           OVER WHITE

           Only that’s not quite true. The camera pulls out slowly, 
           revealing the white we’re seeing is part of a letter.

           B.

           The camera pulls out further, revealing other letters and 
           numbers lined up on-

           BLACK CARD STOCK. Eight digits, all in a row, with similar 
           eight-digit lines above and below. On the top of that card 
           sits the PRESIDENTIAL SEAL, as well as “1198 - AUTHORIZED 
           PERSONNEL ONLY.”

           The camera pulls out more, passing through BLACK PLASTIC, 
           which morphs into the navy blue of-

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           A SUIT JACKET, being worn by a tall, grey haired MAN. We see 
           him from behind as he walks down a brightly lit school 
           hallway, brimming with confidence. Various AIDES in similar 
           navy suits surround him, each trying to get his attention.

                                 AIDE #1
                        We’re trailing with inner city 
                        Latinos, so we’re trying to find 
                        one for you to hug on camera.

                                 AIDE #2
                        I found you a smaller lapel pin, so 
                        hopefully this one doesn’t catch on 
                        anyone’s blouse.

                        Your 2 PM call with Yeltsin got 
                        moved to Wednesday.

           The man GRUNTS in approval. TIM NOVAK (30), wearing glasses 
           and a somehow even navy-ier suit, cuts through the scrum.

                                 NOVAK
                        We’ll be reading “The Very Hungry 
                        Caterpillar” today.

           The man HAPPILY GRUNTS. In a relaxed southern drawl-

                                 MAN
                        I love that book. That caterpillar 
                        sure can eat. Speaking of-
                                 NOVAK
                        Already taken care of, sir. 
                        Motorcade’s driving us straight to 
                        McDonalds after.

                                 MAN
                        All right!

           The man reaches the door, putting his hand on the knob. 
           Before he can turn it-

                                 NOVAK
                        Mr. President?

                                 MAN
                        Yeah, Tim?

                                 NOVAK
                        You’re gonna be great, sir.

           The man opens the door, revealing-

           INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           A large group of STUDENTS and TEACHERS cheer as REPORTERS 
           shout questions. A banner reading “BRUCE-MONROE ELEMENTARY 
           WELCOMES PRESIDENT CLINTON” is strewn across the wall.

           PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON gives the room a wave.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        How we doing, everyone?

           The cheering gets somehow louder. These kids are losing their 
           goddamn minds. A brunette woman, AMANDA DULLES (27) clad in a 
           CLINTON/GORE ‘96 T-shirt, jumps up and down in excitement.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my god! He’s here! The 
                        President’s really here!

           She rushes forward, taking the President’s hand. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Mr. President! President Clinton! 
                        Bill! Can I call you Bill? Oh my 
                        god, I can’t believe you’re in my 
                        classroom!

           President Clinton shakes her hand as Novak leans into his 
           ear.
                                 NOVAK 
                     (whispering)
                        Amanda Dulles, teacher, campaign 
                        volunteer in ‘92 and ‘96.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        Ms. Dulles, thank you so much for 
                        having me read to your class today.

                                 AMANDA
                        Of course! And it’s Mrs. Dulles, 
                        unfortunately. Wait, not that. I 
                        love my husband! We have a great 
                        family! I mean, it’s just the two 
                        of us, but we’re trying-

           Clinton pats her on the shoulder, giving her a kind smile.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        There is nothing more important 
                        than family, Amanda.

                                 AMANDA
                        Uh, yes sir, Mr. President.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        Please. Call me Bill.

           She swoons as Clinton departs, crossing the room. Reporters 
           shout questions at him.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        President Clinton, is it true 
                        you’re settling Paula Jones’ civil 
                        suit?

                                 REPORTER #2 
                        Will you testify if called on by 
                        the Independent Counsel in the 
                        Whitewater case? 

                                 REPORTER #3
                        What’s your reaction to Seinfeld 
                        ending? Can the world survive 
                        without Kramer?

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        I don’t know about all that. What I 
                        do know is that I want to tell 
                        these children a very special story 
                        about a very hungry Caterpillar.

           The children go frickin’ BALLISTIC. 
                                 KINDERGARTNERS 
                        Caterpillar!/Yay President!/Tall 
                        man is tall!

           INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MINUTES LATER

           The kindergartners are seated around Clinton in a semi-
           circle, listening in rapt attention. Amanda’s watches from 
           the back of the room, giant smile on her face.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                     (reading)
                        ...Then he nibbled a hole in the 
                        cocoon, pushed his way out...

                                 AMANDA
                     (sotto)
                        What a man.

           Novak crosses, hand outstretched.

                                 NOVAK
                        Mrs. Dulles? Tim Novak. We spoke on 
                        the phone earlier?

                                 AMANDA
                     (shaking hands)
                        Pleasure to meet you.

                                 NOVAK
                        I just want to thank you for 
                        allowing us into your classroom 
                        today.

                                 AMANDA
                        Are you kidding? The pleasure’s all 
                        mine! It’s not every day my 
                        students get to meet the frickin’ 
                        President!

                                 NOVAK
                        We appreciate your enthusiasm for 
                        education. It’s one of our 
                        administration’s highest 
                        priorities, you know.

           In front of them, Clinton finishes reading the book. He 
           crosses to the bathroom while the room reverts to its 
           primordial, kindergarten-y chaos.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, I don’t know how you do 
                        it.
           A small boy (JOSHUA) runs up and tugs on Amanda’s dress. He 
           crosses his legs - the universal sign for “I have to pee” - 
           and jabs his finger repeatedly towards a wooden door.

                                 AMANDA
                        We use words in our classroom, 
                        Joshua.

                                 JOSHUA
                        I gotta make a pee, Mrs. Dulles, 
                        but the President got there first.

           Amanda tousles his hair.

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, you’re just going to have to 
                        wait for our guest to finish up, 
                        mister.

           Joshua frowns, pouts, and runs off. Novak takes in the scene.

                                 NOVAK
                        Honestly, I don’t know how you do 
                        it.

           A little boy pours Micro Machines into the back of a little 
           girl’s pants. The girls whirls around and SMACKS the boy.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Seems like a hassle.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, I love it. Getting to spend 
                        every day with children is 
                        incredibly rewarding. I’m sure you 
                        feel the same way about working in 
                        the White House.

                                 NOVAK
                        Honestly? Most days, it doesn’t 
                        feel that different.

           The kid with micromachines down her pants does a cartwheel, 
           sending miniature trucks everywhere.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any of your own?

                                 AMANDA
                        No. Not yet. My husband and I are 
                        seeing a specialist, but even if it 
                        goes well, I have no idea how we’re 
                        going to pay for- DANG IT, NATHAN!
           The camera punches in on NATHAN, a chubby boy who’s double-
           fisting Play Doh into his hungry mouth. As DARK MUSIC PLAYS.

                                 SATANIC CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Sanguis Bibimus!

           Amanda darts across the room.

                                 NOVAK
                     (sotto)
                        Huh. Weird kid.

           Amanda puts her hand under Nathan’s mouth.

                                 AMANDA
                        Spit it out, Nathan.

           He looks up at her with black, unblinking eyes, and swallows 
           it.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                     (quiet)
                        Come on.

           FLUSH. The reporters across the room spring to life as the 
           bathroom door opens. Clinton pulls his suit jacket off the 
           hanger, twirling it as he puts it on.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        Thanks a million, kids! You truly 
                        are our future.

           Novak crosses, intercepting the President.

                                 NOVAK 
                     (to Clinton)
                        Great job, sir. You earned your Big 
                        Mac today.

           Clinton smiles broadly, steps out the door, and vanishes into 
           the crowd.

           CAROL (50s) sidles up next to Amanda.

                                 CAROL
                        They don’t call him Slick Willy for 
                        nothing.

                                 AMANDA
                        This is, honest to god, the most 
                        exciting day of my life.

           Joshua approaches the bathroom door.
                                 JOSHUA
                        Finally.

           As he reaches out, he’s shoved out of the way by Nathan, who 
           scurries in and SLAMS the door.

                                 AMANDA
                        Nathan!

                                 NOVAK (V.O.)
                        This presidency is at a crossroads.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING -  DAY

           Handsome shoes slap against run-down carpeting as military 
           attaché LIEUTENANT COLONEL SILVA rounds the corner, briefcase 
           handcuffed to his right wrist.

           CHYRON: Friday, January 16th, 1998

                                 NOVAK (V.O.)
                        The Cold War’s over. We’re 
                        experiencing a record economic 
                        boom. Hell, we almost have a 
                        balanced budget!

           A FEMALE INTERN smiles at Silva, enjoying the view. 

                                 SILVA
                        Ma’am.

           He pushes on, grip tightening on the briefcase.

                                 NOVAK (V.O.)
                        But none of that matters if people 
                        only associate the President with 
                        scandal.

           Silva rounds the corner, approaching the Oval office.

                                 NOVAK (V.O.)
                        White Water. Paula Jones. Ginnifer 
                        Flowers. Travel Gate. File Gate. 
                        Whatever that nonsense was on the 
                        tarmac of LAX. This presidency is 
                        one scandal away from completely 
                        imploding.

           Novak is lecturing bored-looking assistant speech-writer 
           CASSIE KENT (20s).
                                 NOVAK
                        And we owe it to this country to 
                        keep it  from going completely off 
                        the rails.

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s the State Of The Union speech, 
                        Novak.

                                 NOVAK
                        Exactly. So it should lay out the 
                        exact talking points-

                                 CASSIE
                        How about this? You hand this draft 
                        to our boss, the President, and 
                        then I’ll take his notes on it.

           JAMES BRADSHAW (40s), the previously unsmiling Secret Service 
           agent standing behind Novak, lets out a chuckle.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Bradshaw.

           Novak snatches a piece of paper from Cassie’s hands, glaring 
           at the agent.

                                 NOVAK
                        We’re in an election year, people. 
                        Mid-terms are ten short months 
                        away. And this speech represents 
                        POTUS’ commitment to putting 
                        Democrats back in charge of things. 
                        Like it should be.

                                 CASSIE
                     (rolling her eyes)
                        Just get Clinton’s notes on it and 
                        fax it back to me, Uncle Sam.

           She departs, passing the arriving Silva.

                                 SILVA
                        Afternoon gentlemen.

                   BRADSHAW
                                          NOVAK
           Silva.
                                  Hey Silva.

                                 SILVA
                        Got the new Gold Codes from DOD. 
                        POTUS ready to swap out his 
                        Biscuit?

           Silva pats his briefcase.
                                 NOVAK
                        Yeah, give them here. I was just 
                        about to head in.

           Silva produces a KEY and unlocks the handcuffs, handing the 
           briefcase to Novak. Novak turns, knocking on the door.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Sir? I have the SOTU draft for you 
                        to look at. And DOE sent over the 
                        new nuclear launch codes.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON (O.S.)
                     (muffled)
                        Come in!

           Novak opens the door, revealing President Clinton behind the 
           resolute desk, Big Mac in hand. Novak shuts the door behind 
           them, leaving Silva with Bradshaw.

                                 SILVA
                        Hey, what’s the name of that cute 
                        intern in Bowles’ office? She 
                        totally eye-banged me on the way in 
                        here.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        You gotta be more specific, man. 
                        This place feels like the Playboy 
                        mansion if the bunnies all had 
                        masters’ degrees from Johns 
                        Hopkins.

           From behind the closed door, we hear-

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                     (muffled)
                        Ah, shit!

           Bradshaw and Silva share a look. Heavy steps approach the 
           door as a sweaty Novak exits, closing the door quickly behind 
           him.

                                 SILVA
                        Well?

                                 NOVAK
                        The president has the old nuclear 
                        codes on-hand but is in an 
                        important meeting and is unable to 
                        provide them at this time.
                                 SILVA
                        Really? Because it looks to me like 
                        he’s stuffing his cheeks with grade-
                        D beef.

                                 NOVAK
                        The President said he’ll have them 
                        tomorrow.

                                 SILVA
                        You can’t be serious. 

                                 NOVAK
                        We’re taking care of it. We’ll be 
                        in touch.

           Silva glares at Novak, shakes his head, and departs.

                                 SILVA
                     (sotto)
                        This place is coming apart at the 
                        seams...

           Once he’s out of earshot-

                                 BRADSHAW
                        What the hell happened in there?

                                 NOVAK
                        There was a slight... whoopsie.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        What do you mean? 

                                 NOVAK
                        It’s not a big deal. Really.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Be straight with me, Novak. What’s 
                        going on?

                                 NOVAK
                     (gulping)
                        The president lost the Biscuit.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Amanda, purse across her body, stands on a plastic chair, 
           taking down the banner.

                                 AMANDA
                     (concentrating)
                        Almost...
                                 JOSHUA (O.S.)
                        No fair! I want a turn!

           Amanda turns towards the shouting. Joshua and Micro Machine 
           Girl are pawing at Nathan, who stares them down.

                                 JOSHUA (CONT’D)
                        Give it!

           Amanda hops off the chair, crossing towards the kids.

                                 AMANDA
                        Hey now, everyone. We’re inside, so 
                        we use our-

                   JOSHUA
                                      MICRO MACHINE GIRL
           Indoor voices.
                                  Window choices.

                                 AMANDA
                        What’s the problem here?

                                 JOSHUA
                        Nathan found Mister President’s toy 
                        in the bathroom and I want to play 
                        with it but he ate it and then told 
                        me I was adopted. What’s adopted?

                                 AMANDA
                        Nathan, is this true?

           The camera punches in on Nathan’s face. As DARK MUSIC PLAYS.

                                 SATANIC CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Sanguis Bibimus!

           He smiles, revealing a black plastic case in his mouth. 
           Amanda holds out her hand.

                                 AMANDA
                        We’ve talked about this, mister. No 
                        telling the other kids they’re 
                        adopted. And no more eating things 
                        that aren’t food.

           Nathan GULPS, trying his hardest to swallow a plastic 
           rectangle to spite his teacher. It doesn’t work. Eventually-

           PLUH.

           Nathan spits it out into Amanda’s hand. Joshua tries to grab 
           it, but Amanda raises it up to her face.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        What is this thing?
           She inspects the plastic case. There’s a crack in the side, 
           exposing what looks like-

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Is that an eagle?

           Her eyes shift focus from the case to the banner on the wall 
           in front of her. There’s an identical eagle. On the 
           Presidential Seal.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        What in the world-

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        Surprise!

           Amanda WHIPS around, facing a wall of BRIGHT COLORS.

                                 AMANDA
                     (screaming)
                        Aaaah!

           She PUNCHES forward, fist easily traveling through the 
           bouquet of flowers. WHAM. Fist connects with nose.

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        Son of a-

                                 AMANDA
                        Todd! Oh my God, I’m so sorry!

           Reveal TODD DULLES (28), crammed into a cheap suit half a 
           size too small for his body. Blood trickles down from his 
           nose into his neatly trimmed mustache.

                                 TODD
                     (weakly)
                        Hi, sweetie.

           He hands her the shattered bouquet. Amanda hugs him, giving 
           him a kiss on the cheek.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Careful there. Awful lot of blood 
                        coming out of my nose.

                                 AMANDA
                        One sec. 

           Amanda opens her purse, absentmindedly dropping the plastic 
           case inside as she searches for a tissue. 
                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                     (re: flowers)
                        How did I manage to find the 
                        sweetest guy in the universe to be 
                        my husband?

           He gives her a gentle smile. All is forgiven. 

                                 TODD
                        Did you get to meet the president?

           Amanda can barely contain her excitement.

                                 AMANDA
                        It was amazing! He shook my hand 
                        and told me to call him Bill and 
                        read to the kids and oh my God it 
                        was amazing!

           Carol looks over at the commotion.

                                 CAROL
                        Todd? Jesus, what happened to your 
                        face?

                                 TODD
                        Just a little friendly fire.

                                 AMANDA
                        Carol, thank you so much for 
                        covering for me this afternoon. It 
                        means the world to us.

                                 CAROL
                        Oh don’t mention it. You’re 
                        starting a family! That’s well 
                        worth missing an afternoon of 
                        watching these little... 
                        “miracles.”

           Micro Machine Girl uses finger paint to scrawl the word 
           “PINUS” on Joshua’s forehead.

                                 AMANDA
                        We’ll be back before school lets 
                        out. I promise.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Mrs. Dulles? What’s “Pinus?”

                                              PRE-LAP:
                                 BRADSHAW (O.S.)
                        It’s a God damned disaster is what 
                        it is!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

           Bradshaw paces the empty room, eyes bulging.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        I mean, how could he lose the 
                        Biscuit? They’re the nuclear codes, 
                        not the Iowa caucuses. How is POTUS 
                        simultaneously a Rhodes scholar AND 
                        the biggest dumb-ass in the White 
                        House?

                                 NOVAK
                        Careful. That’s our commander-in-
                        chief you’re talking about

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (ignoring him)
                        I’ve been in this building, 
                        protecting the world’s most 
                        powerful men for twenty years! And 
                        this is the thanks my government 
                        gives me four months before 
                        retirement?

                                 NOVAK
                        You’re telling me Bush never 
                        misplaced anything?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Oh, he did. Pens, hard candies, 
                        that bag of crack he had seized 
                        from in front of the White House. 
                        But not THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF 
                        CARDBOARD IN HUMAN HISTORY!

                                 NOVAK
                        Relax. It’s not the end of the 
                        world.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        It LITERALLY might be.

                                 NOVAK
                        Silva gave us updated codes. Even 
                        if someone were to find them, the 
                        missing Biscuit is outdated. The 
                        only thing getting nuked would be 
                        Clinton’s reputation.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        Who gives a shit about his 
                        reputation?

                                 NOVAK
                        I do, for one. And so should you. 
                        If it gets out that the Biscuit is 
                        missing, the leader of the free 
                        world gets the political scandal of 
                        a lifetime. We’re talking hearings. 
                        Congressional humiliation. 
                        Impeachment.  

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Rush Limbaugh will cream his 
                        Dockers in excitement. Jesus, I 
                        thought we were finished dodging 
                        bullets when Newsweek killed that 
                        intern story.

                                 NOVAK
                        So we make sure this doesn’t become 
                        a scandal.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        How? You said it yourself. One more 
                        scandal, and this administration is 
                        done.

                                 NOVAK
                        We find the Biscuit.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Be serious.

                                 NOVAK
                        I am.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        It could be literally anywhere in 
                        the country. Or on Air Force One. 
                        He was in Bosnia three weeks ago. 
                        Maybe it’s there?

                                 NOVAK
                        It’s not in Bosnia. I placed it in 
                        his suit jacket last night when his 
                        dry cleaning came in. Which means 
                        they disappeared in the past 24 
                        hours.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        Great. So you just need to look 
                        everywhere he’s been today. Count 
                        me out.

                                 NOVAK
                        You’re a secret service agent. 
                        Isn’t it your job to protect the 
                        president at all costs?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Yeah, but from assassins and 
                        terrorists, not his own lack of 
                        object permanence.

                                 NOVAK
                        So let’s protect him. We’ll start 
                        in the White House. Odds are, the 
                        Biscuit is still in the building. 
                        Come on, Bradshaw. We owe the 
                        country that much.

           Bradshaw rubs him temples.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Fine. Let’s save this presidency 
                        from itself.

           INT. FERTILITY CLINIC - DAY

           Amanda and Todd sit in sterile wooden chairs facing a smiling 
           DOCTOR GUTIERREZ.

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Mr. Dulles, it says here you served 
                        in Desert Storm?

                                 TODD
                        Yes sir. With the 5th special 
                        forces group.

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Oh, wow. Did you see combat?

                                 TODD
                        Negative, sir. I was a tactical 
                        subsistence specialist.

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        A what?

                                 AMANDA
                        A cook.
                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Oh. When I heard Special Forces...

                                 TODD
                        I was over there providing the 
                        required nutrition that kept our 
                        boys in the fight. It was one of 
                        the greatest honors of my life.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m so proud of my little army man.

           The doctor looks puzzled.

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Hmm. So you never spent any time on 
                        the front lines?

                                 TODD
                        No sir.

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Any exposure to radiation?

                                 TODD
                        Not that I know of.

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Let me rephrase that. Were you 
                        exposed to any depleted uranium 
                        shells?

           A light-bulb goes off in Todd’s head.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, that? Of course. 

                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY - MONTAGE

           As “Good Vibrations” by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch 
           plays...

           CHYRON: IRAQ, 1991

           -Todd, 7 years younger and decked out in a military chef’s 
           outfit, takes a nap on top of a crate labeled “DEPLETED 
           URANIUM SABOT 25MM.

           -Todd wipes his brow under the blistering sun, taking a sip  
           of water from an EMPTY TANK SHELL.
           -A naked Todd, now wearing an empty shell as a jock strap, 
           dances in front of a burning oil well. His fellow soldiers 
           cheer him on.

                                           SMASH CUT TO:

                                 TODD
                        They had piles of ‘em laying around 
                        everywhere. We used ‘em for 
                        everything. Water bottles, 
                        hammocks, girlfriends...

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        That explains it.

                                 TODD
                        Excuse me?

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        I’m sorry to say it, Mr. Dulles, 
                        but due to the prolonged presence 
                        of radioactive material so close to 
                        your reproductive glands, you’ve 
                        been rendered nearly sterile.

           The doctor pauses for a moment, letting this wash over Todd 
           and Amanda.

                                 TODD
                     (quiet)
                        Sterile?

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Nearly sterile. The amount of 
                        radiation you’ve been exposed to 
                        has retarded the motility of your 
                        reproductive material.

                                 TODD
                        My sperm’s retarded?

                                 AMANDA
                        What does that mean, doctor?

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        It means that having a child the 
                        traditional way isn’t a viable 
                        option. However, there are 
                        alternatives. I would suggest In 
                        Vitro Fertilization. 

                                 TODD
                        What’s that?
                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        I believe the common term is a 
                        “test tube baby.”

                                 TODD
                        But what happens when the baby gets 
                        too big for the test tube? Does it 
                        break?

                                 AMANDA
                     (ignoring Todd)
                        So...I’d be able to have a baby?

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        Yes. But I must warn you, it’s not 
                        cheap. You’re looking at fifty 
                        thousand dollars. And that’s just 
                        to start.

           Amanda’s eyes well up with tears.

                                 AMANDA
                        But it’s not fair! My sister didn’t 
                        want kids, and she can’t stop 
                        having them! But I can’t even 
                        afford one?

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ
                        I don’t- I’m sorry.

                                 AMANDA
                        She didn’t even come up with a new 
                        name for her sixth kid. She just 
                        called him Tyler II!

           Todd takes Amanda’s hand.

                                 TODD
                        I promise you, we’ll find a way to 
                        have a Tyler II of our very own. 
                        I’m not quite sure how, but we’ll 
                        find a way.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - DAY

           Bradshaw stands outside the door of the oval office. CLICK. 
           The door opens a smidge, Novak scurrying out.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Took you long enough.

                                 NOVAK
                        Relax. I got it all taken care of.
           Novak holds up a PIECE OF PAPER as they begin walking.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        America’s salvation in the palm of 
                        my- Hey!

           Bradshaw snatches it out of Novak’s hands, reading. He looks 
           up, confused.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Wait, this is the state of the 
                        union address.

                                 NOVAK
                        Exactly. I’m pretty sure there’s 
                        still going to be a government in 
                        four days, Bradshaw. Got to make 
                        sure Clinton signs off on it.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        But what about...

           Novak taps his breast pocket.

                                 NOVAK
                     (whispering)
                        You think I’d be stupid enough to 
                        walk around with signed, classified 
                        presidential memo outlining the 
                        loss of America’s nuclear deterrent 
                        in my hand?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Yes.

                                 NOVAK
                        Dick.

           The round a corner, entering-

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NOVAK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Novak crosses to his desk, Bradshaw closing the door.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Can I see it?

           Novak opens his blazer, pulling out a firm, white DOCUMENT.

                                 NOVAK
                        Keep it clean. Need to fax it over 
                        to the AG to cover our asses.
           Bradshaw unfolds it.

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (reading)
                        “From: William Jefferson Clinton. 
                        Subject: Timothy Novak and...”

           Bradshaw pauses.

                                 NOVAK
                        What?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Holy shit, do you not know my first 
                        name?

                                 NOVAK
                        What? No. Of course I do... Jamal?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        James.

                                 NOVAK
                        Close enough.

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (crossing out the name)
                        “...Agent JAMES Bradshaw are 
                        granted full authority to 
                        investigate the location of the 
                        nuclear launch Gold Codes. Thank 
                        you for your cooperation and 
                        compliance with this memorandum.”
                     (to Novak)
                        What good does this do us?

                                 NOVAK
                        This legally allows us to drop 
                        everything we’re doing in order to 
                        concentrate figuring this whole 
                        thing out. Also, when we DO find 
                        the Biscuit, this will remind POTUS 
                        just how above and beyond we went.

           He crosses to the fax machine.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see... 202-555-4465.

           Novak punches send, sighing in relief.

                                 BRADSHAW
                                 NOVAK
                        I’m sorry?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        The AG’s fax number. It’s 4469. I 
                        know that, because POTUS laughs 
                        like a horny teenager whenever 
                        faxes something to Janet Reno.

                                 NOVAK
                        Oh. Uh...

                                 BRADSHAW
                        What?

           Realization spreads across Bradshaw’s face.

                                 BRADSHAW (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no. No no no!

           Bradshaw leaps across the room, grabbing for the paper in the 
           fax machine. It’s no use - the fax machine is surprisingly 
           strong, yanking the paper out of Bradshaw’s hands and into 
           the ether.

                                 NOVAK
                        I could have sworn it was 65...

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Who did you send it to?

           Novak scans an address sheet next to the printer.

                                 NOVAK
                        Shit.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - STREET - DAY

           Novak and Bradshaw sprint out of the security gate, shoving 
           low-level flunkies out of the way.

                                 NOVAK
                        National security emergency! Let us 
                        through!

                                 BRADSHAW
                        I can’t believe you sent it to the 
                        God damn speech writers!

                                 NOVAK
                        Hey, at least it’s just across the 
                        street. It’s not like I sent it to-
           WHAM. Novak collides with the roof of a sedan, toppling 
           forward.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Novak?

                                 NOVAK
                     (popping up)
                        I’m good! Get across the-

           WHAM. Novak’s arm is smacked by a passing pickup’s mirror.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch!

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Look where you’re going, numb nuts!

                                 NOVAK
                        Yeah, fu-

           RING RING. SMACK. A bike messenger slams into Novak, sending 
           him sprawling.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Damn it!

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (yelling after the rider)
                        It’s too cold for bikes!

           Bradshaw grabs Novak, hustling him to the opposite sidewalk 
           and into-

           INT. THE OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           They enter a palatial building, stuffed to the brim with busy 
           staffers.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        This way.

           He rushes to the elevator bay, scanning the directory.

                                 BRADSHAW (CONT’D)
                        Gore... Shalala... There, Waldman, 
                        Suite 113.

           They sprint down the hall, reaching-

                                 NOVAK
                        Bingo.
           INT. THE OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING - ROOM 113 - DAY

           The door blasts open, Novak and Bradshaw pushing past each 
           other to get inside. Novak scans the room.

                                 NOVAK
                        Back left corner.

           A fax machine beeps, paper laying face-down in the tray. 
           Bradshaw crosses, picking it up. He lets out a huge SIGH of 
           relief.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Got it. 

           Novak CHEERS, hugging Bradshaw.

                                 NOVAK
                        You beautiful son of a bitch!

                                 CASSIE (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, what are the two of you 
                        doing in my office?

           They turn to find Cassie, holding a stack of papers and 
           looking peeved.

                                 NOVAK
                        Oh, uh, just wanted to run POTUS’ 
                        State of the Union notes over to 
                        you.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        You told him you wanted Clinton’s 
                        notes, remember?

                                 CASSIE
                        Sure...

           Novak reaches in his back pocket, handing cassie a folded 
           piece of paper. 

                                 NOVAK
                        We’ll just be on our way, then.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh, could you bring something over 
                        there for me?

                                 NOVAK
                        Sure, what?

           Cassie holds up-
           OH SHIT IT’S THE MEMO.

                                 CASSIE
                        Pretty sure the AG’s gonna want to 
                        take a look at this.

                                 NOVAK
                        How did-

                                 CASSIE
                        I made a copy the second I saw what 
                        it was. You two dummies screwed up. 
                        Real bad.

           Bradshaw calmly walks to the hallway door, closing it.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Ok. Let’s talk.

                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah. Let’s. Did POTUS really lose 
                        the frickin’ nuclear codes?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Yes ma’am.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh my God. Are we going to die? Is 
                        America going to blow up? I mean, I 
                        wouldn’t mind never having to pay 
                        back my student loans, but that 
                        seems like the only silver lining.

                                 NOVAK
                        Relax. No, the nukes are safe. The 
                        only thing at stake is the 
                        reputation of a man who all our 
                        careers are tied to.

                                 CASSIE
                        Huh. Good. I guess. But that means 
                        that Clinton’s Biscuit is just 
                        floating around somewhere?

                                 NOVAK
                        More or less.

                                 CASSIE
                        Great. 
                     (beat)
                        I want in.

                                 NOVAK
                        I’m sorry?
                                 CASSIE
                        I want to help you find it.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        No way. The search party’s already 
                        crowded as-is.

                                 CASSIE
                        Screw that. Take me with you.

                                 NOVAK
                        Why would you want any part of 
                        this?

                                 CASSIE
                        Because, when I find it, I’m going 
                        to make sure I get an office in the 
                        West Wing. Do you know how 
                        humiliating it is having to come to 
                        work in the OEOB every day, only to 
                        see you two dullards strolling into 
                        the White House like you own the 
                        place?

                                 NOVAK
                        You want a better office?

                                 CASSIE
                        No. I want a better career. And 
                        I’ll get that by finding out where 
                        The Man From Hope put the 
                        cornerstone to our country’s 
                        nuclear deterrent.

           Novak and Bradshaw share a look.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Should we-

                                 NOVAK
                        We don’t have a choice.

           They turn to her, Bradshaw sticking out his hand.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Welcome aboard, Ms. Kent.

           She looks down at her copy of the memo, takes out a pen, and 
           adds “+ Cassie :)!” to the text in red.
           INT. LONG JOHN’S HOUSE OF PAWN - DAY

           THUD. Todd lowers his TV SET onto the counter of a dimly-lit 
           pawn shop. The OWNER (LONG JONATHAN) gives it a disinterested 
           glance.

                                 TODD
                        That there is a genuine 13 inch 
                        Proscan TV, with a built-in VCR. We 
                        sure would hate to part with it 
                        unless the price were right, Long 
                        John.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        It’s actually Long Jonathan. And 
                        I’ll give you thirty bucks for it.

                                 TODD
                        I paid $200 for this last year. 
                        Can’t you come up a little bit?

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Probably. But I won’t.

                                 TODD
                        Fifty.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Forty five.

           Todd looks to Amanda.

                                 AMANDA
                        That’s forty five dollars closer to 
                        our baby.

           Todd nods. Long Jonathan takes cash out of the register, 
           sliding it across the counter.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Pleasure doing business.

           Todd grimaces as Long Jonathan places the TV under the 
           counter.

                                 AMANDA
                        I might have something else.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Oh really.

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t want to sell it, but...
           She reaches into her purse, pulling out a small, dark purple 
           stuffed bear.

           HOLY SHIT IT’S A PRINCESS DIANA BEANIE BABY.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        How much would you be able to give 
                        us for this?

           The room goes silent. Long Jonathan’s eyes bulge - is that 
           what he thinks it is?

                                 LONG JONATHAN 
                        No shit...

                                 TODD
                        Amanda, no!

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s the only way, Todd.

                                 TODD
                        That’s the most valuable thing we 
                        own! 

           Long Jonathan’s nearly salivating.

                                 LONG JONATHAN 
                        I’ll give you a thousand dollars. 
                        Here-

           He reaches into the register, pulling out a wad of cash.

                                 TODD
                        Amanda, that might be worth a 
                        thousand dollars now, but it could 
                        be worth a hundred times that one 
                        day! We might be able to pay for 
                        our baby’s college with it!

                                 AMANDA
                        That doesn’t matter if we can’t 
                        have a baby in the first place, 
                        sweetie. 

                                 TODD
                        We can’t.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Two grand. Cash. Final offer.

           He reaches his hand out to shake. Amanda looks at Todd - his 
           eyes are pleading “no.”
                                 TODD
                        There’s got to be another way.

           Amanda gulps, resolute.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m doing this for us.

           She hands the Beanie Baby over. Long Jonathan smiles a huge 
           smile.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        A pleasure doing business with-

           He pauses, opening his hand. A few small, plastic PELLETS 
           fall through his fingers onto the glass below, landing with 
           thuds as loud as gunshots.

           He holds up the stuffed bear - there’s a small tear on it’s 
           side.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my God! No!

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        I’m sorry. I can’t buy this, as 
                        it’s not in mint condition.

                                 TODD
                        What happened?

           Amanda looks in her purse. A small amount of white pellets 
           lay at the bottom, next to-

                                 AMANDA
                        -My keys must have caught on her 
                        fabric. Oh my God! Oh my God I 
                        ruined our nest egg! It’s 
                        completely worthless.

                                 LONG JONATHAN 
                        If there’s nothing else I can help 
                        you with, would you please excuse 
                        me? I’m a very busy man.

           Amanda looks around the empty pawn shop, eyes landing on a 
           FOUNTAIN PEN with the presidential seal on it.

                                 AMANDA
                        What’s that?
                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Looking to buy? That’s the pen 
                        Reagan used to stab John Hinkley to 
                        death.

                                 TODD
                        I’m pretty sure John Hinkley’s 
                        still alive.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        What do I look like, the History 
                        channel?

                                 AMANDA
                        So you deal government memorabilia?

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Depends on what you’ve got.

           Amanda opens her purse, pulling out the black plastic 
           rectangle.

                                 AMANDA
                        How much for this?

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           SLAM. Bradshaw shuts a drawer in frustration. The office  has 
           been turned upside-down - papers and fast food wrappers 
           litter the ground. 

                                 BRADSHAW
                        I don’t know why they want me to 
                        take a bullet for this guy. Heart 
                        disease will get him long before an 
                        assassin does.

           Novak sorts through a pile of Hustler magazines, disgust on 
           his face.

                                 NOVAK
                        I thought the Bush era ended six 
                        years ago...

           Cassie crosses to the resolute desk, clocking Novak’s stack 
           of Hustlers.

                                 CASSIE
                        Think POTUS left nuclear secrets in 
                        one of his girly mags?
                     (off the magazine)
                        Jesus, it looks like she has Savion 
                        Glover in a leg lock.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        Cassie, if you’re not going to take 
                        this seriously, then why don’t you 
                        leave this investigation to the 
                        professionals.

                                 CASSIE
                        No need to be a grouch. This is 
                        kind of fun! We’re solving a 
                        national security mystery.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Great. You can add “Official White 
                        House Detective” to your resumé.

                                 CASSIE
                     (bad British accent)
                        It’s elementary, my dear Watson.

           Something CLICKS in Novak’s brain.

                                 NOVAK
                        What was that?

                                 CASSIE
                        Sorry, my Sherlock Holmes 
                        impression ain’t great. I blame 
                        cuts to Arts funding for, 
                        ironically, elementary education.

                                 NOVAK
                        Exactly. Elementary...

           Light bulb.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit! The school!

                                 CASSIE
                        Come again?

                                 NOVAK
                        We were at the school this morning. 
                        Clinton used the bathroom-

                                 CASSIE
                        -Gross-

                                 NOVAK
                        -And took off his suit jacket. Oh 
                        my God, I know where the Biscuit 
                        is!
           INT. LONG JOHN’S HOUSE OF PAWN - DAY

           Long Jonathan peers through a pair of bifocals, using gloved 
           hands to examine the black plastic case.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Strange... You say you found this 
                        at work?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yes sir. One of my students was 
                        using it as a chew toy. Says he 
                        found it after Bill- Sorry, 
                        President Clinton used the rest 
                        room.

           Long Jonathan runs his finger along the edge, concentrating.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Interesting...

           He spots the crack in the case, carefully bending it back to 
           reveal-

           THE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL. And a set of NUMBERS. His eyes bulge.

                                 LONG JONATHAN (CONT’D)
                        No way.

                                 TODD
                        What is it?

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        How familiar are you two with 
                        America’s nuclear launch 
                        authorization process?

           Not very.
                                  America’s what?

                                  LONG JONATHAN
                        Because, and I can’t believe I’m 
                        about to say this, you two stumbled 
                        on something... extraordinary.

           INT. CARTOON WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Goofy, deformed caricatures of a PRESIDENT and his CABINET 
           talk to each other in grave-sounding GIBBERISH. We push in to 
           a GENERAL holding a BLACK SUITCASE attached to his wrist via 
           handcuffs. A MOUTH AND EYES appear on the suitcase, as it 
           begins SINGING.

                                 CARTOON SUITCASE
                        When presidents have to launch all 
                        our nukes/ the chain of command 
                        can’t afford a rebuke/ ‘Cause 
                        America’s enemies, they won’t wait 
                        at all/ and that’s why I’m here, 
                        I’m the nuclear football.

           A CARTOON CHILD wanders into frame, wide-eyed.

                                 CARTOON CHILD
                        Wow! The nuclear football! How do 
                        you work?

                        I’m glad you asked, kid.

           A caricature of a RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER appears next to the 
           suitcase. He screams nonsense Russian as a wall of TANKS roll 
           towards a sign reading “Berlin - 10 km.”

                        his top Airforce guy.

           The Cartoon President pulls a BLACK PLASTIC CARD out of his 
           coat pocket, breaking it open and reading off a coded 
           sequence.

                        Alpha. Zulu. Four. Quebec. Niner.
           A cartoon AIR FORCE GENERAL gives the president a big smile 
           and thumbs up.

                        In order to stop someone with fewer

                        and launching our bombs/ the 
                        President reads numbers from a

                        So the Biscuit proves the 
                        president’s identity in the event 
                        of a nuclear launch, preventing the 
                        accidental end of our world through

                        Biscuit was lost/ we would have to 
                        find it, no matter the cost/ It 
                        would be more than a case of very 
                        bad luck/ Because without the 
                        Biscuit we are pretty much fucked.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL Todd and Amanda watching a VHS tape of 
           their former television. Todd’s mouth is gaping, Amanda’s 
           eyes wide.

                                 TODD
                        I don’t remember this episode of 
                        Schoolhouse Rock from growing up.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Yeah, they got kind of dark in 
                        their later years.

                                 AMANDA
                        So this thing, it’s a “Biscuit?”
                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Looks like it.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my God...

           She looks down at the plastic case in wonder.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        How did... I pulled it out of a 
                        kid’s mouth!

           Amanda nervously scans the store.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        If it really is missing government 
                        property, we should probably return 
                        it. Right?

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        I’d think real long and hard about 
                        that, lady. You’re in possession of 
                        something that could potentially be 
                        worth millions to the right buyer.

           Todd and Amanda’s ears perk up at “millions.”

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t know...

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Also, you really think those jack-
                        booted G men are just going to let 
                        you hand it back to them and then 
                        go about your business?

                    TODD
                                          AMANDA
           Yes?
                                  Probably?

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Didn’t you learn anything from Ruby 
                        Ridge or Waco? Your ass would get 
                        Vince Fostered so fast your head 
                        would spin. And then explode, what 
                        with the bullet in it.

                                 TODD
                        Oh Jeez.

                                 AMANDA
                        I think this is a bad idea. If the 
                        world ended because of me, I’d be 
                        really sad about it.
                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Odds are, the Feds swapped in new 
                        codes the second these went 
                        missing. What you have is proof of 
                        criminal incompetence at the 
                        highest levels of government. And 
                        that kind of blackmail would sell 
                        for a pretty penny. To the right 
                        buyer.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, well in that case...

                                 AMANDA
                        I really don’t know about all this, 
                        Mr. Jonathan. It seems so... 
                        unpatriotic. 

           The pawnbroker pulls out a card, sliding it towards Amanda.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        When you come to your senses, Mrs. 
                        Dulles, I can help point you in the 
                        right direction. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Wait, you don’t want to buy it?

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        Oh, God no. I’m what we call a 
                        “person of interest” in an “active 
                        federal investigation.” You sell 
                        ONE undercover agent a shipping 
                        container full of grenade launchers 
                        and all of a sudden you’re the bad 
                        guy. 

                                 TODD
                        Been there.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        But if YOU want to get rich, I’d be 
                        more than happy to help. Trust me. 
                        You two just found your lottery 
                        ticket.

           Amanda pockets the card, conflicted.

           INT. BUS - DAY

           The Dulleses sit quietly, holding hands and lost in thought. 
           Finally-
                                 TODD
                     (quiet)
                        What are we going to do? It’s not 
                        like we have fifty thousand dollars 
                        lying around.

           Todd glances at his crotch.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Lousy retarded sperm.

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you think Long Jonathan was 
                        telling the truth? A million 
                        dollars, just for a piece of 
                        cardboard? I mean, for a Beanie 
                        Baby, sure, I get that. But a card?

           Amanda glances at her purse.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t feel right having it.

                                 TODD
                        I know.

                                 AMANDA
                        I mean, I’m not a traitor! I love 
                        the President! I vote in every 
                        election. Even the local ones! I 
                        voted for the school board, for 
                        Pete’s sake.

                                 TODD
                        Jephunneh Chavous ran a great 
                        campaign.

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t know to do, sweetie.

           Todd takes his wife’s hand.

                                 TODD
                        I don’t either. But, whatever we 
                        wind up doing, we’ll do it 
                        together.

           She kisses him on the cheek.

                                 BUS DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Georgia and Park.

           Amanda stands, grabbing her purse.
                                 AMANDA
                        I know I married you for a reason.

           She smiles at her husband, departing the bus.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The chaos of earlier is dying down. Kids are tired, grumpy - 
           it’s the end of the day. Carol hands a juice box to Micro 
           Machine Girl as Amanda enters.

                                 AMANDA
                     (to Carol)
                        Thank you so much for covering for 
                        me.

           She crosses to her desk, putting her purse down.

                                 CAROL
                        No problem at all. Although there’s 
                        something really wrong with that 
                        Nathan kid.

           The camera punches in on Nathan, who’s busy taping a severed 
           Barbie’s head to a stuffed bear’s torso.

                                 SATANIC CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Sanguis Bibimus!

           His head snaps up, black eyes trained on Amanda’s purse.

                                 CAROL
                        So how did it go?

                                 AMANDA
                        Not great. There’s no chance of me 
                        conceiving naturally, and the other 
                        options are going to cost more than 
                        Todd and I make in a year.

           A tear rolls down her cheek. Carol hugs her.

                                 CAROL
                        I know it might seem insurmountable 
                        right now, but I’m sure you two 
                        will find a way. I genuinely can’t 
                        think of someone more suited to 
                        being a mother.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, stop.
                                 CAROL
                        I’m serious! You’re kind, patient, 
                        are a heck of a finger painter...

                                 AMANDA
                     (wiping away tear)
                        I guess.

                                 CAROL
                        And, more importantly, you’ll do 
                        whatever it takes. That’s 
                        motherhood 101.

           Amanda watches the children playing in front of her. They’re 
           smiling, happy, almost angelic. Feeling a TUG on her skirt, 
           she looks down and finds Nathan, “PINUS” still scrawled on 
           his forehead.

                                 JOSHUA
                        Mrs. Dulles? I made you a card.

           He holds up a piece of paper to her. It’s a crude drawing of 
           Amanda surrounded by kids. A cartoon Nathan is in the back, 
           scowling. The tears come back to Amanda. Hard.

                                 AMANDA
                        Well isn’t this just the sweetest 
                        thing, Joshua. Thank you.

           Amanda looks down at him. Damn it, she DOES want one of these 
           for her very own.

           RIIIIIING.

           The school bell goes off, kids grabbing their tiny backpacks 
           as they head for the door. Amanda dabs her eyes, game face 
           on. She looks down to-

           NATHAN’S RIGHT BESIDE HER.

                                 SATANIC CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Sanguis Bibimus!

                                 AMANDA
                        Nathan! Go home!

           Nathan scampers away, hands in his pockets, smiling. Amanda 
           straightens her blouse and heads for the door. She’s looking 
           down at Joshua’s card, exiting obliviously as NOVAK, BRADSHAW 
           AND CASSIE ENTER THE ROOM.

                                 CAROL
                        Uh, can I help you?
                                 NOVAK
                     (ignoring her)
                        There! Bathroom!

           They cross to the bathroom, Novak trying the handle. It’s 
           locked.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Secret Service!

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (quiet)
                        Technically, I’m the only one 
                        allowed to say-

                                 NOVAK
                        Open the God damn door!

           CREAK. The door opens, revealing a terrified CHUBBY KID 
           eating a Milky Way bar.

                                 CHUBBY KID
                        Please don’t arrest me Mr. Police 
                        Man!

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Jeez, Novak. You scared the poor 
                        kid.

           Novak doesn’t listen, scanning the bathroom floor.

                                 NOVAK
                        Damn it. Nothing.

                                 CAROL (O.S.)
                        Excuse me!

           Novak wheels around, finding a furious Carol.

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you people doing 
                        in my classroom?

           Her eyes narrow.

                                 CAROL (CONT’D)
                        Weren’t you here earlier?

                                 NOVAK
                        Yeah, I was. Timothy Novak, from 
                        the White House.

           He reaches his hand out. Carol pointedly doesn’t take it.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        Ma’am, the president might have 
                        dropped a personal item in the rest 
                        room. It’d be about three inches by 
                        five, black plastic. It’s, uh...

                                 CASSIE
                        His pager. The president lost his 
                        pager.

                                 CAROL
                        The president has a pager? Wow. 
                        Welcome to 1998, I guess. Wish I 
                        had one of those.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        As you can imagine, it’s very 
                        important that we find it as 
                        quickly as possible.

                                 CAROL
                        Haven’t seen anything like it. 
                        Sorry.

                                 NOVAK
                     (thinking)
                        Wasn’t there another teacher here 
                        today? I remember her yelling at 
                        that weird kid.

                                 CAROL
                        Oh, Amanda!

                                 NOVAK
                     (eyes lighting up)
                        Yes! Mrs. Dulles. Would we be able 
                        to ask her a few questions?

                                 CAROL
                        I’m afraid you just missed her.

                                 NOVAK
                        Could you kindly give us her 
                        address?

                                 CAROL
                        Of course.

           Carol grabs a piece of construction paper and a marker, 
           writing it down. Behind her, the Chubby Kid, tears still in 
           his eyes, opens another Milky Way.
           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           CLICK. Amanda’s finger hits “play” on a flashing answering 
           machine. 

                                 DOCTOR GUTIERREZ (O.S.)
                        Hey Mr. And Mrs. Dulles, it’s 
                        Doctor G. We ran some further tests 
                        on your sample, and it looks like 
                        the IVF is our best bet. Please 
                        give me a call back and we can 
                        discuss payment options.

           BEEP. The message ends. The Dulleses look shell-shocked.

                                 AMANDA
                        Come on...

                                 TODD
                        Who has that kind of money to spend 
                        on a kid?

                                 AMANDA
                        What about the VA? Have you heard 
                        anything back about them being able 
                        to help us?

                                 TODD
                        I asked, but they told me that 
                        radiation exposure “don’t count.”

           He hangs his head. Amanda takes his hand.

                                 AMANDA
                        What are we going to do?

                                 TODD
                        Maybe... Maybe we take Long 
                        Jonathan up on his offer.

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t know, sweetie.

                                 TODD
                        I wish we had other options, 
                        Amanda, but I don’t see another way 
                        for us to get that much money.

                                 AMANDA
                     (gulping)
                        It just doesn’t feel right doing 
                        that to the President.
                                 TODD
                        It’s all going to be OK. It’s not 
                        like the government has CIA super 
                        agents out hunting for it right 
                        now.

           KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        The Government! They know!

                                 AMANDA
                        Relax. I ordered some Spice Girls 
                        tapes from Columbia House. It’s 
                        probably the delivery guy.

           Amanda crosses to the door, opening it to reveal-

           Novak, Bradshaw and Cassie.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Amanda Dulles?

                                 AMANDA
                        At your service.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        I’m Agent Bradshaw from the United 
                        States Secret Service. 

           She completely freezes.

                                 BRADSHAW (CONT’D)
                        You know, the government?

           She stays completely still.

                                 BRADSHAW (CONT’D)
                        Where your taxes go. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh. Yeah. You guys.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Would you mind if we ask you a few 
                        questions?

           Amanda turns to Todd, pale as a ghost.

                                 AMANDA
                     (clipped)
                        Todd, we have guests. From the 
                        Secret Service.
           She stares at her purse, then back at Todd.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                     (clipped)
                        Maybe we should clean up. Before 
                        our guests come in.

           Todd stares at her blankly.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                     (mouthing)
                        Purse.

           Todd nods in agreement, then picks up her purse, holding it 
           out in front of him like a newborn lion king. 

                                 NOVAK
                     (stepping forward)
                        Amanda? Tim Novak. We met earlier.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, yeah. Nice to see you again. 

                                 NOVAK
                        If you wouldn’t mind, we just need 
                        to ask you a couple of quick 
                        questions. That OK?

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Todd sits on a dilapidated arm chair across from the Feds. 
           Amanda hands Cassie a mug of tea.

                                 TODD
                        What can we do for you?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Well, we’re in the process of an 
                        investigation-

                                 NOVAK
                        It’s very preliminary. Just a 
                        routine thing.

           Bradshaw shoots him a look that says “Stay out of my way.”

                                 BRADSHAW
                        How long have you been a teacher?

                                 AMANDA
                        Five years, now. I finished school 
                        right around the time Todd was 
                        discharged after Desert Storm.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        You served?

                                 TODD
                        Yes sir. 5th special forces. Did 
                        you?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        No, I was too busy protecting Bush 
                        from a second term.

                                 TODD
                     (at ease)
                        How about you two?

                   CASSIE 
                                          NOVAK
           I was in middle school.
                                  Don’t ask.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Mrs. Dulles, we’re afraid that the 
                        President has misplaced his pager. 
                        It’s three by five inches, black 
                        plastic. You didn’t happen to find 
                        anything like that in your 
                        classroom after the President left, 
                        did you?

                                 AMANDA
                     (nervous)
                        No. Of course not.

                                 NOVAK
                        Maybe one of the children found it?

                                 AMANDA
                     (nervous)
                        Could be, but I doubt it. We keep a 
                        close eye on our kids. Are you sure 
                        the President lost it this morning? 
                        Maybe he left it in the White 
                        House.

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (sotto)
                        I wish.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.

                                 CASSIE
                     (clocking Amanda’s purse)
                        Oh my God, I LOVE your bag.
                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, that old thing? Found it at 
                        factory store. Technically, it’s a 
                        “Kate Spad.”

                                 CASSIE
                        Do you mind if I take a look?

           Amanda’s sweating, glancing at Todd.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not sure if-

           Too late. Cassie has her hands on it.

                                 CASSIE
                        This is amazing! You can barely 
                        tell it’s missing the “E.”

                                 AMANDA
                        If that’s all, my husband and I are 
                        very busy and we-

           Cassie peeks inside the purse.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh my God!

           Amanda and Todd FREEZE, eyes locked on each other. They’re 
           boned.

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s not what it looks like.

                                 CASSIE
                        Really?

           She pulls the PRINCESS DI BEANIE BABY out of the purse.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Because it look like the Princess 
                        Di Beanie Baby! How did you get one 
                        of these?

           Amanda smiles, relieved but confused.

                                 AMANDA
                        Todd got it for me as a Christmas 
                        gift.

                                 TODD
                        There’s only three per store. It’s 
                        a collector’s item!
                                 CASSIE
                        That’s so cool! I have a Lefty the 
                        donkey signed by Joe Biden, but I 
                        would KILL for a Princess Di bear.

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah. We’re selling it. We’re 
                        trying to start a family, and, 
                        well, you know how expensive that 
                        can be.

                                 CASSIE
                        I get it.

                                 AMANDA
                        Honestly, I wish I could help you, 
                        but I didn’t see anything at 
                        school. I promise you, if I find 
                        the president’s pager, you’ll be 
                        the first to know about it.

           Novak frowns. Bradshaw sticks out his hand.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Well, thank you for your honestly 
                        Mrs. Dulles. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Of course! 

           The Feds dislodge themselves from the couch, headed for the 
           door.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Take care, folks.

           They exit, Todd locking the door after them.

                                 TODD
                        Now the president’s pager is 
                        missing? Can they keep track of 
                        anything at the White House?

                                 AMANDA
                        I think that was a cover, sweetie.

                                 TODD
                        Oh. Well, then we just lied to the 
                        Secret Service! That’s got to be a 
                        crime!

                                 AMANDA
                     (looking in her purse)
                        Not exactly.
                                 TODD
                        What do you mean?

           She flips her purse over, emptying it. There’s no black case.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        What the...

           Todd scrambles over, going through the pile.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Where the heck is it?

                                 AMANDA
                        They were in my purse when we left 
                        the pawn shop, and I haven’t opened 
                        it since...

           It dawns on her.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Nathan!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - DAY

           A line of STAFFERS is queued up outside a white door. They 
           all look impatient, agitated, and the slightest bit guilty.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

           Novak, Bradshaw and Cassie sit at one side of a large oak 
           table, facing forward.

                                 NOVAK
                        Thank you so much for coming in 
                        today. We just have a few questions 
                        to ask you, if you don’t mind.

           We see the opposite - a nervous looking TALL MALE STAFFER 
           sits across from them, uncomfortable.

                                 TALL MALE STAFFER
                        Yeah. Go ahead.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        We’re not pointing any fingers, but-

           MONTAGE
                                 TALL MALE STAFFER
                        -How was I supposed to know she was 
                        illegal? Granted, she didn’t speak 
                        a word of English, and she-

                                 FEMALE STAFFER IN GLASSES
                        -Had these suitcases full of cash. 
                        All from Indian gambling! But it 
                        wasn’t technically illegal-

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s not what-

                                 MALE STAFFER IN HAT
                        -Because they were just handing out 
                        free Shrimp, left and right, like 
                        they we’re friggin’ Saudi Kings! 
                        Which, technically, they were-

                                 HEAVYSET MALE STAFFER
                        -Asking too many questions. Bingo 
                        bango she gets shipped off to 
                        defense, and we all have one less 
                        problem to worry about.

                                 NOVAK
                        We actually wanted to ask you 
                        something about the president.

                                 HEAVYSET MALE STAFFER
                        Oh, Clinton? Well-

                                 MILITARY FEMALE STAFFER
                        -He’s damn near the most charming 
                        man I’ve ever met, and I’ve met-

                                 MALE STAFFER IN HAT
                        -An actual Saudi Prince! Doesn’t 
                        hand out as much free seafood, 
                        though. Because-

                                 TALL MALE STAFFER
                        -He sends me the funniest emails. 
                        You know that old Coppertone ad? He 
                        found one where the girl’s-

                                 BRADSHAW
                        I’m going to stop you there. The 
                        President lost his pager. Have you 
                        seen it?

           All the staffers appear in split-screen.
                                 STAFFERS
                        No/Nope/Can’t help you/Saudi 
                        Prince!

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Well, thank you for your time.

           The Tall Male Staffer stands up, adjusting his coat.

                                 TALL MALE STAFFER
                        No problem. Good luck. You know how 
                        Clinton is.

           He exits the room, leaving Bradshaw, Novak and Cassie 
           exhausted and demoralized.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Jesus Christ. How does this place 
                        even function?

                                 NOVAK
                        It’s a surprisingly well-oiled 
                        machine.

                                 CASSIE
                        Yeah, if by oil you mean staggering 
                        corruption and complimentary 
                        shrimp.

           KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 BRADSHAW
                     (confused)
                        I thought that was everyone?

                                 NOVAK
                        It was.

                                 CASSIE
                     (to the door)
                        Come in!

           Lieutenant Colonel Silva opens the door, concern on his face.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        What are you doing up here, Silva?

                                 SILVA
                        Looking for you idiots. Do you know 
                        how much shit I’m catching for not 
                        bringing back the old Biscuit?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        We’re taking care of it, Silva.
                                 SILVA
                        My superiors are asking questions, 
                        gentlemen. And when my superiors 
                        ask questions, I’d sure as shit 
                        better have an answer for them. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Wait, how does he know the codes 
                        are missing?

           Bradshaw and Novak go ghost white.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Whoops.

                                 SILVA
                        I knew it! Jesus Christ. You people 
                        really screwed the pooch on this 
                        one.

                                 CASSIE
                        Technically, it’s the President 
                        screwing said pooch.

                                 SILVA
                        I’ve got one task here: handing the 
                        Biscuit to my superiors before 0800 
                        hours tomorrow, thus demonstrating 
                        a baseline competence sorely 
                        lacking in this administration.

                   BRADSHAW
                                          NOVAK
           Tough.
                                  Accurate.

                                 SILVA
                        And if I don’t have said codes to 
                        hand over? I’m selling you out to 
                        the Joint Chiefs. So unless you 
                        want to spend the rest of your 
                        lives in front of an unending 
                        Senate hearing, I’d get searching.

           SLAM. He’s gone.

                                 CASSIE
                        Ah, shit.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Nathan sits alone on a swing, rocking back and forth. He 
           glances at his distracted NANNY, reaches into his pocket, 
           takes out the Biscuit, and pops it into his mouth. 
           He kicks his legs back, trying to build up momentum. The 
           swing rocks forward, but comes to a sudden stop. As Nathan 
           looks up-

                                 SATANIC CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Sanguis Bibimus!

           The camera punches in on Amanda’s angry face. Todd stands 
           next to her, nervous.

                                 TODD
                        You sure we should be doing this at 
                        a playground?

                                 AMANDA
                     (ignoring Todd)
                        You stole from me, Nathan, and 
                        you’re going to give it back right 
                        this instant.

           Nathan stares back at her, his black eyes unblinking.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        And you’re not going to do it ever 
                        again! You understand me, little 
                        guy?

           Nathan POPS the Biscuit out of his mouth into his hand, 
           glaring up at her.

                                 NATHAN 
                     (unnaturally deep)
                        No.

           He goes to pop it back in his mouth, but Amanda swipes for 
           it. In SLOW MOTION, the Biscuit goes FLYING IN THE AIR. 
           Nathan LUNGES FOR IT, but Todd’s hand intercepts, grabbing 
           the plastic case.

           In REGULAR MOTION-

                                 TODD
                        I got it! I got the 
                        OHMYGODWHATTHEHELL!

           Nathan is BITING TODD’S LEFT ARM. Little bastard’s really in 
           there, too. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Holy crap!

           Todd gives his arm a mighty SHAKE, sending Nathan tumbling 
           into the mulch. His Nanny looks up, shocked.
                                 TODD
                        Jesus Christ!

           Amanda yanks him towards the park’s exit.

                                 AMANDA
                        We’re getting out of here. Right 
                        now.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Todd and Amanda sprint around the corner, coming to a rest in 
           front of a convenience store.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my God, I can’t believe he bit 
                        you!

           Todd looks at his arm - Nathan drew blood.

                                 TODD
                        Little punk really didn’t want to 
                        give these back. I think he might 
                        actually be the devil.

           Amanda gives him a hug.

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re a brave man.

                                 TODD
                        Oh, it was nothing. Really. 
                        Anything to start our family, 
                        right?

           They stare at each other for a moment, then BURST INTO 
           LAUGHTER.

                                 AMANDA
                        We got the friggin’ nuclear codes!

                                 TODD
                        And all we had to do was lie to 
                        Federal agents and shake down a 
                        toddler!

           Amanda hugs Todd, burying her face in his shoulder.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Are we really doing this?
                                 AMANDA
                        You know, I got some really good 
                        advice today.

                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Amanda’s back in the classroom, Clinton in front of her. 
           Except now she’s in a ball gown, there’s no kids, and Clinton 
           is slightly less pudgy.

                                 PRESIDENT CLINTON
                        There is nothing more important 
                        than family, Amanda.

           Back to reality.

                                 AMANDA
                        So in a way, President Clinton was 
                        giving us permission.

                                 TODD
                        Oh. Well, when you say it like 
                        that...

           A beat.

           Let’s have a frickin’ baby.
                                  Let’s have a baby!

           INT. LONG JOHN’S PAWN - DAY

           Amanda stands at the counter, more confident than we’ve ever 
           seen her. Todd’s behind her, proud.

                                 AMANDA
                        Now listen here, Mr. Jonathan. 
                        Here’s how it’s going to go down. 
                        We’re going to sell these nuclear 
                        codes, but we’re doing it for a 
                        good reason. So I don’t want any 
                        guff from you about it.

                                 LONG JONATHAN 
                        I wasn’t going to-
                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not doing this to humiliate Bi- 
                        President Clinton, or encourage 
                        America’s enemies. Or degrade the 
                        flag my husband served under.

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        You want my help or not?

           Amanda looks back at Todd, searching for any reason to say 
           no. He looks ahead, determined.

                                 AMANDA
                        Yes we do.

           Long Jonathan pulls out his wallet, removing a business card 
           and handing it to Amanda. 

                                 LONG JONATHAN
                        I got this buddy from my days 
                        working at the GSA. Knows people 
                        who know people who would be 
                        interested to buy what you’re 
                        selling.

                                 AMANDA
                        What is he? Some kind of gun 
                        runner? 

                                 TODD
                        Drug dealer? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Criminal kingpin?

                                 LONG JONATHAN 
                        Kind of.

                                 AMANDA
                        Where do we even find a guy like 
                        that?

           INT. BABIES-R-US - DAY

           Harried parents rush past Amanda and Todd, arguing over car 
           seats and pointing at cribs. Amanda’s focused, but Todd’s 
           taking in all the baby stuff around them.

                                 AMANDA
                        Long Jonathan said his contact 
                        would meet us by the strollers.
                                 TODD
                        Look at that, Amanda! A car seat in 
                        the shape of Winnie the Pooh! The 
                        harness is red like his shirt!

           They approach a CLERK (30s) talking to an eclectically 
           dressed WOMAN. 

                                 CLERK
                        So I tell them, “Listen up 
                        numbnuts. You’re in my house. You 
                        play by my rules. And my rules say 
                        no returns if the toy is half-
                        eaten.”

           The woman LAUGHS. Amanda clears her throat. The clerk 
           IMMEDITATELY code-switches.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you, ma’am?

                                 AMANDA
                        We’re looking for someone who works 
                        here. I think his name is Mr...

           Amanda looks down at a sheet of paper.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Swag-nan-a-mous?

           The clerk’s face lights up.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Oh shit, Long Jonathan send you? 
                        What’s good?

           He gives Amanda a hug.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m Amanda. And this is my husband 
                        Todd

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Pleased to meet you. I’m 
                        Swagnanamous. This’ my bitch Tina. 
                        Say hi, Tina.

                                 TINA
                        Hi y’all.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        What can I do for your good people 
                        today? A little yayo? Crystal? DMT? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SWAGNANAMOUS (CONT'D)
                        Don’t TELL me you’re trying to buy 
                        PCP. Man, you people watch one guy 
                        get beat up by the cops, now every 
                        white person wants to try it out.

                                 AMANDA
                        DMT?

                                 TODD
                        No sir-

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Looking for a little company then? 
                        Tina here got her bachelors in Hand 
                        Jobs at University of Maryland.

                                 TINA
                        It was a double major with 
                        hospitality management.

                                 TODD
                        No thank you!

                                 AMANDA
                        We were actually looking to sell 
                        something, and Mr. Jonathan said 
                        you might be able to help us.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        What is it, exactly?

           Amanda looks around nervously, then leans forward and 
           WHISPERS in Swagnanamous’ ear. After a moment, the clerk’s 
           eyes BULGE.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS (CONT’D)
                        You serious?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yes sir we are.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Didn’t expect to hear this when I 
                        rolled out of futon this morning. 
                        Wow. That’s a major Goddamn deal.

                                 AMANDA
                        It IS a major Goddamn deal!

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        I’d ask you not to swear in front 
                        of the bitch.
                                 AMANDA
                        Sorry.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        My boy Tran’s gonna wanna meet you. 
                        And Akeem. And Ruslan’s gonna 
                        definitely want to meet your asses.

                                 AMANDA
                        Sounds great. Could we have their 
                        numbers?

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Not so fast. See, I’m providing you 
                        with a service, and I’d appreciate 
                        some compensation before we go any 
                        further.

                                 AMANDA
                        What were you thinking?

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        I can help you sell the nuclear 
                        codes for... fifty dollars. Cash.

           A beat.

                                 AMANDA
                        Seriously?

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Look, you wanna get Ted Turner rich 
                        or you wanna stay in the minors?

                   AMANDA
           Ted Turner rich.
                                           TODD
                                  Tina Turner rich.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Then all it’s gonna cost you is 
                        fifty dollars.

           Todd looks to Amanda. She opens her purse, taking out the 
           cash.

                                 AMANDA
                        This had better work.

           Swagnanamous grabs it out of her hand.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Oh, you’d better believe it will. 
                        Tina, mind giving these two nice 
                        whites a ride over to embassy row?
                                 TINA
                        Sure. I’ve got a 2 pm with the 
                        Finish ambassador. Come on, y’all. 
                        Let’s get you paid.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE - DAY

           WHAM. A copy of “Between Hope and History” smacks into the 
           wall, narrowly missing Novak’s head.

                                 NOVAK
                        Hey, watch it!

           Bradshaw turns from the bookcase he’s combing through.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Sorry.

           Cassie drops the mattress, frowning.

                                 CASSIE
                        Don’t really wanna say it, guys, 
                        but it feels like we’re grasping at 
                        straws here.

                                 NOVAK
                        Not the right attitude.

                                 CASSIE
                        Face it, Novak. This administration 
                        is on a crash-course with scandal. 
                        And, in the increasingly likely 
                        situation that we DON’T find the 
                        Biscuit and Silva rats us out, we 
                        WON’T be here to prevent it.

                                 NOVAK
                     (manic)
                        Stop it! You don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about! You’re just some 
                        stupid-

           He stops himself, regaining his composure.

                                 CASSIE
                        Jesus, Novak. It’s a job. We can 
                        all get new ones.

           Bradshaw clocks a BLACK FRAME wedged between the bookcase and 
           the wall.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Cool it, you two.
                                 CASSIE
                        Really, Novak. What’s your deal? 
                        I’ve met honest to God Cabinet 
                        Members who aren’t a tenth the 
                        amount of devoted to Clinton that 
                        you are.

                                 NOVAK
                        Don’t ask-

           Bradshaw loosens the frame - it’s a picture.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        -Do tell.

                                 NOVAK
                        Excuse me?

           Bradshaw turns the photo around. It’s a candid of a smiling 
           GEORGE BUSH walking in the Capitol building with Newt 
           Gingrich, various aides, and in the corner-

                                 CASSIE
                        Novak? You were a Republican?

                                 NOVAK
                        Still am. Well, a registered one, 
                        anyway. But you’d better believe 
                        I’ve voted D since ‘92.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Explain.

           Novak’s head drops, as he lets in a huge SIGH.

                                 NOVAK
                        I’ve wanted to work in politics 
                        since I was a kid. I did everything 
                        right - Undergrad at Brown, JD from 
                        Georgetown. And, because of who my 
                        parents were, a wide support 
                        network in the Republican party.

                                 CASSIE
                        This doesn’t compute.

                                 NOVAK
                        I just wanted to make the world a 
                        better place in my own way. But I’m 
                        also- I have certain...

           His eyes dart nervously around the room.
                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        I made certain lifestyle choices 
                        that weren’t compatible with the 
                        party line. And when you’re hiding 
                        a secret like that... People find a 
                        way to use it against you. 

           A beat.

                   BRADSHAW
                                          CASSIE
           I don’t get it.
                                  You’re gay?

           Novak’s eyes bulge at the word.

                                 NOVAK
                        I prefer what I prefer. And so, I 
                        was forcefully escorted out of 
                        Republican politics. Forever.

                                 CASSIE
                        Jeez, man.

                                 NOVAK
                        So I defected. And you know what? 
                        Clinton opened doors for me that I 
                        thought had been slammed shut 
                        forever. On election night, he took 
                        my hand, looked me directly in the 
                        eye, and said “Thank you.” Which is 
                        more than I ever heard from 
                        Gingrich. So that, Cassie and 
                        Bradshaw, is why I’m doing 
                        everything in my Goddamn power to 
                        keep this presidency going.

           The room’s silent as his compatriots take it all in.

                                         BRADSHAW
                   CASSIE
           That’s beautiful.
                                  You’re a Republican?

           EXT. EMBASSY ROW - DAY

           Todd and Amanda stare down a row of ornate houses - Embassy 
           row. 

                                 TODD
                        Sure is pretty.

                                 AMANDA
                        These look like the kind of houses 
                        Frasier would live in!
                                 TINA (O.S.)
                        Y’all know where you’re going? 
                        Because that Finish dude ain’t 
                        gonna blow himself. That’s more of 
                        an Estonian thing.

           They look over to Tina, sitting in her idling car.

                                 AMANDA
                        We’re doing it!

           INT. EMBASSIES - DAY - MONTAGE

           Todd and Amanda sit with a RUSSIAN ATTACHÉ.

                                 AMANDA
                        Greetings, comrade. 

           Now they’re with an IRAQI ATTACHÉ.

                                 TODD
                        Death to America, right buddy?

           And now with a VIETNAMESE ATTACHÉ.

                                 AMANDA
                        Me so excited to offer you a chance 
                        to ruin America.

                                 TODD
                        We’re here today to offer you the 
                        biggest opportunity of your life-

                                 AMANDA
                        And a chance to stick it to Uncle 
                        Sam.

                                 RUSSIAN ATTACHÉ
                        I’m not sure I follow.

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        You’re saying you have what?

                                 VIETNAMESE ATTACHÉ 
                     (in Vietnamese)
                        I’m sorry, but my translator is 
                        running 5 minutes late. Is this 
                        regarding agricultural tariffs?

                                 TODD
                        We managed to get our hands on some 
                        sensitive information.
                                 AMANDA
                        And we know how much you guys hate 
                        America. I mean, think of all the 
                        terrible stuff we’ve done!

                                 TODD
                        Agent orange.

                                 AMANDA
                        The gulf war.

                                 TODD
                        Sending David Hasselhoff to tear 
                        down the Berlin Wall.

                                 AMANDA
                        If I were you, I’d want revenge.

                                 TODD
                        And what better way than by 
                        exposing the President as one of 
                        the most incompetent men on planet 
                        Earth?

                                 AMANDA
                        So for the low, low price of fifty 
                        thousand American dollars...

                                 TODD
                        We can sell you the President’s 
                        nuclear authentication codes.

           The Russian Attaché looks shocked.

                                 RUSSIAN ATTACHÉ
                        You’re not serious.

                                 TODD
                        You’d better believe we are.

           The moment lingers, all air sucked out of the room. Until-

                                 RUSSIAN ATTACHÉ
                     (laughing)
                        Get a load of this guy, eh?

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        Why would Iraq want to do anything 
                        to harm America? America is number 
                        one big man, like Ronald McDonald. 
                        We love Ronald McDonald!
                                 RUSSIAN ATTACHÉ
                        Our countries are closer now than 
                        they’ve ever been in recorded 
                        history. Even if you DID have what 
                        you say you do, why would we want 
                        to risk that relationship?

                                 VIETNAMESE ATTACHÉ
                     (in Vietnamese)
                        Again, I’m very sorry that our 
                        translator is running late. His cat 
                        has lupus.

           Todd and Amanda share the same look in each embassy.

                                 TODD
                        So what are you saying?

                                 ATTACHÉS
                        Not interested.

           The Dulleses sit, shocked.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh. Well, thank you for your time.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Todd sits slumped down in a booth while Amanda forlornly 
           stirs a creamer into a cup of coffee.

                                 TODD
                        How does this country not have 
                        enemies anymore?

                                 AMANDA
                        Everyone used to hate us. Now? 
                        We’re the most popular country on 
                        Earth. It just isn’t fair.

           A WAITRESS comes over, filling Todd’s coffee cup. He picks up 
           discarded copy of TIME Magazine from the booth next to them, 
           flipping through it.

                                 TODD
                        Face it. America’s the world’s best 
                        friend, and that’s never going to 
                        change.

           Amanda spots a small article in the magazine.

                                 AMANDA
                        I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
           She leans in, reading.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        What the heck’s a Kosovo?

           EXT. MCDONALDS - SUNSET

           Bradshaw holds the door as Novak and Cassie exit the 
           restaurant onto the busy Washington street. They walk away, 
           heads hanging low.

                                 NOVAK
                        Damn it. That’s the last non-White 
                        House location we were at today. 

                                 CASSIE
                        We’re screwed.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Jesus. The last time this happened, 
                        we recovered the Biscuit in, like, 
                        three hours.

                   CASSIE
                                          NOVAK
           I’m sorry-
                                  -Last time this happened?

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ, can he keep track of 
                        anything?

                                 CASSIE
                        Isn’t this information you think 
                        might have been HELPFUL before?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        It wasn’t Clinton. And it’s 
                        actually happened twice before.

                                 CASSIE
                        How do you know-

                                 BRADSHAW
                        I’ve been on this job for twenty 
                        years. I’ve seen some wild shit.

                                 NOVAK
                        When did this happen? And where the 
                        hell did they find the codes?
           EXT. WASHINGTON HILTON HOTEL - DAY

           It’s 1981. President RONALD REAGAN waves to an assembled 
           crowd as would-be assassin JOHN HINKLEY JR steps out, firing 
           a quick shot into Reagan’s torso.

                                 BRADSHAW (V.O.)
                        The second time was when Reagan was 
                        shot. He got rushed to GW Hospital, 
                        and the nurses cut him out of his 
                        suit.

           Despite what Long Jonathan said earlier, Reagan most 
           definitely does NOT stab Hinkley to death with a pen. He just 
           falls to the ground, limp.

           INT. GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY

           A pair of bloody men’s dress shoes sit outside a hospital 
           room, a black piece of plastic inside.

                                 BRADSHAW (V.O.)
                        They found the Biscuit in his 
                        shoes. Orderly put them out in the 
                        hallway. Thank God no one took 
                        them.

           INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

           Now it’s 1979. A CLERK hangs up a wide-lapeled SUIT on a 
           rack, ready to be cleaned.

                                 BRADSHAW (V.O.)
                        The first time was when Jimmy 
                        Carter left them in a suit that got 
                        sent to the dry cleaners. It was a 
                        half hour before that peanut-
                        farming simpleton realized what 
                        happened.

           EXT. MCDONALDS - SUNSET

           We’re back in the present (well, 1998).

                                 CASSIE
                        Somehow, that actually makes me 
                        feel better. Every president is 
                        terrible in their own special way.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        I dunno, this administration seems 
                        to take the cake in incompetence. 
                        You heard our coworkers.

                                 NOVAK
                        That’s the great thing about our 
                        country. Now matter how bad we try 
                        to screw it up, it finds a way to 
                        keep carrying on. 

                                 CASSIE
                        God bless America.

           INT. BABIES-R-US - NIGHT

           Todd and Amanda plow through the store, on the warpath. They 
           approach Swagnanamous, who’s currently selling a car-seat to 
           a pair of YUPPIE PARENTS.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        The important thing about the clip-
                        in system is-

                                 AMANDA
                        None of them wanted to buy the 
                        nuclear codes you son of a bitch!

           Amanda is red with fury, squaring up against Swagnanamous. 
           The terrified yuppies scramble.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                     (annoyed)
                        Lady, you just screwed me out of a 
                        twelve dollar commission! That’s, 
                        like, two meals at Sizzler!

                                 TODD
                        All they did was laugh at us!

                                 AMANDA
                        I’ve never been more simultaneously 
                        proud and disgusted to call myself 
                        an American!

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Sorry, folks, but that’s the way it 
                        goes sometime.

                                 AMANDA
                        We want our money back.
                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Hey, let’s not say anything we 
                        can’t take back. So plan A didn’t 
                        work. But you know what? This is 
                        America! Plan A never works!

           As patriotic strings swell-

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS (CONT’D)
                        You think George Washington gave up 
                        when the Delaware river froze? You 
                        think Abraham Lincoln gave up when 
                        the South decided to succeed? You 
                        think the CIA gave up when black 
                        people started thriving in this 
                        country?

                                 AMANDA
                        Uh, no?

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        You’re damn right. They crossed 
                        that river. They fought the 
                        confederacy. They introduced crack 
                        and HIV into the inner cities. 
                        Because finding plan B is what 
                        America does best.

           Swagnanamous wipes a tear from his eye.

                                 AMANDA
                        We’re way ahead of you.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        I’m sorry?

           Amanda pulls the copy of Time magazine out of her purse.

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you know any Serbians?

           Swagnanamous gives a long, low WHISTLE.

                                 SWAGNANAMOUS
                        Now THAT’S what I’m talking about. 
                        I know the exact dude you wanna 
                        talk to. Plan B, baby!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - NIGHT

           Novak approaches the Roosevelt room with Bradshaw and Cassie. 
                                 NOVAK
                        I’ll be in there ten minutes. Don’t 
                        go too far.

           Novak places his hand on the door, about to enter. He pauses.

                                 CASSIE
                        What’s the hold-up?

                                 NOVAK
                        Just... Thank you. Both of you. I 
                        know this is a pretty insane 
                        situation, but I like knowing that 
                        both of you are on my side.

           He gives them a smile, entering-

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

           The men in the room rise to greet Novak.

                                 NOVAK
                        As-salamu alaykum, gentlemen.

           The closest man extends his hand-

           IT’S THE IRAQI ATTACHÉ.

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        Good to see you, Timothy.

                                 NOVAK
                     (shaking hands)
                        Akeem, the pleasure is all mine. 
                        Mind if we keep this brief? I have 
                        a deadline I need to hit.

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        Are you OK, my friend? You look 
                        like you’ve had a hell of a day.

                                 NOVAK
                        Funny thing is, you wouldn’t 
                        believe me if I told you.

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        I know what you mean. I had the 
                        strangest thing happen to me today

                                 NOVAK
                        Oh yeah?
                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        A portly white man and his wife 
                        came into my office and said they 
                        wanted to sell me your country’s 
                        nuclear codes. Can you imagine?

           Novak’s face freezes.

                                 NOVAK
                        I’m sorry?

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        They walk right in and tell us they 
                        want to sell us launch codes. For 
                        fifty thousand dollars! I have no 
                        idea how they made it past our 
                        secre-

           Novak holds his hand up, silencing the Attaché.

                                 NOVAK
                        Fat guy, around five eight, look of 
                        total mediocrity? Wife have curly 
                        brown hair?

                                 IRAQI ATTACHÉ
                        Why, yes! Have you met them?

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - NIGHT

           An INTERN walks past the door.

                                 NOVAK (O.S.)
                        SON OF A BITCH!

           His shouting startles the Intern, papers flying all over the 
           hallway.

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Scantily-clad club-goers shiver in a snaking, block-long 
           line. A heavy, tattooed BOUNCER works the velvet rope, 
           admitting a group of GW Sophomores.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Enjoy night, ladies.

           CLICK. The velvet rope’s back up. The bouncer’s eyes flick 
           down to his keyboard, then up at two people who definitely 
           aren’t getting in.
                                 BOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        No.

           It’s the Dulleses, not at all dressed for the occasion.

                                 TODD
                        One admission, please.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Club is at capacity. Come back 
                        never.

                                 AMANDA
                        Look, we’re here to see-

           Amanda pulls a CARD out of her purse, eyes squinting to make 
           out the writing.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Jez-di-mir Kuh-vij-ik?

           The bouncer’s eyes narrow. He leans in close.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Why you ask for him? Who send you?

           The bouncer nods at two LARGE MEN, who saunter over towards 
           the Dulleses.

                                 AMANDA
                        Look, mister. We’re here to do two 
                        things: make money and meet Mr. Kuh-
                        who’s-its. 

                                 TODD
                        Our good friend Swagnanamous sent 
                        us here to talk to him.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Swagnamamous? That son bitch?

           The two large men lay hands on Todd and Amanda.

                                 BOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        You know where take them.

                                 TODD
                        Wait, we-

           Todd and Amanda are YANKED forward, disappearing into the 
           door of the club.
           INT. NIGHTCLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Todd and Amanda enter a massive WAREHOUSE, teeming with 
           activity, none of it legal. A slender, bald Serbian man 
           stands on a metal walkway above, shouting directions.

                                 SERBIAN MAN
                        Radic, easy with those, eh? Don’t 
                        want to break merchandise.

           The man spots Todd and Amanda below, smiling wide.

                                 SERBIAN MAN (CONT’D)
                        You! Why you looking for Jezdimir?

                                 AMANDA
                        Swagnanamous sent us.

                                 SERBIAN MAN
                        Swagnanamous! He is best.

                                 TODD
                        Are you Jez-di-whoosits?

           The man bows. This is JEZDIMIR CVIJIC, in the flesh. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes, but you call me by American 
                        name “Jeff.”

           He descends a metal staircase, reaching out and taking Todd’s 
           hand. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Pleased to meet you. Any friend of 
                        Swagnanamous is friend of mine.

           Todd takes his hand.

                                 TODD
                        I’m Todd. This is my wife, Amanda.

           She sticks out her hand. Jeff bends over, kissing it.

                                 JEFF
                        Very white. Is beautiful, yes?

                                 AMANDA
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 JEFF
                        Welcome to my home. Is good to have 
                        visitors. You just like me, living 
                        life of crime.
                                 TODD
                        I wouldn’t say-

           Amanda elbows him.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Oh, yeah. Sure do love crime. Arson 
                        and crack and, uh, racketeering?

                                 JEFF
                        You funny man, Todd. Like Frasier. 
                        You know Frasier? He is man who 
                        talks on radio, and father has dog? 
                        He is fancy, and dog is not. Is 
                        great comedy!

                                 TODD
                        I love that show!

                                 AMANDA
                        So, uh, what exactly do you do 
                        here?

                                 JEFF
                        I am small businessman just trying 
                        to make it in big city. Now, what 
                        can Jeff do for you? You buy crack? 
                        Kalashnakov? Bean Children?

           He extends his hand towards a shipping container with it’s 
           doors open. Amanda’s face lights up with excitement!

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my God! So many Beanie Babies!

           There sure are. Dozens of clear plastic trash bags stuffed to 
           the brim with purple Princess Diana Beanie Babies.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes! America love the bean 
                        children. They are like animal, but 
                        made of cloth. Look, I write word 
                        song on ear.

           Jeff reaches over, grabbing one of the bears. As he flips 
           open the tag-

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        “Hello. I am bear princess. I die 
                        like pig in tunnel. Much sorrow.” 
                        You like?

                                 AMANDA
                        Mmm hmm.
                                 TODD
                        We’re not actually here to buy, Mr. 
                        Jeff. We’re here to sell.

                                 JEFF
                        Interesting. What you have?

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, sir, how would you feel about 
                        taking the United States of America 
                        down a peg or two?

           INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Jeff sits down behind a coke-stained desk, putting his feet 
           on the table.

                                 JEFF
                        Explain, Todd and Todd Wife.

                                 AMANDA
                        Well, we’re in something of a bind. 
                        We’re looking to start a family, 
                        and we need a little bit of help to 
                        get there.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. Family is most important. 
                        Child is pure, full of love. Unless 
                        they Albanian. Then child full of 
                        deceit and wickedness.

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you have children?

                                 JEFF
                        I have son, very proud of him. He 
                        is at Hague now. 

                                 AMANDA
                        To cut to the chase, we need fifty 
                        thousand dollars.

           Jeff whistles.

                                 JEFF
                        That is lots of money, Todd Wife. 
                        What you have that worth that 
                        price?
                                 AMANDA
                        We have something... sensitive. If 
                        it were to be released, the 
                        President, nay, the United States 
                        would be absolutely mortified.

                                 JEFF
                        I like you, Todd Wife. You have 
                        courage. Like goat with handgun 
                        stapled to it.

                                 AMANDA
                        Thank you?

                                 JEFF
                        What is thing you talk about? Photo 
                        of President making blow job to 
                        himself? 

                                 TODD
                        It’s kind oh, uh...

                                 AMANDA
                        We might have accidently gotten our 
                        hands on the United States nuclear 
                        codes.

           Jeff’s mouth goes slack, eyes bulging.

                                 JEFF
                        You forgive me, my English is not 
                        great. When you say nuclear codes-

                                 AMANDA
                        The codes the President has to say. 
                        To launch nuclear missiles. Which 
                        will kill everyone.

           Jeff is completely silent. Todd and Amanda share a look - did 
           they offend him?

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        This is crazy, we never should have 
                        come. Thank you for your time, but 
                        we’ll just-

                                 JEFF
                        Todd Wife, every day I yell at God 
                        for two things. One is to have 
                        Serbia be cleansed of filth. Other 
                        is to make America pay for keeping 
                        me from killing filth myself. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Today, God listen to my screams and 
                        give me everything I need in world. 
                        You are family. I love you.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh. Well, in that case, we love you 
                        too!

                                 JEFF
                        Can I see codes?

                                 TODD
                        We didn’t bring them with us.

                                 AMANDA
                        They’re hidden. In a safe place. If 
                        we can come to an agreement about 
                        the right price, we can bring them 
                        to you.

           Jeff smiles wide.

                                 JEFF
                        You are very smart man, wife.

                                 AMANDA
                        Great! We’d need fifty thousand 
                        dollars. Cash. Or I guess we could 
                        accept a cashier’s check. 

                                 JEFF
                        Yes. Good. I give to you.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, OK. I guess just give us the 
                        money, and then we’ll go and get 
                        the codes and get them back to you 
                        in a jiffy.

                                 JEFF
                        Apologize, but no, that not how 
                        this work.

           Jeff reaches into a drawer, pulling out a gold-plated PISTOL. 
           Todd and Amanda immediately sink in their chairs.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        This is deal. Todd, you stay. I 
                        like you. You good friend. Todd 
                        Wife, you fetch codes and bring 
                        back. I keep Todd as, what is word, 
                        hostage? When Todd Wife bring 
                        codes, then payment. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        But if she not return, Todd maybe 
                        gets shot in face. Deal?

           Todd’s as white as a sheet.

                                 TODD
                        Amanda, you don’t have to-

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, I’ll go get the codes. But 
                        listen to me, mister Jeff. If you 
                        hurt one hair on my husband’s head, 
                        you’re going to be in a world of 
                        trouble.

           Jeff LAUGHS, waving the gun around.

                                 JEFF
                        You spunky, like Frasier Wife, Roz. 
                        Hurry up. We have deal to make.

           EXT. TODD AND AMANDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Amanda hurries down the street, eyes blurry and ears ringing. 
           She’s in complete shock. She makes it to the front door, 
           fumbling around for her keys.

                                 AMANDA
                     (muttering)
                        Going to kill... Todd...

           Behind her, we hear the telltale CLICK of a hand gun being 
           cocked.

                                 BRADSHAW (O.S.)
                        Put your hands up!

           Amanda’s hands shoot up in the air, keys flying off into a 
           pile of slush.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my God! Don’t kill me! I’m a 
                        teacher! I don’t own anything 
                        valuable!

           Bradshaw emerges from the shadows, gun trained on Amanda. 
           Cassie and Novak creeps cautiously behind them.

                                 NOVAK
                        You’re in a lot of trouble Mrs. 
                        Dulles.

           Amanda’s hands drop, tears welling up in her eyes.
                                 AMANDA
                        You have no idea. Help me, please.

           Tears roll down her cheeks. Novak and Bradshaw share a look, 
           unsure about what to do.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                     (quiet)
                        Please.

           INT. TODD AND AMANDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cassie brings a cup of coffee to a distraught Amanda as Novak 
           and Bradshaw sit across from her.

                                 AMANDA
                        I swear to God, we’re not bad 
                        people. Sure, maybe we made a 
                        mistake today, but it’s not like 
                        we’re evil.

                                 NOVAK
                        Just take it from the top, Mrs. 
                        Dulles.

                                 AMANDA
                        Ok. So, when the President visited 
                        my classroom this morning, he 
                        accidently dropped the Biscuit in 
                        our bathroom. One of my students 
                        tried to eat it but I took it from 
                        him and I didn’t even know what it 
                        was! So I put it in my purse and 
                        then we went to the fertility 
                        doctor and he told Todd his sperm’s 
                        retarded and it’s going go be fifty 
                        thousand to have a baby and then 
                        you showed up and we were so scared 
                        but we didn’t have the codes then 
                        because Nathan stole them so we 
                        stole them back from him but he bit 
                        Todd and then Long Jonathan 
                        introduced us to Swagnanamous who 
                        introduced us to Jeff who then took 
                        my husband hostage!

                                 CASSIE
                        Sorry, was there a “retarded sperm” 
                        in there?

                                 NOVAK
                        Sounds like you’ve had quite a day.
                                 AMANDA
                        And now he’s with that gangster, 
                        probably being tortured all because 
                        we want to have one lousy kid!

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Mrs. Dulles, here’s the facts as we 
                        see them. You and your husband 
                        found classified government 
                        materials and then attempted to 
                        sell them to America’s enemies.

                                 AMANDA
                        But it was for a good reason!

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sure the Rosenbergs said the 
                        exact same thing.

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s OK, officer. Arrest me. I’ll 
                        go quietly.

           Amanda sticks out her hands at Cassie, who looks at her 
           confused.

                                 CASSIE
                        Uh, Bradshaw, what do I do in this 
                        situation?

                                 AMANDA
                        Aren’t you with the Secret Service?

                                 CASSIE
                        Well, technically I’m a speech 
                        writer...

           Amanda looks shocked.

                                 AMANDA
                        Excuse me?

                                 CASSIE
                        I mean, Bradshaw is totally secret 
                        service. But Novak and I...

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Mrs. Dulles, your cooperation is 
                        essential to what happens next-

                                 AMANDA
                        Hold on. Just hold on for one 
                        frickin’ second.
           Amanda stands up, agitated.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t a secret service 
                        investigation?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Not exactly.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not under arrest. 

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Again, not exactly, but-

                                 AMANDA
                        Because you can’t arrest me, 
                        because...

           It dawns on her. A smile creeps across her face.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        ...Nobody except us knows the codes 
                        are missing.

                                 NOVAK
                        Technically, you’re correct.

                                 AMANDA
                        Which means you need me just as 
                        much as I need you.

                                 NOVAK
                        Well-

                                 AMANDA
                        Great. So you’re going to help me 
                        get my husband back. 

           The Feds share a look.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Your husband. Who’s currently in 
                        the process of committing treason. 
                        Aided by you. Who’s also actively 
                        committing treason.

                                 AMANDA
                        You say treason, I say opportunity.

                                 NOVAK
                        Pretty sure it’s treason either 
                        way.
                                 AMANDA
                        You don’t want this getting out. If 
                        the press found out Clinton lost 
                        the nuclear codes...

           The smile on her face widens.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Well, you’d all be out of a job, 
                        for starters.

           Bradshaw curses under his breath. She’s got them figured out.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Look, Mrs. Dulles, maybe we can 
                        come to an understanding...

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, I understand all right. You’re 
                        going to help me rescue my husband 
                        from that Serbian lunatic, and then 
                        we’re going to give you back the 
                        codes. And America’s going to be 
                        just fine after all.

           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Amanda shivers as Novak, Bradshaw and Cassie join her in the 
           queue.

                                 AMANDA
                        This is it. The only way to save my 
                        husband.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Afraid so, Mrs. Dulles. 

                                 NOVAK
                        Don’t worry. Get inside, make the 
                        switch, and walk out to the club. 
                        You get your husband back, we get 
                        the Biscuit, and America dodges a 
                        gigantic, scandalous bullet.

                                 AMANDA
                        Ok. I can do this. I mean, I 
                        haven’t been in a club since I was 
                        nineteen. I got thrown out for 
                        being too drunk. But I wasn’t! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                        I just really, really wanted to eat 
                        a stranger’s chicken fingers while 
                        making whoopie with Todd in a 
                        bathroom stall. We’d just won a 
                        friggin’ war!

                                 CASSIE
                        I envy you and your husband. Truly.

                                 NOVAK
                        It’s not every wife who’d leverage 
                        the United States government to 
                        rescue her treasonous husband from 
                        a Serbian gangster.

                                 AMANDA
                        I promised in our wedding vows that 
                        I’d save him from a burning 
                        building, giant dog attack or 
                        Pelican Brief. And so this seems 
                        right up our ally.

                                 NOVAK
                        You’re a brave woman, Mrs. Dulles.

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re darn right. Let’s go get my 
                        husband back.

           She walks away from the Feds towards the Bouncer, who escorts 
           her past the velvet rope.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - BACK WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           The bounder leads Amanda into the cavernous space.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, wow, this is quite impressive.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Yes. Many crimes happen. You want 
                        baby? We can get you baby.

                                 AMANDA
                        Tempting...

           They pass the shipping container full of Beanie Babies. 
           Amanda takes in the sight.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        They look so real!
           The bouncer waits patiently as Amanda leans over the side, 
           peering in.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Yes. Very nice. I bring to Jeff 
                        now?

           Amanda sighs, leaning up and discretely palming one of the 
           purple bears. 

           She follows the bouncer across the room, entering-

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - JEFF’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jeff opens his arms, wide.

                                 JEFF
                        Todd Wife! So glad you make it 
                        back. You bring what I say, or do I 
                        need murder husband first?

                                 TODD
                        I don’t think anyone’s going to get 
                        murdered today. Right, honey?

           Amanda reaches into her purse, pulling out the damaged 
           Princess Di bear.

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, I’ve got it right here you... 
                        Penis. Face.

                                 JEFF
                        I not understand. You want buy Bean 
                        Child?

           She pulls the Biscuit out of the bear’s slit, flashing it at 
           Todd.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Is disguise! Like hair of 
                        Niles!

                                 AMANDA
                        My country’s launch codes in the 
                        palm of your hands.

                                 TODD
                        Please, give to me.

           Amanda lowers it into her purse.
                                 AMANDA
                        Not so fast, buster. You owe us 
                        money. Fifty thousand dollars.

                                 TODD
                        I give you something better: not 
                        having dead husband. Is good deal, 
                        yes?

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK, Amanda. Just do what the 
                        man says and we’ll walk out of 
                        here.

                                 AMANDA
                        You want it? Fine.

           She reaches into her bag, grabbing the bear and tossing it 
           across the room. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Pleasure doing business with you.

           She grabs Todd, hustling him out of the office.

           Jeff crosses to the bear, picking it off the ground.

                                 JEFF
                        OK, bear. You and me will make 
                        America pay for she’s done-

           He hold up the Beanie Baby - there’s no hole in the side.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        What?

           He looks at the tag - IT’S ONE OF HIS KNOCKOFFS.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        No! 

           Jeff draws his gun, sprinting after Todd and Amanda.

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           They burst through the door onto the crowded dance floor, 
           sending a club-goer SPRAWLING.

                                 TODD
                        I knew you’d come back for me.

           She gives Todd a quick kiss, moving forward.
                                 AMANDA
                        How could I leave you behind? We’ve 
                        got a baby to make, mister.

                                 TODD
                        I just wish, you know, we didn’t 
                        have to betray the country to keep 
                        me alive.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, don’t worry about that.

           She reaches into her purse, pulling out the damaged Beanie 
           Baby.

                                 TODD
                        I’ve never been more in love with 
                        you.

                                 JEFF (O.S.)
                        Stop girl with bear!

           They turn around, spotting a frenzied Jeff.

                                 AMANDA
                        Ah, crap.

           She glances across the room, spotting Bradshaw and Novak. 
           They try to push across, but are stuck in the swarm of 
           bodies.

           THE MACARENA comes on the speakers. The place goes absolutely 
           nuts. Jeff is gaining on them, pushing his way through the 
           crowd.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        This way!

           Amanda grabs Todd’s hand, ducking and dodging as the crowd 
           around them breaks into dance. Jeff lunges forward, grabbing 
           Amanda’s shoulder.

                                 JEFF
                        Bear. Now.

           Amanda raises her hands - nothing there. Jeff spins around as 
           Cassie, in the middle of the crowd, dances.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        No!

           He rushes towards Cassie, but spots the bear being passed to 
           Bradshaw, who passes it to Novak. Novak crosses his arms and 
           jumps. By the time his arms shoot back out, the bear is gone.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Where did-

           Amanda and Todd are now on the other side of the dance floor, 
           bear in hand.

                                 AMANDA
                        Got it!

                                 TODD
                        Come on, let’s get out of here. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s this-

           CLICK.

                                 JEFF (O.S.)
                        Not so fast, Todd Wife

           Jeff’s gun is pointed directly at Amanda’s head. The Dulleses 
           freeze.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Give me codes. Now.

           Bradshaw draws his gun, aiming at Jeff.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Secret Service! Freeze!

           The gangster spins Amanda around, holding her in a death grip 
           with his gun against her temple.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh no, Uncle Sam! You not stopping 
                        me.

           BLAM BLAM. Jeff fires towards the ceiling, hitting a speaker. 
           The crowd SCREAMS, turning the dance floor into complete 
           chaos. Bradshaw, Novak and Cassie move in, pushing their way 
           past panicked bodies. 

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Get him!

           They finally reach the Dulleses, finding Todd, alone.

                                 BRADSHAW (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           SLAM. A heavy metal door closes violently behind the bar.
                                 TODD
                        This way!

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - BACK WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Jeff hurries Amanda through the warehouse, panicked.

                                 AMANDA
                        Let me go, you jerk!

                                 JEFF
                        Quiet, Todd Wife!

           He points towards two of his goons, screaming.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                     (in Serbian)
                        We’re getting the hell out of here! 
                        Get the van ready!

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        Amanda!

                                 AMANDA
                        Todd!

           Jeff shoves Amanda towards an idling van as his goons toss a 
           trash bag full of Beanie Babies in the cargo area.

                                 JEFF
                        Where are manners? Please, get in 
                        car or get bullet in face.

           Amanda crawls into the passenger seat and Jeff hops behind 
           the wheel.

                                 AMANDA
                        Help me!

           VROOM. The engine turns over, Jeff gunning the van towards a 
           garage door. SMASH. The van plows through, tearing off into 
           the street.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Damn it!

                                 NOVAK
                        How are we supposed to catch them 
                        now?

           Todd scans the room, eyes landing on a bright red MUSTANG.
                                 TODD
                        Heck yeah.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The van sprints through dark, empty streets. It takes a 
           corner hard, lifting on two wheels before coming back down to 
           earth.

                                 JEFF (O.S.)
                        I should have known Todd a rat. 
                        Just like Fraiser’s enemy, Maris.

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           Jeff’s sweaty and wild-eyed, swerving the van across the 
           median. Amanda sits next to him, terrified.

                                 AMANDA
                        Why don’t we just stop and give the 
                        nice government people the nuclear 
                        codes and everything will be OK and 
                        we all stay alive?

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t think so, Todd Wife. You 
                        have given me the key to humiliate 
                        Serbia’s second-greatest enemy 
                        after the hated Albanians. I refuse 
                        to let it go.

           VROOM. A red BLOB approaches behind them. Amanda and Jeff 
           look in the rear-view mirrors.

                   AMANDA
                                        JEFF (CONT'D)
           Todd!
                                  American scum!

           The Mustang gains on the van, grazing the back bumper.

           INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

           Todd’s behind the wheel. Bradshaw sits next to him, with 
           Novak and Cassie crammed into the barely-existant back seat.

                                 TODD
                        I’m coming, Amanda!

           WHAM. The car slams into the back of the van, bumper catching 
           on bumper.
                                 BRADSHAW
                        Easy there, Sandra Bullock. No need 
                        to go over 50.

                                 NOVAK
                        Throttle down, Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Uh, there’s a problem. I can’t.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        What do you mean?

                                 TODD
                        The cars are stuck together.

           They all look forward, confirming Todd’s theory.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Son of a bitch!

           INT. VAN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff tries to gun the gas, but it’s no use.

                                 JEFF
                        My friend Todd! He has betrayed me!

           He YANKS the wheel to the right, disconnecting from the 
           chasing vehicle. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The van pulls away from the Mustang, nearly crashing into a 
           light poll. Jeff steers away at the last moment, missing it 
           by inches.

           The Mustang pulls up next to the van, Todd rolling down the 
           window.

                                 TODD
                        Amanda! Are you OK?

                                 AMANDA
                        He’s crazy, Todd! He’s going to 
                        kill me!

                                 TODD
                        I need you to jump!

                                 AMANDA
                        What? No way!
                                 TODD
                        Trust me! I’ll catch you!

           Jeff notices the open window, pulling out his pistol.

                                 JEFF
                        Die, Maris!

           BLAM. The bullet sails past Amanda, splattering open one of 
           the Mustang’s tail lights. 

           Jeff turns the van hard left, arriving on-

           EXT. ARLINGTON MEMORIAL BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Todd pulls up to the van again, but Jeff side-swipes him. The 
           Mustang’s front tire blows out, the car rolling to a stop. 
           Inside the van, Jeff looks victorious.

                                 JEFF
                        Todd is defeated! Government is 
                        ruined! Serbia shall be avenged!

                                 AMANDA
                        It might not be perfect, but it’s 
                        my country, buster!

           WHAM. Amanda slugs Jeff in the jaw. He recoils, taking his 
           hand off the Beanie Baby. Amanda grab for it-

           But she isn’t quick enough.

           Jeff grabs her wrist, squeezing it with all his might.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Let go! You’re hurting me!

           His face is contorted, a lethal combination of desperation 
           and hate.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                     (quiet)
                        Plan B.

                                 JEFF
                        What?

           Amanda reaches her right arm over, yanking the steering wheel 
           hard. The van lunges right, colliding with cement and then 
           floating, effortlessly, through the air.

           Back at the Mustang, Todd looks on in horror.
                                 TODD
                        Amanda!

           The van slowly, surely, gracefully descends towards-

           EXT. POTOMAC RIVER - NIGHT

           SPLOOSH. The van nosedives into the river, slamming Amanda 
           and Jeff into the windshield. It begins sinking, water 
           flooding in through the open window. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Todd-

           Frigid water pours into her mouth, drowning out her words.

           On the bridge above, the Mustang rolls to a stop, Todd and 
           the Feds rushing to the now-destroyed railing.

                                 TODD
                        No!

           He spins around to the others, terrified.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        She... The river... In the car.

           Todd turns back to the river, making up his mind.

           He gulps in a lungful of air, then JUMPS, descending into the 
           river below. Bradshaw and Novak look at each other, deciding 
           the right thing to do. They JUMP IN AFTER TODD.

           Todd’s underwater, Bradshaw and Novak plunging in after him. 
           They swim to the sinking van, finding Amanda inside, 
           struggling with her seat belt. Jeff’s passed out next to her, 
           head bashed open by the steering wheel.

           Novak swims over, helping Todd pry open the door. Bradshaw 
           pulls a KNIFE out of his belt it slides through the end of 
           the seat belt, freeing Amanda’s body. Hey eyes are hazy - not 
           looking good. 

           Todd and Novak wiggle her out of the passenger seat, hooking 
           her around their shoulders and kicking up towards the surface 
           as the van (and Jeff) descends into the darkness.

           They break through the surface, paddling as hard as they can 
           towards shore.

                                 NOVAK
                        Cassie!
           They make it to shore as Cassie rushes down, helping the guys 
           get Amanda out of the water. 

                                 TODD
                        Amanda! Wake up!

           He shakes his wife, but there’s no response. Bradshaw lays 
           her down on the grass as Cassie bends over, compressing 
           Amanda’s chest.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Stay with us...

           Cassie pumps Amanda’s chest, leaning over to give her mouth 
           to mouth.

                                 TODD
                     (crying)
                        Wake up, Amanda. Wake up.

           BLORP. Amanda coughs water directly into Cassie’s face, 
           sitting up with a jolt.

                                 CASSIE
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 AMANDA
                        Where... How did... Todd?

           Todd lunges forward, hugging his wife. Bradshaw and Novak 
           look on, smiling.

                                 NOVAK
                        Never thought I’d be this 
                        emotionally invested in a couple of 
                        traitors.

           Cassie slugs him in the arm. He smiles.

                                 AMANDA
                        Thank you.

                                 TODD
                        It was a group effort.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Mrs. Dulles, I’m almost sorry to 
                        ask, but what happened to the 
                        codes?

           Amanda smiles, reaching into her cleavage and pulling out-

           A WATERLOGGED PRINCESS DI BEANIE BABY.
                                 AMANDA
                        I believe we had a deal.

           She hands the bear to Novak. His eyes light up - he’s never 
           held this much power in his hands before.

                                 NOVAK
                        Your country thanks you for your 
                        service. Needless to say-

                   AMANDA
                                       NOVAK (CONT'D)
           This never happened.
                                  This never happened.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Mr. And Mrs. Dulles. I 
                        genuinely hope we never see each 
                        other again.

                                 AMANDA
                        Us too.

           And with that, the Feds depart down the street. The Dulles 
           sit for a moment, catching their breath.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t mean to be a bother, 
                        sweetie, but I’m literally freezing 
                        to death out here.

                                 TODD
                        Right. Let me check the car, see if 
                        there’s a blanket or something.

           Todd heads to the idling Mustang, popping the truck and 
           looking inside.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        What the-

                                 AMANDA
                        Everything ok?

           Todd reaches into the truck, grabbing something.

           ZIIIIIP.

                                 TODD
                        Amanda?

                                 AMANDA
                        What?

           Todd pulls out a duffel bag, opening it to show Amanda.
           IT’S STUFFED TO THE BRIM WITH CASH.

                                 TODD
                        I think we’re going to be parents 
                        after all.

           Amanda SCREAMS as Todd runs the bag of money over, embracing 
           her. 

                                 AMANDA
                     (quiet)
                        There is nothing more important 
                        than family.

                                 TODD
                        Thanks Bill Clinton.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - NOVAK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           POP. Novak opens a bottle of champagne, taking a swig.

                                 NOVAK
                        We did it! We prevented the biggest 
                        presidential scandal of all time!

           He tips the bottle towards Bradshaw.

                                 NOVAK (CONT’D)
                        Celebratory “America’s not boned” 
                        drink?

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Ah, screw it. We earned this.

           Bradshaw grabs the bottle, taking a swig. 

                                 NOVAK
                        Thank you, Bradshaw. For 
                        everything. Really.

                                 BRADSHAW
                        Don’t mention it. And for what it’s 
                        worth, the biggest mistake the 
                        Republicans ever made was driving 
                        you out of their party. You’re a 
                        good man, Novak.

           He sticks out his hand. Novak takes it, shaking heartily.

                                 BRADSHAW (CONT’D)
                        I can’t wait to see the look on 
                        Silva’s face when we hand these 
                        over to him.
           He hands the bottle back to Novak.

                                 NOVAK
                        Cassie, you want a sip? Or are you 
                        too busy measuring your new office 
                        for drapes?

           Cassie sits at Novak’s desk, using his computer.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’ll pass. Still have to make those 
                        changes to the SOTU speech, 
                        remember?

                                 NOVAK
                        You’re no fun.

           CLICK.

                                 CASSIE
                        I think it might be a little to 
                        early to celebrate.

                                 NOVAK
                        What are you talking about? We 
                        found the Biscuit. We saved this
