           FADE IN:

           EXT. RESTAURANT - MALIBU - DUSK

           Like French Laundry in Napa Valley, this restaurant is a one 
           of its kind high end destination spot where people go for 
           special occasions, photo ops and bragging rights.    

           INT. RESTAURANT - BAR - DUSK

           TITLE CARD: Chapter One -- “For Better, for Worse.”

           BRETT HARDWICK (42) is a well built man with a nice face. In 
           any other city he’d be a hunk, in LA, meh, he’s maybe a 6. 

           Brett sits alone at the relatively empty bar, nursing a 
           scotch and soda. 

           MICHELLE (36) approaches in a red dress. With her dark hair 
           and fair skin, she's a god damn knockout. And she’s side-
           eyeing Brett like he’s on the menu. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        This seat taken?

                                 BRETT
                        No, have at it. 

           Brett slides his drink over to make room. Michelle sits on 
           the stool next to him. 

                                 MICHELLE
                             (to bartender)
                        I’d like a martini -- extra dirty.
                             (to Brett)
                        You come here often?

           As soon as it’s out of her mouth, she realizes -- 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Wow. That was bad. I’m obviously 
                        out of practice.

                                 BRETT
                        No, it’s a perfectly good question. 
                        I do not come here often. You?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Never.

           The BARTENDER lays a martini on the counter for Michelle. 
                                 BRETT
                        You look so familiar. Are you an 
                        actress?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’ve been in a few things. 

                                 BRETT
                        That’s where I’ve seen you! 

                                 MICHELLE 
                        People usually remember me from --

                                 BRETT
                        No, let me guess. I know this.

           He studies her face. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        “Hollywood Hills Hotel.”

                                 MICHELLE
                        Wow. I’m impressed. Nobody ever 
                        gets it.

                                 BRETT
                        I see everything.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh? You on house arrest?

                                 BRETT
                             (laughs)
                        No, I’m a reality TV producer. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Wow. Anything I’ve seen?

                                 BRETT
                        You seen “The Groom?” 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh my God, yes! Your billboards are 
                        all over town. I love “The Groom.” 
                        Anything with roses and dates on 
                        horseback... I’m all over it. 

                                 BRETT
                        So you haven’t sworn off dating?

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?
                                 BRETT
                        When you said “out of practice” 
                        earlier, I didn’t know if you 
                        meant...? 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Married.

           Michelle holds up a ring. Beautiful diamond. Expensive. 

                                 BRETT
                        Ah, I see.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Eleven years. 

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck. You do not look old enough to 
                        be married eleven years. I thought 
                        child brides were out of vogue. 

           His faux disbelief makes Michelle laugh.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m old enough to make my own 
                        decisions. 

           She’s definitely coming on to him. Brett takes a sip of his 
           drink, thinking. 

                                 BRETT
                        It’s my anniversary. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Wow. Congratulations. She’s a lucky 
                        woman. 

                                 BRETT
                        I don’t know about that. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRETT
                        Would you want a husband who was in 
                        a bar on your anniversary having 
                        dirty thoughts about the sexy woman 
                        sitting next to him?

           Michelle stares at him. This just passed to the next level. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        She meeting you here? Your wife?
                                 BRETT
                        Later.

           Michelle leans close to Brett, lowers her voice. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Well then, for your anniversary, 
                        I’d like to give you something. 

                                 BRETT
                        What?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m going to suck you off in the 
                        broom closet. 

           Brett chokes on his drink. Laughs again. But Michelle’s not 
           joking. She sucks on her straw, twirling it in her mouth.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        What do you say?

           INT. BROOM CLOSET, RESTAURANT - DUSK

           CLOSE ON: Brett’s face as he gets a blow job. He’s enjoying 
           the hell out of it. But before he climaxes, he pulls Michelle 
           up. She smiles at him. Brett hikes up her red dress and fucks 
           her up against the wall. 

           Michelle puts her hand over her mouth to try to keep quiet --

           MINUTES LATER:

           It’s all over. 

           Brett and Michelle are left flushed and out of breath. 

           She looks at him. He looks at her. Neither says anything. 
           What now?

           INT. RESTAURANT - BAR - NIGHT 

           Brett returns to his stool at the bar unaware that his hair 
           is mussed up. His drink is where he left it. The ice has 
           melted down. 

           Michelle enters a few moments later, straightening her skirt. 
           Her necklace has got twisted around. 

           She slides her drink down the bar and takes a seat a few 
           stools away from Brett. She eats an olive from her dirty 
           martini and doesn’t look at him. He doesn’t look her way 
           either.
           The bartender is the only one who appears to have noticed 
           this whole escapade. He looks at Brett and Michelle and then 
           around at the smattering of other bar PATRONS. Absorbed in 
           their phones, no one seems to have noticed anything. 

           A HOSTESS approaches the bar. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Mr. and Mrs. Hardwick? 

                           BRETT
                                                        MICHELLE
           Yes?
                                              Yes?

                                 HOSTESS
                        Your table is ready. Follow me, 
                        please.

           Brett and Michelle smile at each other, enjoying their secret 
           game. Brett takes his wife’s hand and they follow the hostess-

           INT. RESTAURANT - SUNSET

           -- to the best seat in the house. 

           The view overlooks the unparalleled Malibu stretch of the 
           Pacific ocean. Right now the sun is setting in pinks and 
           reds. The timing couldn’t be more perfect.  

                                 HOSTESS
                        The waiter will be with you soon.

           Hostess turns to leave. Brett stops her. 

                                 BRETT
                             (privately)
                        Um, I called ahead and talked to 
                        the Maitre’d —- 

           As if waiting in the wings for his cue, the MAITRE’D arrives, 
           brandishing a bottle of champagne and pours two glasses.

                                 MAITRE’D
                        Happy anniversary, Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Hardwick. 

                           BRETT
                                                        MICHELLE
           Thank you.
                                              Thank you. 

           The Maitre’D places the champagne bottle in the table side 
           bucket of ice and walks away. Brett and Michelle are left 
           alone at their beautiful table, looking beautiful. They smile 
           at each other. Happy. 
                                 BRETT
                        Do we toast?

           Instead, Michelle leans across and straightens Brett’s mussed 
           up, post closet sex, hair. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Happy anniversary, babe.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER

           Dinner in progress. The lights of Santa Monica are now 
           visible far down the beach — ghostly and ethereal in the fog 
           that’s rolling up the coast.  

                                 BRETT
                        Okay, worst anniversary?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Wow. There have been so many.

                                 BRETT
                        Try to pick one.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay, for me, it’d have to be the 
                        Bahamas. 

                                 BRETT
                        Yes!

                                 MICHELLE
                        Not the private house once we got 
                        there, but the one night stay at 
                        the Atlantis resort that turned 
                        into a four day nightmare.

                                 BRETT
                        That was a shit show. Correct.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I like the novelty now of being 
                        able to tell people we were caught 
                        in a hurricane. But I so hated 
                        actually being in one, trapped in 
                        that shitty, leaky, piece of shit, 
                        hotel for four days. The worst.

                                 BRETT
                        I swear they jacked their prices as 
                        soon as they saw no one could 
                        leave. 
                                 MICHELLE
                        They absolutely did.

                                 BRETT
                        But we did get to eat at Nobu every 
                        night.

                                 MICHELLE
                        When world class sushi costs the 
                        same as a wedge salad, you go for 
                        the yellow tail.

           Brett enjoys his last bite of food and pushes his plate back. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Best anniversary?

                                 BRETT
                        Hard. There have been so many. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Choose, babe.

                                 BRETT
                             (voice lowered)
                        Tonight? Or is it too early to call 
                        it?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Tonight doesn’t count yet. Pick 
                        another one.

                                 BRETT
                        Machu Picchu.

           The WAITER, a 10 in any town USA, stops by the table. 

                                 WAITER
                        Can I interest you in dessert 
                        tonight? We got mini baked Alaskas-

                                 BRETT
                        No, thank you. We’re good.

                                 WAITER
                        Okay. 
                             (as he clears plates)
                        What anniversary is it? 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Eleventh. 
                                 WAITER
                        No, I mean what anniversary? Like 
                        what gift are you suppose to give-?

                                 BRETT
                        Huh, I really don’t know. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        We’ll have to look it up. 

                                 WAITER
                        So what’s the secret to a happy 
                        marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Hardwick?

                                 BRETT
                        You got to be all in. 

           The waiter nods stupidly as if soaking in these words of 
           wisdom and then walks away.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Have we had him before?

                                 MICHELLE
                        A lot. His name is Henry. He gave 
                        you a headshot. Remember?

                                 BRETT
                        That’s the same guy? 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yeah.

                                 BRETT
                        God, there’s too many good looking 
                        men in this town.

           EXT. VALET STAND - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Brett and Michelle stand at the valet stand, waiting for 
           their car to be brought around. 

           A little TV at the valet stand plays a NEWS REPORT about a 
           string of home invasions. It’s in Spanish, so we get to read 
           the subtitles.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...police say it’s unclear if these 
                        are the work of one home invader or 
                        separate home invaders...

           A young Latino VALET comes around the corner in a blue Tesla.  
           He parks the car in front of Brett and Michelle. Brett opens 
           his wallet, looking for tip money. A second VALET holds the 
           passenger side door open for Michelle.

           Suddenly, the doors of the restaurant open and Henry, the 
           handsome waiter, comes out, waving them down. Michelle looks 
           to Brett. What is this?

                                 BRETT
                             (quiet: for Michelle)
                        New headshot?

           The waiter runs up with a big smile. 

                                 WAITER
                        It’s steel. 

                                 BRETT
                        What is? 

                                 WAITER
                        Your eleventh anniversary. It’s 
                        steel, man.  

           The waiter smiles, pleased with himself and his ability to 
           google things on his phone. Michelle smiles at Brett. Say 
           something. Brett gives the waiter a thumbs up.

           EXT. PCH - NIGHT

           Michelle and Brett drive home, laughing. 

                                 BRETT
                        I remember him now.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He had “juggling” on his resume.

                                 BRETT
                        He wanted to be “the Groom.” 
                        Fucking unbelievable this town.
                             (occurs to him)
                        You think he’s cute? Is that why 
                        you remember his name?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I remember him because he’s me. 

           Off Brett’s confused look --

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        You ever wonder what I’d be doing 
                        if I hadn’t met you? I’d be Henry 
                        if I was lucky. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a good restaurant. He 
                        probably gets nice tips.

                                 BRETT
                        World’s smallest violin playing 
                        over here. You’re beautiful, 
                        talented, smart as hell --

                                 MICHELLE
                        And always a thin line away from a 
                        shitty apartment in North Hollywood 
                        that I share with another lady -- 
                        named Pam -- who wanted to be an 
                        actress too. Like me, Pam’s waking 
                        up to the fact that she’s thirty-
                        five and a career waitress. Like 
                        me, Pam’s realizing her dreams are 
                        never going to come true no matter 
                        how bad she wanted them to.
                             (beat)
                        If I ever end up back there, kill 
                        me.

                                 BRETT
                        You go so dark, babe.

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - NIGHT 

           They pull off PCH onto a smaller road. As they drive higher 
           up into the hills, the roads get narrower. “GUILTY” by Barbra 
           Streisand and Barry Gibb PLAYS on the car stereo. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Aw, I love this song.

                                 BRETT
                        I know. I should’ve made it our 
                        first dance.

           Michelle kisses Brett, lowers her window and sings along -- 

                                 MICHELLE
                        “...And we got nothing to be guilty 
                        of -- Our love will climb any 
                        mountain near or far --” 

           Brett, ever a good sport, turns up the volume and joins her. 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Hardwicks have been blessed. Big house. Nice cars. Good 
           landscapers. Their monstrous Spanish Colonial sits back from 
           the small road behind an iron gate. 
           As Brett and Michelle drive up the hill and pull into their 
           driveway, they pass a janky orange NOVA PARKED on a dirt 
           turnout down the hill from their house.

           The SONG ends as the gate opens. Brett and Michelle DRIVE up 
           to the house as the security gate CLOSES behind them. 

           Down the hill, in the Nova, a MAN sits up in the passenger 
           seat, rising from the shadows.

           INT. FOYER - HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Brett puts his keys down. Michelle takes off her heels. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m going up to bed.

                                 BRETT
                        I’ll lock up. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michelle climbs the front staircase, heels in her hand.

           On the landing, she passes a framed picture of “The Groom: 
           Season One” that’s hung on the wall. It features a handsome, 
           blonde man and the caption: “Jake - NASA Astronaut and 
           Olympian.”

           It’s crooked. Michelle notices but doesn’t fix it. She heads 
           on up to the second floor.

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Brett walks along a trail of crushed shell, through a nice 
           assortment of succulents, cacti, and drought-resistant grass.

           Tonight’s fog makes everything feel like a secret garden. A 
           big, white, wall of fog, sits like a hedge right at the edge 
           of visibility, surrounding everything.

           Brett hears something -- SHOES CRUNCHING the crushed shell on 
           the trail. He stops and looks around --

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The TV in the bathroom PLAYS as Michelle brushes her teeth 
           and does her facial tightening exercises in the mirror. 

                                 NEWS PUNDIT (O.S.)
                        ...the only reason we’re hearing 
                        about these home invasions is 
                        because they’re happening in 
                        wealthy neighborhoods... 
           Michelle lowers her face to the sink.

           A MAN stands behind her in the master closet. Dressed in 
           BLACK from head to toe, he wears a scary-as-fuck SKI MASK 
           with white piping.  

           Michelle looks back up, brushing her teeth. When she next 
           leans over to spit, the man is gone. 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Brett listens. He looks around but hears nothing.

           He follows the foot trail to the front pedestrian gate. It’s 
           unlocked and slightly open. 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Even though she’s alone in the room, Michelle uses her hand 
           and forearm to cover her breasts when she removes her dress 
           and puts on a nightshirt. 

           As she slips off her panties and shimmies into a new pair, 
           she sees something --

           The French doors to the balcony are OPEN.  

           EXT. BALCONY, OFF MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           -- Michelle walks out onto the balcony and looks around. On 
           any other night there would be a five million dollar view in 
           front of her, but tonight it’s only fog and a steep, straight 
           drop down into the dry, grassy wilds of Malibu. 

           Michelle SHIVERS. 40,000 years of evolution tell her she’s 
           being watched. She knows it. 

           She looks back into the bedroom, but there’s no one there --

           She looks over the balcony down into the yard. Nothing. 

           Following a sixth sense, she slowly turns and looks up behind 
           her towards the mansion two hundred feet further up the steep 
           hillside.  

           A MAN in a blue BATHROBE stands out on his patio smoking a 
           Cuban. He looks ghostly and dreamlike in the fog. He raises 
           his chubby arm in greeting.

                                 MICHELLE
                             (under her breath)
                        Fucking creep.
                             (loud)
                        Good night, Mr. Powalski!
           MR. POWALSKI (55) is the only neighbor within sight tonight, 
           and with the thickening fog, his house is already halfway out 
           of view. Powalski HOLLERS something to Michelle, but she 
           can’t hear him. She laughs politely and waves. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        ‘Night!
                             (quiet)
                        Perv.

           Someone comes up behind her, STARTLING her.  

           She immediately relaxes when she realizes it’s just Brett. He 
           nuzzles her neck.

                                 BRETT
                        Can’t decide if you look better in 
                        that red dress or out of it? 
                        Leaning towards “out.”

                                 MICHELLE
                        Thought you’d have had your fill 
                        tonight. 

                                 BRETT
                        Me? Never. 

           Michelle looks back up at the neighbor’s patio, but 
           Powalski’s gone. A cloud of blue cigar smoke lingers but it’s 
           quickly absorbed into the thick fog. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Think I figured out where Powalski 
                        gets his money from. He’s a 
                        pornographer.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS - INTERCUT

           The man in the black ski mask stands in the dark bedroom 
           watching Brett and Michelle on the balcony. Watching Brett 
           kiss Michelle’s ear. Watching him cup her breast.

                                 MICHELLE (O.S.)
                        I don’t know, babe. It’s late --

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Come on. It’s my anniversary.

                                 MICHELLE (O.S.)
                        Okay, but no lights.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Brett and Michelle come into the room, but the guy is gone --
           Or he’s hiding back in the shadowy, dark recesses of the 
           master closet with a ringside view --

           LATER:

           Brett and Michelle have sex. She’s phoning it in, but Brett 
           doesn’t seem to notice. 

           Brett finishes and rolls off of Michelle. He grabs her hand 
           and squeezes. Michelle looks up at the ceiling, impenetrable. 

           LATER:

           Michelle STARTLES awake. 

           The MAN in the ski mask with black piping stands right over 
           her, staring down at her.

           Michelle SITS straight up in bed -- 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What the fuck?!

           She reaches for Brett but he makes a little SNORING SOUND and 
           rolls over --  

           The man puts his HAND over Michelle’s MOUTH.

                                 GUNMAN
                        Don’t make a sound. Do what I say. 
                        Do not fuck up. Understand?

           Michelle’s eyes are big. She nods that she understands. He 
           takes his hand off her mouth and wipes it on his pants.

                                 GUNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Gross. It’s wet with spit from your 
                        mouth.

           This reminds him of something. He pulls gardening gloves out 
           of his back pack and puts them on. They’re new and a tight 
           fit. And he’s struggling to wriggle his hands into them. 

           He doesn’t like Michelle watching him struggle. It makes him 
           angry --

                                 GUNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Give me your cell phone.

           She unplugs it from the bedside charger and hands it over. He 
           shoves it in his pocket. 

                                 GUNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Wake him up.
           Michelle squeezes Brett’s arm. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Wake up. Brett? Babe? 

           She squeezes harder, pinching him awake. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Get up.  

           A groggy Brett sits up.

                                 BRETT
                        What is it?

           He sees the man standing by his bed. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Who’s that? 

           His question is almost childlike, like the half-asleep Brett 
           hasn’t yet processed the ominous ski mask or the shiny Glock 
           43 in the man’s hand. The stainless steel slide catches the 
           glare from the light on the balcony, glittering like jewelry. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I think he’s robbing us, babe.

           With a sudden jolt of adrenaline, Brett is fully awake.

                                 BRETT
                        Oh my God. 

           The gunman wrestles two zip ties out of his tight jeans and 
           throws them on the bed. He motions to Brett with his gun. 

                                 GUNMAN
                             (to Michelle)
                        Tie him up. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What? How?

                                 GUNMAN
                        Use the zip ties, dummy.

           The gunman grabs Brett’s cell phone from Brett’s side of the 
           bed and shoves it in his coat pocket too. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know how to use these.

                                 GUNMAN
                        Figure it the fuck out, lady. 
                                 BRETT
                        You can do it, babe. Come on. 

           Michelle looks to Brett for direction. To help her out, Brett 
           puts his HANDS TOGETHER behind his back, but Michelle still 
           FUMBLES with the zip ties. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        There’s like a nob part. See it? At 
                        the bottom? You put the end through 
                        there and it will sort of click --

                                 MICHELLE
                        I got it. 

                                 BRETT
                             (whispers)
                        But not too tight.

           His whisper is louder than he intended. Did the gunman hear? 
           Michelle looks up to check. 

           Yep, he heard. 

           The man comes BARRELING over and BACK HANDS Brett. Hard. 

           A surprised Michelle takes a sharp intake of air. Brett’s 
           shocked too and indignant.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, man. That really hurt. 

           The gunman seems uncertain for a minute but regains his 
           resolve. He WAVES his gun at Michelle --

                                 GUNMAN
                        Finish him up.

           Michelle loops the second zip tie through the first and HOOKS 
           it around Brett’s wrist. Both wrists are now TIED TOGETHER in 
           ghetto handcuffs.

                                 MICHELLE
                        What now?

           The gunman reaches out and GRABS Michelle by the hair --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           The gunman PUSHES Michelle down the hall -- 
                                 MICHELLE
                        Where are we going? Where are you 
                        taking me?

           He PRODS her with the MUZZLE of the GUN.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

           His silence is the worst part. The gunman STEERS Michelle to 
           the left.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        We have money. We’ve got a safe in 
                        the bedroom. There’s jewelry in 
                        there. And cash. Lots of cash I 
                        think.

           He PUSHES her again, to the right.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you want. Just don't hurt 
                        me. Please.

           They’ve arrived at their destination -- the guest room. 

           He SHOVES Michelle inside --

           INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           All Michelle can see in the dark, stale room is the queen 
           size bed towards which she’s being forced.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        No. Please. 

           The gunman THROWS her on the bed. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           He grabs her arm.

           But Michelle FIGHTS. She pulls her arm loose and HITS him. 

           She’s trying to hurt him, but her struggling is only making 
           him mad. 

           He WRESTLES Michelle down. Not fucking around, he PINS her to 
           the bed. Then he takes her arm and duct tapes it to the bed 
           post. 
                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do this. Please. I’m begging 
                        you.

           Michelle fights, SWINGING at him with her free arm.  

           But then he SNATCHES her free arm and duct tapes it to the 
           other bed post, stretching it out painfully to make it reach.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Ouch! You’re hurting me!

           He takes another piece of duct tape -- 

           RIPS it off the roll with a fleshy, TEARING SOUND --

           And pushes it over Michelle’s mouth with some satisfaction. 

           Michelle KICKS at him. 

           But none of her kicks land anywhere near him because the 
           gunman is now standing perfectly still at the foot of the 
           bed, watching Michelle SQUIRM. 

           It’s creepy as hell. He SNORTS dismissively -- 

                                 GUNMAN
                        Get over yourself, Mrs. Hardwick. 
                        I’m not going to fuck you. 

           With that, he turns and leaves the room.

           Michelle stops kicking, relieved but still terrified.

           Neither Michelle nor the gunman seem to notice that he just 
           used her last name.

           LATER:

           Some time has passed. Michelle is still tied to the guest 
           bed. The neighbor’s motion activated patio LIGHTS COME ON, 
           bathing everything -- the neighbor’s yard, the steep, brush-
           covered hillside, and the side of the Brett and Michelle’s 
           house that faces the hillside -- in BRIGHT LIGHT. 

           Michelle looks over at the window. Only a few hundred feet up 
           the hill, Mr. Powalski’s house is now a world away. 

           The light from the flood lights GLINT off a gun safe on the 
           floor of the closet. Approximately a foot deep and eight 
           inches high, it’s got a glow-in-the-dark sticker of a green 
           alien on it. 

           Michelle eyes the gun safe. Right there. Only ten feet away.
           She looks at her binds. She tries to BITE through and spit 
           out the tape covering her mouth.

           Then she hears heavy FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. 

           The door FLIES open -- 

           The GUNMAN RIPS her duct taped hands from the bed posts and 
           sits her up on the side of the bed. He CRAWLS behind 
           Michelle. The duct tape SCREECHES like something alive as he 
           RIPS it off the roll with his teeth and wraps it around her 
           wrists, binding her newly freed hands together -- 

                                 GUNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do anything stupid. 

           The gunman pulls the Glock out of his waistband and presses 
           the cold metal to the small of Michelle’s back. 

                                 GUNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Got it?

           She nods her head. The gunman reaches around and RIPS the 
           duct tape off Michelle’s mouth in one painful jerk, taking 
           some sadistic pleasure in the pain he’s causing her. 

           Then the gunman THUMPS her on the top of her head with the 
           handle of the gun. 

                                 GUNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Be quiet.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I will. Sorry.

           He THUMPS her again. A little harder this time, enjoying 
           himself. Michelle shrinks down protectively but makes no 
           further noise.

                                 GUNMAN
                        Be good. 

           He gets off the bed, dragging her along behind him -- 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           There’s a sliding wood door that separates the main bedroom 
           area from the his and hers walk-in closets and the bathroom 
           beyond. 

           The master bedroom is dark, but every light is on in the 
           bathroom, blazing full blast. It’s fucking Las Vegas down 
           there between the his and hers walk-in closets.  
           The gunman DRAGS Michelle to the master bathroom --

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           -- and THROWS her in. 

           She’s relieved to see Brett sitting there on the floor. The 
           gunman PRESSES Michelle down next to him. 

           Using more duct tape, he TIES her hands to the drawer handles 
           behind her. Then he turns and leaves. 

           When he gets to the sliding wood door, he slides the big wood 
           door closed. He then turns the lock on the outside. Doors 
           don’t lock on the outside, but closets do. 

           They hear the BOLT CLICK. They’re LOCKED in. But they’re 
           alone. 

           Michelle and Brett share a look as they wait, listening as 
           the gunman’s FOOTSTEPS recede. 

           Once he’s gone, they get to work -- 

           Brett climbs up on his knees and goes to the drawers. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Second one. On the left. 

                                 BRETT
                        This one?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. Hurry.

                                 BRETT
                        I’m going as fast as I can.

           Brett tries to open the drawer with his bound hands behind 
           his back, but to do that he’s got to squat and the angle is 
           all wrong.  

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        I can’t get it. Can you?

                                 MICHELLE
                        He taped me to the drawer handle.

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck.

           After some WRESTLING --
                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Got it!

           The drawer opens and he finds what he’s looking for --
           SCISSORS.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Cut me loose.

           He gets down beside Michelle. Scissors held behind him in his 
           bound hands, he POKES the SCISSORS in the general vicinity of 
           Michelle’s duct taped hands.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Ouch! What are you doing?

                                 BRETT
                        I’m leaving the blades open. You 
                        have to put the tape in there. And 
                        then I’ll snip it. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ouch. Please don’t cut my vein 
                        open.

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck, Michelle. I’m doing my best.

           Without being able to see it, Michelle positions her taped 
           hands between the blades of scissors to the best of her 
           ability. 

           Brett repositions himself, scissor handles in hand. Michelle 
           double checks the positioning. Brett takes a big breath. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        You got it?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know.

                                 BRETT
                        What do you want me to do?

           Michelle braces herself --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Cut it.

                                 BRETT
                        Yeah?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Just do it. 
           Michelle closes her eyes and scrunches up her face in 
           anticipation of something going wrong. 

           SNIP -- the SCISSOR BLADES come together, sharp and fast.

                                 BRETT
                        Did I get it?

           Michelle WRIGGLES her wrists, they’re coming loose.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. Do it again, babe.

           He does. SNIP. Michelle WRESTLES a hand free. It’s still 
           covered in duct tape, but it’s no longer attached to her 
           other hand.

                                 BRETT
                        Yes! Get mine off.

           Grabbing the scissors, Michelle tries to get them between the 
           zip tie and Brett’s skin, but it’s a tight fit. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s too tight. 

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck. I told you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        But, wait, you can still hoist me 
                        up without them being cut. We just 
                        need to turn you around.

                                 BRETT
                        Right. Okay. That’ll work.

           Without further conversation they move into the shower stall--

           INT. FOYER - HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           The gunman walks into the foyer, searching for something. 

           He finds it: the entryway bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM OFF FOYER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The gunman lifts the toilet seat. On second thought, he 
           closes the toilet seat. He reaches back with one hand and 
           pushes open the door so that he can have a view of the front 
           door while he takes a long, luxuriant PISS. He seems to 
           really be enjoying himself.
           He sees a little gold Buddha on the back of the toilet. He 
           stares at it. 

           Is this religious icon working on his conscience? 

           Nope. He plops the baby Buddha in the toilet and FLUSHES it. 

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           With his back to her, Brett uses his zip-tied hands to HOIST 
           Michelle up to the little window at the top of the shower.  

           Michelle SLIDES the glass pane up, PROPS it open with a 
           bottle of shampoo. 

           She KNOCKS out the screen. They’re overjoyed when they HEAR 
           it LAND on the balcony outside.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay, push me up, babe.

                                 BRETT
                        I am. You gotta climb.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I am. 

           They work at it and she gets a third of the way out the 
           window which is enough to know that this plan isn’t going to 
           work. She doesn’t fit.

                                 BRETT
                        We should’ve measured it.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You should’ve measured --

           Michelle SLIPS off Brett’s hands. She’s FALLING --

           With his hands still bound, Brett somehow manages to sort of 
           SHOVE Michelle into the corner before she hits the floor. It 
           muffles the FALL and the NOISE. 

           They look at each other, worried.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Did he hear us?

           INT. DEN - HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           The gunman riffles through Brett’s desk, putting valuables in 
           a file box he carries. 
           Then he sees an award statue in a glass case across the room. 
           It sits atop a pompous little podium. 

           He can’t figure out how to get inside the glass case so he 
           BREAKS IT with the hilt of his gun, careful to shield his 
           eyes from the FLYING GLASS. 

           He picks up the statue like it may be something of real 
           value, but then he reads the plaque aloud --

                                 GUNMAN
                        To Brett Hardwick for “The Groom” 
                        from Mavern, the studio that brings 
                        you the “The Groom.”
                             (sotto)
                        This ain’t no Emmy.

           Correct. It’s a self aggrandizing award given to the producer 
           of THE GROOM from the production company he owns that 
           produces THE GROOM. 

           The Gunman drops the worthless statue on the floor and goes 
           back to his box of spoils. This is when he sees something 
           that makes him stop in place -- 

           Three framed posters of THE GROOM hang on the wall, each 
           featuring a different season and a different groom -- 

           Robert: Fireman and Pit Bull Rescuer (season two)

           Josh: Millionaire and Little League Coach (season three)

           Levon: Ivy League Brain Surgeon and Chef (season four)

           The Gunman stands before the wall of posters, reverent and 
           motionless. It’s impossible to know what he’s thinking.

           But then he TAKES OFF his MASK. 

           In deep concentration, EDDIE ESPERANZA (28) studies the 
           posters, allowing us a long, good look at his face -- 

           And, fuck, if he isn’t a handsome mother fucker too. A well-
           built Latino man with a strong jaw and classic good looks, 
           Esperanza’s as handsome as the men featured on the posters. 

           He stares at “the grooms” wistfully, admiring the rotating 
           stars of the series, and ostensibly, the universe. 

           Then he MOVES so suddenly, it’s startling. Esperanza STRIKES 
           the SAME POSE as Robert the Fireman, complete with boy next 
           door “aw shucks I’m hot” smile.   
           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Brett and Michelle sit on the bathroom floor, defeated.

                                 MICHELLE
                        It wouldn’t have worked anyway. I 
                        locked the balcony door earlier. I 
                        forgot. I’d just be trapped outside 
                        getting cold. 

           Michelle rubs her wrists. They still have tape all around 
           them, but they’re not hooked together. 

                                 BRETT
                        Get these off of me.

           Brett turns his back to her. She takes the scissors and 
           starts to GNAW AWAY at his ties. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay, so what’s the plan now?

                                 BRETT
                        As soon as one of us gets the 
                        chance we go for the gun safe in 
                        the guest room.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Okay, but I want to be the one to 
                        do it. Zero. Nine. One. Seven - 
                        then what?

                                 BRETT
                        Zero. Eight. It’s our anniversary 
                        date, babe. 

           Michelle stops, genuinely touched. Her eyes tear up a little.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        What? You know I’m a romantic. 

           Michelle is suddenly overwhelmed with emotion --

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m a terrible person. 

                                 BRETT
                        Are you kidding? You’re wonderful.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’ve been a terrible wife and just 
                        a shitty bad person.
                                 BRETT
                        Hey, where is this all coming from? 
                        Is it about tonight? I can argue 
                        with the wife part because I’m the 
                        husband and really the only person 
                        who can say if you’re a good wife 
                        or not. And I say you’re a great 
                        wife, babe. 

           Michelle smiles weakly. This makes her feel a little better.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        And as far as being a bad person 
                        goes... 

           Here he falters.

                                 MICHELLE
                        See? I’m bad. You can’t even think 
                        of anything to say --

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck ‘em. What does being “good” 
                        mean anyway?

                                 MICHELLE
                             (re: zip ties)
                        Lean forward a little, babe. I’ve 
                        almost got it.

                                 BRETT
                        So you don’t recycle or care about 
                        homeless people, but you cried at 
                        that abused dog commercial, 
                        remember? I had to bring you a box 
                        of Kleenex. You’re not terrible, 
                        babe. You’re my lady. 

           He turns around and kisses her, leans his forehead on hers.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        You’re just having feelings because 
                        this is stressful and nerve-
                        wracking. But everything’s going to 
                        work out great. Trust me.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Babe? If I told you something --

           A LOUD CRASH as the HEAVY WINDOW they propped open in the 
           shower stall SLAMS SHUT -- 
           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           Emulating the brain surgeon’s sexy arrogance, Esperanza 
           pretends to hold a stethoscope in one hand as he flips an 
           omelette with the other.  

           His fun is interrupted by the LOUD THUMPING SOUND from 
           upstairs. Esperanza looks upstairs towards the NOISE.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michelle and Brett HEAR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS coming. 

           He doesn’t have much time. Brett WRESTLES to PULL his wrists 
           apart -- the weakened zip tie finally gives way. Yes! His 
           hands are free. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Don’t forget to keep them behind 
                        you. Pretend they’re still hooked.

           The FOOTSTEPS get closer. 

           Brett puts his hands behind him. Michelle does too, 
           pretending like she’s still duct taped to the drawer handle.

           Eyes on the door, they brace themselves for impact -- 

                                 BRETT
                        Here we go.

           The door FLIES open. And Esperanza enters -- 

           Without his mask on.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        The fuck was that noise?

           No one says anything. Michelle and Brett fight the urge to 
           look at each other and confirm that they’re seeing what 
           they’re seeing.  

           Esperanza clocks their faces. He knows something’s up. 

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 BRETT
                        Nothing. We weren’t --

           But Brett sputters out, not actually saying anything -- he’s 
           doing mental math; is it in his best interest to say 
           something or to not say something... 
           But before he can decide, Esperanza CATCHES his own unmasked 
           REFLECTION in the MIRROR. 

           He looks mad and very disappointed in himself. Now he knows 
           what Brett and Michelle know. 

                                 MICHELLE
                             (damage control)
                        We’d never tell anyone. I promise. 
                        We won’t report any of this --

           An angry Esperanza DRAGS Brett up by his collar and PULLS him 
           from the room -- 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, ADJACENT TO MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Brett scrambles to get his legs under him, but he ends up 
           being more POTATO BAGGED out of the master closet and down 
           the hall than walking on his own volition.

                                 BRETT
                        Not so rough! Come on! 

           They take a corner and... THWACK!.. Brett’s shoulder takes 
           the FULL HIT of the WALL.  

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Mother fucker! You dislocated my 
                        shoulder. Fuck, man.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Before he left the closet, Esperanza SLAMMED the sliding door 
           closed behind him.  

           But he left before it actually latched. 

           It’s sliding on the rail fast, but Michelle’s faster. 

           Seizing her opportunity, she RACES for it -- 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Esperanza DRAGS Brett into the upstairs hall. 

           Once they’re a few corners away from Michelle, near the top 
           of the stairs, Esperanza drops Brett on the rug. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        What now, man? She saw my face. 
           Like two actors getting off stage, they take a second to 
           catch their breath. A worried Esperanza looks to Brett for 
           answers --

                                 BRETT
                        Don’t worry. It’s okay.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Nah, man. I think she’s on to us.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Michelle SPRINTS for the closet door. She’s only got seconds.

           She TRIPS over a pair of heels and GOES DOWN. 

           SPRAWLED FLAT on the FLOOR --

           She STICKS her arm out like she’s sliding to home base --

           THROWING her hand between the sliding door and the wall. 

           Her fingers get HAMMERED, CRUNCHING on impact. 

           But they STOP the door from closing and latching. 

           It hurts like a motherfucker -- Michelle SHOVES her duct 
           taped wrist in her mouth to stop from SCREAMING -- but she 
           did it.  

           With her hands now free (if a little swollen) and the door 
           wide open, Michelle CLIMBS to her feet. She RIPS the excess 
           duct tape from her hands and makes a RUN for it. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Michelle comes around the first corner. Coast is clear. Light 
           as a cat, she hurries down the hall toward the guest bedroom.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Without the neighbor’s motion activated lights, the room is 
           pretty dark.

           Michelle SCURRIES to the half open closet door and KNEELS 
           down in front of it. She PULLS the doors open, expecting to 
           lay her hands on the gun safe.   

           But the GUN SAFE is GONE. 

           All that is left is a square imprint in the carpet where the 
           gun safe used to be.

           Frightened and pale, Michelle looks up.  
           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Michelle comes out of the guest room and HURRIES down the 
           hall. As she passes the main staircase, she hears VOICES 
           rising up from the living room downstairs. 

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        -- this just got really fucked up.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        What? No. Nothing’s changed --

           Esperanza SCOFFS. Michelle stops dead still, listening. 

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        How can you say that? She knows who 
                        I am, man -- 

           CLOSE ON: Michelle’s face as she leans in closer to listen--

           INT. DEN - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           Esperanza paces, running his hands through this hair. Brett 
           stands, confident and assured. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        -- She’s seen me with the yard crew 
                        hundreds of time. 

                                 BRETT
                        She doesn’t look at the gardeners. 
                        She can’t tell you guys apart.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Racist, man.

                                 BRETT
                        I didn’t mean it like that. I meant 
                        Michelle’s in her own world. She 
                        doesn’t think about or really even 
                        notice other people. Especially 
                        lower... you know... staff people.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           CLOSE ON: Michelle’s face as she listens to her husband tell  
           a stranger who she is and who she isn’t.  

           INT. DEN - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           Esperanza won’t be appeased --  
                                 ESPERANZA
                        She’s going to turn me in. You got 
                        to tell her what’s going on. 

                                 BRETT
                        Look, everything’s fine. I got it 
                        all worked out. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Just tell her it’s just for 
                        insurance you know. That you hired 
                        me and --

                                 BRETT
                        I got it. Don’t worry. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        I don’t want to get arrested.

                                 BRETT
                        Nobody’s getting arrested, man. 

           Brett motions to calm-down. Esperanza notices that his hands 
           are freed.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Your zip ties are cut???

                                 BRETT
                        Yes, but it’s okay --

           Esperanza freaks out --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Are her ties cut too?

                                 BRETT
                        Yes, but --

           Esperanza pulls the gun from his waistband, worked up. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Then how do I know she’s not 
                        calling 911 right now?! Shit, man.

                                 BRETT
                        Because you have our phones, okay? 
                        Look, she’s locked in, sitting on 
                        the floor of the bathroom, scared 
                        out of her mind. She’s not fucking 
                        John McClane.

           Esperanza doesn’t know who that is and Brett is pissing him 
           off. He points the Glock at him, reasserting himself. 
                                 ESPERANZA
                        You are one smug, arrogant dude, 
                        man. I knew you were bad news.

                                 BRETT
                        Put that thing away --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        All grinning like a dirty monkey at 
                        the zoo saying anything to make it 
                        all right. Fuck that. 
                             (gets in his face)
                        You think I’m stupid, Mr. Fucker?

                                 BRETT
                        Stop waving the gun around, okay?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Then stop fucking with me, man! You 
                        got a plan here? Tell me.

           There’s a long moment here as Brett thinks, calculating his 
           best move -- 

                                 BRETT
                        It doesn’t matter if she’s seen 
                        your face --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        To you --

                                 BRETT
                        To either of us because she’s not 
                        going to tell anyone. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You don’t know that --

                                 BRETT
                        She’s not going to tell anyone 
                        because she’s not going to be able 
                        to tell anyone. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Huh? What are you saying?

                                 BRETT
                        Michelle’s not getting out of this 
                        house tonight.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You saying what I think you’re 
                        saying, man?
           How explicit does he have to be? Brett fights frustration.

                                 BRETT
                        If you think I’m saying I’m going 
                        to murder my wife tonight then, 
                        yeah, I’m saying what you think I’m 
                        saying, man.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           ON MICHELLE: hearing these words said aloud. She looks across 
           the hall at the wall of photos of her and Brett.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARTY HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DUSK - FLASHBACK

           TITLE CARD: Chapter Two -- “For Richer, for Poorer.”

           Michelle, hair back in a ponytail, wears a white button up 
           shirt and a wee little bow tie. She walks through the CROWD 
           with a plate of hors d oeuvres. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Excuse me. Watch your back, please.

           She weaves through the packed room with real finesse. She’s 
           got an MFA in dodging elbows and glasses of red wine.

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Got any cocktail weenies on there?

           She’s annoyed, but voila... when she turns around she’s got 
           her professional happy smile plastered on her face. 

           Brett stands there in a suit and tie, looking very handsome 
           and very attentive. In a room where everyone’s trying to 
           catch the eye of someone more important, Michelle’s not used 
           to the undivided attention. She likes it.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        No cocktail wienies, but I could 
                        probably scrounge you up some pork 
                        rinds.  

                                 BRETT
                        Mmmm.
                             (motions to the floor to 
                              ceiling windows and the 
                              patio beyond)
                        You allowed to go see the view? 
                        ‘Cuz it’s sunset right now and it’s 
                        pretty fucking rad.
                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh, I’m sorry. I can’t go anywhere 
                        with anyone who says ‘rad.’ Sorry.

           He smiles. She smiles. 

           A big MAN clears off Michelle’s platter of spring rolls 
           without even acknowledging her. Reminded that she’s invisible 
           and unimportant, Michelle watches as the big man toddles off--

                                 BRETT
                        It’s his cheat day.

           EXT. PARTY HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - DUSK - FLASHBACK

           Michelle and Brett stand on the edge of the patio, watching 
           the sun set over LA. 

                                 BRETT
                        Never gets old. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You like LA?

                                 BRETT
                        Love it! 

           She looks skeptical.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Look down there -- all those 
                        people, all their dreams -- 
                        everybody down there is here for 
                        some reason, some dream that was 
                        bigger than their fear. How can you 
                        not love this town? This is a city 
                        made entirely of dreamers.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um... except the natives. 

                                 BRETT
                        Are there any? Really?

                                 MICHELLE
                        So what’s your dream? From your 
                        irrepressible optimism, I’m 
                        guessing eccentric chocolate 
                        factory owner or rocket ship man.  

                                 BRETT
                        Me? I want to be -- happy. 
                        Ridiculously, every day, 
                        deliriously happy.
           This is strangely profound and not the answer Michelle was 
           expecting. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I got to get more canapes.

           She walk aways, then turns around, inspired.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Hey?

           Brett takes his eyes off the sunset for her.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I want your number.

                                 BRETT
                        Yes!

           INT. WEDDING VENUE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The floor is cleared for the first dance. Michelle and Brett 
           take center stage.

                                 MICHELLE
                             (under her breath)
                        Ready?

                                 BRETT
                        You bet. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        I introduce to you Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Hardwick!

           GROVER WASHINGTON JR.’S “JUST THE TWO OF US” starts up and 
           Brett and Michelle begin to dance as the CROWD CLAPS.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You should have to blow a blood 
                        alcohol level before you get to 
                        make a wedding toast.

                                 BRETT
                        You talking about your mom or Jake?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Both. By the way, who’s brilliant 
                        idea was it to have “The Groom” 
                        make his own toast? Couldn’t 
                        someone have written him something 
                        to say? 
                                 BRETT
                        Guy’s a cash cow. He can make a 
                        long, drunk, unfunny toast at my 
                        wedding all day long. We rich, 
                        baby. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I wish we’d picked a different 
                        song. You know what I wanted. 

                                 BRETT
                        “Close My Eyes Forever” Ozzy 
                        Ozborne and Lita Ford?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yep. Or that Calliou song. 

                                 BRETT
                        Another good choice. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I want more cake. 

           He twirls her. 

                                 BRETT
                        I put dibbs on the third tier. 
                        We’re taking that shit to the hotel 
                        room. 

           She smiles at him, completely in love. 

           EXT. MACHU PICCHU - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Brett stands dangerously close to the ledge. Michelle takes a 
           picture of him. 

                                 BRETT
                        I look good?

           She shrugs.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Take another.

           He strikes the same pose, like he’s going to eat the world. 
           Michelle takes the picture.

                                 MICHELLE
                        This one’s hot. 

           Brett comes over and looks at it. 
                                 BRETT
                        Boom! Post it.

           They kiss. Michelle sneaks a picture of them kissing to post 
           later. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Happy anniversary, babe. 

           He swoops her up in his arms and YELLS, king of the world --

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           -- his YELL cuts off so abruptly that the silence is 
           deafening. You can hear the FURNACE kicking on and the SURF 
           in the far distance. 

           Michelle takes her eyes off photos of them in Machu Picchu 
           and them at their wedding and them doing fucking everything 
           together for the past eleven years. She presses on her eyes 
           with her palms.  

           And takes a big breath. She’s got to keep her shit together. 

           VOICES drift up from below -- 

           INT. DEN - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           Brett paces. 

                                 BRETT
                        Michelle’s not going to turn you in 
                        because Michelle’s going to be 
                        dead. There. Okay? That’s the plan. 
                        I told you not to worry about it.   

           Everything is quiet. Then the outside sprinklers come on. RAP-
           TAP-TAPPING on the window when they rotate past.   

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Fuck. That’s dark.

                                 BRETT
                        I’m going to do it after you’re 
                        long gone. Then I’ll call the cops 
                        and give them a description of the 
                        intruder and I’ll say he’s like 
                        five foot eight and Asian. Maybe 
                        I’ll say he spoke with a thick 
                        Malaysian accent. 
                             (misreading Esperanza’s 
                              incredulous look)
                        I’ve got a good ear for accents. 
                        They’ll believe me.

                             (back on track)
                        All they’ll know is that there 
                        really was someone here in the 
                        house -- they’ll see your 
                        bootprints and our bruises -- and 
                        they’ll know that it wasn’t me. 
                        Case closed. My wife was killed by 
                        a masked intruder.
                             (pause)
                        Who I think was Asian and had a 
                        thick Malaysian accent.  

           A beat as Esperanza thinks it over. Then with certainty --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Nope. Fuck this. I’m outta here.

           Esperanza turns and starts to WALK OUT of the house --

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           CLOSE ON: Michelle looks panicked. 

           INT. FOYER - NIGHT - INTERCUT

           Brett goes after Esperanza -- 

                                 BRETT
                        Wait! Hear me out --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        I don’t like your wife, but I’m not 
                        down with killing her. 

           Esperanza drops the file box in the foyer and opens the door. 

           Brett turns on his salesman mode. There’s not much difference 
           between him and the guy at a used car lot in Van Nuys -- he’s 
           desperate and improvising and somehow managing to sell it.

                                 BRETT
                        That’s why I didn’t tell you in the 
                        first place, okay? I don’t want you 
                        to be part of it, Esperanza. I want 
                        you to have no part in it. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        But when you say, ‘a masked gunman 
                        did this,’ I’m that masked gunman. 
                        If it ever came back to me, I’m the 
                        one going down for it. No way, man. 
                        I’m an actor.

           Brett tries to look earnest and baffled.
                                 BRETT
                        I would never let you take the fall 
                        for it. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You absolutely would.

           Esperanza opens the front door. 

                                 BRETT
                        Wait, Esperanza!

           Brett closes the door and this pisses Esperanza off. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        What can I offer you to finish this 
                        up? We just got to go empty the 
                        safe and then you can go, okay? The 
                        safe’s got all the truly valuable 
                        stuff that I need stolen and out of 
                        the house, okay? So let’s just go 
                        empty it?
                             (beat)
                        Then your part’s done. You can go. 

           The SPRINKLERS RAP-TAP-TAP along the bay window again.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You over water your cacti. 

                                 BRETT
                        You want more money? I have more 
                        money. I’ll double your price. 
                        Triple it. How about forty 
                        thousand? It’s right upstairs in 
                        the safe. Let’s just go get it.
                             (a beat)
                        Come on. 

           On Esperanza, thinking, slowly coming around. Brett should 
           just stay quiet and wait, but he’s the type that can’t help 
           but try to seal the deal -- 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        More money than you’ve seen in your 
                        entire life, man. 

           This sets Esperanza off -- 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You don’t know that. That’s another 
                        racist assumption. My dad was an 
                        orthodontist! 
                                 BRETT
                        Oh, okay. Sorry. My bad.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You’ve lied to me. I can’t trust 
                        you. Fuck you. 

                                 BRETT
                        How about I help you carry the 
                        stuff out? Then you can just go. 
                        Let’s just go empty the safe and -- 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        No, fuck that. I’m changing the 
                        plan. 

                                 BRETT
                        What does that mean?

           Esperanza PULLS a pair of hand cuffs out of his back pack and 
           before Brett knows what’s happening -- he HOOKS one to 
           Brett’s hand. 

           Fear flashes in Brett’s eyes. For the first time tonight, he 
           looks genuinely terrified.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? Stop! 

           Esperanza KICKS Brett’s legs out from under him, DROPPING him 
           to the ground. 

           He HOOKS the other handcuff to the leg of the oak desk, 
           trapping Brett. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        What is this? No. Don’t do this! 
                        What the fuck?!

           Leaving him handcuffed to the desk, Esperanza heads upstairs.

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Esperanza climbs the stairs two at a time. He checks out “The 
           Groom” poster from season one. Suddenly, he gets an idea.

                                 ESPERANZA

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Esperanza arrives in the upstairs hallway. We’re half scared 
           he’s going to catch Michelle sitting there listening -- 
           But she’s gone. The hallway is clear. 

           Esperanza BARRELS on toward the master bedroom. 

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Esperanza goes to unlock the closet door. He’s surprised to 
           find it unlocked. 

           He ROLLS the door back carefully, on high alert -- 

           But Michelle sits on the bathroom floor right where he left 
           her. 

           She’s got her hands behind her back, pretending they’re still 
           taped to the drawers. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You know the combo to the safe?

           She nods. Esperanza SCOOTS down next to Michelle. They both 
           know that the duct tape is already off.

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        You do this?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Come on. 

           He pulls her up, gentler than he’s been and leads her -- 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           -- into the master bedroom. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Where’s the safe?

           Michelle points to a painting on the far wall.

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Open it.

           Michelle SWINGS the landscape painting aside. Behind it is a 
           wall safe with a brass plated dial. 

           Michelle enters the numbers, but she messes up and has to 
           stop and start over.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sorry. I’m shaking.
           Esperanza waits as she enters the numbers. A CLICK deep 
           inside the safe, and the door SPRINGS open.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Step back.

           Michelle steps aside. Esperanza roots around in the safe. He 
           PULLS out a stack of cash. He tries to contain his excitement 
           -- he actually has never seen this much money in cash before.

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                             (to Michelle)
                        You got a bag or something I can 
                        use --?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sure.

           Michelle goes toward the master closet. Stops.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Is it okay if I go in here --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Yeah. Whatever.

           Michelle comes back with an empty Lululemon bag. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s Esperanza, right? I always try 
                        to remember people’s names. I was a 
                        caterer for years and a waitress. 
                        So I know what it’s like to be 
                        treated like you’re invisible.

           He scoffs. She’s trying too hard to bond. Esperanza shoves 
           the bag at her and motions with the gun.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Load it up. Don’t leave anything 
                        out. 

           Michelle FILLS the bag with the contents of the safe -- 
           jewelry, cash, the will.

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        Not the paperwork. I don’t want 
                        that crap.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh, okay, sure. 
           She starts to separate the contents. Papers stay in, JEWELRY 
           BOXES and CASH come out. She comes to a stack of bonds. 
           Confused what to do --

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Do you want these in or out?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        What are they?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Bonds.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        What’s that?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You know I don’t really know. 

           She LAUGHS. Tries to stop, but now that she’s started, she’s 
           finding it hard to reel it in. She just keeps LAUGHING. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Knock it off.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m sorry.
                             (puts her hand in her 
                              mouth)
                        It’s nerves.

           Esperanza looks at her like she’s crazy. He doesn’t know what 
           to do. Michelle sits down cross legged on the rug and fans 
           her face.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I’ve just got to calm down.

           But she’s still laughing and now crying too. She’s a hot 
           mess. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a long night. I’m sorry.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You done?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Just a second. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        It’s a chick thing.
                                 MICHELLE
                        You got a girlfriend?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        I’m not talking about it. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You do. I bet she’s pretty.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Don’t. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        What?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You don’t have to be fake.

                        I’m not being fake --

                        He’s going to kill you.

           Michelle’s got to play act like she’s surprised.

                        What?

                        No.

           Is he buying her acting?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh my God.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        I can make that not happen -- 

           He’s buying it.

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        But you got to give me something. 

           Michelle suppresses a real shudder, not acting anymore. 
                                 MICHELLE
                             (worried)
                        What?

           He almost doesn’t want to say it. But he finally mans up and 
           asks --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You got any say on who becomes “The 
                        Groom?”

           Michelle’s eyes light up, relieved. She nods 
           enthusiastically. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. Yes, I do.

           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           Handcuffed to the desk, Brett tries to lift it and slide his 
           handcuffed wrist out from under. 

           But he can’t lift the whole desk with one arm which is what 
           he’d have to do in order to slide the handcuffed hand out 
           from under the leg. He’s stuck.

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck. This is bad. 

           Outside, through the sliding glass kitchen door, he sees the 
           green glow-in-the-dark alien sticker. 

           Brett looks closer, SQUINTING -- the gun safe is outside on 
           top of a pile of miscellaneous valuables Esperanza has 
           collected from around the house. This is Esperanza’s take 
           away pile. And Brett’s got to get to it.  

           Brett thinks, realizing something -- 

           He can’t lift the desk, but he can maybe slide it.

           A hand on each desk leg, Brett SHOVES using the power of his 
           legs to move it. The desk begrudgingly MOVES. 

           Brett looks hopeful: it’s not going to be speedy, but it’ll 
           get the job done.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michelle’s regained her composure. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m an executive producer.
                                 ESPERANZA
                        At Mavern?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes, at Mavern. I can have a say in 
                        who gets cast. I’ve never got in 
                        there, but I have the right too. 
                        Absolutely. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        So, you think I’m handsome enough?

                                 MICHELLE
                        For sure.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Yeah?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. You’ve got a nice strong jaw.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Fuck. You’re just saying all this 
                        ‘cuz of the situation.

                                 MICHELLE
                        No way! When you used to work in 
                        the yard, I thought it. 

           It came out like flirting which she didn’t intend. It’s made 
           both of them uncomfortable.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                             (recovering)
                        We’ll have to round out your story 
                        a bit you know --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Huh?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You know -- give you something 
                        distinctive. Like we could make you 
                        the owner of the landscaping 
                        business. Call you an 
                        “entrepreneur.”

                                 ESPERANZA
                        But I’m not the owner.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I know that. It’s all kind of half 
                        truths. 
                                 ESPERANZA
                        What is?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um... the show. The “grooms”?

           Esperanza looks confused. A phone RINGS. He pulls Michelle 
           and Brett’s cell phones from his pocket but they’re not 
           ringing. 

           He tosses them in the Lululemon bag and opens his back pack. 

           It’s his phone that’s RINGING. He checks out the caller ID 
           and then answers. Michelle eyes his gun, left unattended.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Yeah?
                             (listens)
                        Give me a minute.

           Michelle inches her hand toward the Glock. Esperanza grabs 
           Michelle’s arm not noticing how dangerously close she’s come 
           to grabbing the gun -- 

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        Come with me.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Esperanza pushes Michelle back in the bathroom and LOCKS the 
           sliding wood door.

           Frustrated and jacked on adrenaline, Michelle SMASHES a jar 
           of face cream in the sink.

           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           Brett, flushed, his brow covered in sweat has PUSHED the oak 
           desk out of the den and into the spacious kitchen. 

           His progress is kind of amazing and he looks at how far he’s 
           come, proud of himself. 

           Just a little bit further to go. 

           Brett starts at it, HEAVING the two desk legs out in front of 
           him. Crawling along behind, doing something like mountain 
           climbers, he uses his legs to PUSH the desk along the tile 
           floor.  

           Then he hears a GUN COCKING near his ear --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        What the fuck are you doing?
           Esperanza has snuck up on him.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Esperanza throws Brett into the bathroom with Michelle. And 
           closes the closet door with a SLAM and LOCKS it. 

           Michelle strains to listen, but she can’t hear his footsteps 
           receding. 

                                 BRETT
                        Slight wrinkle --

           Michelle puts her finger to her lips, silently shushing him. 
           She points to the door. Cups her ear. He’s listening to us.

           Brett nods. He gets it. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                             (loud; for show)
                        I’m going to help him load 
                        everything in his car and then 
                        he’ll be gone. 

           Fuck. Can she really trust anything Brett’s telling her? 
           Brett looks like he’s scared, but is he just pretending. 

           Unsure if Esperanza’s within earshot or not, Michelle plays 
           along.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        Great. 

           Then they hear HEAVY THINGS MOVING down below in the kitchen. 
           They can speak freely.

                                 BRETT
                        Fuck, he’s so loud. The neighbor’s 
                        going to hear him. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Powalski? 

                                 BRETT
                        We’ll find out the guy’s an arms 
                        dealer with a Rambo complex. He’s 
                        going to come out shooting a flame 
                        thrower. 

           He’s funny. Her husband. Michelle looks sad. She tears up.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Babe, what is it?
           She shakes her head. She can’t. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a long night, huh?
                             (then)
                        It’s almost over now.

           This has a heavy connotation for Michelle. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        The gun safe in the guest room is 
                        gone.

                                 BRETT
                        I know. I saw it outside by the 
                        sliding door. He’s got it stacked 
                        with all the other stuff he’s 
                        taking. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You tell him about it?

                                 BRETT
                        About what?

                                 MICHELLE
                        The gun safe.

                                 BRETT
                        No. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Then how did he know about it?

                                 BRETT
                        I don’t know. He probably saw it.

           Michelle doesn’t look convinced. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        What? Am I that good of an actor? 

           Ever the optimist, Brett plugs ahead --

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        So here’s what we’re going to do -- 
                        when he comes back, I’ll wrestle 
                        him to the ground and you grab his 
                        gun.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t like that plan.
                                 BRETT
                        Alternately, I can wrestle him. You 
                        can run down the stairs through the 
                        whole house, go outside, open the 
                        gun safe, run back in, and come all 
                        the way back up here. Let’s just 
                        hope I’m still alive. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You remember the beetroot chocolate 
                        cake?

                                 BRETT
                        What?

                                 MICHELLE
                        From our wedding?

                                 BRETT
                        Of course. It was fucking 
                        delicious. Why are you thinking of 
                        that now?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know. 
                             (beat)
                        Why don’t we eat dessert anymore?

                                 BRETT
                        Carbs?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m serious.

                                 BRETT
                        I was being serious. I don’t know. 
                        Hey, are you okay? You sure you’re 
                        up to this?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. 

           She knows she shouldn’t. She tries to stop herself. But she 
           can’t hold her tongue -- 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I know you saw a divorce lawyer.

                                 BRETT
                        What?
                                 MICHELLE
                        Don’t lie. Hamm and Guilford? Their 
                        number showed up on the cell phone 
                        bill. A lot.

           Brett starts laughing.

                                 BRETT
                        You’re right. I did call them. A 
                        lot. For research. Jesus, Michelle. 
                        We’re thinking of doing a new show 
                        called “The Divorcee.”

                                 MICHELLE
                        Bullshit.

                                 BRETT
                        I told you about it.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You did not.

                                 BRETT
                        You’re having white wine amnesia. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Don’t be a prick. Own it. You want 
                        to divorce me. You want to leave me 
                        with nothing. You want to send me 
                        back to some shitty little hole in 
                        North Hollywood -- 

                                 BRETT
                        No, where is all of this --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Then why do we still have the pre-
                        nup? It’s right out there in the 
                        safe. Let’s just go rip it up. 
                        Right now. It would just make 
                        everything better --

                                 BRETT
                        You know what I love about you? 
                        You’re beautiful and unpredictable 
                        and fun. But fuck if you aren’t a 
                        gaping, unfillable hole of 
                        insecurity. It’s been eleven years. 
                        How long is it going to take for 
                        you to know I love you? 

           She doesn’t know if she should believe him or not. 
                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        I’m all in. For richer and poorer. 
                        In sickness and health. All of it, 
                        okay? 

           He’s convincing her, but then he goes and pushes it too far.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Til death do us part.

           Michelle’s eyes narrow, suspicious. They hear Esperanza’s 
           heavy FOOTSTEPS coming towards them.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        We good?
                             (beat)
                        Michelle? We going to do this?

           Making up her mind --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes. Let’s do it.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, ADJACENT TO MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Esperanza unlocks the closet door and slides it open. It’s 
           only open a foot or two when -- 

           Brett ATTACKS.

           Like an unsuspecting quarterback being SACKED by an offensive 
           lineman, Esperanza FLIES backward --

           And HITS the floor of the master bedroom -- 

           Everything in his hands goes FLYING. 

           In the dark room, it’s hard to see if there was a gun or not.  

           Michelle SCRAMBLES around, searching for the missing gun --

           Meanwhile, Brett climbs atop Esperanza, taking pleasure in 
           PUMMELING him. 

           Michelle can’t find the fucking gun anywhere.

           Was it ever even here?

           Esperanza grabs Brett’s face, TWISTING his jaw.

                                 BRETT
                        Get the gun, Michelle!

           She CRAWLS around the bed, pawing the carpet. No gun. 
                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s not here!

           Locked in a life and death fight, Brett looks at Michelle. 
           And she looks at him. They’re both panicked.

           Plan B time.

           Without having to say a word to each other, Michelle gets up 
           and takes off RUNNING as fast as she can for the gun safe --

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Michelle RUNS toward the stairs. She’s running so fast she 
           KNOCKS into things, CLIPS corners. 

           Picture frames SMASH to the floor in her wake.

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Michelle FLIES down the stairs. 

           As she WHIPS by “The Groom” poster, it blows back to center. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Michelle RACES for the sliding glass door --

           SCOOTING around the oak desk that is inexplicably in the 
           center of the kitchen, she SLIDES the glass door open so hard 
           it REBOUNDS on her -- 

           EXT. PATIO - HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Michelle PAWS through the pile of loot -- jewelry and cuff-
           links and silver letter openers --

           She finds the GUN SAFE.

           Her hands SHAKE. She PLUGS in the numbers --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Zero. Nine. One. Seven. Zero. 
                        Eight.

           The gun safe POPS open --

           Michelle is elated and flooded with relief.

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Still FIGHTING, Brett and Esperanza come CRASHING down the 
           stairs. 
           “The Groom” poster is KNOCKED off the wall and over the 
           railing. 

           It EXPLODES on impact. 

           GLASS SHARDS fly everywhere. 

           Brett and Esperanza ROLL to the bottom of the staircase.

           Brett gets his legs under him first.

           He GRABS Esperanza’s head and SMASHES it hard on the 
           banister.

           This pisses Esperanza off. He rears like a RAM and -- 

           CLOBBERS Brett into the wall, making a Brett sized hole. 
           Plaster crumbles, showering them both with powder.

           Michelle RUNS into the room --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Stop!

           SKIDDING to a stop in her bare feet, she has a Colt 38 
           pointed at them.  

           Without thinking, Esperanza SWATS it out of her hands.

           And the GUN goes SKITTERING 

           Across the floor

           SPINNING 

           Up for grabs

           It comes to a stop near 

           BRETT 

           With lightning fast reflexes, he LUNGES for it. 

           But Michelle is right there too. She lies her hand on his, 
           GRIPPING like a vise. 

           Brett looks at her. She looks at him. Steely. 

           Esperanza’s almost there, ready to throw his big, meaty paw 
           in the mix too.

           Brett and Michelle LOCK eyes. 

           His say, “give it to me.”
           Hers say, “I’m not letting go.”  

           Brett relents and releases hold, letting Michelle come up 
           with the GUN. 

           Michelle holds it out in front of her in the general 
           direction of both Esperanza and Brett. 

           She’s twitchy, on high alert for any quick movements. 

           Esperanza, realizing the seriousness of the situation, PUTS 
           his hands up in the air.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Don’t shoot me. This was all his 
                        idea. I’m just an actor.

                                 BRETT
                        You just tried to legit kill me.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        You attacked me first.

                                 BRETT
                        Yeah ‘cuz you handcuffed me to my 
                        desk -- and dislocated my shoulder-- 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Brett, stop. I want to hear what he 
                        has to say.

           Brett falls back.  

                                 ESPERANZA
                        This all started a couple of months 
                        back. I had an audition for Brett’s 
                        show --

                                 BRETT
                             (interjects)
                        For a waiter on the special date 
                        weekend.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        He remembered I used to work on 
                        your yard. 

                                 BRETT
                        Can I butt in here? I want to 
                        clarify this sequence of events--

                                 MICHELLE
                        God damnit, Brett! Let him talk.
           Brett looks stung by the tone of Michelle’s voice. He throws 
           his hands up in the air, exasperated. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        A few weeks later he calls and says 
                        he wants to get a drink. I didn’t 
                        think anything of it you know -- 

                                 BRETT
                        He didn’t get the role by the way. 
                        He stared straight into the lens. 
                        Real professional. 
                             (to Esperanza)
                        UCB should refund your money.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        -- At drinks, he says he has a job 
                        for me. And that’s where it 
                        started. He told me about the pre-
                        nup you made him sign and how he’s 
                        short on cash --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Well, he lied. He’s the one made me 
                        sign a pre-nup. A long one.

                                 BRETT
                        It was the Mavern lawyers, 
                        Michelle! I told you --

                                 MICHELLE
                        You own Mavern, asshole!

           Brett looks at Michelle, surprised at her vitriol. Is she 
           acting or is she actually upset with him? 

                                 ESPERANZA
                             (to Michelle)
                        But you’re a boss there too, right?

                                 BRETT
                        Michelle?! 
                             (scoffs)
                        No way.

                                 ESPERANZA
                             (to Michelle)
                        But you said you were the corporate 
                        producer. You said you could help 
                        me --

                                 MICHELLE
                        I can.
                                 BRETT
                        With what? Michelle, what’s going 
                        on? When were you two talking?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I want to hear the rest of 
                        Esperanza’s story. Go on. You were 
                        having drinks with my husband...

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Um... okay... that’s where he hired 
                        me to come here tonight and break 
                        in your home and steal things -— he 
                        said it was for insurance. 

                                 BRETT
                        That part is true.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        But then tonight I find out that 
                        all of this, the break in, the 
                        robbery, the duct tape, and zip 
                        ties and whatever -- it’s all so 
                        that he can kill you. 

           Michelle likes how the GUN feels in her hand. She AIMS it at 
           Esperanza and then Brett. She likes the fear in their eyes.

                                 BRETT
                        I told him that, but you know why.

                                 ESPERANZA
                             (confused)
                        Why?

           Michelle looks at Brett. Steely. It’s unnerving. He starts 
           feeling uncomfortable. 

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        Why? Someone tell me.

           But Michelle holds eye contact with Brett. She doesn’t blink, 
           doesn’t give an inch. Brett starts to sweat.

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        What the hell’s going on here?

                                 BRETT
                        You’re not doubting me, are you, 
                        babe?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You sounded pretty fucking 
                        convincing, babe.
                                 ESPERANZA
                        He set this all up to get away with 
                        murder -- your murder. But I 
                        stopped his plan. I saved your 
                        life. And we got our own deal now, 
                        right?

                                 BRETT
                        Um? What deal? What’s he talking 
                        about, Michelle?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        -- I did my part and now... you’ve 
                        got the gun now, Mrs. Hardwick. You 
                        got the power. He doesn’t.

                                 BRETT
                        Michelle? You’re kind of freaking 
                        me out --

           As Brett and Esperanza have been campaigning, speaking over 
           each other, Michelle’s calmed down -- 

           Calmed down so much, that it’s almost as if something inside 
           her has been turned off completely. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Michelle? Babe? Look at me.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Everything I’ve told you is the 
                        truth. You got to believe me, Mrs. 
                        Hardwick. 

           She looks him square in the eye. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I believe you. Sorry. 

           Then Michelle PULLS the TRIGGER -- 

           It’s LOUD and fucking jarring as hell

           -- she SHOOTS Esperanza. 

           And he FALLS to the cold tile floor. Dead. 

           And then there’s a moment where there’s no sound and where 
           nothing moves -- except the PLUME of smoke coming from 
           Michelle’s gun.  

           The world’s on pause. The whole world has stopped rotating.
           And then, inconceivably, Michelle, shaky and full of flooded 
           with endorphins, laughs.  

           A mist of blood splatter speckles her night shirt and her 
           face almost like summer freckles, but it doesn’t bother 
           Michelle. Endorphins course through her veins, flooding her.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. Wow. 

           She shakes off energy, jogging in a little circle, attempting 
           to discharge some of her super-charged energy.

           Brett watches her. He looks thrilled that she’s happy.

           He puts a hand up in the air.  

           For a second it looks weird. His arm outstretched up in the 
           air. What the heck is he doing? 

           But then, incredibly, Michelle HIGH FIVES him. 

                                 BRETT
                        Happy anniversary, babe.

           He smiles. She smiles back. And they kiss.

           Then the entire evening REWINDS -- 

           EXT. MALIBU HILLS - NIGHT

           In a stylized, REVERSE TIME LAPSE, the fog thins and LIFTS 
           and ROLLS back out to the ocean.

           The LIGHTS in the houses on the Malibu hillside COME BACK ON 
           to an earlier and simpler part of the evening when people 
           were walking dogs and watching TV. Porch LIGHTS and living 
           room LIGHTS and LAMPS -- FLICK on all over the dark hill like 
           little kernels of popcorn popping.

           The MOON in the sky jogs backward across the night sky from 
           west to east. 

           Then, just as abruptly as it started, the REWINDING stops and 
           our evening begins to play forward again in real time. 

           EXT. ROAD - MALIBU HILLS - NIGHT

           TITLE CARD: Chapter Three: “‘Til Death Do Us Part”

           An orange Nova drives up the road toward the HARDWICKS' gated 
           house. 
           INT. NOVA - NIGHT 

           Esperanza drives. He points to the Hardwick’s house as it 
           comes into view. 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        That’s the one.

           He’s not alone in the car -- GREG BAXTER (28) sits in the 
           passenger seat. Like Hannibal Buress, Greg is a nerdy, 
           stocky, black guy with glasses. He’s got his name stenciled 
           on his blue work shirt. 

                                 GREG
                        Wow. 

           Esperanza parks in a dirt turnout and turns off the ignition. 
           They sit in silence for a minute.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Oh, check this out. 

           Esperanza shows Greg 10,000 dollars in cash he’s been keeping 
           under the driver’s seat.

                                 GREG
                        Jesus. You should really put that 
                        in the bank. Buy bonds or 
                        something.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        This is only half of it. I get the 
                        rest after.

                                 GREG
                        But think about it -- isn’t half 
                        for doing nothing -- better than 
                        all of it for doing something 
                        dangerous and stupid?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        No, ‘cuz it’d only be half. And 
                        it’s not dangerous or stupid. It’s 
                        just a job. 

                                 GREG
                        Got to be the weirdest acting job I 
                        ever heard of, man. Why can’t he 
                        just tell his wife what he’s doing? 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        He doesn’t want her to know he’s 
                        having money troubles.  
                                 GREG
                        I feel bad for her. Can you imagine 
                        how scared she’s going to be waking 
                        up with you all standing there 
                        looking like the fucking Night 
                        Stalker? Fuck. Not cool.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Don’t feel bad for her. She’s a 
                        terrible person. 
                             (off Greg’s look)
                        I ever tell you what she did to me? 
                        I was working in the yard and I had 
                        to pee real bad, right? I didn’t 
                        just want to go in the bushes ‘cuz 
                        like what if she saw me. And I 
                        didn’t want to go hide somewhere 
                        and have her find me with like my 
                        dick in my hand.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        So, I’m like I’m a person, she’s a 
                        person, I’m just going to go to the 
                        front door and knock and ask if I 
                        can come in and use her toilet 
                        please. So I do. And she says no. 

           Greg nods, waiting for more. 

                                 ESPERANZA (CONT’D)
                        She says there’s a gas station down 
                        on PCH. She says go down there.  

           Greg’s not as offended on Esperanza’s behalf as Esperanza 
           wants him to be. 

                                 GREG
                        Sounds like you still got some 
                        emotion around this, Eddie --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        No, I’m just saying the toilet was 
                        right there! I could literally see 
                        it from the front door -- stupid 
                        little Buddha on it. She’s just a 
                        bad person, man.

           Long pause. The night’s super quiet. 
                                 GREG
                        I don’t get why he can’t just leave 
                        all his valuables out in a box for 
                        you? 

                                 ESPERANZA
                        It’s got to look legit. Insurance 
                        investigators are super smart. 

                                 GREG
                        Hmmm. Something just doesn’t seem 
                        right. You should back out, Eddie --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        I can’t. This guy’s kind of a big 
                        deal. I think tonight’s sort of an 
                        audition. 

                                 GREG
                        You didn’t say that! Year one at 
                        UCB and look at all the work you’re 
                        up for. Taco Bell manager? You got 
                        a callback. Gang member four? You 
                        almost got a line. It’s incredible. 
                        Seriously, Eddie. Good job. So 
                        what’s this one for? A commercial 
                        or something? 

                                 ESPERANZA
                             (evading)
                        Nah, a show. One of those reality 
                        ones I think.

                                 GREG
                        Which one? I watch all of them.
                        “Survivor?” That’s the best one by 
                        a mile.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        I think it’s called “The Groom.”

                                 GREG
                        Oh, shit! I love that one. “Jake: 
                        NASA astronaut --

                                 ESPERANZA AND GREG
                        -- and Olympian.”

           Esperanza’s waiting for Greg to make fun of him, but he 
           doesn’t.
                                 GREG
                        You’d make a cool groom, man. It’s 
                        time they cast a Latino. We got to 
                        get an Ortiz in the White House.

           Fist bump. Greg is energized now.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so how can I help? Want to 
                        improv? Get into character?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Nah, just be my back up. Stay here 
                        and you know if I’m not back by --
                             (checks his watch)
                        -- like three a.m. just check on me 
                        or something, okay? 

                                 GREG
                        You got it.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Shit. It’s time. I got to get 
                        inside.

                                 GREG
                        Hey, take that resentment at the 
                        lady for not letting you use her 
                        toilet. Take that and use it. 
                        Channel that anger into your 
                        character.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Okay.

                                 GREG
                        You’re a heartless home invader.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Okay. 

                                 GREG
                        Fuck that lady. And fuck her baby 
                        Buddha.  

           Esperanza grabs a black back pack from the back seat. 

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Duct tape, gloves, a gun and shit. 
                                 GREG
                             (not okay)
                        Oh.

                                 ESPERANZA
                        Wish me luck, man. 

           They fist bump again in a half-ironic way. Then Esperanza 
           exits the car and runs across the road to the pedestrian 
           gate. He opens it and disappears into the yard.

           A worried Greg sits in the car, watching him until he’s gone. 

           He looks around anxiously. It’s very dark here in Malibu.

           Down the road, headlights come around the bend. Greg ducks 
           down in his seat. 

           And the Hardwick’s Tesla drives past him.  

           The gate ROLLS OPEN and Brett pulls into the driveway. Greg 
           HEARS the distorted words of “GUILTY” playing in the car.   

                                 BARBRA STREISAND AND BARRY GIBB
                        “Our love is one in a million --
                        Eyes can see that we got a highway 
                        to the sky --”

           As soon as their car is out of sight, Greg pops his head up.

           TIME LAPSE: the fog ROLLS in. And the house lights on the 
           hill GO OFF one by one as the evening gets later and later. 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE/INT. NOVA - NIGHT

           Greg, his eyes sort of glazed over with boredom and fatigue,  
           plays games on his phone as he watches the Hardwick’s house. 

           He fights off a yawn. He scratches an itch. 

           But then he hears a loud NOISE from the house. A THUD. A 
           window SLAMMING? Greg strains to hear more but there’s only 
           silence. He checks his watch: 2:19.

           Should he be worried?

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER:

           Greg wakes with a start. He fell asleep. What happened? He 
           checks the time: 3:07.
           Anxious and ready to go, he texts Esperanza -- Everything ok 
           in there? He grows impatient. Calls Esperanza. 

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        Yeah?

                                 GREG
                        It’s me. What’s going on in there? 
                        You okay? 

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        Give me a minute.

           Greg stays on the phone listening as there’s FOOTSTEPS, and 
           FABRIC MOVING, WOOD DOORS SLIDING SHUT and DEADBOLTS LOCKING.

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Okay, man. I’m back.

                                 GREG
                        Everything okay?

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        You’ll never believe it. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m going to be the new “Groom.”

                                 GREG
                        What?! That’s fantastic! You aced 
                        it.

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        Deal making, man. 

                                 GREG
                        I’m so proud of you. Well done.

                                 ESPERANZA (O.S.)
                        Okay, I got to go. Give me ten 
                        minutes and I’ll be out.

           Greg hangs up. 

           MINUTES LATER:

           Greg stares off in space when a COYOTE crosses the road. It 
           stops in the middle of the road, staring off in space too. 
           Then it locks eyes with Greg. A chill goes down his spine. 

           NOISES come from the house. RUNNING. VOICES. A SLIDING GLASS 
           DOOR SLAMMING SHUT.

           Greg sits up. The coyote TAKES OFF and Greg’s commune with 
           nature ends. 
           Greg looks around, suddenly feeling very exposed out here in 
           the janky Nova. Making up his mind, he gets out of the car 
           and walks toward the Hardwick’s house -- 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Greg gets to the pedestrian gate. Finds it locked. Fuck. He’s 
           nervous, but he CLIMBS the fence, officially trespassing now.  

           Greg walks on the trail of crushed shells to the back of the 
           house. His FOOTSTEPS sound THUNDEROUS to him. Greg opts to 
           walk on the dirt on the side of the trail. It’s much quieter. 

           EXT. PATIO - NIGHT

           Greg comes around the side of the house. It’s very dark back 
           here. 

                                 GREG
                             (whispering)
                        Eddie?

           As he gets closer to the sliding glass doors off the kitchen, 
           he sees the pile of loot stacked back here. In the dark, his 
           eyes focus in on the glow-in-the-dark alien sticker. It takes 
           him a second to realize it’s on an OPEN GUN SAFE -- 

           This is when Greg looks through the sliding glass door and 
           sees the strange tableau inside the house-- 

           Michelle, dressed only in a nightshirt, has a gun pointed at 
           Esperanza who is pleading for his life --

                                 ESPERANZA
                        -- I did my part and now... you’ve 
                        got the gun now, Mrs. Hardwick. You 
                        got the power. He doesn’t.

                                 BRETT
                        Michelle? You’re kind of freaking 
                        me out --

           Greg’s scared -- by the situation but also by the 
           impenetrable and icy expression on Michelle’s face.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Michelle? Babe? Look at me.

           Greg SEARCHES his pockets for his phone but he doesn’t have 
           it. It’s in the car.

                                 GREG
                             (sotto)
                        Shit.
                                 ESPERANZA
                        Everything I’ve told you is true. 
                        You got to believe me, Mrs. 
                        Hardwick. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I believe you. Sorry. 

           Michelle pulls the TRIGGER. 

           It’s LOUD and fucking JARRING as hell.

           Recoiling in horror, Greg DIVES out of sight. He listens, 
           breath jagged, scared out of his mind.

           Everything is PIN DROP QUIET. 

           Greg’s breath feels so LOUD he’s sure they can hear him 
           inside. 

           Have they already heard him? Are coming for him? Panic grips 
           him.

           But then Greg HEARS Michelle LAUGH, high on endorphins --

                                 MICHELLE  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. Wow. 

           He HEARS some RUNNING AROUND and then what SOUNDS like a HIGH 
           FIVE.  

                                 BRETT (O.S.)
                        Happy anniversary, babe.

           Greg hears Brett and Michelle KISS --  

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - INTERCUT

                                 BRETT
                        Better than Machu Picchu?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Fuck Machu Picchu. This is the best 
                        anniversary ever. I’m still 
                        shaking.

                                 BRETT
                        There were, swear to God, about ten 
                        times tonight when I didn’t know if 
                        it was all going to work out.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Me too. And when you were talking 
                        to him? I actually got worried. 
                                 BRETT
                        I was just saying whatever I could 
                        think of to get him to stay -- I 
                        kept hoping you’d come down with 
                        the gun.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You were very convincing. I almost 
                        believed you. 

                                 BRETT
                        Ha. That would’ve been a double 
                        twist. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ha. 

                                 BRETT
                        Should I call 911?

                                 MICHELLE
                        No. Wait. Just give me a second. I 
                        want to enjoy this. 

           But her good mood is turning somber --

           EXT. PATIO - NIGHT

           Greg looks up from his hiding place and assesses the 
           situation. It’s not great. He has to run back across the 
           patio -- right in front of the glass doors -- in order to get 
           away.

           Fuck.

           With no choice, Greg silently counts to three and makes a RUN 
           for it.

           But he TRIPS --

           Over the Lululemon bag full of cash and FALLS face first. 

           He lies there on the ground. Did they hear him?

           He’s got to know. 

           Mustering his nerve, Greg turns his head to the side and --

           Looks up at the house --

           Michelle comes to the glass door, gun in her hand. She looks 
           outside, searching the dark patio and wild hillside behind 
           the house. 
           But it’s so dark out, she’s partially blinded by her own 
           reflection in the nighttime window. 

           She doesn’t see Greg lying on the ground a few feet away. 

           Greg swallows hard, lying as flat and still as he can, not 
           moving. 

           Then two things happen simultaneously --

           One, Michelle turns around to go and -- 

           Two, a hillside coyote activates Powalski’s LIGHTS and they 
           KICK ON.

           Now it’s bright as fucking daylight back here.

           And Michelle sees Greg lying on the patio literally right in 
           front of her.

           And Greg sees her see him. 

           The gig’s up.

           It’s hard to tell who’s more shocked to see the other.

           Michelle fumbles with the gun, aims it at Greg and SHOOTS -- 

           The glass door SHATTERS and GLASS FLIES everywhere. 

           Shaking with fear, Greg stumbles to his feet and TAKES OFF 
           like a jack rabbit.

                                 BRETT
                        What the hell, Michelle?!

                                 MICHELLE
                        There’s some guy here. 
                             (then)
                        Grab a knife! 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Greg RUNS down the trail to the pedestrian gate.

           A barefoot maniac in hot pursuit, he hears Michelle’s FEET 
           POUNDING on the crushed shells behind him.

                                 MICHELLE
                             (over her shoulder; to 
                              Brett)
                        Hurry up, babe! Cut him off at the 
                        gate!
           Greg’s going to get cornered.

           Fuck.

           And just like that, like some miracle, or act of God, 
           Powalski’s lights FLICK off. And it’s completely dark again. 

           Greg exhales. He’s got half a chance now.

           But then BANG!

           A bullet WHIZZES past him, so close he feels the wind. 

           Michelle SHOOTS at him again. 

           BANG!

           GREG DIVES into the scraggly weeds of the hillside. 

           Forming a new escape plan, he SCRAMBLES up toward Powalski’s 
           house, trying to be as quiet as possible -- 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - YARD - NIGHT

           Out of breath, Brett catches up with Michelle on the lawn. 
           He’s brought a knife from the kitchen.  

                                 BRETT
                        You hit him?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know.

                                 BRETT
                        Where’d he go?

           They hear SIRENS. They’re faint and coming from far away, but 
           they’re coming.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. Did someone call 911? Fuck.

                                 MICHELLE
                        We got to get him. 

                                 BRETT
                        Or we just let him run --
                             (over her protestations)
                        Hear me out. We tell the cops there 
                        were two home invaders. And this 
                        one? -- he ran away.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He saw me shoot him.
                                 BRETT
                        So he’s lying! We say the opposite. 
                        But how’s it going to look that 
                        we’re hunting him down? Normal 
                        people don’t do that. Your attacker 
                        leaves, you just call the police, 
                        right? 

                                 MICHELLE
                        No.

                                 BRETT
                        So we just go running around the 
                        neighborhood with knives and guns, 
                        Michelle??? We don’t know where the 
                        fuck he is.

           They hear a RUSTLING from the hillside. 

           A clod of dirt ROLLS down. They look at each other --

           EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT 

           Greg SCRAMBLES up the hillside. 

           Getting CUT and SCRATCHED, his calloused hands GRAB hold of 
           whatever he can to pull himself up the steep incline.    

           EXT. POWALSKI’S PATIO - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Greg arrives on Powalski’s patio where an eternity pool 
           STEAMS in the night. There’s nice patio furniture and baskets 
           of thick, pristine white, cabana swim towels everywhere.  

           Greg steps toward the house and the motion activated LIGHTS 
           COME ON. Greg shields his eyes -- 

                                 POWALSKI (O.S.)
                        Stop right there!

           Greg THROWS his hands up in the hair.

           A figure comes forward from the shadows and the fog --

           It’s Mr. Powalski in his tattered blue robe. 

           He’s got stogie in his mouth and a SHOTGUN in his hands.  

           EXT. HILLSIDE BETWEEN THE HOUSES -- NIGHT

           In her bloody, dirt-covered night shirt, Michelle makes her 
           way up the scraggly, weedy hillside, cutting herself on all 
           the native vegetation.  
           Brett follows. He’s much better at hill climbing. Probably 
           because he has pants on. 

           But just as they start to make some time, the hillside is 
           suddenly lit from below in alternating BLUE and RED lights.   

           Brett turns and looks down. To his horror, he sees a police 
           car arriving on their little street.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        Come on -- 

           Michelle looks at Brett. They look up the hill and then back 
           down. 

           Making a decision, they redouble their efforts and PUSH on up 
           the hill --

           EXT. POWALSKI’S PATIO - NIGHT 

           Powalski pulls a shell from the pocket of his blue robe and 
           loads it into the chamber as he moves in on Greg. But then he 
           sees the dirt and blood and the abject fear in Greg’s eyes -- 

                                 POWALSKI
                        You okay, kid?  

                                 GREG
                        Help. They’re trying to kill me --

           Then, without warning and without malice, the SHOTGUN in 
           Powalski’s arms GOES OFF. 

           BLOOD SQUIRTS out of Greg’s side, staining his blue work 
           shirt red. 

           INT. COP CAR - NIGHT

           COP #1 hears the SHOTGUN BLAST and grabs his RADIO --

                                 COP #1
                        I’ve got a 10-57 here. Code 20. 

           EXT. POWALSKI’S PATIO - NIGHT

                                 GREG
                        You shot me! Why’d you shoot me?!

                                 POWALSKI
                        I’m sorry. This thing’s got a hair 
                        trigger. 

           Greg pulls up his shirt and assesses the damage. Powalski 
           winces at the sight of the wound. 
                                 POWALSKI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, geez.

           Greg inspects it. 

                                 GREG
                        It only grazed me. I’ll live.

                                 POWALSKI
                        I got a first aid kit somewhere...

           Powalski lumbers back toward the house.

                                 GREG
                        No, wait! You got to go flag down 
                        the cop. Get an ambulance for my 
                        friend.

           Powalski heads down the driveway. Stops.

                                 POWALSKI
                        Can you make it to the house on 
                        your own? You need a hand?

                                 GREG
                        I did two tours in Afghanistan.

                                 POWALSKI
                        I do HVAC. Should never have got a 
                        shotgun. I feel like a real jerk.

           Powalski is about to turn, but he sees something HEINOUS 
           CRAWLING up onto his patio out of the hillside --

                                 POWALSKI (CONT’D)
                        Brett? Michelle?

           They’re covered with blood and dirt. Brett puts his KNIFE 
           DOWN on a patio table in a friendly, neighborly gesture and 
           waves a small hello. 

           Michelle POINTS her GUN at Greg. He shakes with fear just 
           seeing her again --

                                 MICHELLE
                        He robbed us, Mr. Powalski. He’s a 
                        home invader. Like on the news.

                                 GREG
                        You’re lying!

                         MICHELLE
                                                      GREG (CONT'D)
           You’re lying!
                                              You shot at me!
           Powalski looks from Michelle to Greg. He has no idea what’s 
           going on here or whom to believe.

                                 POWALSKI
                        Look, I don’t want to get involved--

                                 GREG
                        You got to believe me. They set my 
                        friend up and then she shot him --

           Without knowing it, Powalski has his shotgun aimed ever so 
           slightly at Michelle and Brett. She clocks it. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You and that gardener tried to rob 
                        us and you know it --

                                 GREG
                        That “gardener” was Eddie Esperanza 
                        and he was my friend and one hell 
                        of an improv-er --

                                 BRETT
                        Who cares? You’re a thief. We’re 
                        just defending ourselves and our 
                        home from criminals. Powalski, you 
                        can see what’s going on here.  

           Now, Powalski’s got the shotgun aimed a little more at Greg. 
           Michelle smiles. 

                                 GREG
                        She shot Eddie like it was part of 
                        some game or something. She’s a 
                        lunatic psycho!

                                 MICHELLE
                        Any time a woman does anything not 
                        scripted she’s crazy, is that it?

                                 BRETT
                        Michelle, calm down. 
                             (taking charge)
                        Powalski sees what’s going on here. 
                        He’s going to help us, hon. 

           But Powalski’s not sure what’s going on. He HEARS a WOOP WOOP 
           and looks down at the street -- a second COP CAR arrives.

                                 POWALSKI
                        Okay, look. The police are here. 
                        They’ll sort this whole thing out -- 

           There’s a MUFFLED THUD and then -- 
           Powalski looks down at his belly. 

           There’s a GAPING HOLE where his gut used to be. He drops his 
           cigar and his shotgun, looking completely confused. 

           Michelle holds a cabana towel with a smoking hole in it as 
           her makeshift silencer. She moves in on Powalski --

                                 GREG
                        SWEET JESUS!

                                 BRETT
                        WHAT THE FUCK, MICHELLE?!

           Michelle SHOOTS Powalski again. This time in the head. 

           INT. SECOND COP CAR - ARRIVING - NIGHT 

           A MUFFLED POP somewhere in the foggy hills. COP #2 looks up 
           and over at COP #3.

                                 COP #2
                        You hear that?

           Another MUFFLED POP. He heard that. They grab their guns.

           EXT. POWALSKI’S PATIO - NIGHT

           Powalski goes down hard, DROPPING to his knees. His FACE 
           PLANTS on the cement with a WET THWACK. Greg whimpers. Brett 
           looks horrified --

                                 BRETT
                        What the fuck are you doing?!

           Greg puts his hands as high in the air as he can, 
           surrendering completely. He knows he’s next.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He didn’t believe us. I could tell. 

                                 BRETT
                        Because you should’ve let me do the 
                        talking. I’m good at bullshit --

           Brett looks down at the COP CARS converging on the street 
           below --

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        This is a big fucking mess, 
                        Michelle. Fuck!

                                 MICHELLE
                        There’s only one bullet left.
                                 BRETT
                        Okay.
                             (runs hands through hair)
                        Let me think.

           Seeing an in, Greg begs for his life --

                                 GREG
                        Please don’t use that bullet on me. 
                        Please. Don’t. I’m just a 
                        repairman. I just moved to LA. I 
                        had a dream to be a -- 

                                 BRETT
                        Don’t tell me about your dream! 
                        Stop talking!
                             (to Michelle; making up 
                              his mind)
                        Okay. You’re right, shoot him. This 
                        is our last chance before the cops 
                        get here. 

                                 GREG
                        No, please!

           Michelle looks down the hill and sees the squad cars parked 
           outside the gate of her house. The officers get out of the 
           cars, guns drawn. 

                                 MICHELLE
                             (sad, reflective)
                        We’re out of time, babe.

                                 BRETT
                        Then do it now. Hurry.

           But Michelle’s got bigger fish to fry than Greg --  

           She AIMS the GUN at Brett.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Um... what are you doing?
                             (confused)
                        Point that thing at him.

                                 MICHELLE
                        But I’ve only got one bullet left, 
                        babe, I got to use it on you.

                                 BRETT
                        Are you kidding me right now?!
                                 MICHELLE
                        Come on, did you really think I 
                        just arbitrarily decided I wanted 
                        to kill someone for my anniversary 
                        present this year? Come on, Brett.

           She wipes her eyes. Her nose is running.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want it to end like this 
                        but you gave me no choice.

                                 BRETT
                        What the fuck is happening right 
                        now --

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m really torn up about this, 
                        okay? I’ve been teary all night, 
                        wrestling back and forth with 
                        whether I should actually do it or 
                        not. This is really hard for me. 

                                 BRETT
                        For you? 

           She nods, crying.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        How are you able to spin it so that 
                        this is my fault? You’re pointing a 
                        gun at me.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’m not the one calling divorce 
                        lawyers. I’m not the one lording an 
                        obscenely long pre-nup over your 
                        head --

                                 BRETT
                        Always on about the fucking pre-
                        nup, Michelle --

                                 MICHELLE
                        I have the gun, I get to talk! 

           Greg checks on Powalski. He presses a beach towel to the back 
           of Powalski’s head while he checks for a pulse. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        You have no idea what it’s like 
                        knowing that my whole life could be 
                        taken away from me at any minute. 
                        I’ve got to do what’s best for me.

                        I’ve got to secure my future. Be 
                        smart about it. Be the hero of my 
                        own story --

                                 BRETT
                        You are hurting me so bad right 
                        now, Michelle. Do you have any idea 
                        how terrible you’re being? 

           Greg looks around for Powalski’s shotgun but doesn’t see it -- 
           it’s got to be UNDER POWALSKI.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        You asked me to set this up for 
                        you. You said you wanted to know 
                        what it felt like to kill someone. 
                        I did that for you! Do you know how 
                        sick that is? That’s how much I 
                        love you. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        When I heard you tell him you were 
                        going to kill me I had to worry 
                        that you’d had the same thought 
                        that I’d had, that you were 
                        planning the same thing I was 
                        tonight. That you were using the 
                        home invasion to get rid of me... 

                                 BRETT
                        Well, I wasn’t because I’m not a 
                        fucking sociopath --

                                 MICHELLE
                        It doesn’t matter. That’s not the 
                        point. It’s just -- I knew in that 
                        moment that I had to go through 
                        with this. 
                             (beat)
                        I have to get rid of you before you 
                        get rid of me. It’s the only way. 

           Michelle grabs a towel as a silencer and pulls the hammer 
           back.  

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        So just let me do this.  

           For the first time, Brett realizes that she’s really going to 
           do this --  

                                 BRETT
                        Stop. No. We can fix this, 
                        Michelle, okay?

                        I’ll rip up that pre-nup right now. 
                        I don’t give a shit.

           Brett’s got her attention --

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           COPS #1, #2 and #3 JUMP the fence and FAN OUT all over the 
           yard. 

           They MOVE at a fast clip, FEET POUNDING on the CRUSHED 
           SHELLS. FLASHLIGHTS and GUNS drawn. 

           Cop #1 finds the broken glass door off the kitchen.

                                 COP #1 
                        Over here!

           Cop #2 shines his flashlight inside, illuminating Esperanza’s 
           fallen body. 

                                 COP #2
                        We got one down. Call paramedics. 

           Cop #3 uses his RADIO to call for help. Cop #1 holds up the 
           ski mask he finds with white piping. A Glock sits under it. 

                                 COP #1
                        What the hell is going on here?

           EXT. POWALSKI'S PATIO - NIGHT

           Michelle’s got the gun leveled at Brett -- 

                                 BRETT
                        I’ll rip it up and we’ll forget 
                        this ever happened, okay? I forgive 
                        you for acting like a crazy person 
                        and plotting to murder me, okay? 
                        It’s behind us. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        How do I know that you won’t renege 
                        on that? And use this against me?

                                 BRETT
                        Because I won’t. Come on, babe. 
                        Don’t ruin the good thing that we 
                        got.  

           He motions to them - bloody, dirty, one pointing the gun at 
           the other. He doesn’t see the irony. 
                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going burn you. I promise. 
                        The pre-nup kept you here. It took 
                        away your escape route, don’t you 
                        see? Your nature tells you to get 
                        rid of me a hundred times a week, 
                        right? But the pre-nup made you 
                        stay. But we don’t need it anymore. 
                        I can see that now.
                             (then)
                        Go all in with me, babe. Come on.

           He’s got her. But he just can’t stop selling --

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        Stop keeping one foot out the door. 
                        Stop thinking all “where’s mine?”   

           This makes Michelle mad.

                                 MICHELLE
                        That’s easy for you to say because 
                        it is all yours.

                                 BRETT
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Well, now it’s mine. Bye, Brett. I 
                        really did love you.

           She levels the gun at him. 

                                 BRETT
                        Do not do this --

           But she does do it. 

           She SHOOTS Brett. 

           But it’s not a clean shot. It HITS him in the leg.

           And he goes down in a spray of ARTERIAL BLOOD and VISCERA. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck, Michelle?!

           Michelle moves in on him -- 

           Brett DRAGS himself along the length of the steaming infinity 
           pool, leaving a snail trail of blood and viscera. 

           She SHOOTS at him again. But the GUN only CLICKS. 
           No more bullets.

           Michelle and Brett lock eyes. 

           It’s on.

           Brett SCREAMS for help. 

           Moving surprisingly fast for someone’s whose leg is 
           hamburger, he pulls himself toward the hillside dragging his 
           wrecked, BLOODY HUNK of a leg behind him.

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                             (calls out)
                        Up here! Help! I’m up here!

           Michelle reverses course and GOES for Powalski’s shotgun. 

           She SHOVES his big body off of the shotgun. But he’s really, 
           really heavy. All she’s managing to push off is Powalski’s 
           blue robe. She looks around -- 

           Sees Greg -- mystified by what’s been playing out in front of 
           him, he’s been trying to stay as quiet as possible -- 
           Michelle orders him -- 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Help me!

           Greg and Michelle push at Powalski. The big man’s robe comes 
           open. He’s basically lying there in his tiny underwear now. 

           With Greg’s help, Michelle gets her arm under Powalski girth 
           and GRASPS the BARREL of the SHOTGUN. She’s got it. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           She’s goes after Brett, leaving Greg alone.

           This is his chance to escape. 

           Greg assesses his options. Run down the driveway or run 
           across the patio into Powalski’s house. 

           SCRAMBLING to his feet, quiet as only a big man can be, Greg 
           goes for the house --

           POOLSIDE: 

           Michelle hunts Brett. PUMPING the SHOTGUN as she WALKS toward 
           him through the steam and the fog --
                                 BRETT
                        Help! Up here! 

           Michelle takes her SHOT. 

           But nothing happens. There’s no shell in the chamber.  

           Michelle looks at the useless shotgun, betrayed. 

           And her feeling of betrayal only intensifies when -- 

           Brett GRABS her ankle and TACKLES Michelle to the patio. 

           Something GLINTS in his hand.

           Surprise. Brett’s got the KNIFE he laid on the patio table 
           earlier. 

           ROLLING on top of Michelle, he PINS her to the cement. 

                                 BRETT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to hurt you but--

           She KNEES him in the junk and STRUGGLES to get away with 
           everything she’s got. 

           Brett LAYS the KNIFE down to WRESTLE her flat. 

           Meanwhile, Greg RUNS for his life across the patio. He’s 
           almost to Powalski’s back door when he KNOCKS a basket of 
           towels into a GLASS TABLE. He tries to stop the inevitable-

           But the GLASS TABLE HITS the PATIO and SHATTERS in a NOISY 
           MESS.

                                 MICHELLE
                             (to Brett)
                        He’s getting away! Look! Stop him!

           When Brett turns to look at the fleeing Greg, Michelle 
           WRIGGLES away from him enough to reach for --

           And GRAB -- 

           The KNIFE on the ground.

           And with no hesitation, Michelle STABS Brett in the back.

           Brett’s eyes GO WIDE and a TRICKLE of a blood comes out the 
           corner of his mouth. 

           He stares at Michelle. Unbelievingly. 
           Then his eyes go vacant and his BIG BODY goes LIMP and he 
           FALLS face first on her. 

           Michelle struggles to UNTANGLE herself from him. 

           She ROLLS his dead weight off of her, freeing herself.

           She RUNS after Greg into Powalski’s house --    

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cop #3 TRACKS footsteps through the dewy grass. They lead to 
           the wild hillside. He shines his flashlight up there.

                                 COP #3
                        They went this way!

           INT. HALLWAY - POWALSKI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Holding a beach towel to his side, Greg hurries down a long 
           palatial hallway. 

           He turns a CORNER --

           Hobbling along, he looks around, lost, exhausted and 
           terrified.

           He turns another CORNER --

           Michelle stands right there.  

           Bloody. Dirty. Filthy. Teary.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t want to kill you. Okay? 
                        I’ve already had to kill so many 
                        people tonight. I’m not a bad 
                        person. I don’t even know you.

           She blows a piece of wayward hair out of her face -- 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I think you and I can make a deal.

           This is not what Greg was expecting.

           Michelle TOSSES him the empty gun. 

           On instinct, Greg CATCHES it.  

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        The Malibu police are going to be  
                        here in about a minute. So this is 
                        what we’re going to do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to find somewhere 
                        inside here to hide and when I’m 
                        back from the hospital later today, 
                        I’ll come and find you and we can 
                        work out the details of our deal. 
                        Something mutually beneficial. How 
                        does that sound?

                                 GREG
                        I can’t trust you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Sure you can. I’m out of bullets.

           This is not a convincing argument. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Now the other option is I tell the 
                        police that you and Esperanza 
                        robbed us. That you shot Brett and 
                        Powalski. And look? You’ve got 
                        fingerprints on the gun and blood 
                        at the crime scene.

           Greg looks down at the gun in his hands. He drops it. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Or option three, I tell them you 
                        have bags of guns and ammo and that 
                        you’re hiding in this house 
                        somewhere. We can see how that goes 
                        for you. Whose story do you think 
                        they’re going to believe, yours or 
                        mine?  

                                 GREG
                        I’m a marine, lady.

                                 MICHELLE
                             (leaning in)
                        And I was the star of a UPN show 
                        that ran for two and a half 
                        seasons. 

           They look at each other. 

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        What do you say --
                             (reads his name off his 
                              shirt)
                        -- Greg? Want to roll the dice with 
                        the Malibu police or me?

           Greg looks upset. He doesn’t like those odds.
           EXT. ST. JOHN’S HOSPITAL, SANTA MONICA - NIGHT

           It’s still night, but dawn is slowly breaking in the east in 
           muted pinks and oranges.  

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Michelle sits on an examination table, wrapped in a police 
           issued, steel blanket. 

           Red-eyed and snot nosed, it looks like she’s been crying for 
           days. 

           Two plains-clothed detectives enter. The woman, DETECTIVE MIA 
           BROWN (30’s), never went to charm school. Her hair is pulled 
           back in a severe ponytail and she wears no make-up. The man, 
           DETECTIVE LUIS DE LA CRUZ, (60’s) is chubby, friendly and 
           sharp as tack.   

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        I’m Detective Brown. This is 
                        Detective De La Cruz. 

           De La Cruz smiles and nods. 

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        Hello.

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        We need you to walk us through the 
                        events of the night.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t know if I can right now. 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        Try.

           Michelle looks annoyed. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        May I get a cup of water? Please.

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        Of course. Here ya go. 

           Michelle smiles at Detective De La Cruz, turning on the 
           sweet.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Thank you, Detective.

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        Long night?
                                 MICHELLE
                             (snort)
                        You don’t know the half of it.

           The detectives are burning to look at each other, but they’re 
           disciplined. Detective Brown pulls over a chair -- 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        Start at the beginning, Mrs. 
                        Hardwick.

           EXT. POWALSKI’S HOUSE - MORNING 

           The sun has come up and everything is new again.  

           INT. HALLWAY - POWALSKI’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Greg crawls out of a closet and walks down the palatial 
           halls. 

           Waiting to be caught any second, he looks over his shoulder 
           anxiously. 

           A POLICE RADIO CRACKLES somewhere outside. Nearby.

           Greg lies his hand on a wall sconce and gets the surprise of 
           his life when a secret door in the wall SLIDES OPEN.  

           Not in a position to look a gift horse in the mouth, Greg 
           DUCKS inside the secret hiding spot.

           INT. LABORATORY - POWALSKI’S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Once inside, Greg finds a button that, when pressed, CLOSES 
           the secret door. 

           Greg lets out his breath for the first time in hours. 

           He’s safe. 

           But where exactly is he?

           Greg looks around. It’s a laboratory of sorts. But it’s not 
           meth or illegal arms, the thing that appears to be studied 
           here is 

           HVAC units. 

           One hundred different types of tubing are spread out on one 
           table. And two different experiments are running concurrently 
           behind glass on either side of the lab. 

           And then there’s a pink unit the size of the shoe box that 
           sits on a table all by itself. Glossy and perfect. 
           Greg goes up and presses the “on” button. 

           Instantly, cold, delicious, silent air blows in his face. 
           It’s like manna from heaven.

           It’s only now, in the bright lights of the laboratory that we 
           can finally make out the name of the business Greg works for 
           on the back of his work shirt -- 

           It’s an air-conditioning repair business.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           St. Johns in Santa Monica. 

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Michelle finishes her fantastic tale --

                                 MICHELLE
                        -- I shot him, I ran and the second 
                        one -- 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        The Asian one? With the accent?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Malaysian accent. Yes. He chased 
                        Brett and me. We tried to escape to 
                        the neighbor’s but the gunman 
                        caught up with us and shot --

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        The neighbor?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE DA LA CRUZ
                        And your husband?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        But not you.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He missed.

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        Twice?

           Michelle nods.
                                 DETECTIVE BROWN (CONT’D)
                        What are the odds? 

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        You an actress, Mrs. Hardwick?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I was. Years ago. More of a 
                        waitress really. 

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        “Hollywood Hills Hotel,” right?

           She says nothing. Steers the conversation elsewhere.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Poor Brett. How could this happen 
                        to him? And on our anniversary.    

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        What anniversary is it?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Eleventh.

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        I mean what gift? Crystal? China? 
                        Silver?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Um... Steel, I think.

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        Steel? What kind of gift is that, 
                        huh? 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        A Glock 43?

           Michelle shoots a reproachful look at Detective Brown, this 
           is in poor taste. 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe more like a cutlery set?  

           Michelle realizes it’s more than just poor taste. This is an 
           accusation. She stiffens. Does Detective Brown know 
           something?

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t got the chance to tell 
                        you, Mrs. Hardwick, but you weren’t 
                        the only survivor last night.  
           This is terrible news for Michelle and her face gives her 
           away. She was never a very good actress to begin with.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        Really? 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        Yes. And as soon as he’s out of 
                        surgery, we’re going to be very 
                        interested to hear his version of 
                        last night’s events.

           With this, the detectives get up, stretch, gather their 
           things and walk out of the room.  

           Michelle is left utterly devastated. 

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t know if it will best a new 
                        knife set or a Glock, but I got 
                        something else for you made of 
                        steel. 

           Detective Brown RATTLES her handcuffs.

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Happy anniversary, Mrs. Hardwick. 

           The rug has just been pulled out from under Michelle. She’s 
           going down. Fuck. 

           EXT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Detectives Brown and De La Cruz come out of the examination 
           room and walk down the hall. 

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        She didn’t ask who.

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        Who what?

                                 DETECTIVE DE LA CRUZ
                        Who lived?

                                 DETECTIVE BROWN
                        Because it doesn’t matter who. She 
                        tried to kill all of them. She 
                        knows she’s fucked no matter who 
                        lived.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BAR - RESTAURANT - DUSK

           TITLE CARD: ONE YEAR LATER 

           Chapter Four: “In Sickness and in Health”

           CLOSE ON: Michelle’s face. Her hair is tied back in a bun. 
           She wears a button down white shirt and a wee little bow tie.

           She enters the bar of the restaurant.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Mr. and Mrs. Klein?

           PULL OUT to reveal that Michelle is carrying two dinner 
           menus.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Your table is ready. Follow me, 
                        please.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DUSK

           Michelle seats the KLEINS at the best table in the house. The 
           sun is just beginning to set over the Pacific. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I’d like to tell you about 
                        tonight’s specials. We have a sweet 
                        butter poached Nova Scotian 
                        lobster...

           ACROSS THE DINING ROOM - the Hostess and Henry the Waiter 
           gossip by the kitchen door. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        I heard she’s a murderess.

                                 WAITER
                        Allegedly.

                                 HOSTESS
                        No, I heard she did it. 

           EXT. RESTAURANT, VALET STAND - DUSK

           Michelle leaves work with a to-go box. Keys in hand, she 
           waves to the VALET GUYS as she walks past. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Good night, Jose. Good night, 
                        Manny.

           DOWN THE HILL:
           Michelle gets to her car --

           Which is a white utility van with a handicap lift. She gets 
           in.

           EXT. PCH - NIGHT

           Michelle drives along PCH. At a red light, she counts her tip 
           money. 

           EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - DUSK

           There is a “FOR SALE” sign in the formerly well manicured 
           yard that is now overgrown. 

           That’s what happens when you shoot your landscaper. 

           Michelle parks the van and exits. She walks past a boneyard 
           of the dead plants. Everything that was not drought resistant 
           has died out. 

           There’s a janky wheelchair ramp up from the car park to the 
           front door. 

           INT. FOYER - DUSK

           Michelle enters and puts her keys in a ‘World’s #1 Patient’ 
           cup on the entry table. She takes the to-go box with her --

                                 MICHELLE
                        Babe?

           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           The den has been transformed into a makeshift bedroom. 
           Michelle enters with the to-go box and two forks.  

           Brett sits in a wheelchair. He’s wearing a nice blazer that 
           probably once fit but is now too big on his shrunken frame. 

           His head is cocked at that unnatural Christopher Reeves angle 
           and he’s got a colostomy bag. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Whatcha doing in the chair, babe?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Happy anniversary, babe.

                                 MICHELLE
                             (surprised)
                        What?

           “GUILTY” by Barbara Streisand and Barry Gibbs starts to PLAY.
                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Let’s dance. 

           Michelle laughs. And he laughs. 

           Brett who can’t walk, can’t talk and needs care for the rest 
           of his life, spins in a circle. His version of a wheelie.

           INT. APARTMENT - KOREA TOWN - DUSK

           Henry the waiter stands at his apartment window, watching a 
           billboard go up across the street. 

           It’s for “The Groom.” And the new bachelor is a thinner, 
           buffer, contact lens version of --

           “GREG - Marine and Millionaire Inventor”  

           The poster shows Greg holding up a glossy pink HVAC unit -- 
           known the world over as the revolutionary “Baxter.”

           Henry shakes his head in disbelief and envy. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck that guy.

           Henry KICKS his couch.

           INT. DEN - NIGHT

           Michelle helps Brett into bed, careful to prop him up with 
           pillows and hang his colostomy bag on its hook by the bed. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I got us something good.

           She brings over the to-go box and two forks from the kitchen. 
           She takes off the lid. Brett picks up a fork and tastes it.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Beetroot and chocolate cake?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Happy anniversary, babe. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        What else was on the menu?
                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh, let’s see, there was an orchard 
                        crumble with pears and black-
                        berries.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Mmmm.

                                 MICHELLE
                        And a fudgy fig roll.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Start with the entrees.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I will, but first, did you see our 
                        ratings? This season is killing it. 
                        Everyone loves a rags to riches 
                        story.  

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        He’s so ugly. It’s kind of amazing.

                                 MICHELLE
                        He’s ugly, but he’s got like a real 
                        man sex appeal that America seems 
                        to like. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        What do I care? It’s not my fucking 
                        show anymore. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Hey, I’m sorry we had to sell off 
                        the show and all our assets and go 
                        bankrupt defending ourselves, but 
                        it will all be over one day. And 
                        we’ll get back to normal. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Detective Brown’s going to keep 
                        coming at us. She knows I’m lying 
                        to her. She wants to punish us. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Forget her. 
                             (then)
                        What’s the first thing you’re going 
                        to do when we get our old lives 
                        back?
                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Unparalyze myself and fix it so 
                        that I don’t have to carry a bag of 
                        shit with me everywhere I go.

                                 MICHELLE
                        I really am sorry, babe. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        I know. I got you something. For 
                        our anniversary.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You did?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        It’s over there. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Is this the secret thing you’ve 
                        been working on for months, babe?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Not saying.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ordering special parts for it?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        My lips are sealed.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Where is it?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Top drawer of the dresser.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh goody. You’ve been so secretive.

           As Michelle crawls across the bed --

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        What is twelve years anyway?

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Linen, colored gems and pearls.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh, I’m excited. I’ve always wanted 
                        me some colored gems. 

           Michelle opens the top drawer of the dresser and finds a 
           sloppily wrapped gift about the size of --
           A pipe bomb.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Aww. You even wrapped it yourself. 
                        You really shouldn’t have, babe. 

           She unwraps the paper.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        After what I did to you, I think 
                        you’re free to never get me a gift 
                        again as long as we live.

           She rips the rest of the wrapping paper off revealing a bare 
           cardboard box. Not exactly what she was expecting.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, you got me. I’m intrigued. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        It was very hard to find a way to 
                        top last year.

           Michelle holds the box in her hands. She shakes it. 

           Is that a smile on Brett’s partially paralyzed face?

                                 MICHELLE
                        What is it, babe?

           But Michelle’s happiness takes a sudden, sharp turn. She 
           HEARS something... 

           TICKING. 

           She cocks her head.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        You hear that?

           She opens the package. 

           Revealing a BOMB 

           Pounds of PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE are sloppily shoved in to 
           capacity under a DETONATOR. Way more serious than your 
           average pipe bomb, this fucker’s got behemoth power. 

           The countdown TICKS: 6 seconds 

           Michelle looks up at Brett in horror --

           5 seconds
           Her face is pure panic and terror --

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Happy anniversary, babe.

           Brett smiles.

           4 seconds

           Then, inconceivably, Michelle’s panic begins to morph into 
           something else --

           3 seconds

           Something that looks like acceptance. 

           A tectonic revelation sweeps her face --

           2 seconds

           And she looks at Brett, a tear in her eye --

           1 second

                                 MICHELLE
                        Oh, honey, it’s perfect.

           KA-BOOM!!!!!!!!!

           INT/EXT. HARDWICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Hardwick’s Spanish Colonial EXPLODES.

           As “Guilty” PLAYS, a FIREBALL ROLLS through the house in SLOW 
           MOTION DESTROYING everything in its path -- 

           The posters for “The Groom” -- INSTANT ASH.

           The abandoned master bedroom and bathroom -- BOOM. GONE.

           The rippling FIRE BALL INCINERATES the gun safe and the 
           replacement baby Buddha, turning them to MOLTEN PUDDLES. 

           The house gets SHREDDED, top to bottom. 

           Everything becomes INSTANT SHRAPNEL --

           LAUNCHING up hundreds of feet in the night air --

           The FLAMING PIECES of Michelle and Brett’s lives SHOOT out 
           like ROCKETS and FIREWORKS. 

           The bits and embers SCATTER and FALL all over the dry Malibu 
           hillside like the most brilliant meteor shower ever. 
           FADE OUT

           THE END
