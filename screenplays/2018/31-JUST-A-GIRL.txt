           INT. BELL HOME - EARLY EVENING

           The sun is beginning to set, its rays glowing through the 
           window.  SAMANTHA BELL (16), wide eyed and still coming to 
           terms with how long her limbs are, ties an AMERICAN FLAG 
           ribbon into her braided hair. She wears white jeans, a red 
           top and blue Converse low tops.  

           From downstairs we hear her mother, CAROLYN (45), moderately 
           stressed out, calling up to her -

                                 CAROLYN (O.S.)
                        Samantha!  We have to get going.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Coming!

           Sam puts the finishing touches on her hair, grabs a small 
           purse and walks out of the room.  

           INT. BELL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Sam walks into the living room to find Carolyn putting the 
           finishing touches on her make up in the hall mirror.  Next to 
           her is a small DISPLAY CASE with various bits of WAR 
           MEMORABILIA; certificates, a few bullet shells, a rugged 
           looking SWORD, and PHOTOGRAPHS of a young soldier.  

           As Sam walks towards her, she notices her father KEN (50) 
           sitting on the couch, PASSED OUT.  

           We’ll recognize Ken as the young man pictured in the display 
           case, 30 years later.  Right now Ken is wearing FULL MILITARY 
           DRESS, several medals pinned to his chest; a highly decorated 
           enlisted man.  On the coffee table in front of him, a glass 
           half filled with melted ice and something brown. 

           Sam stares at him for a second.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Is dad coming?

                                 CAROLYN
                        He’s not feeling well.  He told me 
                        he needed to sleep.  

           This isn’t the first time Ken hasn’t been up for it.  Sam 
           nods, knowing not to ask any more questions.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m ready.  

           Carolyn turns to her.  
                                 CAROLYN
                        Oh honey.  You look beautiful.  
                        Let’s go!

           EXT. STREET - DUSK

           Sam and Carolyn watch as a SUBURBAN PARADE passes by - a 
           small bagpipe brigade, the local rotary club, a bright red 
           vintage convertible decorated with signs for the local realty 
           company, everyone waving flags.  Veterans are EVERYWHERE, 
           wearing their dress whites, with their families.  

           But something is off.  Everyone is also carrying torches in 
           the fading light.  Banners read “NORTH AMERICAN VICTORY 
           WEEK!” and “25 YEARS FREE FROM EVIL!”

           EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 

           Sam and Carolyn walk with the parade, carrying their own 
           torches.  Sam spots her best friend ANNABETH (15) nearby with 
           her family.   

           Carolyn chats with another mother, isn’t really paying 
           attention, so Sam slowly makes her way through the crowd to 
           Annabeth.  They hug.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh my god I thought I was never 
                        going to find you.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Me too!  Is your arm so tired from 
                        this stupid torch?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Ugh.  Totally.  

           As the girls walk, a VOICE comes over a loud speaker.  

                                 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
                        We no longer fear the night.  

           Annabeth and Sam join the entire crowd, albeit apathetically -

                                 ANNABETH/SAMANTHA/CROWD
                        We conquered the night!  

           EXT. MEMORIAL PARK - NIGHT

           A large field just outside of town.  Annabeth and Sam are 
           standing together, facing a large WAR MEMORIAL.  
           At its center is a huge wooden EFFIGY of a crouched, blank 
           figure.  They’re surrounded by a few hundred other people 
           from town, all with torches in hand.  A SPEAKER in full 
           military dress is at a microphone.  

                                 MILITARY SPEAKER
                        ...this victory was won through 
                        courage...

           His droning words fade into the background.  

           At the edge of the crowd, Sam spots CLARKE (17) and DAVE 
           (17).  

           Sam nudges Annabeth.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Annabeth.  Dave is over there.  

           Sam points to the guys.  Annabeth looks, then squeezes Sam’s 
           hand.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh my god.  Good eye.  That is why 
                        you’re my best friend.  

           Sam laughs.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s the only reason??

                                 ANNABETH
                        No but come on let’s go!!

           EXT. MEMORIAL PARK - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

           Sam and Annabeth hover on the periphery of the crowd.  Dave 
           smokes a cigarette with Clarke, laughing and joking with him.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Should we go further up, so we’re 
                        standing in front of them?  It 
                        doesn’t seem like they’re looking 
                        over here.

           As they deliberate two other girls - MANDY (16) and CLAIRE 
           (16) approach Dave and Clarke, hugging them, flirting.  

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        Shit.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I hate those bitches.  
           Annabeth sighs.  The SPEAKER is finished and people are 
           marching towards a large bonfire, at the foot of the now 
           BURNING WOODEN EFFIGY.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Whatever.  

           A SONG picks up in the background; a patriotic hymn, and 
           people sing along in a soft murmur, as they slowly add their 
           torches to the pyre, the fire growing bigger, burning the 
           Effigy.

           The Night is ours again,
           We burn the devil tonight,
           For the night is ours again.

           EXT. MEMORIAL PARK - NIGHT

           Sam and Annabeth get in line behind a big procession of 
           people, all waiting to drop their torches at the foot of the 
           now BLAZING EFFIGY.  

           Mandy, Claire, Clarke and Dave, clustered in a semi-circle, 
           join the line right behind them.  

           Annabeth squeezes Sam’s hand and mock screams.  Sam leans 
           into Annabeth.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (whispering)
                        Talk to him.  Screw those girls.

           Annabeth turns around. 

                                 ANNABETH
                        Hi Dave.  

                                 DAVE
                        Oh hey.

           Sam also turns around.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hey guys.  

           Mandy rolls her eyes... But then something catches her 
           attention. She nudges Claire and points at Sam.  

                                 MANDY
                        Ummm... looks like you had an 
                        accident Sam.  
           Sam looks down at her jeans - realizes SHE GOT HER FIRST 
           PERIOD.  A menstrual blood stain blooming on her white jeans.

           Mandy and Claire are laughing hysterically.  Clarke can’t 
           help but grin.  Dave joins them.  

                                 DAVE
                        Oh fuck.  

           Mandy turns to Annabeth.  

                                 MANDY
                        How can you be friends with such a 
                        weirdo?  

           Mandy laughs and shakes her head.

           Sam shoves her torch into Claire’s hand and turns, starting 
           to walk away, then running, as more and more people in the 
           crowd notice and start to laugh.  

           INT. BELL HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

           Sam gets home.  She starts to rush up the stairs - but her 
           Carolyn steps into the front hall.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Where did you disappear to?  

           Sam freezes.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I was just with Annabeth.  Can I go 
                        upstairs?  

                                 CAROLYN
                        What’s the rush?  

           Sam turns around, her face tear streaked.  Carolyn clocks the 
           blood stained jeans.   

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        Oh no.  I’m sorry honey.  Come 
                        here.  

           Sam walks down the stairs.  Her mother hugs her.  

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sam pulls off her jeans and panties.  Carolyn gives her a 
           towel.  She wraps it around her waist.  She sits down on the 
           edge of the tub. 
                                 CAROLYN
                        Don’t sit down there, we don’t want 
                        to get blood on the towel.  

           Sam tears up.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Sorry.  

           Carolyn hugs her.

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s okay honey.  Don’t worry.  
                        This is normal.  Once you’re 
                        showered and changed, make sure and 
                        wash your jeans and underwear out 
                        in the sink before you put them in 
                        the washer.  Okay?

           Carolyn rummages under the sink and pulls out a box of PADS.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yes.  Okay.  

           Sam just nods.  Carolyn pulls a pad out of the box.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Now - this is a pad.  You may hear 
                        about something called a tampon.  
                        They’re legal but... the type of 
                        girls that use them.  They’re not 
                        good.  So always just use a pad.  
                        The way these work-

           INT. SAM’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sam washes her shorts out in the sink.  She’s mesmerized by 
           the blood swirling around the drain.  She stares at it.  

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sam lays in bed, wide awake, staring at the ceiling.  She 
           stands up and gets out of bed.  She pulls her chair to the 
           window sill and looks out on the wooded suburbs.  

           INT. LOCKERS HALLWAY - DAY

           Sam unloads her book bag, repacks it at her locker.  She’s 
           looking around for someone, we don’t know who.  
           The halls are decked out in patriotic bunting, along with 
           garlands of garlic and posters and flyers bearing a bizarre 
           symbol - a figure, in the same crouch as the effigy from the 
           opening sequence, in silhouette, surrounded by flames.  

           Through the hustle and bustle of the hallway, Sam catches 
           people snickering at her.  

           Mandy stops at Sam’s locker, hovering over her as she packs 
           her bags.  Sam tries to ignore her.   

                                 MANDY
                        I bet you use heavy flow pads.  You 
                        seem like a heavy flow girl.  

           Sam keeps ignoring her. 

                                 MANDY (CONT’D)
                        You’re basically wearing a diaper 
                        aren’t you?  

            Mandy hits the back of Sam’s head.  

                                 MANDY (CONT’D)
                        Whatever.  Loser.  

           INT. HOME ROOM - DAY

           MRS. WAFFENHOPPER (55) stands at the front of class, Claire 
           next to her, reading off a piece of paper.  Everyone else 
           sits head bowed, eyes closed, hands clasped tightly in the 
           prayer position, among them, Claire and Annabeth.  Across the 
           classroom, Mandy very quietly unwraps a piece of gum, 
           pretending to pray.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We pray that when our days come to 
                        an end the Lord takes us in peace 
                        into the after life.  

                                 REST OF CLASS
                        Amen.

                                 CLAIRE
                        We pray that God protects us always 
                        from demons that dwell in the 
                        night.  

                                 REST OF CLASS
                        Amen. 
           INT. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           MS. D’AGOSTINO (45), Ms. D to the students that love her, 
           which is most of them, erudite yet accessible.  A cool 
           teacher because she’s just that good.  Annabeth and Sam 
           listen attentively, taking notes.  Nearby, Mandy and Claire 
           text each other, not paying attention.  

                                 MS. D
                        Let’s not forget, that in the 
                        second battle of New York we got 
                        caught with our pants down.  US led 
                        forces suffered a stinging defeat.  

           Suddenly, as Ms. D speaks, Sam gets hit with a serious cramp.  
           Can’t see straight pain.  She holds her stomach and tries to 
           act nonchalant, but of course Mandy notices.  

                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        A virtual massacre that provided 
                        the enemy with a critical blood 
                        supply, and allowed them to build 
                        their forces in the Northeast 
                        quietly, for that entire summer.  
                        So when the nights start getting 
                        longer in October... they’re ready.  

           Mandy raises her hand.  

                                 MANDY
                        I have a question Ms. D.  Were they 
                        attracted to all blood?  

                                 MS. D
                        Yes.  

                                 MANDY
                        What about period blood?  

           Everyone laughs.  Sam turns red, sinks deeper into her chair.

                                 MS. D
                        Yes, Mandy.

                                 MANDY
                        Is it more dangerous if you’re a 
                        heavy flow girl?

           The class snickers again. 

                                 MS. D
                        That’s enough Mandy.  

           The bell rings.  Everyone stands.  
                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        Starting in on the last chapter 
                        tomorrow, so please be prepared.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Sam and Annabeth in line for your standard cafeteria fare, 
           eying it warily as stodgy workers dole it out one 
           unappetizing glop at a time.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        So what should we do this weekend?

           Annabeth hesitates.

                                 ANNABETH
                        I have to do some stuff with my 
                        family.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        All weekend?  What about Friday?

           They get to the end of the line and swipe their lunch cards.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Sorry I’m busy.  

           Sam heads in one direction - notices Annabeth isn’t following 
           her.  She walks back over to Annabeth. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Where are you going?

           Annabeth turns back to Sam.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        We don’t always have to sit 
                        together.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Who am I going to sit with?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know Sam!  God you’re so 
                        clingy.  

           Annabeth stomps off, and joins DAVE’S TABLE; sitting with 
           Dave, Clarke, Mandy, Claire and other cool kids.  Sam finds a 
           seat by herself and picks at her sandwich.  
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Sam gets dressed for LACROSSE, throwing on her uniform; 
           sleeveless practice jersey, practice skirt, bike shorts, the 
           like.  

           Sam clocks Annabeth talking and laughing with Mandy - Sam’s 
           hearing is strangely acute... she can hear everything they’re 
           saying crystal clear... we move in on their conversation -

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know.  I mean she’s weird 
                        but she’s pretty nice.  

                                 MANDY
                        Ugh.  Are we talking about the same 
                        Sam?  I wish that freak would 
                        fucking kill herself.  I hate 
                        looking at her.   

           Mandy puts her hair up in a pony tail.  

                                 MANDY (CONT’D)
                        You should sit with us tomorrow.  

           Sam plops down to the bench suddenly, her cramps hitting her 
           like a ton of bricks, doubled over.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Okay cool.  

                                 MANDY
                        One thing though - Dave is Claire’s 
                        guy.  So if you want to be friends 
                        with us, you need to step off.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh.  Okay.  Well...

                                 MANDY
                        Let’s get out there.  

           Annabeth follows Mandy out, past Sam’s locker.  Sam is bent 
           over, holding her stomach.  Annabeth looks at her then turns 
           away quickly, trying to pretend she didn’t see her, a little 
           bit ashamed.  

           EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY

           Sam and her teammates are running scrimmage; half wear red 
           mesh jerseys over their practice uniforms.  Mandy and 
           Annabeth play opposite Sam’s team.
           The sun is killing Sam’s eyes.  She can’t focus on the game - 
           keeps shielding her eyes from the sun.  Her skin is RED; she 
           looks like she’s getting the worst sunburn of her life.  She 
           touches her shoulder - winces.  

           Then she gets hit with INTENSE CRAMPING PAIN... doubles over 
           for a second, grabbing her stomach, panting.

           Mandy runs past Sam and smacks her shins with her lacrosse 
           stick.  

                                 MANDY
                        Heavy floooowwwwww!!!

           Sam straightens up, pissed.  She bites her lower lip, runs 
           through the pain, right at the ball, angry - steals it from 
           Mandy - 

           Works her way down the field... Annabeth gets close to her - 
           tries to steal the ball away - Sam keeps her at bay - maybe 
           nudges her a little bit hard - she’s angry at her after all - 
           THE SUN IS SO STRONG... SAM IS MOMENTARILY BLINDED BY IT...

           Sam nears the goal... ANNABETH TRIPS... SAM SWINGS THE STICK 
           BACK TO TAKE THE SHOT AND HITS ANNABETH IN THE NOSE!!

           Annabeth’s face gushes blood.  Sam clocks what’s happened.  
           She rushes to Annabeth’s side, takes off her bandana, and 
           holds it to her nose.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Oh my gosh are you okay?

           Annabeth pushes her away, crying.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Get away from me!  

           Mandy and several other girls start chanting-

                                 MANDY AND OTHERS
                        Go heavy flow!  Go heavy flow!  Go 
                        go go heavy flow!  

           Sam stands up straight.  Then a wave of pain hits her.  She 
           bends over, clutching her stomach.

           The coach, who we’ll recognize as MRS. WAFFENHOPPER comes 
           jogging over.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry.  It was an accident.  
                        The sun...
           Waffenhopper pats her back and keeps walking towards 
           Annabeth.

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        It happens.  Annabeth you okay?

           INT. BELL HOME - DAY

           Sam steps inside and immediately races up the stairs to her -

           BEDROOM - 

           Where she shuts the door, and starts changing into pajamas.  
           She catches herself in the mirror.  She stares at herself.  
           Her pad sticks out the sides of her underwear.  She’s very 
           badly sunburned, all over, blistering in places.  She 
           tenderly touches a blister, wincing.  Concern crosses her 
           face.  This is a really bad burn.  

           Then she puts on her pajamas and sits down at her computer.  
           She pulls up an INSTANT MESSENGER APP and taps out a message 
           to ANNABETH.

           “i’m really sorry about what happened.  are you okay?  it was 
           an accident, i feel so bad.”

           Then Sam gets into bed, pulling the covers up to her neck.  
           She falls asleep instantly.  

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The room is dark.  Sam opens her eyes, suddenly feeling 
           totally awake.  She gets out of bed and checks her computer.  
           NO RESPONSE from Annabeth.

           INT. BELL HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam eats dinner quietly with Carolyn and Ken.  Ken has a 
           strong looking cocktail in front of him.  He takes a big swig 
           and is slightly drunk, trying to affect a serious mood and 
           not pulling it off.

                                 KEN
                        Your mother told me about your big 
                        news.  

           Samantha stops eating.  
                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        All I have to say is don’t think 
                        you’re an adult, because you’re 
                        not, and girls can get into a lot 
                        of trouble when they grow up too 
                        fast.  And it lasts forever, that 
                        trouble.  Do you understand?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yes dad.  

           Ken turns to Carolyn, drunk.  

                                 KEN
                        There.  How was that?  You happy 
                        now?

           Carolyn takes a bite of her food.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s important she know there are 
                        consequences to her actions.

           Sam just focuses on her plate, trying to ignore them. 

           EXT. EDEN PRAIRIE, MN - NIGHT

           Sam walks the family dog BUJO on a sidewalk next to a street 
           that during daylight hours would be busy, but tonight is 
           silent.  On her side are small single family homes.   Across 
           the street is a forest preserve.  She feels good in the night 
           air.  Happy.  

           A deer appears in the street.  She pauses and stares at it.  
           Then suddenly she hears the SOUNDS OF A CAR, driving fast, 
           music blaring... it appears around a corner and barrels 
           towards the deer.  The deer - caught in the headlights - 
           freezes - THE CAR SLAMS INTO THE DEER, THROWING IT INTO THE 
           AIR... then stops.  

           A door opens.  Clarke emerges from the car.  He walks up to 
           the deer, bends down to look at it.  Sam walks closer.  
           Clarke sees her.   

                                 CLARKE
                        Did you see it?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.

           He touches it.  
                                 CLARKE
                        Fuck.  Those fucking assholes.  

           The car horn starts honking.  Clarke’s friend DAVE (17) 
           sticks his head out the window.  

                                 DAVE
                        Let’s go mother fucker!

           Clarke stands up, shaking his head.  

                                 CLARKE
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You don’t need to apologize to me.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Don’t tell anyone.  That it was us.  
                        Okay?

           Sam nods.  

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           Clarke walks to the car - goes to open the door but his 
           friends drive away.  He runs after the car, they stop again, 
           he jumps in.  

           Sam is left alone with the dead deer.  Blood pools from its 
           head on the sidewalk.  Bujo sniffs the blood then licks it.  
           Samantha is transfixed by it.  Keeps looking at it.  Can’t 
           stop.  She crouches down and touches it.  Rubs it between her 
           fingers.  Smells it.  Then tastes it.  

           As the blood hits her tongue she rolls back onto her butt, 
           stunned for a moment.  It tastes so good.  She touches the 
           blood again and licks her fingers.  It hits her harder, her 
           eyes roll back into her head for a second.  

           OS we hear another car approaching.  Sam jumps up and rushes 
           back to the sidewalk, looking over her shoulder - did they 
           see her?  No.  The car turns the corner and Sam turns her 
           head away as the car rushes by.  She shakes her head, trying 
           to shake the taste out of her mouth, hurrying away into the 
           night.  

           INT. BELL HOME - SAM’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sam’s alarm is blaring.  Light bleeds into the room.  She 
           pulls the comforter over her head, still fast asleep.  
           Carolyn steps into the room.  
                                 CAROLYN
                        Sam!  Your alarm has been going off 
                        for ten minutes.  Get up!  

           Carolyn pulls the covers back.  Sam struggles out of bed.  

           She looks at her computer - NO RESPONSE from Annabeth.  

           INT. SAM'S BATHROOM - DAY

           Sam peels off her clothes.  Her burns have gotten better 
           overnight.  The blistered skin is dead, flaking off... 
           Revealing underneath it pale white, almost translucent skin.  
           She’s exhausted.  She sits on the toilet as the shower heats 
           up.  Then she stands and steps into the shower.  Immediately 
           she turns the shower down to cold, as cold as it can get.  

           More and more of the skin starts peeling off of her.  It’s 
           not painful.  It’s just disconcerting.  She peels it off, 
           washing with a bar of soap, exhausted, leaning against the 
           shower wall.  

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM  - DAY

           Sam has to sit down to put on her pants - a pair of black 
           jeans, then hunts through her drawers for a top.  She settles 
           on a black long-sleeve shirt, pulls it on.  

           INT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Sam walks down the hall, exhausted.  She pauses to catch her 
           breath - and finds herself standing in front of a massive 
           school bulletin board, with bold letters declaring NAV WEEK 
           ART CONTEST!  Tacked up all over the board are various 
           student drawn and painted vignettes of THE VAMPIRE WARS.  

           The slaughter of a hundred vampires in a church.  

           The burning of bodies.  

           Vampires staked out in the sun, their skin smoking and 
           sizzling.  

           The humans, triumphant and unflinching in every picture.  

           Sam’s reverie is interrupted by Claire, who purposely bumps 
           into her, sending Sam’s books FLYING -

                                 CLAIRE
                        Did you hear it’s spring freak?
           Claire laughs and continues on her way.  Sam spots Annabeth 
           at her locker nearby, NOSE BANDAGED.  Annabeth averts her 
           eyes.  Sam picks up her books, walks quickly past Annabeth, 
           not looking at her. 

           INT. HOME ROOM - DAY

           Mrs. Waffenhopper stands at the front of homeroom.  Girls 
           pick at their nails and do last minute homework.  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        Okay, who will lead us in our 
                        prayer offerings this morning?  

           Sam stares down at her desk, exhausted and starting to look a 
           little bit pale.  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER (CONT’D)
                        So you’re going to make me look at 
                        the attendance list?  Okay then.  

           Mrs. Waffenhopper looks at her little green teacher’s 
           notebook.

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER (CONT’D)
                        Samantha.  You’re up next.  

           Sam sighs.  Mandy laughs.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Can I go tomorrow?  Please?

                                 MANDY
                        What’s the matter Sam?  Feeling 
                        heavy?  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        That’s enough of that.  It’s your 
                        turn Samantha.  

           Sam reluctantly stands and walks to the front of the room.  
           She picks up a piece of paper off the teacher’s desk; form 
           government letterhead.  The header reads - NATIONAL RELIGION 
           DEPARTMENT.  PRAYER OFFICE.  DAILY PRAYER. The seal of the 
           UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

           Sam has trouble focusing on it.  She steadies herself.  She’s 
           exhausted.  The room spins slightly.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We thank the Lord for another day, 
                        twenty five years after the last 
                        demon was sent back to hell.  
                                 REST OF CLASS
                        Amen.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We thank the Lord for the morning, 
                        that we were safe through the 
                        night.  

                                 REST OF CLASS
                        Amen.

           Mandy throws a crumpled up ball of paper.  It hits Sam in the 
           face.  She looks at Mandy.  Tries to keep reading, but the 
           words are blurry.  

           Sam suddenly sets the paper down on the desk, walks back to 
           her seat and sits down, head in hands.  The room is spinning.  
           Murmurs from the class.  Did Sam really just do that?

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        Excuse me Samantha?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Can’t someone else read it?  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        Samantha stand up and finish.  

           Sam shrugs her shoulders.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t.  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        Samantha this is extremely 
                        disrespectful.  

           Sam feels a sudden anger rising in her.  She looks at Mrs. 
           Waffenhopper with rage.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I said I fucking can’t okay?  I 
                        can’t.  Who cares.  Who cares about 
                        these stupid fucking prayers!  

           Mrs. Waffenhopper walks up to her and grabs her by the hair, 
           lifting her out of her seat - Samantha complies, stunned - 

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        Principal’s office.  Now.  
           INT. CAR - DAY

           Carolyn drives Sam.  They’re silent.  Sam stares out the 
           window.  Sweat is beading on her forehead.  She looks pale.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’m very disappointed.  You are not 
                        like this.  You are not a problem.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I said I was sorry.  What else do 
                        you want?

           Carolyn gets quiet.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I was just about your age when my 
                        mother was killed.  It was two 
                        years into the war.  Everyone 
                        thought that Minnesota was cleared 
                        and safe.  The fronts were south. I 
                        got into a fight with her that 
                        morning.  I called her a bitch. 

           Carolyn starts to tear up.  

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        I got home and she was gone.  We 
                        didn’t know where she was.  I found 
                        her in the basement, hanging upside 
                        down.  Drained.  

           Carolyn wipes away the tears.  

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        It was so awful.  They were so 
                        terrible Sam.  You don’t know how 
                        bad it was.  That’s why we pray.  
                        You pray hard that God protects us 
                        and the evil never comes back. 

           Tears stream down Sam’s cheeks.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry.  

           They pull up to their house.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Okay honey.  I’ll see you at dinner 
                        time, I have to go back to work.  

           Sam nods and climbs out of the car.  
           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sam drops her book bags in her bedroom.  She sits at her 
           desk, slams her fist into it, frustrated, angry, scared.  
           She’s sweating more now.  She rocks back and forth slightly, 
           her eyes closed.  Then she gets up.  Walks out of the room 
           into -

           INT. BELL HOME - SAM’S PARENTS’ ROOM - DAY

           Sam walks into the room and marches up to her mother’s 
           jewelry box.  She opens it and looks through it.  Pulls out a 
           small SILVER NECKLACE WITH A SILVER CROSS.  She puts it on.  

           INT. BELL HOME - SAM’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sam is trying to work on her math homework, still pale, still 
           sweating.  Exhausted, but also fidgety.  She can’t focus.  
           And her neck is itchy.  She starts to scratch it.  Then goes 
           to look in the mirror.  The necklace is literally making her 
           skin smoke slightly.  She pulls it off.  Runs her hands over 
           the burn marks.  

           She shakes her head.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No.  No.  

           INT. BELL HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Sam barrels into the kitchen, on a mission.  She heads 
           straight for a large bowl on the counter.  In it, fruit, 
           various veggies, onions, and... several cloves of garlic.  

           She pulls a pan out of a cabinet and sets it on the stove.  
           Heats the pan.  Adds oil.  Then starts peeling garlic and 
           throwing it into the pan.  She sautés the garlic.  Her eyes 
           start to water as she does.  But she’s not giving up.  

           When it’s ready she grabs some eggs from the fridge and adds 
           them.  They sizzle and cook.  She scoops it onto a plate and 
           goes to sit down at the table.  She cuts a big piece of egg 
           with her fork and raises it to her mouth.  She gags at the 
           smell.  Then she puts the forkful in her mouth.  She forces 
           it down.  

           She sits there, panting.  She starts to sweat.  But she’s not 
           done yet.  She takes a big bite of egg again, forces it down.  
           Starts eating faster.  Then stops.  

           She rushes to the - 
           HALL BATHROOM

           Where she bends over the toilet and violently wretches, 
           throwing up everything she just ate.  She pants.   

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sam sits down at her computer and messages Annabeth again.  

           “i’m really sick.  i’m kind of scared.  can you just write me 
           back?”

           Sam gets into bed.  She’s sweating.  Sick.  She pulls up the 
           covers.  

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Carolyn and Ken hover over Sam’s bed.  She’s now covered in 
           HIVES, itchy, still sweating.  Her face is swollen.

                                 KEN
                        Can she keep anything down?

                                 CAROLYN
                        No.  

                                 KEN
                        How are you doing honey?

           Sam wipes her mouth. She has trouble speaking.  Her tongue is 
           swollen.  She’s wheezing.  She shakes her head.  She can’t 
           talk.

           INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam is looking even more worse for wear.  Her hives have 
           gotten more intense.  Her eyes are swelling shut.  An ER 
           DOCTOR examines her as Carolyn and Ken hover nearby.  Sam is 
           wheezing, hard.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Nurse I need an epi-pen 
                        immediately.  
                             (to Sam)
                        Did you eat anything you don’t 
                        normally eat?  

           Sam shakes her head.  
                                 ER DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Did you get stung by a bee, 
                        anything like that?

                                 CAROLYN
                        What’s going on?

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        She’s in anaphylactic shock - 
                        usually caused by an allergic 
                        reaction.  

           A NURSE appears with an epi-pen and hands it to the doctor. 

                                 ER DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Can you unbutton and pull down your 
                        pants please?

           Sam is weak.  She stands up but topples over.  

           The Nurse steps forward and helps push Sam back onto the 
           examination table, then pulls down her pants.  The Doctor 
           jabs the epi-pen in her thigh.  

                                 ER DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be okay.  

           Sam’s breathing normalizes.  She takes deep breaths.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The hospital after hours.  Quiet but for the gentle beep of 
           machines.  Sam can’t sleep.  She’s wide awake and feeling 
           better; her hives have faded, her swelling is gone.  But 
           she’s still pale and sweaty.  And she keeps staring at her 
           jeans, neatly folded on an arm chair.  She gets up.  Walks 
           over to her jeans.  She pulls out her phone, and taps out 
           another MESSAGE to ANNABETH.  

           “i had to go to the hospital.  i’m okay though.  i hope 
           you’re okay too.  i’m sorry again.”  

           She clicks send.  Watches her phone for a moment.  Then looks 
           in the other pocket of her jeans.  She finds the bandana from 
           lacrosse practice. She unfolds it.  It’s still moist with 
           blood.  

           She runs her fingers over the blood stain.  She holds it up 
           to her mouth.  Starts to squeeze it.  Wring it.  She’s 
           working this bandana like a junkie trying to scrape together 
           a bump from four different baggies.   A drop of blood drips 
           off it onto her tongue.  
           She feels fireworks when she tastes it.  It’s like heroine.  
           Her eyes roll into the back of her head and she goes slack.  
           A few seconds later she comes to - then immediately begins 
           sucking on the bandana.  

           She gets back into bed.  Sucks on the bandana in bed.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

           Sam opens one eye.  She can hear, as if they’re next to her, 
           the ER Doctor talking in a hushed tone with Carolyn and Ken 
           just outside the door to Sam’s room.  

                                 ER DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        We treated the allergic reaction.  
                        But these lingering symptoms 
                        suggest something else.  The 
                        concern is... well this new 
                        generation of kids seems to be 
                        experimenting more and more with 
                        drugs.  

                                 KEN (O.S.)
                        Is that right?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

           Carolyn and Ken stand around Samantha’s bed with the ER 
           Doctor.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Did you take anything at all?  
                        Maybe something a friend gave you?   
                        Sometimes it could look like a 
                        normal pill, like for a headache.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        We want you to be honest.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No.  I didn’t.  

           The ER Doctor nods, thinly veiling his skepticism.  

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        I’m going to write you a 
                        prescription for an Epi-Pen and 
                        some anti-histamines.  A nurse will 
                        come in and teach you how to use it 
                        when I’m done here.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        I just want to be very clear with 
                        all of you - that this device is to 
                        be used only in cases of a severe 
                        allergic reaction to something like 
                        food, a bee sting, the like.  If 
                        you use it for anything else... or 
                        on someone else, maybe who might be 
                        using drugs... it could kill them.  
                        Okay?

           Carolyn stares at Sam, barely concealing her anger.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        We got it doctor.  Thank you.

           INT. ADVISER ROOM - DAY

           Ms. Waffenhopper stands at the front of the classroom, 
           lecturing.  Girls doodle or pick their nails.  Sam tries to 
           focus, but she’s pale.  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        I know you’re all going to be going 
                        to parties this weekend, 
                        celebrating NAV Day, having fun.  
                        But don’t forget... what this week 
                        is about.  

           As she continues, we CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Sam sits at a desk.  In front of her, a MATH TEACHER writes 
           out a PROOF with the pythagorean theorem.  Sam tries to take 
           notes but can’t focus.  The light coming in from windows is 
           almost blinding.  She feels dizzy.  She has to lean against 
           her desk, steadying herself. Nauseous.   There is no sound, 
           save the sound of Mrs. Waffenhopper, droning on -

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER (V.O.)
                        Before the wars, we were foolish.  
                        We thought the world was good, we 
                        thought that nothing was more 
                        important than being a free and 
                        open society.   

                                                      CUT TO:
           INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

           Sam sits in chemistry.  Still nauseous.  Wearing goggles, 
           watching an experiment... MRS. WAFFENHOPPER’S words still 
           echoing through her head. 

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER (V.O.)
                        There was tragedy and catastrophe, 
                        there were bad people - but we did 
                        not realize that the devil walked 
                        among us, feeding on us, vile and 
                        unfeeling, that there was such a 
                        thing as pure evil embodied in 
                        flesh... 

           Suddenly THE BELL RINGS and the sound of the school day roars 
           back into Sam’s head.  She starts packing up her books.  

           Clarke stops at her lab bench.  

                                 CLARKE
                        I heard you told Waffenhopper to 
                        fuck off.  

           Sam stares at the floor.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It was a mistake.  

           Clarke shrugs.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Sounded cool to me. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Sam sits next to her locker, almost catatonic.  She bites her 
           nails, on the verge of tears.  Around her girls dress for 
           after school sports.

           Annabeth, nose bandaged, rounds a corner and spots her.  
           Stops for a second. Then walks towards her.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Hey.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hey.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Are you okay?  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah I’m fine.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m sorry I didn’t respond last 
                        night... I’m still your friend.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Are you?

           Annabeth knows what she means and it makes her sad, and it 
           shows.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah.  

           Sam stands, grabs her book bag.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Well I’m fine.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where are you going?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Home.  Just tell Waffenhopper I 
                        don’t feel good.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Okay.  Well if you need - 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I said I’m fucking fine.  Okay?  
                        I’m fucking fine.  Don’t talk to me 
                        if you don’t want to know.  

           INT. BELL HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam sits at dinner with her parents.  She’s still sweating.  
           She has to focus very carefully on lifting a fork to her 
           mouth.  Ken has a large cocktail glass in front of him.  He’s 
           drinking from it in gulps.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        We’re worried about you Sam.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I think we need to talk about it.  
                        I don’t think we can just leave it 
                        at “I’m sorry.”
                                 KEN
                        Maybe she’s just being a teenager.  
                        You think about that Mom?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I don’t think it’s about being a 
                        teenager.  I think she’s up to 
                        something.  What are you up to Sam?

           Sam breaks down sobbing.  The tension.  The guilt over this 
           burgeoning desire in her is too much.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t... I’m trying to hold it 
                        together.  Okay?  I’m sorry.  I’m 
                        just stressed out and I’m a good 
                        kid.  There’s nothing wrong with 
                        me.  I’m trying really hard.  

                                 KEN
                        Listen we know.  We know you’re 
                        trying hard.  But you need to be 
                        safe.  So what did you eat, that 
                        made you so sick?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I don’t know.  Maybe it was the 
                        cafeteria.  The food is so shitty 
                        there.  

           Carolyn sets down her fork.

                                 CAROLYN
                        I need to know.  I need to know if 
                        my daughter is doing drugs. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m not, I swear.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Then why are you sweating and cold?  
                        Then why did we have to take you to 
                        the hospital? What are you hiding 
                        from us?  What?

           Sam can barely keep it together.  She throws her dish at the 
           wall.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Fuck you!  Fuck you! I’m not hiding 
                        anything!  Fuck you!

           Carolyn stands up and slaps Samantha out of her chair.
                                 CAROLYN
                        Now are you going to calm down?

           Ken stands up.  

                                 KEN
                        Don’t hit my daughter.  

           Sam pants on the ground.  

           Carolyn stands, gets in his face.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I won’t have that language in this 
                        house.  
                             (to Samantha)
                        Get upstairs.

           INT. SAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sam’s room is dark.  Illuminated by the moon.  But she’s wide 
           awake, sitting at the window, looking out into the night, 
           filled with longing.  She starts to cry.  She touches her 
           neck, her body, her burned skin.  

           She leans against the window and knocks her head against it, 
           softly.  

           Then she makes a decision.  

           She walks to her desk and pulls out a notepad.  She starts to 
           write - 

           “I am sorry.  I don’t know what I am becoming, but I don’t 
           want to be it.  So I would rather not be.  I am sorry.  I 
           never meant to hurt you.”  

           INT. BELL HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Sam walks into a dark basement.  Flips on the light.  Walks 
           to a shelf and grabs a long coil of ROPE.  

           In her hand, printed instructions off a website.  “How to Tie 
           a Noose.”  

           She starts tying the noose.  Fucks up.  Has to start over.  

           Finally gets it.  She throws the noose over a pipe.  Then 
           ties it off on the basement staircase railing.  She pulls 
           over an old dining room chair.  Steps up onto it.  
           She loops the noose around her neck.  Tears stream down her 
           eyes.  This is it for her.  She can’t stand the person she 
           is.  She kicks the chair out from under her.

           And she drops about a foot.  She’s about two feet off the 
           ground, choking, feet kicking.  

           And she keeps choking.  She turns blue.  

           But then something bizarre happens.  She starts to relax.  
           Her arms drop.  Her legs stop kicking.  As she hangs, she 
           starts to realize - I’m not going to die.

           She hangs for another moment.  Her face is ashen.  She can’t 
           breath.  But she’s still here.  She sways slowly.  She 
           doesn’t know why it didn’t work.  She’s uncomfortable.  She’d 
           rather breath.  But she won’t fucking die. 

           Fuck it.  If she won’t die then fine.  She kicks her legs 
           out, trying to swing her body on the rope like a pendulum.  

           She finally kicks hard enough to swing over to the basement 
           stair railing.  She grabs the other end of the rope, tied off 
           to the railing.  Then carefully unloops her head from the 
           noose.  But she loses her balance and falls with a loud SMACK 
           to the ground.  

           She lies on the basement floor, catching her breath.  Then 
           she gets up.  

           EXT. BELL HOME - NIGHT

           Sam stalks through her backyard, wearing her pajamas, a 
           person transfixed, under a spell.  She senses something.  
           Moves quietly into the undergrowth.  She hears something.  
           Waits.  Moves slowly further in - then reaches her hand in - 
           snatches out a LARGE SQUIRREL - she twists its head - it 
           starts bleeding.  

           Sam drinks the blood.  It’s her first time really scratching 
           the itch she’s had for the past three days and it’s a relief, 
           it’s ecstasy, it’s everything.  Her eyes roll into the back 
           of her head.  She descends into an opioid bliss.  

           EXT. BELL HOME - DAWN

           Sam wakes up to the first light.  Heavy dew is on her and all 
           around her.  She wakes up and shakes it off her.  She looks 
           next to her.  The dead squirrel, next to her right hand.  She 
           picks it up and squeezes the rest of the blood out of it, 
           right into her mouth.  She wipes her mouth with the back of 
           her hand.  Stands up.  
           Walks into the bushes again, listening.  Pauses.  Crouches 
           down...

           EXT. BELL HOME - DAWN

           Sam sits on the lawn.  Three dead squirrels next to her.  She 
           opens the top to a GIRLS’ LACROSSE WATER BOTTLE.  Rips the 
           head off one of the squirrels and begins draining it’s blood 
           into the bottle.  

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY

           Sam is nervous.  She walks quickly, looking to either side.  
           Gets to her locker.  Pulls out her water bottle and takes a 
           quick sip, then puts it into her locker.  She zips up her bag 
           and heads to class.  

           INT. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Ms. D at the front of the room, holding court.  

                                 MS. D
                        NAV Day.  North American Victory 
                        Day.  That’s what we’re celebrating 
                        on Saturday.  Let’s be real though.  
                        Who can tell me what really made 
                        that day possible?  What was the 
                        turning point in the war?

           Claire raises her hand.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Prayer.  

                                 MS. D
                        Sure.  Prayer helped.  But... we’re 
                        a history class here.  We’re 
                        talking about actual events, cause 
                        and effect.  I’m sure prayer 
                        helped.  I’d never say otherwise, 
                        partly cause these puritan nuts 
                        would fire me.  

           The class laughs.  

                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                             (half joking, half not)
                        Shit I shouldn’t have said that.  
                        Don’t tell your parents.  

           More laughter.  
                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        Okayyy.  Let’s move on.  So beyond 
                        prayer... 

           Sam raises her hand.  Ms. D nods to her.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Aerosol garlic.  

                                 MS. D
                        That’s exactly right.  That was the 
                        weapon that could render the 
                        vampires helpless.  Easy to mass 
                        produce, easy to deploy.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Seems kind of cowardly doesn’t it?

                                 MS. D
                        I’m sorry?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I guess I was just curious because 
                        we talk about chemical warfare now 
                        like it’s this hideous thing, but 
                        isn’t aerosol garlic essentially 
                        chemical warfare against vampires?

                                 MS. D
                        It’s an astute analogy.  But 
                        realistically -

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Realistically we gassed a bunch of 
                        people that look like us but 
                        they’re just a little different.  

                                 MS. D
                        I’m going to stop you there Sam.  
                        If you’d like to have a 
                        conversation during my office 
                        hours, fine - but this is not 
                        appropriate and I need to move 
                        through this material.  Okay?

           Sam looks down at her desk.  

                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        Moving on.
           EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT

           A game in progress.  Sam sits on the sidelines.  In the 
           stands, CLARKE, DAVE AND OTHER LACROSSE GUYS stand together, 
           shirtless, chests painted with the school initials, cheering.  

           Sam stares at them.  Stares at Clarke, at his body, 
           shimmering in the early summer heat.  

           On the field, Mandy, Annabeth (nose still bandaged) and 
           Claire are the forwards - three other girls on the field.  

           Claire rolls her ankle.  Mrs. Waffenhopper taps Sam.  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        You’re up Sam.  

           Sam takes a SWIG FROM HER WATER BOTTLE. She takes a deep 
           breath.  The night air is cold and she is alive.  She runs 
           onto the field.

                                 CLARKE
                        Yeah, let’s go Sam!

                                 OTHER LAX GUYS
                        Yeah!!  Go Sam!

           Play resumes.  Sam gets the ball.  She handles it 
           effortlessly, with an almost inhuman grace.  She gets stopped 
           up by two defenders - passes it to MANDY.  

           Mandy tries to take a shot - is intercepted - but SAM swoops 
           in and scores.  Mandy, disappointed, jogs back into position.

                                                      CUT TO:

           MONTAGE -

           THIS SHIT SHOULD FEEL LIKE A DAVID FINCHER NIKE COMMERCIAL.  
           MOTION.  INTENSITY.  BETTER THAN ANY FUCKING FOOTBALL MONTAGE 
           YOU’VE EVER SEEN.  SAM IS FAST.  AGILE.  SHE HAS TO STOP 
           HERSELF FROM TRYING TOO HARD - OR SHE’D RUN THE WHOLE 
           FIELD... QUICK SHOTS -

           -SAM, WASTING THE COMPETITION, DRIBBLING AROUND THE OPPOSING 
           TEAM, MANDY AWESTRUCK... SAM SHOOTS - SHE SCORES!

           -SAM, PUTTING A VICIOUS SPIN ON A BALL FROM MIDFIELD, THE 
           BALL MOVES TO ANNABETH PERFECTLY, SETTING HER UP FOR A SHOT - 
           SHE TAKES IT - SHE SCORES!  SMILES AT SAM, THE TWO HIGH 
           FIVE...
           -SAM, HUSTLING DOWNFIELD, WHEN MANDY TRIPS HER!  SAM SPRAWLS 
           OUT, THEN JUMPS BACK UP, SHOOTING MANDY A GLARE -

           -PICKS UP THE BALL OFF MANDY IN A SCRUM - PASSES TO ANNABETH - 
           ANNABETH PASSES BACK - SAM HAMMERS HOME A GOAL!

           EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Everyone from the game meeting their parents.  Sam steps out 
           into the night air with Annabeth.  She feels relaxed, happy.  

           Clarke and Dave hang out with the other lax bros, shirtless.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Hey.  Good game Sam!

           Sam blushes.  Dave raises his hand to Annabeth.

                                 DAVE
                        Annabeth can I get a high five?

           Annabeth slaps his hand.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Thanks.  

                                 CLARKE
                        You guys killed it.  

           Just then, MANDY bounds out of the locker room up to Clarke.  
           Gives him a big hug, kissing him hard.  

                                 MANDY
                        Hey baby.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Hey babe.  

           Claire follows, hugging Dave.  

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        You guys ready?

                                 MANDY
                        Yeah! 

           They walk off together, Mandy knocking into Sam as she 
           passes.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Bitches.  
                                 ANNABETH
                        Whatever.  Want to sleep over 
                        tonight?

           Sam sees CAROLYN in her car.  Waving to her.  

           EXT. CAR - NIGHT

           Sam leans in the window to talk to Carolyn and Ken.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Absolutely not. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s just Annabeth.  You know her.  

                                 KEN
                        I think it’s fine.  She’s gonna do 
                        what she wants anyway.

           Carolyn ignores him.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Get in the car.  I’m not 
                        negotiating this with you.  

           Sam stands up straight and looks at her mom.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m not getting in the car.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        You walk away from this car you’re 
                        grounded.  You don’t leave the 
                        house.  Don’t make me get out and 
                        force you.  

           Samantha backs away from the car.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Fuck you.  

           She storms off.  Then starts to run.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go!

           Annabeth runs with her and they head for Annabeth’s beat up 
           car.  
           INT. ANNABETH'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Annabeth sits at the kitchen table, looking at People and Us 
           Weekly magazines. Sam stands at the window, looking out into 
           the night like a caged animal.  She sips hard from her water 
           bottle.  It’s drained.  Nothing.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Fuck marry kill.  Harry Styles, Joe 
                        Jonas, Zach Efron.   

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Killing all of them isn’t an option 
                        right?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh come on.  You have to like Harry 
                        Styles.  

           Sam sits down at the table, antsy.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’ll be right back.  

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sam sits alone in the bathroom.  She’s sucking on the water 
           bottle.  There’s nothing left.  She opens it and rubs her 
           finger in it, trying to mop up whatever blood she can.  

           She sits on the toilet ringing her hands, desperate.  Pulls 
           at her hair.  She wants to scream and cry all at the same 
           time.  She rocks back and forth, holding her knees.  

           A KNOCK sounds at the door.  

                                 ANNABETH (O.S.)
                        Sam you okay?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah!  Just one second!

           INT. ANNABETH'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Annabeth sits at the kitchen table looking at her magazines.  
           Sam walks back in, trying to hide her clenching fists.  She 
           looks around the room, spots a small BAR CART.  Walks up to 
           it and lifts up a bottle of vodka.  She turns to Annabeth.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Do you want to try drinking?
                                 ANNABETH
                        Really?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I mean, all the adults do it.  Why 
                        can’t we?  All they do is talk 
                        about how bad everything is, how 
                        evil everything is and I’m fucking 
                        sick of it.  Let’s get drunk.  

           Annabeth cracks a smile.

                                 ANNABETH
                        I mean - my parents won’t be home 
                        till the morning... and I want to 
                        make sure I know what it does to 
                        me... so if we’re at a party...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Let’s do this.  

           INT. ANNABETH'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Annabeth and Sam are DRUNK.  And Sam keeps drinking.  TAYLOR 
           SWIFT is blaring.  Annabeth is on a chair singing into a 
           bottle of Campari.  

                                 ANNABETH
                             (singing)
                        'Cause the players gonna play, 
                        play, play, play, play
                        And the haters gonna hate, hate, 
                        hate, hate, hate
                        Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, 
                        shake, shake, shake
                        I shake it off, I shake it off

           Sam pounds another shot.  Then walks to the fridge, opens it.  
           Inside is a package of RAW GROUND BEEF.  She opens it and 
           starts to dig into it with her hands, eating it.  

           Annabeth stops dancing and singing-

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god you’re so fucked up!  

           Sam laughs.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m hungry!  

                                 ANNABETH
                        That’s gross stop!  
           Annabeth gets off the chair and tries to pull the meat away 
           from Sam - but something shifts in Sam’s eyes - she shoves 
           Annabeth hard, across the room.  

           Both girls are stunned.  Sam sets down the meat.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry.  Are you okay?

           Annabeth gets to her feet.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah.  I’m fine.  

           INT. ANNABETH'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Annabeth and Sam are back in bed.  Sam is wide awake, still 
           drunk.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know.  Everyone says it’s 
                        wrong before you’re married.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        But everyone does it.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Did you ever think that maybe 
                        they’re lying to us about this 
                        stuff?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        No - I don’t know -

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Because - like - I want to fuck 
                        someone.  

           Annabeth laughs.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know... yeah!  I mean... I 
                        don’t know what I want.  But I want 
                        Dave.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        I want to fuck Clarke.  Like I want 
                        to ride him.

                                 ANNABETH
                        What if you get pregnant?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You can get condoms.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah I guess.  

           They lay in bed quietly.  Annabeth closes her eyes, nearly 
           asleep.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Did you ever think about what it 
                        would be like if you were a 
                        vampire?

                                 ANNABETH
                        No.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        But what if you were?

                                 ANNABETH
                        But I’m not.  I’m human.  And 
                        they’re not.  They’re made from the 
                        devil.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        But what if they weren’t?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I think you’re drunk.  

                                                      CUT TO:

           THREE HOURS LATER

           Sam and Annabeth are in bed together.  Annabeth is snoring 
           softly.  Samantha is wide awake.  And she’s pale and sweating 
           again.  She needs a fix.  She gets up.

           EXT. ANNABETH’S - NIGHT

           Samantha steps out into the moonlight.  She pauses, smelling 
           the night air, feeling at home.  Crickets thunder.  The 
           forest beyond the house is a symphony, at least to Sam.  
           A lone DEER wanders through the yard, nibbling on grass.  Sam 
           watches it.  Her fangs start to grow.  

           She pads softly up to it.  The deer looks at her.  Looks 
           right at her.  But it’s almost as if it’s looking past her.  
           It’s seeing her but not feeling her.  

           IN ONE ULTRA SWIFT MOVEMENT SHE TACKLES IT TO THE GROUND... 
           It jerks... She wrestles it... Then sinks her now grown 
           canines into it’s neck.  

           It kicks and spasms, then grows weaker.  Sam drinks, her eyes 
           roll into the back of her head, she passes out like a junkie 
           that just pushed off.  

           EXT. ANNABETH’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Sam comes to.  The sun is just starting to light up the sky.  
           There’s a glow in the air.  She looks at the deer.  Drinks 
           again.  

           TIME CUT:

           TO SAM, now with several GIRLS’ LACROSSE WATER BOTTLES on the 
           ground.  Sam hugs the deer carcass, lifting it up.  A steady 
           trickle of blood fills the water bottle.  It’s awkward for a 
           small girl to be holding a massive deer and trying to get 
           it’s blood to trickle into a tiny water bottle... but Sam is 
           managing... somehow the deer doesn’t seem all that heavy to 
           her.

           Until she hears off screen the sound of A CAR APPROACHING.  
           She drops the deer, grabs her water bottles, screws the top 
           on the last... rushes into the bushes as A CAR PULLS INTO THE 
           DRIVE WAY.  It slows, then stops right by the deer.  

           Annabeth’s parents CRYSTAL and GREG (late 40s) emerge from 
           the car and walk up to the dead deer, it’s head almost 
           dangling off.

                                 GREG
                        Jesus.  

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Could it be a wolf?

                                 GREG
                        Let’s go inside and check on the 
                        girls.  

           IN THE BUSHES - 
           Sam panics.  Quickly and quietly moves through the woods at 
           the perimeter of the house, going as fast as she can...

           Inside, Crystal and Greg have just walked in the door.  

                                 GREG (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Girls!  

           Sam panics.  Annabeth’s window is on the second story.  How 
           is she going to get back up there?  

           She tries climbing on the gutter - but the gutter starts to 
           bend and creak.  She springs off the side of the house - and 
           rockets almost twenty feet away, landing on her feet. She’s 
           startled - did she really just jump that far? 

           She jumps a few times on the ground, in place, feeling a 
           spring in her legs.  

           Then backs up and RUNS TOWARDS THE HOUSE - LEAPS - AND 
           SPRINGS UP TO ANNABETH’S WINDOW!  

           She’s balanced precariously on the window ledge - trying to 
           figure out how to open the window - is prying it open - but 
           LOSES HER BALANCE!  SHE FALLS TO THE GROUND WITH A SICKENING 
           THUMP!  

           She lies still.  Did she break her neck?  

           No.  She slowly gets to her feet - and SHAKES THE FALL OFF!  

           She jumps up to the window again and manages to jimmy it 
           open, then slips inside.  

           INT. ANNABETH'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sam tucks the two water bottles full of blood into her 
           backpack then slips wordlessly into bed with Annabeth.  

           Just then, a KNOCK sounds at the door.  

           Annabeth groans.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What?  

           The door opens a crack.  Crystal peaks her head in.  

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Just got home - wanted to check on 
                        you two.  Did you see anything last 
                        night, or hear anything in the 
                        yard?
           Annabeth groans long and loud.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What?  It’s so early!    

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Okay well come down to breakfast 
                        when you’re ready.  

           INT. BELL HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sam steps into her house.  Ken sits on the couch, feet up.  
           He’s drinking a beer and it’s clearly not his first.  He 
           doesn’t look at Sam.  Keeps watching his game.  

                                 KEN
                        Your mother is at work right now.  
                        So we can save up for you to go to 
                        college.  What do you think about 
                        that?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Can I go upstairs?

                                 KEN
                        No you can’t go upstairs.  You can 
                        stand there and talk to me.  Your 
                        mother is at work right now and 
                        she’s very upset with you.

           Sam pauses.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 KEN
                        She knows you’re a good kid but we 
                        worry.  We have to worry.  We’re 
                        your parents.  

           Sam nods.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        You understand?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yes, I understand.  

           Ken takes a long sip off his beer.  He’s pretty drunk.  

                                 KEN
                        Did I ever tell you about my 
                        sister?  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        No... I didn’t know you had a 
                        sister.  

                                 KEN
                        Yeah.  Rosie.  She was six years 
                        older.  

           Ken stares into the middle distance, collecting his thoughts.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        I thought she was so cool.  She was 
                        so cool.  She was kind of a punk.  
                        People dressed punk back then.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What happened to her?  

           Ken finishes his beer and crushes the can.  

                                 KEN
                        They turned her.  We don’t know how 
                        it happened.  She was just one of 
                        them, and she left.  And I never 
                        saw her again.  Probably got killed 
                        in an aerosol attack.  They burned 
                        the bodies, right away so... we 
                        don’t know.  She was cool though.  
                        Kind of a bad bitch.  You know what 
                        I mean?  

           Sam nods.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I think so.  

                                 KEN
                        There’s dishes in the sink for you 
                        to do.  Once you’re done with those 
                        you can start your homework.  

           Sam sighs heavily.  Turns to go.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Sam.  You know I love you and I 
                        never want to lose you, right?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  

           She walks off.
           INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Alone in her room, Sam tries to do her homework.  But she’s 
           having trouble focusing.  She keeps staring at her water 
           bottle.  She picks it up and takes a sip.  Then another.  
           Then gets into bed with it and takes a long sip, grinning 
           stupidly to herself.  

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING

           It’s a normal school day.  Kids are stuffing books into 
           lockers, hefting backpacks, talking.  

           And then there’s SAM.  

           And we slow way the fuck down.  She takes a tiny sip from her 
           water bottle.  

           And we watch her fucking sneer at all these little shit heads 
           at school.  She’s blood high and has all the swagger of Lou 
           Reed Live in Paris.  Every step she takes screams fuck you, I 
           don’t give a shit, I’m doped out of my mind.

           She wears all black.  Her skin has gotten more pale, but her 
           blisters are gone.  Her clothing is an effortless high school 
           fuck you cool.  If Joan Jett had a daughter with The Dude and 
           she was a real bad bitch.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Since when are you goth?  

           Sam steps up and gets in her face.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What the fuck did you say to me?

           Claire backs off.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Calm down, freak.  

           Sam pushes her against a locker.  There’s something scary in 
           her eyes - something beyond a teenage girl.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Call me a freak again you fucking 
                        cunt.  Do it.  See what happens.  
                        Give me a reason to break your 
                        little fuckface pug nose.   

                                 CLAIRE
                        Listen, I was just joking around.  
           Sam leans into her close, pushing her against the locker.  
           Slowly grabs her throat.  Leans into her ear.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I don’t think your jokes are funny.  

           Sam turns and walks to her locker.  Claire peels herself off 
           the wall, trying to pretending that the thing she just saw in 
           Sam’s eyes didn’t scare her.  

           INT. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Ms. D has a large map pulled down.   

                                 MS. D
                        Now it was right around the second 
                        battle of New York that US led 
                        forces captured a live vampire and 
                        we were able to understand the true 
                        extent of their abomination.  In a 
                        series of experiments, we located 
                        their few weaknesses.  

           Sam raises her hand.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        So they did the experiments on live 
                        vampires?  Isn’t that torture?

                                 MS. D
                        People get tortured.  Vampires are 
                        not people.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What did they do wrong?  

                                 MS. D
                        Samantha don’t be ridiculous.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        But we attacked them first!  In New 
                        York.  That’s what we just learned.

                                 MS. D
                        Sam you have to take the Federal 
                        test on this material in less than 
                        a week and we still have a lot left 
                        to cover.  I too am interested in 
                        nuance and ethics, but 
                        unfortunately the Federal 
                        government is not.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MS. D (CONT'D)
                        For now let’s assume the official 
                        US Department of Education “every-
                        vampire-is-Satan-history” is the 
                        truth so you can pass this test and 
                        we can all move on with our lives.  
                        Capice?

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           School is out.  Kids rush to cars, head off to sports, etc.  
           Sam steps out into the harsh light.  She immediately pulls 
           the hood of her sweatshirt up and rummages in her backpack...  

           Out of nowhere, she hears - 

                                 CLARKE (O.S.)
                        I love the way you keep fucking 
                        with Ms. D.  

           Sam turns to find Clarke grinning, backpack slung over his 
           shoulder.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Thanks.  

                                 CLARKE
                        You’re pissing her off so much.  

           Sam shrugs.  Looks in her backpack and grabs a sunglasses 
           case, pulling it out.

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m having a little party tonight, 
                        in honor of NAV day.  You should 
                        come.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m grounded.  My parents think I’m 
                        doing drugs.  

           Clarke smiles and touches Sam’s arm flirtatiously.

                                 CLARKE
                        That’s terrible Samantha.  What 
                        kind of girl are you?

           Sam puts on her shades and zips up her bag.  She smiles back, 
           coy.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I guess I’m figuring that out.  

           She walks off.
           INT. PHARMACY - DAY

           A big chain pharmacy.  Sam and Annabeth roam the aisles, 
           chatting in low voices.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t think it’s a good idea.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Let’s just see if we can buy them.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What if someone sees us getting 
                        them?

           They get to a greeting card section and pretend to peruse the 
           cards.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m doing it.  And if my parents 
                        find out, whatever.  We got drunk, 
                        and we’re fine.  We didn’t get 
                        struck by lightening.  I think our 
                        parents are bullshit.  So yeah, 
                        fuck it.

           At the end of the aisle is the PHARMACY COUNTER.  Over the 
           counter... among the boxes of SUDAFED and other over-the-
           counter drugs are also stacked CONDOMS.  

           A sign reads: MUST BE OVER 21 TO PURCHASE CONDOMS WITH VALID 
           ID.  SALES ARE TRACKED AND RECORDED.  

           Sam walks up to the counter.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        How much are the condoms?  

           The PHARMACIST, bored, eyes Sam.  

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Are you over 21?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Can I see some ID?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Oh I forgot it at home.  

           The Pharmacist points to the SIGN, even more bored.  
                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Shoot okay.  

           Sam walks back to Annabeth.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Let’s just go before someone sees 
                        us.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        This is stupid.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Let’s go.  Come on.  

           Sam watches as the Pharmacist heads to the back to answer a 
           ringing phone.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Okay.  

           Annabeth turns to go - and Sam suddenly VAULTS THE PHARMACY 
           COUNTER, GRABS A BOX OF CONDOMS, JAMS IT INTO HER JACKET, 
           VAULTS THE COUNTER BACK.... ALL IN A MATTER OF SECONDS!  

           She follows Annabeth out nonchalantly... but the store ALARM 
           sounds as they pass through the anti-theft gates... 

                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        Girls - mind if I check your bags?

           Sam grabs Annabeth’s arm.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        RUN!

           The two girls BARREL OUT INTO THE NIGHT!  

           EXT. EDEN PRAIRIE STREETS - NIGHT

           THE GIRLS RUSH DOWN AN ALLEY BEHIND THE WALGREENS... ON THEIR 
           LEFT IS A LOW CHAIN LINK FENCE...

                                 ANNABETH
                        DID YOU TAKE SOMETHING?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        JUST RUN!  

           SAM VAULTS TO THE TOP OF THE CHAIN LENGTH FENCE... ANNABETH 
           STRUGGLES TO CLIMB IT - SAM, BALANCING ON TOP OF THE FENCE, 
           GRABS HER ARM AND IN ONE SWIFT MOTION PULLS HER UP AND OVER 
           IT, DROPPING HER ONTO THE OTHER SIDE!
           THEY KEEP RUNNING... DOWN A RAVINE TO -

           RAILROAD TRACKS

           THEY RUSH ACROSS THE TRACKS AND KEEP RUNNING... FINALLY 
           STOPPING UNDER A QUIET BRIDGE.  

           They catch their breath, panting, then start to laugh.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What did you steal??

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I got them.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What?

           Sam pulls the box of condoms out of her jacket.  

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        How did you do that??

                                 SAMANTHA
                        He wasn’t looking!  

                                 ANNABETH
                        You’re fucking nuts!  

           INT. ANNABETH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam sits at Annabeth’s computer as Annabeth puts on make-up.  
           Sam punches into GOOGLE: 

           “how to put on a condom”

           Hits search.  Annabeth looks over her shoulder - panics for a 
           moment -

                                 ANNABETH
                        Don’t do that on my computer!

           The search results come up - but they’re blurred out.  Over 
           the entire website, the SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
           comes up and a warning.  

           THIS CONTENT IS RESTRICTED.  MUST BE 21 OR OLDER TO ACCESS.  
           INPUT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO PROCEED.  

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        Thank God.  
           Annabeth goes back to her make up.  Sam unwraps a condom and 
           rolls it onto her finger.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Think it’s like this?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know.  Probably. 

           Sam wears a black skirt, black jean jacket and black tank 
           top.  She pulls on big black Doc Martens.  

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        Sam - it’s an NAV  party.  Don’t 
                        you think you should wear something 
                        red white and blue?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t stand that shit right now.  
                        I don’t know why.  

           Annabeth shrugs, zips up a preppy white dress.

           INT. CLARKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A high school party in full swing.  Kids hang out on sofas, 
           drinking beer out of cans... BUT EVERYONE IS DRESSED LIKE A 
           VAMPIRE.  White painted faces.  Heavy eye make up.  Everyone 
           has holes in their neck and fake blood.  

           Annabeth and Sam step in, awestruck.  Annabeth sticks out 
           like a sore thumb.  At a table in the front hall there’s 
           VAMPIRE MAKE UP laid out, and two mirrors.  Two LAX GUYS and 
           a CHEERLEADER TYPE (16-18) are there putting on make up and 
           drinking.  Sam and Annabeth walk up and look at the face 
           paint...

           INT. CLARKE'S HOUSE - BAR AREA - NIGHT

           Sam and Annabeth wander into the bar area, now in full 
           vampire make up - pale, dark eyes, fake holes in their necks.  

           Clarke and his friend DAVE (17) hammer a shot of tequila.  
           Clarke looks up.

                                 CLARKE
                        You made it!

           He gives Sam a big hug.  Suddenly MANDY appears... walks up 
           to Annabeth and gives her a hug -
                                 MANDY
                        Hey girl!  What the fuck!  How are 
                        you?

           Annabeth hugs her back.  

                                 MANDY (CONT’D)
                        Why is the weirdo here?

           Mandy hangs on Clarke, arm around him.

                                 CLARKE
                        Cause I invited her.

           Clarke smiles at Sam.  Sam smiles back.  

                                 MANDY
                        That’s so funny!  Maybe she’ll kill 
                        herself in front of all of us 
                        tonight.  That would be so funny, 
                        seeing a freak like her just die.  
                        Don’t you think?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mandy are you such a bitch because 
                        you’ve never been fucked?

           Clarke starts laughing with Dave.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Oh shit!

                                 MANDY
                        Um, what?  
                             (to Clarke)
                        Are you gonna let her say that to 
                        me?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You need him to defend you?  Now I 
                        know you’ve never fucked him.  

           Sam takes a step closer to Mandy and Clarke.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I can tell by the look in your 
                        eyes.  Because fucking feels good, 
                        and people like it.  And it’s clear 
                        you don’t know what that’s like.

           Clarke is blushing.  Sam turns to him and puts a hand on his 
           chest, getting closer.  
                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                             (coy)
                        Have you fucked her?

                                 MANDY
                        That’s none of your business.

           Clarke shakes his head, laughing.  Mandy is on the verge of 
           tears.  Clarke gives her nothing, just a suppressed smirk.  
           Sam reaches her hand up and touches Clarke’s hair.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What are you afraid of Mandy?  If 
                        you fuck and feel good some vampire 
                        is gonna come suck your blood.  
                        Like me?

           Sam fake lunges at Mandy.  Mandy jumps back.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        Oh my God why are you even with 
                        her?  She sucks.  

           Clarke shrugs.  Mandy storms off.  Clarke doesn’t follow her, 
           his gaze fixed on Sam now.  

                                 CLARKE
                        We need to do a “welcome to the 
                        party” shot.  Don’t you think?

                                 ANNABETH
                        What are they doing?

                                 DAVE
                        Vampire shots. 

           Clarke grabs a salt shaker and some lime holds them up to 
           Sam.  

                                 CLARKE
                        I think we should all try it - 
                        don’t you?

           Sam smiles.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  Show me.  

           Clarke rubs the lime on her neck, then sprinkles salt.  On 
           the other side of her neck, repeats, with powdered sugar.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Aren’t you going to do me?
           Sam grabs a lime and rubs it on Clarke’s neck.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Should we do it?  

           Dave smiles and grabs a salt shaker, salts and limes 
           Annabeth, and vice-versa.

           They’re all ready now.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Okay.  One two three BLOOD!

           Sam and Clarke lick each other’s necks, then take the shot.  
           Sam coughs a little.  Clarke plunges his mouth onto Sam’s 
           neck, licking up the sugar, and Sam tries to follow suit, but 
           she misses her mark, laughing.  

           She’s a little off balance, Clarke leans into her, pulls her 
           head to his neck, she licks it, then presses her mouth down 
           on his neck.  

           We’re tight on Sam’s face.  She can feel his blood pumping, 
           just under the skin.  Her eyes are wide.  She’s jonesing.  
           She pulls her head back and kisses Clarke.  

                                                      TIME CUT TO:

           INT. CLARKE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Sam, Clarke, Annabeth, Dave, take another shot.  They’re 
           definitely drunk now.  Nearby the dance party is ramping up.  
           Music blares.  Kids smoke, drink and grind on each other.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What do you think?  Are we blood 
                        drunk now?  

                                 DAVE
                        I am definitely blood drunk.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Do you ever wonder what that would 
                        be like?  Being blood drink?

                                 DAVE
                        We learned about this in AP Bio.  
                        We have dopamine receptors.  They 
                        have something else, and the shit 
                        that hits them like opioids is 
                        human blood.  And it’s just like 
                        this thing they can’t get enough 
                        of.  
           Sam turns to Annabeth.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I dare you to try Dave’s blood.

           Sam grabs a kitchen knife hand hands it to Annabeth.  
           Annabeth looks at her, horrified.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        That’s so fucked up.  

           Dave and Clarke are grinning.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Come on.  See if you have the 
                        receptor.

           Dave leans into Annabeth.   

                                 DAVE
                        I dare you...

                                 ANNABETH
                        Don’t be disgusting.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s just a joke Annabeth.  I’ll do 
                        it if you do it.  

           She turns to Clarke.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?  Do you dare me 
                        to drink your blood?  

           Clarke takes the knife and pricks his finger.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Yeah.  I dare you.  

           He hands the knife to Dave.  

           Sam takes Clarke’s finger, eyes the blood slowly dripping 
           from the small cut.  Her mouth is watering.  She smiles at 
           him seductively.  

                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        Well?  

           Sam takes the finger in her mouth, starts to suck on it... 
           Keeps sucking it, sliding the finger deeper in her mouth, in 
           and out, miming fellatio.  She pulls away and smiles at 
           Clarke.  
                                 CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        That was hot.  

           Sam turns to Annabeth.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Try it.  

           Dave pricks himself.  

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah.  Try my blood.  In honor of 
                        NAV Day, and all the dead vamps out 
                        there.  Do it!

                                 ANNABETH
                        Ew.  No.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Come on.  Don’t be a pussy.  

           Sam looks at her, takes Clarke’s finger back in her mouth, 
           starts sucking it.  Pulls it out.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  Suck!  

                                 DAVE
                        Suck!  Suck! Suck!

           Sam freezes - carefully wipes the blood from her mouth.  She 
           gets off of Clarke.  The COPS SUDDENLY GROW ALERT - TAKE A 
           STEP BACK - 

           Sam looks at Clarke.  He’s covered in blood.  Her blood.  She 
           still has her period.  He stands up, swaying unsteadily.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Everything is okay.

           The Cop shuts the door.  

           Clarke is unsteady.  Sam is panicked.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        My parents are going to fucking 
                        kill me.  

           Clarke stares at the blood on his body.  

                                 CLARKE
                        Your parents?  Are you kidding me?  
                        This is fucking disgusting.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry... I didn’t think...

                                 CLARKE
                        Why would you fuck me when you’re 
                        on your period?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I don’t know... I just wanted to, I 
                        didn’t think you would care...

                                 CLARKE
                        Just get out of here.  

           Clarke walks to the adjoining bathroom and shuts the door.  

           Sam sits on the bed for a moment, alone, thinking.  Then she 
           smiles.  And she just starts to laugh to herself.  Laughs a 
           little harder.  Then walks to the window, her clothes balled 
           up in her hand and climbs out.  

           EXT. CLARKE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

           Sam pulls on her clothes on the roof, quickly and quietly.  
           Below the house, cuffed kids are loaded into vans.  She 
           crawls along the roof to another WINDOW.  She peers inside 
           another BEDROOM sees Dave putting on his shirt.  She keeps 
           crawling, to the next window, where she peers into a KID’S 
           BATHROOM.  Inside, Sam can see through the darkness ANNABETH, 
           sitting in the bath tub behind the shower curtain.  

           She taps on the window.  Annabeth sees her.  Comes to the 
           window and opens it.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Come out here.  They won’t check 
                        the roof.  

           Annabeth looks out.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t know.  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        It will be fine.  

           Annabeth unsteadily starts to crawl out on the roof.  Sam 
           steadies her.  The two crawl to the highest part of the roof 
           and lay down flat next to each other.  The stars and the moon 
           are bright.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah.  

           They lay there, talking in HUSHED WHISPERS.

                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        Did you guys hook up?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What did you do?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What do you think?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I gave Dave a blowjob.  That’s all 
                        we did.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You did?  What did it taste like?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Salty shampoo.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s so weird.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What did you do?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I fucked him.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Wow.  What was it like?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I got blood on him... from my 
                        period. 
           Annabeth stifles a laugh.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Ew!!!  Are you kidding?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What is the big deal!!  I thought 
                        he’d want to!

           They lay on their backs.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Thanks for finding me.  

           Annabeth squeezes Sam’s hand.  Sam smiles and squeezes back.  

           INT. BELL HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Sam is in black jeans and a dirty black t-shirt.  She looks 
           as pale as she’s ever looked.  She’s bent over a cereal bowl.  
           Carolyn does dishes.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I heard there was a big party this 
                        weekend.  A lot of kids got 
                        arrested.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I was at Annabeth’s house.

           Carolyn scrubs a pot.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s getting harder to trust you 
                        Samantha.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Well I didn’t get arrested did I?  
                        Wouldn’t that be one clue for you?

           Sam finishes her cereal and takes it over to the sink.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Annabeth is picking me up.  

           Sam grabs her backpack and stuffs her water bottle into it.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        What’s in the water bottle?

           Sam freezes.  Carolyn walks up to her and pulls the water 
           bottle out of her backpack.  
                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been awfully attached to it 
                        lately.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Give it back.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        You think I don’t know that trick?  
                        You think kids weren’t doing that 
                        at my age at school?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Please - mom - it’s not that - 

           Sam reaches for the bottle - Carolyn holds it out of reach.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        So you’re getting drunk at school 
                        then?

           Carolyn starts to unscrew the water bottle top.  Samantha 
           grabs for it.  Carolyn jerks it back - spilling BLOOD all 
           over herself.  

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s just a joke, I swear - 

                                 CAROLYN
                        A joke?  This is blood.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s just a joke... ask Annabeth... 
                        I swear...

           INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Annabeth and Sam sit in a small waiting area in the hallway.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where did you even get blood?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        From that deer in your front yard. 

           Annabeth gives her nothing.  
                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Look I’m sorry, okay?  I didn’t 
                        want to get you in trouble but my 
                        mom went psycho... Can you just go 
                        along with me?  Say it was gonna be 
                        a prank on Mandy because she’s been 
                        bullying us?

                                 ANNABETH
                        Why would I help you?  This is 
                        totally fucked.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Because we’re friends!

                                 ANNABETH
                        Everyone thinks I’m a slut now 
                        because of you.  

           Sam takes a breath.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What?

                                 ANNABETH
                        You wanted to hook up so badly.  
                        And you made me get drunk and then 
                        I hooked up with Dave.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You’ve had a crush on him for like 
                        a year.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I didn’t want to do that.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s not my fault.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        People are talking about you.  

           Sam stares at her.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What are they saying?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        That you bit Clarke’s neck.  He 
                        said he was bleeding after.

           Sam turns red.  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        I was drunk... I told you...

           The school psychiatrist MR. BENISTE (50) pops out of his 
           office.  

                                 MR. BENISTE
                        Annabeth and Samantha?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  That’s us.  

                                 MR. BENISTE
                        Ready for you now.  

           INT. SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sam and Annabeth sit with a sensitive guy who looks like Sean 
           Hannity, MR. BENISTE (50).  

                                 MR. BENISTE
                        Look I was a kid once.  And I get 
                        it, vampires, blood - it’s taboo.  
                        They’re bad.  It’s fun to be bad.  
                        Am I right?

           Sam lets out a breath.  She’s going to have to do this.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.  I guess so.  

           Annabeth still isn’t speaking.  

                                 MR. BENISTE
                        What about you Annabeth?  You’ve 
                        been pretty quiet.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I think it’s disgusting.  

                                 MR. BENISTE
                        Okay.  Say more about that.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I think it’s perverted that Sam 
                        thought squirting blood would be 
                        funny and I think, I just think 
                        it’s fucking disgusting.  And I 
                        think she’s disgusting.  And I 
                        don’t know why I have to be in a 
                        room with her.  She’s sick.  
                                 MR. BENISTE
                        Okay Annabeth.  Let’s calm down.  
                        You’re feeling lots of emotions 
                        right now.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        It’s like she wants to be a vampire 
                        or something.  There’s something 
                        wrong with her.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I don’t - it was just a joke -

                                 MR. BENISTE
                        Okay, okay guys.  Let’s agree that 
                        nobody wants to be a vampire.  We 
                        know that.  Sam is expressing a 
                        kind of rebellion, that isn’t real.  
                        And your friendship is important to 
                        her.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Can I go?  

           INT. BELL HOME - NIGHT

           Sam gets home.  Carolyn is with an ADT TECHNICIAN.  

           Sam pauses in the foyer, looking at her mom.  Carolyn 
           notices, approaches. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        We’re just having a security system 
                        installed.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Why?

                                 CAROLYN
                        To be safe.  

           Sam looks around the room - control panel.  Sensors.  Carolyn 
           turns to Sam.  

                                 CAROLYN (CONT’D)
                             (pointed)
                        Now we’ll know if anyone opens a 
                        window to the house in the middle 
                        of the night.
           INT. BELL HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sam eats with her parents.  Chicken marsala is on the menu 
           tonight.  And Sam is fucking hungry.  But it’s not enough.  
           The meat is just not enough.  She eats it, faster and faster.  
           Ken is drunk.  

                                 KEN
                        Very exciting security system.  Did 
                        you see it Sam?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah. 

                                 KEN
                        I think it’s so exciting don’t you 
                        Mommy?

            Carolyn is silent, keeps eating.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think she’s up to?  
                        Just sneaking off, doing drugs, 
                        having sex with boys?  

           Quiet.  Sam stops eating.  

           He reaches over and squeezes Sam - knocking over his water 
           glass in the progress.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        You gonna be trouble kiddo?  

           Carolyn immediately jumps up and starts to clean it up.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Shut up Ken.  

                                 KEN
                        Who me?  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Shut up.  

                                 KEN
                        What?  Do you think Sam is going to 
                        suck my blood?  

           Carolyn stands up, storms away from the table.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?  Are you afraid I’m 
                        going to help Sam score drugs?
           He takes a sloppy bite of food.  

                                 KEN (CONT’D)
                        Your mom’s a real fucking bitch 
                        isn’t she?   

           Sam stares at her plate, about to cry.  

           INT. BELL HOME - SAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sam lays in bed - but she can’t sleep.  She’s dope sick.  She 
           wants blood.  

           INT. BELL HOME  - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sam stands in front of the fridge in the darkened kitchen.  
           Inside she sees frozen hamburger meat.  She pulls it out.  

                                                      CUT TO:

           INT. BELL HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sam, standing in front of the microwave, lit by its dim bulb.  

                                                      CUT TO:

           INT. BELL HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sam, sitting at the kitchen table, eating defrosted but not 
           cooked raw beef, quietly, hungrily.  

           She doesn’t notice when Carolyn quietly enters the room.  
           Carolyn watches Sam, confusion and horror on her face.  

                                 CAROLYN
                             (quiet)
                        What are you doing?

           Sam stops eating.  Looks up at her mother.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah sorry.  I -

                                 CAROLYN
                        That’s not cooked.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I think it is - I microwaved it...

           Carolyn stares at her.  
                                 CAROLYN
                        It’s okay.  Goodnight honey.

           INT. MS. D'S OFFICE - DAY

           Sam steps into Ms. D’s office.  Sam looks ragged.  Ms. D is 
           putting books and other items from her desk into a box.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Why are you putting your stuff in 
                        boxes?

           Ms. D doesn’t look up from her packing.

                                 MS. D
                        Cause one of your shit head 
                        classmates - excuse my French - 
                        reported me to the school and... 
                        I’m going to be looking for a new 
                        job now.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Are you okay?

                                 MS. D
                        I’m an adult, I’ll be just fine.

           Ms. D looks up at Sam.  Sees the hurt and concern on her 
           face.  

                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay Sam?  Come here, sit 
                        down.  

           Sam sits across from Ms. D at the desk.  Sam wipes her eyes.  
           Tears gathering.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I just want to know if they could 
                        be like us.  If they wanted to. 
                        Vampires.

                                 MS. D
                        Sam - is that why you’re in my 
                        office?  To ask me about vampires?  
                        Let’s talk about you.  Are you 
                        okay?

           Sam sighs and squirms a little in her seat.  

                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s my parents.  They just... they 
                        think I’m this bad kid.  And I’m 
                        not.  I’m trying to be good but 
                        it’s really hard.  

                                 MS. D
                        Of course it is.  I get it.  It’s 
                        not easy being a teenager.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        So what do I do? 

                                 MS. D
                        You ask for help.  You try to talk 
                        to your parents.  If that doesn’t 
                        work - Mr. Beniste the school 
                        social worker is very -

           Sam calms a little, staring straight ahead.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I met him.  He’s a condescending 
                        prick.   

           Ms. D laughs.

                                 MS. D
                        Yeah I could see that.  Well 
                        listen.  You can talk to me.  

           Ms. D takes a post it and scribbles out a phone number on it.  

                                 MS. D (CONT’D)
                        This is my cell.  If you really 
                        need something, you can call me.  
                        Okay?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Thanks Ms. D.

           EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - DAY

           Sam, clad head to toe in long-sleeve clothes and wearing 
           sunglasses and a hat, runs a passing drill with MANDY.  She’s 
           sluggish - she needs blood.  Mandy hits the ball out of reach 
           of Sam.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Come on.  

                                 MANDY
                        Sorry slut.  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        What did you call me?  

                                 MANDY
                        I heard about what you and Annabeth 
                        did at the party.  You’re total 
                        whores.  The whole school knows.  

           Sam takes a deep breath.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Are you gonna pass me the ball or 
                        not?  

           Mrs. Waffenhopper sees the girls not running their drill.  

                                 MRS. WAFFENHOPPER
                        Girls?  Is there a problem?  

                                 MANDY
                        No Mrs. Waffenhopper.  

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Sam walks home from school alone, wearing sunglasses, black 
           jean jacket, black jeans, black sneakers and a black hat.  As 
           she rounds a corner she spots MANDY AND CLAIRE beating up 
           ANNABETH, who is just trying to get away.  They knock her to 
           the ground and start to kick her.  She curls up, CRYING 
           OUT... SAM RUSHES TOWARDS THEM, ADRENALINE KICKING IN -

                        Hey!  

           Sam starts running, and suddenly she’s on them, yanking 
           Claire away.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 MANDY
                        We’re showing Annabeth what happens 
                        to sluts.  

           Mandy kicks Annabeth again.  Annabeth lets out a YELP!

                                 MANDY (CONT’D)
                        You’re next slut.  

           Claire walks up to Sam and swings at her - but Sam’s reflexes 
           are too fast - she ducks the swing and SHOVES CLAIRE - CLAIRE 
           GOES FLYING, TUMBLING OVER HERSELF IN THE GRASS.  She 
           staggers to her feet, dazed.  
           Mandy looks in shock at Sam.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What?  You want some?

                                 MANDY
                        You fucking bitch!

           Mandy picks up her LACROSSE STICK AND COMES STRAIGHT AT SAM, 
           SWINGING IT HARD - SAM DUCKS THE STICK ONCE, TWICE, THEN 
           CATCHES IT WITH HER BARE HANDS - MANDY TRIES TO PULL THE 
           STICK AWAY FROM SAM BUT CAN’T - 

           CLAIRE RUNS UP WITH HER STICK AND SMASHES IT OVER SAM’S 
           HEAD... THE STICK CRACKS... SAM IS STUNNED FOR A MOMENT... 
           STAGGERS... HER HEAD IS BLEEDING SLIGHTLY...

           CLAIRE AND MANDY BACK AWAY FOR A MOMENT... WHAT DID THEY DO?  

           BUT SAM... SHAKES IT OFF!!  GRABS THE STICK OUT OF MANDY’S 
           HANDS AND BREAKS IT IN HALF OVER HER KNEE!  

           A HALF A LACROSSE STICK IN EACH HAND SHE GOES AT CLAIRE AND 
           MANDY - STRIKING MANDY IN THE ARM HARD, THEN CHEST, THEN 
           LEGS, KNOCKING HER TO THE GROUND...

           SHE LOOKS UP TO FIND CLAIRE RUNNING AWAY!  TAKES A HALF OF 
           THE LACROSSE STICK AND HURLS IT AT CLAIRE - THE STICK HITS 
           CLAIRE IN THE BACK AND KNOCKS HER TO THE GROUND!  

           Sam pants, clutching her knees for a second.  Then looks over 
           to Annabeth, who has staggered to her feet.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Are you okay?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I think my arm is broken.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Let’s go to my house and get help.  

           Sam puts Annabeth’s good arm around her and they limp off.  

           INT. BELL HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

           Sam gets home with Annabeth, shocked to find Ken and Carolyn 
           are waiting with several UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS.  Sam 
           freezes.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It wasn’t our fault - they attacked 
                        us -
                                 KEN
                        Sam, calm down.  

           Annabeth, upset, in pain, on the verge of tears-

                                 ANNABETH
                        What’s happening?  

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’ll call your mother.  Come with 
                        me.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Annabeth needs help!  Her arm might 
                        be broken!

           Carolyn leads Annabeth into a different room.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 KEN
                        Your mother has some concerns, so 
                        she made a phone call.  And when 
                        this is all over, I don’t know, 
                        we’ll laugh.  But you’re going to 
                        have to go with the police to get 
                        some tests done.  

           Carolyn comes back into the room.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Where’s Annabeth?

                                 CAROLYN 
                        I called her mother.  She’s coming 
                        to pick her up.  

           The Sergeant grabs Sam’s arm.  

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Miss we’re going to take you to a 
                        safe place, where you’ll be given a 
                        very simple health exam.  That’s 
                        all.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Dad - mom - please just tell them - 

           The Sergeant starts to cuff her.  

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        This is only procedure.  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Where are you taking me?

           Samantha’s muscles tense.  She quivers with an explosive rage 
           bigger than her body.  She stares at her mother.  She can’t 
           stop crying.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        Take her.

           INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           A nurse draws blood from Sam, who is cuffed to a bed, hand 
           and foot.  Several cops mill around her.  Everyone is quiet.  
           But Sam’s hearing is more acute than ever.  Around the corner 
           she can hear - 

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The POLICE SERGEANT (60), weathered, talks to the CHIEF OF 
           POLICE (35), baby faced.

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Sir I feel it’s my duty to inform 
                        you that our department hasn’t 
                        stocked anti-Vampire ordinance in a 
                        decade.  

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        Come on Sergeant.  Some lady thinks 
                        her teen partying means she’s a 
                        vampire?  Give me a break.  Don’t 
                        worry, when this little girl kills 
                        me you’re not responsible.  

           Ken and Carolyn step into the hallway.  

                                 KEN
                        Can we see her?

                                 CHIEF OF POLICE
                        Sure, go on in.  

           Ken starts to walk into the room.  Carolyn lingers outside.  

                                 KEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 CAROLYN
                        I’m not going in there.  
                                 KEN
                        The last vampire was killed twenty-
                        five years ago.  Sam is sixteen.  
                        It is literally impossible.  And 
                        forgetting all that she’s our 
                        daughter.

                                 CAROLYN
                        You know it’s true.  

                                 KEN
                        I’m going in to talk to her.  

           INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Ken sits next to Sam, cuffed to the bed.  

                                 KEN
                        All this is going to be over soon.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Where is mom? 

                                 KEN
                        This is hard for her.  But it’s 
                        going to be okay, and you guys are 
                        going to be okay.  This is just 
                        something we have to deal with.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I want her here.  Tell her to come 
                        in. I want my mom.  

           This is killing Ken.  He stands up and walks to the door.  
           Looks out into the hallway, at someone we can’t see.  

                                 KEN
                        Please Carolyn.  

           OS we suddenly hear heavy footsteps.  Suddenly - POLICE BURST 
           INTO THE ROOM - BEGIN WHEELING SAM AWAY - SAM PANICS - 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        DAD!  WHERE ARE THEY TAKING ME?

           Ken’s face is dumbstruck.  He watches her go, not believing 
           what’s happening.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sam is rapidly wheeled down a hallway.  
                                 SWAT COP
                             (into radio)
                        With code triple 6, repeat, code 
                        triple 6, en route to main 
                        entrance.  

           As Sam is wheeled down the hospital corridor, she catches 
           sight of her mom - 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Please, Mom -

           But Carolyn just stares back at her - cold as ice.  

                                 CAROLYN
                        You thought you had us all fooled?

           Sam struggles against the handcuffs.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No.  I’m me.  I’m not fooling 
                        anyone.  Please - I’m just a girl -

                                 CAROLYN
                        You’re a little fucking monster.  

           Sam PANICS... something primal gets activated inside of 
           her... she flexes, fury rising - then SNAPS OFF THE HANDCUFFS 
           IN ONE QUICK JERK - TURNS - STANDS ON THE WHEELED GURNEY AND 
           GRABS THE SERGEANT BY THE HAIR AND LACES INTO HIS THROAT!

           COPS OPEN FIRE!  SAMANTHA’S BODY SHAKES AS 6 GLOCKS AND 2 
           SHOTGUNS PUMP HER FULL OF LEAD.

           She lays on the ground, motionless.  Calm for a moment.  The 
           COPS attend to the fallen Sergeant.  

                                 COP
                             (into radio)
                        We need additional back up, an 
                        ambulance - code triple 6 - notify 
                        state and federal authorities, I 
                        repeat, code triple 6.  

           In the midst of the commotion, Carolyn stoops down to look at 
           Sam’s body.  She starts to cry.  Suddenly, Sam’s lips start 
           to move.  Her eyes flutter open.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (whispering)
                        I’m sorry mom.  This is what I am.  

           Carolyn backs away.  
                                 CAROLYN
                        She’s alive.  

           Sam licks the blood off her lips - but Carolyn doesn’t notice 
           because she’s watching Sam’s body slowly squeeze out and 
           expel the bullets, one by one, her wounds healing 
           themselves...

           Sam jumps to her feet and runs for it - a SWAT COP gets in 
           her way - SHE JUMPS ONTO HIM AND RIPS HIS THROAT OUT, THEN 
           LAUNCHES OFF OF HIM, BLOOD SOAKED - LITERALLY BOUNCING OFF 
           WALLS AS THE COPS BEGIN OPEN FIRING AGAIN - SAM RUNNING AT 
           TOP SPEED INTO -

           THE STAIRWELL

           FLYING DOWN THE STAIRS, BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS - GETTING A 
           LEAD ON THE PURSUING COPS -

           INT. HOSPITAL - MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

           Sam tears into the lobby - and almost runs right into 
           ANNABETH - HER ARM IN A CAST - WITH HER PARENTS - 

           Annabeth hugs her hard.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m so sorry Sam.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I want to be always friends 
                        Annabeth, no matter what happens.  
                        Okay?  

           JUST THEN - COPS TROOP INTO THE ROOM AND WITHOUT WARNING OPEN 
           FIRE!!!

           BULLETS RIDDLE SAM AND ANNABETH - SAM EXPLODES INTO ACTION -
           FASTER THAN ANYONE CAN THINK OR REACT - SHE JUMPS FROM ONE 
           COP TO ANOTHER, LIKE A MASTER PREDATOR - GUNFIRE - BUT SAM IS 
           TOO FAST - RIPPING THROATS OUT - A FEW COPS GET SHOTS OFF - 
           SAM DOESN’T FLINCH - TWO, FOUR, SIX, TEN COPS, THROATS RIPPED 
           OUT, BLOOD EVERYWHERE!  

           When the last body hits the floor Sam crouches for a second, 
           catching her breath, drinking hungrily from the body... until 
           she hears a WAIL-

                                 CRYSTAL
                        MY CHILD!  MY BABY!  
           Sam rushes over - Annabeth has been shot multiple times, her 
           breathing is labored, she’s bleeding out, her eyes roll into 
           the back of her head.  

                                 CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
                        She’s not breathing!  Someone help!  

           But nobody in the hospital moves.  Sam crouches down.  

                                 CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
                        Get away from her!  Get away!  

           Sam touches Annabeth’s neck, feeling for a pulse.  She looks 
           dead.  Sam takes a shard of glass from the ground and slices 
           open her own hand... blood runs out of it...  

                                 CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m going to save her.  

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Don’t you touch her!  

           Sam flashes her fangs.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Get away!

           Crystal backs away - Sam holds her hand over Annabeth’s 
           mouth, squeezing her own blood into Annabeth’s mouth...

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Don’t...

           Annabeth stirs.  Starts to breath again.  She weakly starts 
           to suck on Sam’s hand, drinking her blood.  

                                 CRYSTAL (CONT’D)
                        Oh God.  You’re one of them.  You 
                        turned her, didn’t you?

           Annabeth eyes weakly flutter open.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s still her.  Please.  Help us.  

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Get away from me!  You killed her!  
                        You!  You made her one of them!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        She was going to die!  
                                 CRYSTAL
                        You should have let her.  She 
                        didn’t choose this.

           Sam calms, resolved.  She walks over to a DEAD COP and drinks 
           long and steady from his neck.  Stands up and wipes the blood 
           from her mouth.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Neither did I.

           Sam picks up Annabeth’s BULLET RIDDLED BACKPACK and dumps out 
           everything inside of it.  She walks up to the PHARMACY 
           COUNTER in the lobby of the hospital.  The PHARMACIST (40) 
           cowers behind the counter.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I need all of your epi-pens.  And 
                        strongest anti-histamines.  Now.  

           The Pharmacist nods, starts grabbing epi-pens and anti-
           histamines and putting them on the counter.  Sam stuffs them 
           into the backpack until it’s full.  

                                 CRYSTAL
                        They’ll get you for what you did.  
                        They’ll -

           Sam walks back over and picks up Annabeth, slinging her limp 
           body over her shoulder.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Go fuck yourself.  

           Sam carries Annabeth through the carnage, out of the 
           hospital, into the night.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Helicopters hover in the near distance, lights on, searching.  

           Sam cradles Annabeth and rushes up to the front door of a 
           simple house.  She knocks on the door.  

           MS. D answers.  

                                 MS. D
                        Come on in.
           INT. MS. D’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ms. D lays sheets on the couch, and Sam lays Annabeth on top 
           of it.  

           The TELEVISION is on.  A REPORTER speaks over footage of 
           SEARCHING HELICOPTERS and POLICE ROAD BLOCKS.  

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Police say that sixteen year old 
                        Samantha Bell tested positive for 
                        vampire anti-bodies today at a 
                        local area hospital.  It is the 
                        first confirmed sighting of a 
                        vampire on US soil since June 5th, 
                        1992, which we now celebrate as NAV 
                        Day.  The last known vampire was 
                        killed in China in 1994.  Police 
                        are urging anyone -

           Ms D. turns off the television and hands Sam a mug of tea, 
           sitting across from her.

                                 MS. D
                        We need to decide what you’re 
                        doing.  If you turn yourself in, it 
                        might not be so bad for you.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I can’t.  You know what would 
                        happen if I did.  

                                 MS. D
                        I don’t know.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Just help me Ms. D.  Please.  Help 
                        me figure out what to do.  

           Ms. D sighs, thinking.

                                 MS. D
                        You’re right.  You can’t turn 
                        yourself in.  

           Sam starts to cry.  Ms. D hugs her.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I just want to be normal again.  

                                 MS. D
                        About ten years ago there was a 
                        rumor... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MS. D (CONT'D)
                        that some vampires escaped into the 
                        north woods, across the border, in 
                        Canada.  It was winter.  They 
                        searched for them but... the 
                        terrain was too bad.  They gave up 
                        after a few weeks.  Maybe if you go 
                        there - maybe you could find 
                        someone.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Okay.  Thank you.  

           Ms. D squeezes her tighter.

                                 MS. D
                        It’s okay Sam.  I’m happy to have 
                        known you.

           INT. MS. D'S HOUSE - DAY

           Annabeth and Sam sleep.  Annabeth stirs awake.  She looks 
           around.  Sam hears her, opens her eyes, sits up.

                                 ANNABETH
                        My eyes hurt.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s just the light.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Sam - what happened?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You got shot in the chest... I 
                        thought you were dead... you were 
                        dead.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        But I’m alive.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Well... I saved you.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What?  How?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m a vampire Annabeth.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        No... No you’re not... You can’t 
                        be...
                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s why they were arresting me.  

           Annabeth is suddenly panicked.

                                 ANNABETH
                        Wait - then how did you save me?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I had to turn you.  

           The color washes from Annabeth’s face.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        No... no Sam. Don’t joke.  Don’t 
                        joke like this.  Where’s my mom?  

           Annabeth jumps to her feet.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Annabeth - please - just -

           Annabeth struggles to her feet.  She walks slowly to the door 
           to the BACKYARD - opens it - steps out into - 

           EXT. MS. D'S BACK YARD - DAY

           THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY.  Annabeth squints.  She can barely 
           keep her eyes open.  She looks at her skin.  It’s getting red 
           and warm.  

           She turns and charges back into -

           THE HOUSE

           Where Annabeth rushes up to Sam and tackles her, pulling her 
           hair, down to the ground, slapping at her - 

                                 ANNABETH
                        HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You were going to die!

                                 ANNABETH
                        YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME!  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You’d rather be dead than be like 
                        me?  What’s wrong with me?  I’m 
                        normal, I’m still me.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                        And now we can do this together.  
                        We’re best friends.  We can help 
                        each other.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I can’t do this.  I can’t live like 
                        this.  I just...

           Sam grabs a water bottle and opens it.  Annabeth is 
           immediately transfixed by the smell.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Nobody can hurt us now.  

           She holds out the bottle to Annabeth.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Just try it.  It makes you feel 
                        good.  

           Annabeth takes a step back... but she’s drawn to it.  She 
           can’t help herself.  She takes the water bottle in her hand, 
           peering inside it.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        What is it?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I got it last night.  From a deer.  

           Annabeth raises the water bottle to her nose.  Then she can’t 
           help it.  She takes a sip.  Then a swig.  Then drinks more 
           and more until it runs down her chin.  She grins stupidly, 
           doped up.  She lays back into the bed.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        It feels so good.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I know.  

           Sam takes the water bottle and polishes off the few drips 
           left.  She lays down next to Annabeth, holding her.  

           EXT. MS. D'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ms. D opens the trunk to her car. Sam, carrying Annabeth’s 
           backpack, climbs inside with Annabeth.  
                                 MS. D
                        Just stay calm.  Once we drive 
                        through the last road block I’m 
                        going to drive for another hour, 
                        then I’ll stop and let you out.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Thank you Ms. D.  

                                 MS. D
                        It’s okay kiddo.  

           She shuts the trunk.  

           INT. TRUNK - NIGHT

           Sam and Annabeth hold each other.  Annabeth is crying.  The 
           car bumps along.  They feel it slow.  Quiet, then voices.  

           More quiet.  

           The car starts moving.  

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           Ms. D pops open the trunk.  Sam and Annabeth stagger out, 
           stiff.  She hands Sam the car keys.   

                                 MS. D
                        I drove west of the city.  From 
                        here you should be able to go due 
                        north and not hit any road blocks.  
                        They don’t think you’ve left.  
                        There’s a second set of keys... 
                        they’re to my boat.  There’s a map 
                        in the car with the address of the 
                        dock in International Falls, and a 
                        little bit of cash to set you on 
                        your way.  Get there and you can 
                        take the boat across the border 
                        into Canada.  Just head north.  
                        From there... you’re looking for a 
                        town called Red Lodge.  That’s 
                        where the sightings were.  I don’t 
                        know if they were real - it was ten 
                        years ago.  But that’s all I can 
                        think of.  I’m sorry I can’t help 
                        you more.  If anyone found out...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s okay.  
                                 MS. D
                        I’ll wait a few hours before I go 
                        for help.  It should give you 
                        enough of a head start.  

           Sam hugs Ms. D.  Annabeth hangs back, anxious.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Thank you.  

                                 MS. D
                        Just one more thing... Can you bite 
                        me?  So if they catch you, I can 
                        say that you forced me?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Okay.  

           Sam approaches her.  Smells her neck.  Her fangs grow.  She 
           bites down.  Ms. D starts to bleed a bit.  Sam keeps sucking.  
           Then she backs away.  

           Ms. D staggers a little bit, then holds a handkerchief to her 
           neck.  She stumbles to the ground.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 MS. D
                        Yes.  I’m okay.  Go, now.  

           Ms. D pants, catching her breath.  Sam heads for the car.  
           But Annabeth doesn’t move.  She’s frozen where she stands, 
           transfixed, watching Ms. D bleed.  She rushes forward and 
           pushes Ms. D back to the ground, starts sucking her blood.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No!  Stop!  

           Sam tries to pull Annabeth away but Annabeth shoves her back, 
           keeps drinking - bloodlust setting in - SAM GRABS HER BY THE 
           HAIR - YANKS HER BACK - ANNABETH TEARS MS. D’S THROAT WIDE 
           OPEN...

           Annabeth catches her breath, comes to her senses.  Both girls 
           stare at Ms. D - pale now, bleeding out, coughing and choking 
           on her own blood.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Oh my god.  Fuck.  Oh my god.  

           Sam leans into Ms. D.  
                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sorry.  I... think you’re going 
                        to die.  

           Fear in Ms. D’s eyes.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Do you want me to... save you?  
                        Should I turn you?  

           Ms. D stares at her, her face contorted in pain.  Shakes her 
           head. No.  

           Ms. D passes out.  Annabeth keeps staring at the blood, 
           transfixed.  Both girls are hypnotized.  They both crouch 
           down and start drink the blood.  

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Sam positions a jerry can under a tree with a funnel.  She 
           walks back to the car, where Annabeth sits on the bumper, 
           crying.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        We killed her!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It was an accident.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I couldn’t stop... Sam I couldn’t 
                        stop.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        It’s okay.  We know now.  Not to 
                        start.   

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t want to do this.  I can’t 
                        leave.  I need to see my parents.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Your parents won’t help you 
                        Annabeth.  They think we’re demons.  
                        They think we’re evil.  It’s just 
                        us now.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t know 
                        what to do.  I didn’t want you to 
                        die -

                                 ANNABETH
                        WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME!  YOU 
                        SHOULD HAVE LET ME!  I DON’T WANT 
                        TO DO THIS!
           Sam grabs her and hugs her close.  Annabeth fights it a bit 
           but relaxes.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We have each other, okay?  Maybe 
                        there’s more of us in the North 
                        woods.  And if there aren’t, we’ll 
                        go somewhere where nobody knows us, 
                        and we’ll just keep living.  We’re 
                        best friends.  We can do it.  

           Annabeth can’t stop crying.  Sam pops the trunk.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Please help me.  She’s dead now.  
                        And we need this blood to stay 
                        strong.  

           Annabeth looks in the trunk.  Inside, the rumpled body of Ms. 
           D.  She can’t stop staring at the blood.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        All right.  

           The two girls lift the body and carry it to the jerry can and 
           funnel.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’ll hold her up.  You make sure it 
                        goes into the funnel.  

           Annabeth gets on her knees and positions the funnel under Ms. 
           D’s neck.  Blood starts to drain into it.  

           EXT. RAINY LAKE - NIGHT

           Annabeth and Sam pull up to a short DOCK on the bank of a 
           huge boundary water lake in Northern Minnesota.  

           They quietly get into the boat, loading it up with the JERRY 
           CAN, BACKPACK and some other supplies.  The air is still.  
           The moon lights up the lake.  

           Sam starts up the engine and they motor into the night.  

           EXT. MIDDLE OF RAINY LAKE - NIGHT

           Annabeth and Sam motor along, quietly, the lake lit up by the 
           moon.  It’s almost peaceful.  Annabeth sips from a water 
           bottle full of blood.  They’re both happy, smiling, blood 
           drunk.  
                                 ANNABETH
                        It’s like I never realized how 
                        beautiful the night is.  I feel 
                        like I can just see everything.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        My dad said that there are all 
                        these rich people who just don’t 
                        even use their cabins, or don’t use 
                        them in the winter.  We could 
                        probably hide in one.  And there’s 
                        lots of deer that we could hunt.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Maybe we could learn how to clean 
                        the deer and we could sell the 
                        skins.  Or make furniture with them 
                        or something.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        And just live quietly, maybe even 
                        buy our own cabin someday.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah!  We can just be like cool 
                        hippy ladies in the North Woods!

           Just then they hear a sound.  It’s a helicopter.  It’s 
           getting closer.  The girls look at each other.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Maybe that’s border patrol.

           Sam turns the boat towards a small island covered lots of big 
           pine trees and a small inlet.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        We have to hide.  

           They pull into the inlet, on a small island on the lake and 
           jump out of the boat.  They carry the jerry can, backpack and 
           a few water bottles with them.  They crouch in the woods.  

           The helicopter gets closer, it’s searchlight playing over the 
           water and trees.  

           The girls hold each other, scared.  

           The helicopter seems to be hovering over the small island - 
           then Sam sees the SEARCHLIGHT is trained right on THEIR BOAT.  
           She grabs Annabeth’s hand, and the two scramble over rocks, 
           through bushes, headed to the other side of the island - 

           SEARCHLIGHTS SWEEP OVER THEM
           They pause, cowering under dense trees - more choppers now on 
           the scene - searchlights sweeping over them, and boats 
           approach in the distance.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        We have to get off this island.  

           Sam opens up the water bottles and starts filling them with 
           blood from the jerry can.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        They’re going to find us.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Not they’re not.  You don’t know 
                        how fast we are now.  We’ll swim.

           She finishes filling the bottles and gives two to Annabeth.  
           She takes another two and stuffs them into the backpack.

           A BOAT ARRIVES ON THE SCENE -

           Through the trees, they see FLASHLIGHTS - WHOEVER THEY ARE, 
           THEY’RE ON THE ISLAND... Sam and Annabeth must change course - 
           crossing the small island again - they make for the shore...

           And Sam runs right at the water - hits it full stride - she’s 
           waiting to sink - but she skips along the surface for a 
           second - she’s stunned, smiles to herself - she’s running on 
           water!

           Sam turns to look at Annabeth - scared on the shore - and Sam 
           trips, sinks down and has to tread water.  She swims back to 
           shore.  FLASHLIGHTS ARE BEARING DOWN ON ANNABETH - SHE 
           HUDDLES BEHIND A TREE...

           Sam grabs her and pulls her towards the shore.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Come on!  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Sam I can’t swim that well.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We don’t have to.  Seriously.  Just 
                        do what I do.  

           Sam backs up again, soaking wet, water bottle in each hand.  
           She runs at the water again, and this time SHE DOESN’T 
           STOP... AND SHE FLOATS OVER THE WATER, HER FEET MOVING SO 
           FAST SHE DOESN’T SINK... SHE’S RUNNING ACROSS THE LAKE!  
           Annabeth watches her in amazement.  Then backs up and runs at 
           the water - AND SKIMS ALONG THE SURFACE, RUNNING, NOT SINKING 
           AT ALL - SAM CAUTIONS A GLANCE BACK, ANNABETH BEHIND HER, THE 
           TWO GIRLS NOW SMILING, ALMOST LAUGHING - SKIPPING ALONG THE 
           WATER LIKE TWO SPRITES - DANCING BETWEEN THE SEARCH LIGHTS OF 
           THE ROVING HELICOPTERS...

           THE GIRLS RUN ACROSS THE MOONLIT LAKE, AWAY FROM THE 
           HELICOPTERS, DISAPPEARING QUIETLY INTO THE DARK HORIZON.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Sam and Annabeth sleep soundly under pine branches piled into 
           a lean-to, the sun bright outside.

           There’s a rustling in the woods.  It gets closer.  Closer.  

           Then suddenly we see - a young GIRL (8) and her FRIEND (8), 
           both wearing FAIRY WINGS.  

           The two girls stop, staring at Sam and Annabeth.  

           The Girl picks up a long stick and pokes Annabeth with it.  
           Annabeth stirs awake.  

                                 GIRL
                        What are you doing here?

           Annabeth shakes Sam awake.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        We’re just sleeping.  

                                 FRIEND
                        Why are you sleeping on the ground 
                        in the woods?  

           Sam clocks the girls’ wings.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We’re fairies.  

           Annabeth can’t help staring at the GIRL’S NECK.  It seems to 
           pulse in the sun. 

                                 GIRL
                        No you’re not.  There’s no such 
                        thing.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yes there is.  Because we are.  You 
                        must believe in fairies.  You’re 
                        wearing fairy wings.
           The Friend has a scab on her knee that she starts to pick.  

                                 FRIEND
                        Where are your wings?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        They’re under our clothes.  

                                 GIRL
                        Let’s see them.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s kind of rude isn’t it?

           The Friend’s scab starts to bleed.  Both Sam and Annabeth 
           freeze, transfixed. 

                                 GIRL
                        Where are your parents?  

           Sam takes a second to answer - staring at the droplet of 
           blood oozing out of the Friend’s scab.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We don’t have parents.  We’re 
                        fairies.  

           Annabeth forces a tight lipped smile.  

           Sam takes a swig from her water bottle.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        She’s right.  

           Annabeth can feel her fangs growing.  She clenches her mouth 
           shut.

                                 FRIEND
                        That’s sad for you that you don’t 
                        have a mommy and daddy.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I know.  But we have each other.  
                        And we’re best friends.  

                                 GIRL
                        We’re best friends too.  But I 
                        still like my mommy.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Where are your parents?  
                                 FRIEND
                        They’re at the house.  It’s over 
                        there.  

           The Friend points off behind them.  

           EXT. MODERN WILDERNESS HOUSE - NIGHT

           The cabin glows in the night air.  Quiet... until we hear the 
           Girl and Friend SCREAMING WITH LAUGHTER, chasing each other 
           around the first floor, as their PARENTS try to cajole them 
           into going to bed.  

           Annabeth and Sam creep towards the cabin, watching.  The 
           PARENTS catch the two little girls and take them up to bed.  

           Sam and Annabeth watch them quietly from the shadows.  
           Annabeth bites her lower lip.  It’s upsetting her, but she 
           doesn’t want to show it.

           TIME CUT:

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The cabin is now dark.  Sam and Annabeth sit crouched, 
           waiting.  They nod to each other, then creep to the front of 
           the cabin.  There’s a car parked in the gravel driveway.  Sam 
           tries the door.  It’s open.  She flips down the sun visor.  
           Keys fall out. In the cup holder, a WALLET with CANADIAN 
           DOLLARS stuffed in it haphazardly.  

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Sam and Annabeth drive along a quiet wooded road.  Annabeth 
           is silent, staring out the window.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Are you okay?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I was just thinking about when we 
                        were little girls, like them.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We always played fairies.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yeah.  

           Annabeth exhales loudly.  Her eyes are moist.  
                                 ANNABETH (CONT’D)
                        I just miss it.  I miss everything.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I know.  I’m sorry.  But we’re 
                        going to be okay.  

           A GAS STATION glows in the distance.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        We need gas again.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Okay.  

           Sam pulls the car into the gas station.  

           EXT. CANADIAN GAS STATION - NIGHT

           The two girls get out of the car.  The bathroom is on the 
           exterior of the gas station on the right.  Next to it glows a 
           solitary PAY PHONE.

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m dying - can I go to the 
                        bathroom?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Sure.  

           Sam heads into the gas station to pay.  Annabeth waits for a 
           moment, then walks up to the pay phone, picks it up, dials 
           the operator.  

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Operator.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Can I make a collect call to the 
                        US? 

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Sure.  What’s the number?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        612-834-2246.  

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        And your name?  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Annabeth.  
                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        One moment.  

           Annabeth hears a clicking on the line.  It seems 
           interminable.  Then, suddenly - 

                                 CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                        Annabeth?  Is that you?

           Annabeth starts to cry.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Hi mom.  Hi.  

                                 CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                        You’re alive.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Yes.  

                                 CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                        Where are you?

                                 ANNABETH
                        I just want to come home.  Nobody 
                        knows that I’m turned.  We could 
                        just say that I’m not.  We could 
                        say I’m fine.  I don’t have to 
                        drink blood... I’m fine.  I -

                                 CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                        Tell me where you are.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I’m in Canada.  

                                 CRYSTAL
                        Where?

           Annabeth hesitates for a second.  Should she tell her mom?

                                 ANNABETH
                        We’re going to a town called Red 
                        Lodge.

                                 CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                        I need to hang up now.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        No - please - mom -
                                 CRYSTAL (O.S.)
                        No.  You’re not my daughter.  My 
                        daughter died.  You’re something 
                        else.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Mom!  It’s me!  I swear!  

           The line goes dead.  Annabeth turns.  Sam is standing a few 
           feet away.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        What did you do?  

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Sam drives furiously.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        She wouldn’t do that.  She wouldn’t 
                        call the police.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        YES SHE WOULD ANNABETH!  YES SHE 
                        WOULD!  SHE THINKS YOU’RE A MONSTER 
                        NOW!  SHE HATES YOU!  OKAY?  DON’T 
                        YOU UNDERSTAND THAT!  SHE THINKS 
                        YOU’RE NOT HUMAN!  

           Annabeth can’t stop crying.  

           A SIGN is illuminated in the distance by their headlights.  

           RED LODGE - 20 KILOMETERS.  

           As they round a turn the SIGN briefly goes into the darkness - 
           BUT IT SEEMS TO GLOW BLUE.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Do you see that?  

           Sam slows the car and kills the headlights.  

           The car creeps towards the sign.  As they draw closer, WORDS, 
           GLOWING BLUE IN THE MOONLIGHT APPEAR ON THE SIGN.  A secret 
           message.  IT READS:

           “ANY SURVIVORS: GO INTO THE WOODS NORTH OF RED LODGE.  HIDE. 
           LAST AS LONG AS YOU CAN.  WE ARE THERE.  WE WILL COME TO YOU 
           WHEN IT IS SAFE.  YOU ARE NOT ALONE.”

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Can you see that too?
                                 ANNABETH
                        Yes.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        There’s more of us Annabeth!  We’re 
                        going to be okay!  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Just leave me here.  Just pull 
                        over.  I don’t want to go.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You’re coming Annabeth.  We’re 
                        going together.  We’re best friends 
                        and we’re going to make it 
                        together.  

           Sam floors it.  The car speeds on.  BUT SUDDENLY - 
           HELICOPTERS APPEAR - FIRST ONE, THEN TWO - 

           HEADLIGHTS APPEAR ON THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM - 

           BEFORE SAM CAN REACT THEY’RE BLINDED BY A SPOTLIGHT FROM A 
           CHOPPER -

           A VOICE SOUNDS OVER A LOUDSPEAKER-

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        ATTENTION.  THIS IS THE JOINT NORTH 
                        AMERICAN TASK FORCE.  SURRENDER NOW 
                        AND YOU WILL BE TAKEN ALIVE.  
                        SURRENDER NOW.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        Just stop the car.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        They’ll kill us!  Don’t you know 
                        that by now? 

           Sam floors it.  The car lurches forward - 

           SUDDENLY - GUNFIRE - THE CAR IS RATTLED BY BULLETS - ONE HITS 
           SAM, PASSES STRAIGHT THROUGH HER ARM - SHE CRIES OUT IN PAIN!

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHH!  Fuck.  Fuck, fuck.  

           She’s bleeding badly.  BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER 
           WOUNDS... IT SMOKES AND SIZZLES, AND SAM SEIZES UP WITH 
           INTENSE PAIN... THROUGH GRITTED TEETH SHE CRIES OUT TO 
           ANNABETH -
                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D) 
                        IT’S SILVER! 

           ANNABETH is hit in the leg.  She’s bleeding badly.  She 
           starts SCREAMING.  

           SUDDENLY - FOG FILLS THE AIR - SAM AND ANNABETH START 
           COUGHING HARD - TEARING UP -

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        It’s garlic!  The backpack!  Hand 
                        me the backpack!  

           ANNABETH reaches back and grabs the backpack from the back 
           seat.  Sam tears it open with one hand.  

           IN FRONT OF HER - A CHOPPER HOVERS LOW TO THE GROUND, 
           BLOCKING THEM - 

           SAM GRABS AN EPI PEN AND SLAMS IT INTO HER LEG!

           GRABS ANOTHER AND SLAMS IT INTO ANNABETH’S LEG!  

           Their wounds start to heal.  Sam grabs a prescription bottle 
           and dumps a few pills in her mouth, dry swallows.  

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Take these.  

           Annabeth follows suit -

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        TAKE THE WHEEL!

           ANNABETH GRABS THE WHEEL - 

           THE CAR CAREENS TOWARDS THE LOW HOVERING CHOPPER - THEIR 
           GATLING GUN OPENS FIRE ON THE CAR - 

           THE CHOPPER OVERHEAD STARTS SPEWING AN AEROSOL GAS - SAM AND 
           ANNABETH COUGH - MORE GARLIC -

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        STAY DOWN AND DRIVE STRAIGHT!

           ANNABETH HUNCHES OVER -

           SAM OPENS THE SUN ROOF - GRABS A FEW MORE EPI PENS OUT OF HER 
           BACKPACK, STUFFS THEM IN HER BACK POCKET - 

           AND IN ONE SWIFT MOTION LEAPS OUT OF THE CAR TOWARDS THE LOW 
           HOVERING CHOPPER IN FRONT OF THEM - THE GUNNER SEES HER 
           FLYING TOWARDS THEM -
                                 GUNNER
                        PULL UP!

           THE CHOPPER STARTS TO LIFT OFF - BUT IT’S TOO LATE - WE’RE 
           NOW-

           INT./EXT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

           SAM SLAMS INTO THE GUNNER AND RIPS HIS THROAT OUT - THE PILOT 
           PANICS - PULLS HIGH - BANKS TOWARDS THE OTHER CHOPPERS - 

                                 PILOT
                        SHE’S IN MY CHOPPER -

           SAM RIPS THE THROAT OUT OF THE OTHER CREW MEMBER - TURNS TO 
           THE PILOT - RIPS HIS THROAT OUT - THE CHOPPER STARTS TO GO 
           DOWN - SAM CLIMBS OUT THE SIDE DOOR, BRACES HERSELF AGAINST 
           THE FALLING CHOPPER - FLEXES HER LEGS - SPRINGS LIKE A BULLET 
           FLYING STRAIGHT AT THE SECOND CHOPPER - 

           BACK ON THE ON THE GROUND -

           THE CHOPPER SAM ATTACKED HITS THE GROUND AND EXPLODES IN A 
           FIREBALL - ANNABETH BARELY MANEUVERS THE CAR AROUND IT WHEN-

           ANNABETH IS HIT IN THE CHEST WITH A BULLET - LOSES CONTROL OF 
           THE CAR, CRASHES - FLIES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  LAYS ON THE 
           GROUND, MOTIONLESS.  

           IN THE SKY

           NO TIME WASTED, SAM RIPPING THROATS OUT - THE SECOND CHOPPER 
           STARTS TO GO DOWN - SAM JUMPS OFF ONTO THE ROAD - 

           RUSHES UP TO ANNABETH... CRADLES HER... TAKES AN EPI PEN AND 
           INJECTS IT STRAIGHT INTO HER CHEST!

           ANNABETH COUGHS, COMES BACK TO LIFE... HER BODY LITERALLY 
           SQUEEZES THE SILVER BULLETS OUT, PLINK PLINK PLINK ONTO THE 
           PAVEMENT - ANNABETH STAGGERS TO HER FEET - THE TWO GIRLS 
           START RUNNING INTO THE WOODS!  

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           ANNABETH AND SAM RUN THROUGH THE WOODS - SOLDIERS ON FOUR 
           WHEELERS AND DIRT BIKES PURSUE THEM -

           ANNABETH STUMBLES.  Sam stops to help her up.  But she won’t 
           get up.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I can’t Sam.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        We can get away!  Then we’ll hide, 
                        and we’ll find others like us!  We 
                        just have to keep going!

                                 ANNABETH
                        I don’t want to Sam.  I don’t want 
                        to be this.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You have to come!  Please!  I need 
                        you!  You’re my best friend.  

                                 ANNABETH
                        I can’t.  I’m sorry.  I don’t want 
                        to be a vampire.  I don’t want to 
                        be alive.  I can’t do it.  Go.  Go 
                        without me.  I’ll hold them off.  

           Sam tries to pull her up.  The soldiers get closer.  Shots 
           start to ring out.  Annabeth stands - rips her arm free of 
           Sam’s grip - AND CHARGES STRAIGHT AT THE APPROACHING SOLDIERS-

           SAM WATCHES IN HORROR AS ANNABETH MAKES HER LAST STAND - 
           JUMPING FROM DIRT BIKE TO ATV - RIPPING THROATS OUT - TAKING 
           MORE AND MORE BULLETS - UNABLE TO FIGHT ON - FALLING TO THE 
           GROUND - A SOLDIER JUMPS OFF A DIRT BIKE - UNSHEATHES A 
           HOLLOW POINTED STAKE - AND STABS ANNABETH IN THE HEART!  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        NO!!!!

           SAM IS FROZEN IN PLACE.  SHE PANTS, CRYING.  ANNABETH’S WHOLE 
           BODY SHUDDERS AND SMOKES, AS HER HEART PUMPS SILVER DUST 
           THROUGH HER VEINS - SHE SCREAMS - HER BODY SHAKES AND BOILS -

           AND SAM TURNS AND SHE RUNS.  SHE RUNS FASTER THAN SHE’S EVER 
           RUN, TEARING THROUGH THE TREES, CRYING SCREAMING TO HERSELF, 
           GRABBING ANOTHER EPIPEN AND JAMMING IT INTO HER NECK, 
           DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT FOREST, FASTER THAN ALL OF THEM - 

           INT. DEEP FOREST - DAWN

           Sam, exhausted, stops running.  Leans down next to a tree.  
           Collapses.  She’s pale, sweating.  She takes a sip of her 
           water bottle - but there’s nothing left.  No more blood.  

           She sits quietly.  Light coming through the trees.  Her skin 
           starting to smoke even worse than before as the beams spread 
           across her.  She’s given up.  She’s too tired to go on.  Too 
           heart broken.  Her skin smokes subtly in the sunlight.   
           Suddenly she hears a crackle.
           She stands up.  Delirious with exhaustion.  Hardly able to 
           see through the intensifying sunbeams.  

           A FIGURE in a HOODED CLOAK APPROACHES HER.  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Who are you?  

           She walks unsteadily towards the Figure.  Then collapses.  

           FADE TO BLACK.

           THE END.
