           The Black List was compiled from the suggestions of over 300 film executives, each of whom contributed 
           the names of up to ten favorite scripts that were written in, or are somehow uniquely associated with, 2018 
           and will not have begun principal photography during this calendar year.

           This year, scripts had to receive at least seven mentions to be included on the Black List.

           All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.

           The Black List apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation identification, and 
           questionable 2018 affiliations.

           It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

           The Black List is not a “best of” list. It is, at best, a “most liked” list.
               “Writing is finally about one thing: going into a room alone and doing it.  Putting words on 
                                   paper that have never been there in quite that way before.”

                                            “The easiest thing to do on earth is not write.”
