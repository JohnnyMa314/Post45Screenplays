           OVER BLACK. 

           TITLE CARD: BASED ON DECLASSIFIED FBI FILES. INSPIRED BY 
           ACTUAL EVENTS. THE FOLLOWING IS A TRUE STORY...

                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                        But what does true really mean?

           FADE IN:

           EXT. AD-DWAR/IRAQ - NIGHT

           Stars can be seen SHINING brightly in the sky as DARKNESS 
           surrounds the barren landscape with not a soul in sight. A 
           MAN'S VOICE, best described as a NorCal (North California) 
           accent, begins speaking with kindness and authority:

                                 PIRO (V.O)
                        My father used to say: You can bend 
                        the truth, but not the facts.

           TASK FORCE 121, composed of a dozen elite DELTA FORCE 
           SOLDIERS in army-camo and night vision goggles, move slowly 
           through the scattered tall grass, carrying loaded M4 carbon 
           rifles toward a lone shack off in the distance. 

                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                        He wanted me to understand truth 
                        can be subjective, but facts... 
                        they have to be absolute.

           POV THROUGH NIGHT VISION: A small lean-to abuts the shack. A 
           white taxi cab is parked nearby. No other targets visible.

                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                                             (CONT'D)
                        So, I asked him which is more 
                        important: the truth or the facts?

           COMMANDER RAISES HIS HAND for the UNIT to ADVANCE, silently 
           searching for signs of life until... a SOLDIER stumbles upon 
           a SEALED BUNKER hidden in the earth. For a brief moment, NO 
           ONE MOVES; questioning if this is a trap or the grand prize.

           CHYRON: Operation Red Dawn.

           A BEAD OF SWEAT drips from the Soldier, tautly gripping his 
           rifle aimed at the bunker seal being slowly lifted to reveal: 
           AN ARAB MAN (66), disheveled, bearded, waving his hands in 
           the air, unarmed, grasping a Qur'an, weakly muttering. 

                                 SADDAM
                        I am Saddam Hussein. President of 
                        Iraq. 
           The unkempt Arab Man is quickly pulled from the hole as a 
           LIGHT SHINES to verify the intended target: SADDAM HUSSEIN, 
           once the Butcher of Baghdad, now ex-President of Iraq,  
           surrounded with no way out. His chest puffs up, insisting:

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        I am willing to negotiate.

           Saddam is immediately restrained against his will by Soldiers 
           pressing his face firmly into the ground without mercy.

                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                        He told me the truth: Facts alone 
                        are never enough. What matters most 
                        is a compelling argument...

           CLOSE ON SADDAM'S TIRED EYES with a strange look of relief, 
           followed by uncertainty for what fate lies ahead.

           INT. OPERATION ROOM/CAMP VICTORY/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           A MILITARY ANALYST takes a red magic marker to write: 
           12-13-03. As he steps back, we see a cork board covered in 
           playing cards with the faces of Arab men printed at the 
           center. The sign above reads: IRAQI MOST WANTED. 

                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                        Whoever can tell the most 
                        convincing story, held together by 
                        enough facts, gets to be the one 
                        who ultimately controls, “the 
                        truth, the whole truth and nothing 
                        but the truth..." so help us God.

           At the top of the board is Saddam Hussein's face on the Ace 
           of Clubs. The card is marked: CAPTURED.

                                 TITLE CARD: SADDAM & ME

           INT. CLASSROOM/CENTER GROVE SCHOOL - DAY

           Special Agent GEORGE PIRO (35), Lebanese-American, goatee, 
           stands mild-mannered, sporting a black suit, white shirt and 
           striped red tie. He is mid-presentation with the chalkboard 
           bearing his name and title behind him.

                                 PIRO
                        That was the first lesson I learned 
                        when my family immigrated here. I 
                        was a twelve year old refugee, who 
                        couldn't speak a word of English, 
                        trying to escape a civil war in 
                        Lebanon...

                                 PIRO (CONT'D)
                        The fighting made it impossible for 
                        the U.S. to verify all our facts, 
                        but we had a compelling argument as 
                        honest, hard working people hoping 
                        to earn a second chance in America. 
                        That was our truth... And that's 
                        why I joined the FBI. To repay my 
                        debt to this country. To protect 
                        the American people, uphold the 
                        Constitution of the United 
                        States... and have a chance to save 
                        the next family, just as this 
                        country ended up saving mine.
                            (beat)
                        Any questions?

           A room filled with THIRD GRADERS at their desks, stare 
           blankly at the nuanced monologue. Piro smiles at his son, 
           LAZAR (8), who is busy checking to see how his Dad's 
           presentation was received. A BOY raises his hand.

                                 BOY #1
                        Can we see your gun?

                                 PIRO
                        An Agent only takes out their 
                        weapon when absolutely necessary. 

           Another GIRL raises her hand.

                                 GIRL
                        Is it true you're going to Iraq?

                                 PIRO
                        That's right. The FBI is stationed 
                        around the world to do our part in 
                        the War on Terror --

                                 GIRL
                        My dad says the Iraq War is a hoax 
                        propa... gated by the Bush 
                        Administration to steal Arab oil.

           Piro grows uncomfortable, trying to move on.

                                 PIRO
                        Any other questions?

           The BOY raises his hands excited. Piro points to call on him:

                                 BOY #1
                        What about a bullet?
           The CLASS gets more engaged. Piro forces one last smile 
           before noticing a FIREFIGHTER waiting his turn; the struggle 
           to make a good impression on his son Lazar becomes real.  

           EXT. PLAYGROUND/PARK - DAY

           Lazar plays on the swings, waving over to his parents: A 
           humbled Piro and MEHRI (35), kind-eyed, warmly bundled up for 
           winter. They both wave back before turning to each other.

                                 MEHRI
                        The look on your face says career 
                        day didn't go so well.

                                 PIRO
                        I got smoked by a firefighter.

                                 MEHRI
                        They're only eight, George.

                                 PIRO
                        Tell that to the little girl 
                        grilling me about geo-politics.

                                 MEHRI
                        War is difficult for kids to 
                        process. You of all people know 
                        that.

           Piro looks again at Lazar, concerned:

                                 PIRO
                        Has Lazar said anything to you?

                                 MEHRI
                        Only that he wishes you didn't have 
                        to go for so long. 

                                 PIRO
                        And what about you? 

           Piro wraps his arms around his wife.

                                 MEHRI
                        All I need is for you to come home.

                                 PIRO
                        I always do.

                                 MEHRI
                        Cause you know I'd hunt you down in 
                        the next life if you didn't.
           Piro grins at her jab, then moves in to kiss his wife until 
           she clears her throat.

                                 MEHRI
                                        (CONT'D)
                        Your friends are here.

           Piro pulls back to find: Exec. Asst. Directors JOHN S. 
           PISTOLE (47) and GARY M. BALD (43), two career g-men, seated 
           on a nearby bench. He settles for a kiss on his wife's cheek 
           before walking over to his Superiors.

                                 PIRO
                        Director Pistole. Bald. 

                                 PISTOLE
                            (hands an envelope)
                        Your ticket. Visa. And itinerary.

                                 PIRO
                        Thank you, sir. You didn't have to 
                        come all this way...

           Mehri watches her husband curious for a moment, then returns 
           to playing with her Son. Bald responds, gruffly:

                                 BALD
                        We did't have time to wait for 
                        playtime to be over.

                                 PISTOLE
                            (translating)
                        Bureau is under a lot of pressure 
                        right now, Agent Piro.

                                 BALD
                            (checks his watch)
                        From this moment, everything -- the 
                        quality of your reports to the 
                        color of your stool -- all of it 
                        reflects back on us.

                                 PISTOLE
                        This is a rare opportunity for a 
                        junior agent like yourself.

                                 BALD
                        So don't fuck it up.

                                 PISTOLE
                        Flight leaves at seven pm tonight.

                                 PIRO
                        Yes, sir.
           Piro notices a black SUV idling behind them.

                                 PISTOLE
                        Director Mueller would like have to 
                        a brief word.

           Piro nods, adjusting his tie as he walks into:

           INT. SUV/PARK - DAY

           Director ROBERT MUELLER (60), combed salt and pepper hair, 
           the ultimate g-man, sits in the back looking out the window. 
           Piro takes a seat beside him.

                                 MUELLER
                        It's good to spend time with your 
                        family. They'll be one of the few 
                        things that keep you grounded over 
                        there. How's your wife handling 
                        your departure?

                                 PIRO
                        Mehri understands what's at stake

                        That doesn't make it any easier... 
                        Go ahead. Open the envelope.

           Piro opens to reveal: a classified file on Saddam Hussein, 
           including photos of the Dictator at the height of his power.

                        government can make their case 
                        against Saddam Hussein... 

           Piro flips to the next page with Saddam's most recent  
           unflattering mug shots.

                                 MUELLER
                        This is the kind of case that will 
                        either make or break your career. 
                        And for that, I'm sorry... Keep 
                        your head down. Do the work. And we 
                        will do everything on our end to 
                        protect you from the hawks.

           Piro exits the vehicle, just as Pistole and Bald enter.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND/PARK - DAY

           Piro rejoins Mehri and Lazar. As he holds his Wife and Son 
           close together, watching the SUV drive away.

           EXT. DULLES AIRPORT/WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

           A post-9/11 airport scattered with SOLDIERS carrying assault 
           rifles and long lines of TRAVELERS waiting to get through 
           security. Piro walks up with Mehri, Lazar and a large 
           suitcase. He is about to say something to his wife, when --

                                 MEHRI
                        Shut up and kiss me goodbye.

           Piro kisses his wife, then holds her close for an extra beat. 
           Lazar watches, trying to make sense of what this all means. 
           Finally, Piro lets go and kneels down to his son.

                                 PIRO
                        And you...

                                 LAZAR
                        Me?

                                 PIRO
                        Promise you'll watch over your 
                        mother.

                                 LAZAR
                        I promise, baba. Will you be able 
                        to call more this time?

                                 PIRO
                        I had an even better idea...
           Piro pulls out a 3rd generation iPod along with a voice 
           recorder added-on.

                                 PIRO
                                       (CONT'D)
                        I want you to record messages to me 
                        on here for your mom to send over, 
                        so I can hear your voice wherever I 
                        am. What do you think?

                                 LAZAR
                        What kind of messages?

                                 PIRO
                        Anything you want...

           Piro hands the iPod to his son, then hugs him tightly.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Baba loves you very much.

           Piro lets go as Lazar takes his Mother's hand.

                                 MEHRI
                        Tell baba you love him.

                                 LAZAR
                        We loooooove you, baba.

           Piro forces a smile, grips his suitcase tightly walking 
           toward the security line. As Lazar waves goodbye with Mehri, 
           the SOUND OF AN AIRPLANE TAKING OFF BRINGS US TO:

           INT. TERMINAL/BAGHDAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           The waiting area contains only US SOLDIERS holding assault 
           weapons, paired with IRAQI POLICE carrying handguns. 
           Plainclothes PASSENGERS, here on business, exit the airplane 
           into the Terminal alongside Piro, who hides his lack of sleep 
           with a pair of dark tinted Oakley sunglasses.

                                 COMMANDING VOICE (O.C.)
                        Special Agent Piro?

           Piro turns to spot Army Sgts. LAWRENCE ROUKEY (33), strong 
           but kind face, and SHERWOOD BAKER (30), quiet with glasses, 
           holding a handwritten sign with his name. Before he can 
           respond, Roukey and Baker snap their feet together and 
           stiffen their posture to announce:

                                 ROUKEY
                        Sergeants Lawrence Roukey and 
                        Sherwood Baker, sir. We will be 
                        your escorts into Camp Slayer.
                                 PIRO
                        I'd love to stop by my hotel --

                                 ROUKEY
                        Sir, we have been asked to bring 
                        you directly to Camp Slayer.

                                 PIRO
                        On whose orders?

           Roukey checks with Baker, who quietly shakes his head 'no'. 

                                 ROUKEY
                        Best if you just came with us, sir.

                                 PIRO
                        Relax. You can call me George.

           Roukey and Baker both loosen up their posture. Piro offers a 
           handshake to Roukey, who gladly accepts.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Thank ya, George. We get in trouble 
                        if we don't put on the "show".

           Piro extends his hand to Baker, who takes his guest's luggage 
           instead. The Special Agent turns to Roukey, sotto voce:

                                 PIRO
                        Does he talk?

                                 ROUKEY
                        Baker? Only when he's got something 
                        to say.

           As Baker rolls Piro's luggage, the glass door opens out to:

           EXT. BAGHDAD INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Baker loads the luggage into a military Humvee with Roukey 
           taking the driverside. Piro notices a bright hanging banner 
           "Baghdad International Airport", then realizes it's masking 
           the original fading sign for "SADDAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT". 

           Suddenly, a roadside BOMB EXPLODES just outside the Airport, 
           blowing dust in the air. Piro cowers. Soldiers are unmoved. 

                                 ROUKEY
                        Security has been finding new IEDs 
                        on the road every week now. 

                                 PIRO
                        News back home says the war is 
                        supposed to be winding down. 
                                 ROUKEY
                        Don'tcha worry, George. Insurgent 
                        bombs aren't slowing us down.

           Baker opens the Humvee door for Piro. As Roukey revs up the 
           engine, they begin driving toward a Palace on the horizon.

           INT. HUMVEE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Roukey speeds past the airport barbed wire fence along a 
           rough and tumble dirt road. Baker sits shotgun while Piro 
           looks out the window from the back.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Rumor is you're here to talk with 
                        Saddama.

                                 PIRO
                        Saddama?

           The Humvee takes a sharp turn as Roukey laughs to himself.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Well... Osama's still on the loose, 
                        so capturing Sadd-ama is the next 
                        best thing, right?

                                 PIRO
                            (all business)
                        You're only to refer to him as Vic, 
                        Sergeant.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Yes, sir... Can I ask why: Vic?

                                 PIRO
                        Letters on his cell door. When he 
                        learned they stood for "Very 
                        Important Captive", 'Vic' demanded 
                        that become his moniker... 

           Piro attempts to open up one of the windows.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        ...while in confinement.

                                 BAKER
                        I wouldn't do that, sir.

           Piro turns, surprised to see Baker finally talking when 
           SEVERAL ROCKS ARE THROWN AT THE WINDOW, thus proving his 
           point. Roukey lets out a "WOO" and accelerates. On Piro, 
           feeling the insanity of Baghdad starting to creep in.
           INT. CAMP SLAYER/VICTORY COMPLEX/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Roukey and Baker lead Piro through a palatial space with 
           beautiful tile and a mural of a smiling Saddam in full 
           military attire, wielding a sword. A large banner hangs that 
           reads: "Welcome to Camp Slayer. Another Day in Paradise." 

                                 ROUKEY
                        ...And they call this the Perfume 
                        Palace ‘cause it looks like a 
                        perfume bottle from the outside.

                                 PIRO
                            (patience worn)
                        Where are you taking me, Sergeant?

                                 ROUKEY
                        Almost there.

           CLOSE ON the mural of Saddam, almost watching over them.

           INT. MAIN HALL/CAMP SLAYER/VICTORY COMPLEX/BAGHDAD - DAY

           MILITARY STAFF are sorting through stacks of paper across 
           half a dozen folding tables as an excited CHARLES DUELFER 
           (50), thin and mustached, eagerly approaches Piro.

                                 DUELFER
                        Special Agent Piro. 
                            (shakes his hand)
                        Charles Duelfer. Head of the Iraq 
                        Search Group.
                            (to Roukey and Baker)
                        Thank you for retrieving our new 
                        friend.

           Roukey salutes Duelfer before clicking his heels, turning 
           about face to exit with Baker.

                                 PIRO
                        Thought David Kay was running ISG.

                                 DUELFER
                        David was... until he resigned. 
                            (gestures to the room)
                        Now, I'm the one in charge of 
                        cleaning up this mess.

                                 PIRO
                        So, I take it you're no closer to 
                        finding the Iraqi's WMD program...
                                 DUELFER
                        I've been trying since the nineties 
                        as a UN Inspector. No... This time 
                        I'm just here to find the truth. 
                        What about you, Agent Piro?

                                 PIRO
                        Bureau wants a lawful conviction. 
                        Truth is above my pay grade.

           Duelfer appreciates the joke, then spots something.

                                 DUELFER
                        Shit.

           JOHN BOLTON (54), a pink-faced, fierce neocon with thick 
           rimmed glasses and a deep silver walrus mustache, marches 
           toward them both. Duelfer explains:

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 DUELFER
                        John Bolton. Under Secretary of 
                        State for Arms Control and 
                        International Security Affairs.
                            (off Piro, absorbing)
                        Bolton was the first to peddle 
                        intel that Iraq was buying yellow 
                        cake uranium in Africa... None of 
                        which has proven true.

           Bolton arrives unhappy to see Duelfer with Piro.

                                 BOLTON
                        I thought we agreed to speak with 
                        Agent Piro together.

                                 DUELFER
                        He and I were just on our way...

                                 BOLTON
                        You know Duelfer used to be CIA? 
                        What was your specialty, again? 
                        Arming child soldiers in Chad?

                                 DUELFER
                            (clearly dodging)
                        When you get a higher security 
                        clearance, John, I’ll be sure to 
                        tell you all about it.

                                 BOLTON
                        There's a saying we have in State: 
                        too much time in intelligence can 
                        make a man stupid.
           Duelfer grimaces as Bolton smiles, leading the men into:

           INT. SCIF/CAMP SLAYER/VICTORY COMPLEX/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. A windowless 
           conference room with leather chairs and long wooden table. 
           Duelfer and Piro sit as Bolton leans back in his chair.

                                 DUELFER
                        You know I always feel bad for the 
                        undersecretaries at State. They 
                        never give you any windows.

                                 BOLTON
                        Helps me stay on DC time.

           Bolton takes off his glasses to inspect Piro.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 BOLTON
                        So, you're the one Director Mueller 
                        chose for the interrogation... 
                            (glasses back on)
                        I don’t know what you've been told, 
                        but it should come as no surprise 
                        State considers your presence a 
                        hazard to our work in rebuilding 
                        Iraq. That said, the powers-that-be 
                        need us to be on the same page...

           Piro embraces the tactless olive branch:

                                 PIRO
                        I appreciate that, sir.

                                 BOLTON
                        The three of us carry a tremendous 
                        burden for the future of this war. 
                        Which is why I need to know whether 
                        you come to help or hinder?

                                 PIRO
                        All due respect: Neither.

           Duelfer turns to Piro, impressed. Bolton leans forward.

                                 BOLTON
                        This isn't Capitol Hill, son. 
                        Staying neutral in Iraq is not an 
                        option if you want to survive.

                                 PIRO
                        I was asked to treat this as a 
                        criminal investigation.

                        Independent of White House and 
                        State. I'm sure you understand we 
                        can't risk compromising testimony 
                        or evidence.

                                 BOLTON
                        Secretary Powell already presented 
                        the evidence to the United Nations. 
                        You’re here to get a confession out 
                        of Saddam.

                                 PIRO
                        If there are weapons, sir... I can 
                        assure you, we will find them.

                                 BOLTON
                        If? 
                            (leans in)
                        We’re in an election year, son. 
                        Voters need to know: Weapons of 
                        Mass Destruction are in Iraq. The 
                        President needs them to know.

                                 PIRO
                        Director Mueller --

                                 BOLTON
                        Has no reach here. You’re pissants 
                        operating under the good grace of 
                        this White House. Cross me and I 
                        will personally banish you to the 
                        lowest order of existence.

                                 DUELFER
                            (to Piro)
                        Suddenly, Iraq feels strikingly 
                        similar to Capitol Hill.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm certain we'll all find a way to 
                        work together. 

                                 BOLTON
                        I hope so, Agent Piro... I look 
                        forward to your first report.

           On Piro and Duelfer, rising to exit as Bolton leans back in 
           his chair again, unsure if the message was received.

           EXT. SIDE STREET/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           A PACK OF STRAY DOGS drink from a lone puddle near a group of 
           IRAQIS gathered outside their storefronts.  
           They all go SILENT to watch Duelfer and Piro walk past, mid-
           conversation. Only Piro seems to takes notice of their gaze.

                                 DUELFER
                        You know half of Americans still 
                        support this war? They don't give a 
                        shit about your interrogation or 
                        whether we find WMD. They just 
                        don't want to have to worry...

                                 PIRO
                            (re: Iraqis)
                        And what about them?

                                 DUELFER 
                        Majority want us out. One way... or 
                        another.

           Piro notices several buildings bombed and battered.

                                 PIRO
                        I can't imagine why.

           Out of nowhere, an IRAQI MAN (30) bumps into Piro, causing a 
           moment of confusion. The Man apologizes profusely in Arabic 
           to disarm the situation. As he goes to walk on, Piro GRABS 
           the Man's HAND to reveal his stolen wallet. The two lock 
           eyes, frozen, uncertain how the moment will play out.

           Across the way, both men spot US SOLDIERS on their patrol. 
           The Iraqi turns pale with regret. Piro notices the dirt under 
           his fingernails and turns overtly friendly, in Arabic:

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        My wallet. Thank god... I must've 
                        dropped it without noticing.

           The Iraqi nods slowly, unsure if he's sincere or full of 
           shit. Piro pulls out some bills and hands them to the Man.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Please, for your troubles...
                            (adamant)
                        I insist.

           The Iraqi cautiously accepts, then presses his hands together 
           in gratitude before quickly leaving. Duelfer raises an 
           eyebrow, starting to get a read on the Special Agent.

           INT. GREEN ZONE CAFE/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           A red colored tent with red plastic chairs and tables inside. 
           American, Iraqi and British flags are draped across the wall. 
           Piro waits at a table as Duelfer returns with Corona Lights. 
                                 DUELFER
                        Liquor was banned in '94. Now, they 
                        can't ship it quick enough.

           The two clink, then drink. Duelfer studies Piro, carefully.

                                 DUELFER
                                          (CONT'D)
                        Generous finders fee for an Iraqi 
                        who almost robbed you.

                                 PIRO
                        He was an out-of-work laborer 
                        trying to feed his family.
                            (off Duelfer)
                        A real thief doesn't have callouses  
                        on their hands and a tan line where 
                        their wedding ring used to be.

                                 DUELFER
                        I see why Mueller chose you... 
                        You’re what? Thirty-five? 

                                 PIRO
                        Almost the same age as Vic's 
                        youngest son would have been. 

                                 DUELFER
                        You seem quite at home for a g-man 
                        still fresh out of Quantico.

                                 PIRO
                        I grew up in Beirut during the 
                        seventies. I've seen what a war 
                        zone looks like before. 

                                 DUELFER
                            (in Arabic)
                        Ah, then you should be able to 
                        curse like a real Arab, too.

                                 PIRO
                        Not as well as I used to.

                                 DUELFER
                        Try me.

                                 PIRO
                        Alif er eb nos tezak.

                                 DUELFER
                        What does that mean?

                                 PIRO
                        A thousand dicks in your ass. 
           Duelfer smirks, then grows stern:

                                 DUELFER
                        You’ll have to do better than that 
                        to keep up with the number of fucks 
                        Vic gives and shits he takes.

                                 PIRO
                        I'll see what I can do.

                                 DUELFER
                        Understand he’s going to make this 
                        personal. Dodging every question,  
                        pushing to get inside your head.

                                 PIRO
                        Now, he sounds like my mother.

                                 DUELFER
                        I’m not joking... Bolton is right 
                        about one thing: Here in Baghdad, 
                        we're on our own. So, you sure you 
                        have the stomach for this?

                                 PIRO
                        I have been combing through every 
                        speech, every tape, every report on 
                        him... anything to stay ahead and 
                        keep my gut in check.

                                 DUELFER
                        It'll help to avoid the food in the 
                        commissary, too... So, when’s the 
                        rest of your people arrive?

                                 PIRO
                        Tomorrow. I wanted to get the lay 
                        of the land first.

                                 DUELFER
                        Good. Longer this goes on, the more 
                        violent his loyalists will become.

           Piro nods, satisfied, then finishes his beer.

                                 PIRO
                        You think this insurgency is 
                        getting worse?

                                 DUELFER
                        I know it is.

           On Piro, staring at the Iraqi flag on display positioned 
           opposite the American. 
           INT. CEMENT HOUSE/SADR CITY/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           A disheveled space with an old television and cracked plastic 
           furniture. ALI (18), a baby faced Iraqi, stirs a pot of 
           biryani (slow cooked rice with meat) while listening to Uncle 
           Cracker's 2002 "Drift Away" on his Discman CD Player. Bobbing 
           his head, he then scoops out two bowls full. 

           In the corner, another bearded Iraqi Man (30), who we'll call 
           HASSAN, solders wires onto an IED. Ali presents the biryani, 
           which prompts Hassan to put down his work and eat. In Arabic:

                                 HASSAN
                            (disappointed)
                        Biryani, again?

           Ali pulls off the headphones, but MUSIC can still be heard.

                                 HASSAN
                                         (CONT'D)
                        I said: No more Biryani.

                                 ALI
                        I told you I only know how to cook 
                        one thing... When will you let me 
                        do something useful?

           Hassan continues shoveling down the food.

                                 HASSAN
                        Soon. The Americans are still 
                        crawling everywhere.

                                 ALI
                        The bombs have not deterred them.

                                 HASSAN
                        They are only one part of our 
                        campaign. Just as you and I are 
                        soldiers in a much larger army...

                                 ALI
                        You keep saying that.

                                 HASSAN
                        Because it’s true. Because we must 
                        stay focused. Because our President 
                        is counting on us.

           Hassan pats Ali on the shoulder, then hands him the bomb. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE OF BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Uncle Kracker PLAYS ON. In a barren field, the city twinkles 
           far off behind them.  
           As Hassan hides behind a large rock for protection, Ali lays 
           the bomb down then sprints back to the rock. Hassan dials a 
           number on his cellphone triggering A LARGE EXPLOSION. Flames 
           dance in Ali’s eyes. Hassan rises with a big smile.

                                 ALI
                        You can detonate remotely?

                                 HASSAN
                        With enough phones, we can rig them 
                        all this way. Now, start the car.

           Ali goes to close the trunk of a beat-up nineties sedan. 

           FROM HIS POV: reveal a stock pile of a DOZEN IEDs waiting to 
           be rigged. As the Trunk shuts... 

           EXT. GATE/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           A military prison built by US Forces, surrounded by cement 
           walls topped with barbed wire.

           Piro and Duelfer wait outside as a Humvee pulls up, followed 
           by a trail of dust. Roukey and Baker emerge to open the door 
           for: TODD IRINAGA, thirty-six, third generation Japanese-
           American, beaming as he HUGS Piro close like old friends do:

                                 IRINAGA
                        When you said “special assignment”, 
                        this wasn’t exactly what I had 
                        envisioned.

                                 PIRO
                        You were the one who wanted out of 
                        the Modesto field office...

           Irinaga releases the hug, playfully jabbing back:

                                 IRINAGA
                        I thought “sun and sand” meant 
                        beach, not a fucking desert war.

           Next out of the Humvee, THERESA FELIX (44), a no-bullshit 
           wayward warrior, and CAROL STROUD (40), a whip-smart 
           introvert. Baker stands firmly, in position.

                                 FELIX
                        At ease... 

           Baker lowers his shoulders. Felix turns to Piro:

                                        (CONT'D)
                                 FELIX
                        Would've been nice to know we'd be 
                        coming straight from the airport. 
                                 PIRO
                        You can thank the White House for 
                        moving up our timeline.

                                 FELIX
                        Long as you know it makes it harder 
                        for us to our jobs, Agent Piro.

           Stroud steps up, kindly clarifying to Piro:

                                 STROUD
                        Sorry. We didn’t get much sleep 
                        working on the plane.

           Piro appears proud to have his assembled Team.

                                 PIRO
                        I want you to meet Charles Duelfer 
                        from ISG. This is: Special Agent 
                        Todd Irinaga and FBI Analysts 
                        Theresa Felix, intelligence, and 
                        Carol Stroud, behavioral. They were 
                        briefed and prepped in DC.

           Duelfer nods to acknowledge them, but appears distracted by 
           their looming assignment.

                                 DUELFER
                        Shall we?

           As Roukey and Baker signal the Guard Post above...

           EXT. COURTYARD/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           THE GATE OPENS. Iraqi PRISONERS in yellow uniforms, separated 
           by another layer of fencing, turn their attention to Roukey 
           and Baker leading Duelfer, Piro, Irinaga, Stroud and Felix.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Welcome to Camp Cropper.

                                 IRINAGA
                            (sotto voce to Piro)
                        The fuck’ve you got me into?

           Piro doesn’t know either. Felix notices the sea of Prisoners 
           peering through the fence.

                                 STROUD
                        They're all Iraqi Prisoners of War?
                                 DUELFER
                        The administration calls them HVDs, 
                        “High Value Detainees”, to get 
                        around any legal issues until the 
                        Provisional Authority establishes 
                        proper due process.

                                 PIRO
                            (to Roukey and Baker)
                        Next time, take us the back way.

                                 BAKER
                        This is the back way, Agent Piro.

           As Piro observes a range of desperation, anger, fear, hope 
           and resignation in the Prisoners' eyes...

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           LIGHTS FLICKER ON. Piro, Irinaga, Felix and Stroud take in 
           the bleak cement space filled with recording and monitoring 
           equipment, a crumbling old corkboard and a large table.

                                 PIRO
                        This is home.

                                 FELIX
                        Charming.

                                 PIRO
                        Anything else we need, ground 
                        forces will provide.

                                 IRINAGA
                        How about a window?  

           Piro stares down Irinaga, who shrugs. Felix turns ON MONITOR 
           TO REVEAL: Saddam Hussein -- now down to just a mustache -- 
           sitting back against the wall, waiting. The Team stops 
           everything, absorbing the image. Piro stands arms crossed, 
           sizing up his larger-than-life Subject. Stroud breaks the 
           silence by flipping a switch to prep the recorder: 

                                 STROUD
                        Interview Session #1. February 7th, 
                        2003. Conducted by SSA George Piro.

           Everyone resumes work as Felix hands photos and documents to 
           Irinaga, who pins various images of Saddam to the board. 

           Duelfer enters, plopping down a thick accordion file.
                                 DUELFER
                        First round of intel reports on WMD 
                        just in case Vic suddenly decides 
                        to 'open up'...

                                 FELIX
                        What do you mean by ‘first round’?

                                 DUELFER
                        We’ve been monitoring Iraq for 
                        twenty years. There’s enough paper 
                        to fill this room ten times over.

           Piro smiles to cut through tension between his Team and 
           Duelfer's bumpy start.

                                 PIRO
                        Thank you, Charles. Today is just 
                        about starting a dialogue.

           Duelfer leans closer to Piro.

                                 DUELFER
                        You sure you don’t want me to sit 
                        in there with you?

                                 PIRO
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but 
                        to him: you look like a middle age 
                        white man from Washington... 
                            (off Duelfer)
                        I need Vic to know I’m in charge. 
                        No one else.

                                 DUELFER
                            (nods in agreement)
                        Small piece of advice, then: Don't 
                        smile. It'll make him have to work 
                        harder to win you over.

                                 STROUD
                        Ready when you are, Agent Piro. 

           Piro nods to Stroud, who hits RECORD. As he exits, leaving 
           Duelfer dissatisfied with not being invited inside.

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           A LOUD BUZZER SOUNDS. A thick door opens as Piro enters the 
           prison cell to find a stone cold Saddam, reading Hemingway's 
           'The Old Man and the Sea' in SILENCE.

                                 PIRO
                        Salaam Aleikum.  
           Piro offers to shake hands, but Saddam ignores. In Arabic:

                                 PIRO
                                       (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Saddam, my name is George. I'm 
                        here on behalf of the United States 
                        Government.

           Saddam puts down the book, then carefully sizes up his 
           interrogator, skeptical: 

                                 SADDAM
                        You work for Bush?

                                 PIRO
                        Yes. I've been sent to talk --

                                 SADDAM
                        You do not look CIA. Nor dress well 
                        enough to be from the White House. 
                        Whatever you are... you are but a 
                        child compared to me.

                                 PIRO
                        As I recall, you were my age when 
                        you became Vice President of Iraq.

                                 SADDAM
                        Ah... so, you know your history.

                                 PIRO
                        Enough to know you’re too shrewd to 
                        underestimate me.

                                 SADDAM
                            (switches to English)
                        Have a seat, Mr. George.

           Saddam intentionally smiles, looking up at the camera in the 
           corner on the wall, knowing he's being watched.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           In another room, Duelfer, Felix, Stroud and Irinaga are 
           recording the conversation, anxiously listening in.

                                 IRINAGA
                        What do you think?

                                 DUELFER
                        He’s doing better than CIA... 

           ON MONITOR: Piro sits down, nervously smiling back.
                                 DUELFER
                                          (CONT'D)
                        At least he was.  

           As they turn back to the Monitor to see:

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam loses the pleasant demeanor, unfolding his hands to 
           become more animated. Piro quickly sheds the smile.

                                 SADDAM
                        So, you are here to find the 
                        infamous Weapons of Mass 
                        Destruction for Bush to justify his 
                        unlawful invasion... Well, your 
                        friends at Langley have already 
                        tried and failed. Now, so will you.

                                 PIRO
                        My interests go beyond merely WMD.

                                 SADDAM
                        For more than ten years America has 
                        been obsessed with nothing else. 
                        What could possibly be more 
                        important?

                                 PIRO
                        You are an enigma to the West. This 
                        is about how history will remember 
                        Saddam Hussein.

           Saddam raises an eyebrow, intrigued.

                                 SADDAM
                        Go ahead. You may ask your 
                        questions.

                                 PIRO
                        What would you say has been your 
                        biggest accomplishment?

                                 SADDAM
                        There are too many.

                                 PIRO
                        And your greatest failure?

                                 SADDAM
                        I have none.
                                 PIRO
                            (one last try)
                        Is there anything you would have 
                        done differently?

           Saddam takes a moment, then LAUGHS to himself.

                                 SADDAM
                        Why would I reveal this to my 
                        enemy?

           Piro takes a beat, then tries a different tone:

                                 PIRO
                        The more openly we talk, the more 
                        freedom you get. I hear you like to 
                        garden. I can arrange for that.

                                 SADDAM
                        Do you not understand, Mr. George? 
                        This is a game. You do not know the 
                        cards that I hold. And I do not 
                        know yours. Am I full of shit? Or 
                        do I have a winning hand? We play 
                        until one of us suffers defeat.

                                 PIRO
                        I don't believe that's true.

                                 SADDAM
                        And that makes you naive... You 
                        want to know how history will 
                        remember me? The book will read: 
                        “the people of Iraq never stopped 
                        fighting against the illegal 
                        occupation of our land.” 

                                 PIRO
                        Then why do news report show 
                        celebrations in the streets?

           Saddam SLAMS HIS HAND DOWN ON THE TABLE, IN ARABIC:

                                 SADDAM
                        LIES.

           Piro remains calm, unaffected.

                                 PIRO
                        All the more reason to go on record 
                        with me, so the world can know your 
                        side of the story.
                                 SADDAM
                            (collects himself)
                        Earn your captive's trust first, 
                        then extract the intelligence. Is 
                        that your strategy, Mr. George?

                                 PIRO
                        This usually works better if we can 
                        come to trust each other.

                                 SADDAM
                        Fine. You want trust? Tell me: When 
                        did your family flee Lebanon?

           Piro stays quiet, trying to choose his next words carefully.

                        Oh, you may sound American in their 
                        tongue, dressed in your cheap polo 
                        tucked in tight, carefully groomed 
                        like them... But your Arabic still 
                        sounds like an Assyrian dog from 
                        Beirut. So, why did your parents 
                        abandon their country?

                                 PIRO
                        If they hadn’t, I wouldn't be 
                        sitting here today.

                                 SADDAM
                        And how many do you think died 
                        because of that decision?

                                 PIRO
                        I don't know... Have you ever asked 
                        yourself the same question?

                                 SADDAM
                        The sad part is, Mr. George, you've 
                        lost touch with your past and don’t 
                        realize you have no future. The 
                        Americans will never let you be one 
                        of them. They blame all Arabs for 
                        the fall of their towers. You will 
                        only ever be a pawn to them... 
                        Nothing more. Only less.

           Piro tries to hold his composure, clearly thrown:

                                 PIRO
                        You don’t know what I am.
                                 SADDAM
                        You are conflicted, so desperate to 
                        prove yourself, because deep down 
                        you live in fear that they will 
                        strip away everything dear to you.

                                 PIRO
                        So I take it you don't care about 
                        Iraq anymore? You'd rather hurl 
                        insults at me and my family than 
                        help your own people?

                                 SADDAM
                            (in Arabic)
                        A man who has no real country 
                        cannot insult me. You're not a real 
                        Arab. You're now an imitation. Go 
                        back to your suburbs, Mr. George... 
                        Allah calls to me.

           Piro looks to the camera, knowing everyone can see his 
           humiliation.

                                 PIRO
                        Mr. Saddam --

           But Saddam has turned his back and kneels upon his rug. As 
           Saddam begins to pray in Arabic...

           INT. BATHROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro BURSTS INSIDE to throw up into one of the stalls. 
           Hugging the bowl, he looks up at the light SHINING IN...

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           CLOSE ON a pair of delicate ADULT HANDS rolling a buttery 
           shortbread dough into a small round ball. LIGHT from outside 
           shines on the flour still floating in the air.

           A pair of curious YOUNG EYES watch the process unfold as the 
           hands push into the shortbread ball to create a small well at 
           the center, placing finely chopped wet walnuts inside. 

           The filled dough is pressed into a beautiful wooden mold that 
           results in a round cookie shape with a spiral pattern. 

           The hands then pull out a tray of baked cookies from a worn 
           stove. A pair of small YOUNG HANDS reaches for one of them, 
           but is immediately SWATTED AWAY.

           REVEAL an eager ten year old boy -- YOUNG GEORGE PIRO -- 
           rubbing his hand as his mother, FRANCIA (30), sifts powdered 
           sugar across her creations. In Arabic:  
                                 FRANCIA
                        Now you can have one, Georgie.

           Finally, she hands her son a cookie. As Young Piro is about 
           to gleefully bite in...

           INT. BATHROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Irinaga walks in, staying back as Piro remains in the stall.

                                 IRINAGA
                        You okay in there?

                                 PIRO
                        I’m fine. Just give me a minute.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Helluva first impression...

                                 PIRO
                            (not really)
                        Thanks.

                                 IRINAGA
                        That's not what I'm talking about. 

           Piro rises from the bowl, curious:

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 IRINAGA
                        Soon as you left, Saddam slipped 
                        one of the guards something from 
                        his notebook then went back to 
                        praying...

           Piro appears from the stall wiping his mouth, curious.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Irinaga returns to sit with Duelfer, Stroud and Felix. Piro 
           studies the note written in Arabic, then reads:

                                 PIRO
                        "Unbind your soul. It is my soul 
                        mate and you are my soul’s 
                        beloved... No house could have 
                        sheltered my heart as you have... 
                        If I were that house, you would be 
                        its dew... You are the soothing 
                        breeze... My soul is made fresh by 
                        you... And our Baath Party blossoms 
                        like a branch turns green. The 
                        medicine does not cure the ailing 
                        but the white rose does."
                                 IRINAGA
                        Robert Frost, he is not.

                                 STROUD
                        Guard said Vic wants his poem 
                        published in the New York Times.

                                 DUELFER
                        This doesn’t leave here until my 
                        people have time to analyze the 
                        text for any coded messaging.

           Piro quietly recites the last part of the poem back.

                                 PIRO
                        I already know: He's talking about 
                        Iraq and WMD.

           Piro thumbs through a file. Everyone else looks at him like 
           he's speaking another language.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Charles, wasn’t there a farm you 
                        inspected with the UN for weapons 
                        back in 96?

                                 DUELFER
                        The 'Chicken Farm' was a front for 
                        producing chemical weapons. 

           Piro pulls out a map of Iraq out on the table.

                                 PIRO
                        Where "our Baath Party blossoms 
                        like a branch turns green... The 
                        medicine does not cure the ailing 
                        but the white rose does.”

                                 IRINAGA
                        What is he talking about?

                                 PIRO
                        His party blossoms with weapons, 
                        hidden where green can grow... the 
                        farm. The medicine does not cure 
                        the ailing...

                                 STROUD
                        ...Chemical Weapons? 

                                 PIRO
                        Exactly.  

           Irinaga finds the structure on the map. 
                                 IRINAGA
                        Looks like the farm is still there, 
                        but there's only one building left.

                                 FELIX
                        And how do we know it's not a trap? 
                        This is the same guy who killed off 
                        his in-laws and still expected his 
                        wife and daughter to love him... 
                        What's stopping him from trying to 
                        get rid of us?

           The room goes quiet. All eyes turn to Piro.

                                 PIRO
                        He said this is a game. We can't 
                        win unless we are willing to play.

                                 DUELFER
                        I'll have ISG look into the site.

                                 PIRO
                        No, we're coming with you.

           Piro pats Irinaga on the shoulder to sign them both up.

                                 FELIX
                        You two want to go play in the 
                        sandbox? Be our guest.

                                 DUELFER
                        I’ll get you both cleared.

           Stroud cuts in to ask: 

                                 STROUD
                        How do you want to handle the daily 
                        reports to Washington?

           Piro is fixated as he watches on the Monitor: Saddam praying.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 STROUD
                        Agent Piro?

                                 PIRO
                            (snaps out of it)
                        Sorry, what was that?

                                 STROUD
                        The reports.

                                 PIRO
                        Right... Everything goes through me 
                        before leaving this office. 
           On Piro, returning back to study Saddam's every move.

           EXT. THE CHICKEN FARM/OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           Chyron: Operation Iron Promise.

           Two Army Humvees pull up to an old rusted building in the 
           middle of nowhere. Out of the vehicles emerge Roukey and 
           Baker with several other SOLDIERS followed by Duelfer, 
           Irinaga and Piro, wearing bulletproof vests and helmets. 
           Duelfer uses a GPS device to confirm the coordinates.

                                 DUELFER
                        Hazmats on.

           Roukey and Baker pull out a protective suit along with gas 
           masks. The other Soldiers secure the perimeter.

                                 DUELFER

                        Sandman, this is Observer. Radio

                        Remember: Don't touch anything 
                        unless I tell you otherwise.

                                 ROUKEY
                            (into mic)
                        Roger, wilco.

           Roukey nods before heading toward the Building. 

                                 IRINAGA
                        They know what they're doing?

                                 DUELFER
                        First time since the invasion 
                        anyone has encountered the real 
                        possibility of chemical weapons.

           As Roukey and Baker open the door and enter... INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. THE CHICKEN FARM/OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           Rows of flowering plants are set up on long tables. Papers 
           scattered along the floor. Roukey and Baker have their 
           weapons drawn when they hear a CLICK.  
           They aim their weapons in the direction of the sound 
           revealing the IRRIGATION SYSTEM WATERING the plants. Roukey 
           speaks into his comm.

                                 ROUKEY
                        No sign of Ali Baba. 

                                 DUELFER
                        What about the facility?

                                 ROUKEY
                        Papers scattered everywhere. 
                            (scans the room)
                        And at least a dozen plants on some 
                        kind of timer.

           Baker gets closer to find piles of large black and yellow 
           seeds near a mortar and pestle filled with powdery substance.

                                 DUELFER
                        Anything else?

                                 ROUKEY
                        Looks like they've been grinding 
                        the seeds down to a white powder.

                                 DUELFER
                        Listen to me very closely Sandman. 
                        You're looking at purified ricin. 
                        Even a few grains could kill you. 
                        So I need you to back out. Slowly.

           Roukey starts to move back until nearly stumbling over 
           something in his path. Baker turns to see an IRAQI MAN, 
           barely breathing, covered in burns and blisters with yellow 
           fluid -- on the ground.

                                 DUELFER
                        Sandman, report.

                                 BAKER
                        Observer, we have a breather.

           On Roukey, frozen in place.

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

           EXT. LABORATORY/THE CHICKEN FARM/OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           Roukey and Baker immediately pull off their masks, revealing 
           how sweaty and out of breath they are. MEDICS IN HAZMAT SUITS 
           haul out the Man on a stretcher. Duelfer approaches Piro.
                                 DUELFER
                        They stabilized him, but no 
                        guarantee he’ll be able to talk.

                                 IRINAGA
                        I still don't get why Vic would 
                        want us to find his secret stash?

           Duelfer notices above the door a sign that reads: Al Abud.

                                 DUELFER
                        To show he has a strong hand. If 
                        there’s an “Al Abud” network of 
                        Iraqi insurgents capable of 
                        producing chemical weapons: How 
                        many are there? How well-financed 
                        are they? This is why I fucking 
                        hate incomplete data.

           Piro half-listening, lost-in-thought, chimes in:

                                 PIRO
                        But at least we know Vic may have 
                        something tangible to bargain with.

           Irinaga and Duefler raise an eyebrow, unconvinced as the 
           other Soldiers continue to keep watch. 

           In the distance, reveal: Hassan with Ali, stealthily watching 
           unnoticed from behind a hill. Hassan quickly zips up his 
           backpack with gas masks and cellphones rigged as remote 
           detonators. As they flee into the desert, unnoticed...

           INT. LOBBY/HOTEL/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           A Western-friendly hotel that makes you almost forget this is 
           Baghdad. Piro and Irinaga walk through the automated sliding 
           glass doors, feeling a cool blast of AC.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Come on. 
                            (points to dining room)
                        I think we’ve earned a round.

                                 PIRO
                        I need a rain check.

                                 IRINAGA
                        We're in the desert, Piro. How do 
                        you expect me to cash a rain check?

                                 PIRO
                        We'll find an oasis. I promise. 
           Irinaga nods, patting his friend on the back, sincere:

                                 IRINAGA
                        Fine, but you better not be going 
                        upstairs to work.

           As Piro rides up the elevator, Irinaga walks to:

           INT. DINING ROOM/HOTEL/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           A sparse after-dinner CROWD. Felix and Stroud sit at a small 
           round table with wine when Irinaga joins them.

                                 STROUD
                        No Agent Piro?

                                 IRINAGA
                        Rain check.

                                 FELIX
                        But we’re in a desert --

                                 IRINAGA
                        You don’t have to tell me.
                            (signals waiter)
                        A beer, please. Any will do.

                                 FELIX
                        Look, I know he’s your friend, 
                        Todd, but I’m worried how long the 
                        guy is going to last out here.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Don’t let the Boy Scout facade fool 
                        you. Piro can be cutthroat.

                                 STROUD
                        I think Theresa and I are just 
                        concerned over his... 

                                 FELIX
                        Experience.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Look, I’ve known him since we were 
                        both local PD. He takes his time in 
                        the box, but always gets the other 
                        side talking.

           Waiter returns with a beer that Irinaga immediately downs.

                                 FELIX
                        That may have worked in...
                                 IRINAGA
                        Ceres, California.

                                 FELIX
                        Ceres, right. I'm telling you right 
                        now it's not going to cut it with--
                            (quietly)
                        A deposed dictator accused of 
                        possible war crimes.

                                 STROUD
                        He did get us to the Chicken Farm.

                                 FELIX
                        He found a trail of breadcrumbs, 
                        where it leads is another story... 
                        Besides, I heard the Bureau only 
                        chose him because they wanted a 
                        native Arabic speaker and we only 
                        have twelve in the field.

                                 IRINAGA
                        The reality is -- we don't 
                        understand this place the way Piro 
                        does. Shallow pond means he gets to 
                        be our big fucking fish.

           Duelfer approaches as the Group gets quiet.

                                 DUELFER
                        Mind if I join?

           Irinaga gestures for Duelfer to pull up a chair.

                                 IRINAGA
                        I thought you were staying across 
                        town at the Victory Complex.

                                 DUELFER
                        I was hoping we could discuss Agent 
                        Piro's current strategy...

           As Irinaga, Stroud and Felix's face all say 'yes'...

           INT. PIRO'S ROOM/HOTEL/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro opens the door to find a package on his bed, which he 
           opens to find his iPod inside. Piro powers on the iPod, now 
           filled with music and voice memos. He puts on the classic 
           white ear buds, then presses play.
                                 MEHRI (V.O.)
                        Lazar and I loaded some music and 
                        recordings to keep you company. Now 
                        hurry up and get home. Love You...

           Reaching deeper, Piro pulls out a pocket size photo of 
           LAZAR'S SCHOOL PORTRAIT.

                                 LAZAR (V.O.)
                        Hi baba, mama helped me make this 
                        for you...

           Piro can't help but smile until he notices at the bottom of 
           the box is a crayon drawing of Saddam signed by Lazar.  

                                              (CONT'D)
                                 LAZAR (V.O.)
                        We went to the library every day 
                        after school to make a special 
                        report on Saddam Hussein for you. I 
                        learned many things about him. My 
                        favorite fact so far is...

           On the recording, Lazar clears his throat and speaks as if 
           he's giving a class presentation:

                                              (CONT'D)
                                 LAZAR (V.O.)
                        Did you know that Saddam penned a 
                        best-selling romance novel?

           Piro pauses, then fast-forwards.

                                              (CONT'D)
                                 LAZAR (V.O.)
                        Saddam fact number 32: Baba, did 
                        you know that Saddam commissioned a 
                        Qur’an written in his own blood?

           Piro pulls off the earbuds, then takes out his satellite 
           phone, dialing.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Hello?

                                 PIRO
                        Why is my son sending me drawings 
                        and recorded messages about Saddam?

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Oh, I didn't expect the package to 
                        get there so quickly.

                                 PIRO
                        Mehri, answer the question.
                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Lazar wanted to know more about 
                        what his father was doing over in 
                        Iraq, so I assigned a kind of book 
                        report for him.

                                 PIRO
                        You don't think he's too young to 
                        learn about a murdering dictator?

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        I'm not going to lie to him for 
                        you, George.

                                 PIRO
                        For me? 

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        I think it's therapeutic. He needs 
                        to see the world for what it is.

                                 PIRO
                        And what? I don't get a say?

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Of course you do... but you never 
                        want to talk about this stuff. You 
                        always skirt over anything about 
                        the Middle East, your time in 
                        Beirut --

                                 PIRO
                        You want to talk about it? Fine. 
                        Let's talk.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Okay. Let me put Lazar on.

                                 PIRO
                        No.
                            (sighs)
                        I miss you, habibata.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                            (genuinely worried)
                        Did something happen?

           Piro is silent, leaning Lazar's photo on his desk.

                                              (CONT'D)
                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        You gotta give me something, 
                        George.

           Another beat, then Piro conjures a faux answer: 
                                 PIRO
                        Baghdad has made realize how much I 
                        truly hate shoveling snow... 
                            (Mehri sighs)
                        I mean if I think about how many 
                        hours I've spent lifting frozen 
                        water from one spot to another -- 
                        Makes you really wonder if we 
                        should consider a warmer climate.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        I'm serious, George.

                                 PIRO
                        Be glad you're not here. That's all 
                        you need to know. Trust me, Mehri.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        And I wish you would trust me.

           Out his window, Piro sees Baghdad at night, then confesses:

                                 PIRO
                        It feels just like the summer 
                        before I came to the States. Beirut 
                        was like a pressure cooker. Now, 
                        Baghdad is waiting to erupt. Except 
                        these people have no way out.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        You're doing everything you can.

           Piro looks at the photo of Lazar one last time.

                                 PIRO
                        Tell Lazar I love him, okay? I'll 
                        call you again as soon as I can.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        George...

           Piro hangs up the phone, then turns back to the cartoon 
           drawing of Saddam, crumbling his son's work in the trash can.

           EXT. STREET/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Piro, in shorts and tee, runs in the early morning, listening 
           to Kanye West's "Jesus Walks". Moving to the rhythm of the 
           beat, he starts to see IRAQIS staring at him as an outsider. 

           Rounding a corner, he catches his breath, spotting an IRAQI 
           MOTHER, FATHER and SON eating a familiar powdered sugar 
           cookie. The child locks eyes with Piro until U.S. Army Spc. 
           DON CLARY (21) presses Piro against a wall, ENDING THE MUSIC. 
                                 CLARY
                        Hands where I can see him.

                                 PIRO
                            (in Arabic, to the Family)
                        Get out of here.

           Clary pushes Piro harder against the coarse wall, scratching 
           Piro's hand in the process. The Iraqi Family moves on.

                                 CLARY
                        Wait to be spoken to.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm an American.

           Army Staff Sgt. CLINT WISDOM (39) steps in to assess:

                                 WISDOM
                        Then why are you running around the 
                        Green Zone without ID?

                                 PIRO
                        I didn't realize --

                                 WISDOM
                        Case you haven't noticed, we're in 
                        the middle of a war zone with 
                        people blowing themselves up.

           Clary is about to cuff Piro's bleeding hand, when -- 

                                 DUELFER (O.C.)
                        Let him go.

           Wisdom and Clary turn around to see Duelfer standing with 
           Roukey and Baker by their Humvee.

                                 DUELFER 
                        Unless you want your superior to 
                        know you tried to arrest an FBI 
                        Agent.

           Clary sighs, then immediately releases Piro, who holds his 
           bloody hand defensively.

                                 WISDOM
                        We've been on high alert after 
                        yesterday's IED. Two of our friends 
                        got caught in the blast.

                                 CLARY
                            (hands back his iPod)
                        I love Kanye, by the way. 
                                 PIRO
                        Thanks...

                                 WISDOM
                        Keep that ID on you, okay?

           Clary and Wisdom tip their helmets goodbye. Piro, rattled, 
           turns paranoid toward Duelfer.

                                 PIRO
                        You following me, Charles?

                                 DUELFER
                        You're no good to me dead. 

           On Piro, unhappy and unnerved, climbing into the Humvee.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Duelfer, Irinaga, Felix and Stroud are all gathered around 
           the table with the map of Iraq still laid out. A dour Piro -- 
           showered, changed and hand bandaged -- enters quietly.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Good morning, sunshine.

           Piro shoots a 'fuck you' at Irinaga, then turns to Stroud:

                                 PIRO
                        Is the map prepped for Vic?

                                 STROUD
                        We wanted to talk to you about 
                        that...

           Stroud carefully gathers the right words as Piro furrows his 
           brow at her overly cautious tone. Felix jumps in --

                                 FELIX
                        We’re concerned by how easily Vic 
                        decided to cooperate...

                                 PIRO
                            (annoyed)
                        And what do you expect me to do 
                        with that concern, Felix?

                                 STROUD
                        Right now, he doesn’t know you went 
                        to the Farm. The more you withhold, 
                        the better we'll be able to sift 
                        through what's real and what's not. 

           Piro jabs his finger at Saddam waiting on the Monitor. 
                                 PIRO
                        I’m moments away from going back in 
                        and you want to toss out the script 
                        along with our only lead? Are you 
                        out of your mind? Vic is trying to 
                        negotiate with us.

                                 FELIX
                        He openly suggested he might be 
                        "full of shit". We have to consider 
                        this could be his way to bluff his 
                        way to freedom.

                                 PIRO
                        You think you know more about Vic 
                        than I do?

                                 FELIX
                            (restraining herself)
                        I think its best to tread lightly, 
                        Agent Piro.

                                 PIRO
                        Last I checked, I'm the one who 
                        uncovered the lab; who sits across 
                        the table from him; who was chosen 
                        to lead this interrogation. Not 
                        you. Or anyone else in this room.
                            (stares at Felix)
                        We understand each other?

           Felix begrudgingly rolls up the map, handing it over.

                                 FELIX
                        Perfectly, sir.

           Duelfer watches Piro take the map, then head into:

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Guards open the door to let Piro inside. Saddam sits, wearing 
           glasses, writing while eating Doritos from a family size bag.

                                 SADDAM
                        One moment. 

           Piro takes a seat, masking any emotion that he was forced to 
           wait. Saddam finishes, closing his notebook and removing 
           glasses. He wipes his Dorito fingers with baby wipes.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        Another poem... Did you enjoy my 
                        last one?
                                 PIRO
                        So much that I came to discuss its 
                        meaning.

           Saddam studies Piro closely.

                                 SADDAM
                        You look like you’ve been getting 
                        some sun, Mr. George. Have you 
                        gotten out to see the sights?
                            (bitterly)
                        It's been almost a year since I've 
                        seen my beloved Baghdad.

                                 PIRO
                        You wanted me to find the Chicken 
                        Farm hidden in your poem. Why?

           Saddam offers Piro a baby wipe.

                                 SADDAM
                        You're bleeding.

           Piro realizes his cut has reopened, accepting the baby wipe 
           to clot the opening.

                                 PIRO
                        It's nothing.

                                 SADDAM
                        So, you are a literary scholar now? 
                        What did you find at this ‘Chicken 
                        Farm’? The U.N. inspected that site 
                        in 1996, destroying everything.

                                 PIRO
                        Then why is ricin being grown by 
                        insurgents loyal to you?

                                 SADDAM
                        You tell me, Mr. George. I thought 
                        you said the Americans fully 
                        controlled Iraq and my people have 
                        abandoned me? Unless perhaps, not 
                        everything you say is so true.  

           Piro lays out the map with the Chicken Farm marked.

                                 PIRO
                        Neither of us want to see any more 
                        Iraqis die. If you show me the 
                        remaining labs, we can make sure 
                        this doesn't escalate any further. 
           Saddam looks at the map, then back to Piro.

                                 SADDAM
                        I can tell you're not a Muslim or 
                        you would understand the Qur'an 
                        teaches to not fear death.

           The sanctimonious comment triggers Piro to blurt out:

                                 PIRO
                        You gassed your own people at 
                        Halabja... so don't suddenly claim 
                        you're a religious martyr.

           Saddam simmers at mention of the infamous attack, then 
           changes tack:

                                 SADDAM
                        Which side of the civil war in 
                        Lebanon did your good Christian 
                        family fight on?

                                 PIRO
                        I don't see how my family's past is 
                        going to end this war.

                                 SADDAM
                        You said you wanted to earn my 
                        trust? You give, I give. You try to 
                        take? You get nothing.

           Piro looks into Saddam's eyes, then accepts the bargain.

                                 PIRO
                        They came to America before having 
                        to choose a side.

                                 SADDAM
                        How did you feel knowing your 
                        parents abandoned your homeland?

                                 PIRO
                            (reluctant)
                        A car bomb in our neighborhood left 
                        them with no other choice.

                                 SADDAM
                        There is always a choice.

                                 PIRO
                        I was young. I didn't understand. 
                                 SADDAM
                        A child understands more than a 
                        parent realizes.

                                 PIRO
                        ...I was angry at them.

                                 SADDAM
                        For what?

                                 PIRO
                        For never giving me a choice. 

                                 SADDAM
                        So, what did the angry boy do?

           Piro swallows at the painful memory, then turns back to 
           Saddam:

                                 PIRO
                        I think it's your turn, Mr. Saddam.

                                 SADDAM
                        I want you to see why the 
                        insurgency grows every day -- 
                        because America provides no 
                        alternative. My people will not 
                        stop. They will not cower. They 
                        will not flee. Until you help me 
                        gain my freedom to guide them 
                        otherwise.

           Piro feels outplayed by Saddam, speaking in Arabic:

                                 PIRO
                        What are the insurgents planning to 
                        do with the chemical weapons?

                                 SADDAM
                            (in English)
                        I wonder how many more Americans 
                        have to die before you realize you 
                        have no choice but to release me... 

           Saddam smiles again, then goes back to eating Doritos. 

           EXT. SOUK/BAGHDAD - DAY

           An outdoor market filled with spices, meats and nuts. Hassan 
           loads a backpack into the trunk of a car, quickly closing it 
           and walking away. He gets a few blocks away to join Ali at a 
           nearby STREET VENDOR to order in Arabic:
                                 HASSAN
                        Two shish kebab.

           Vendor hands the kebab to Hassan, who hands one to Ali.

                                 HASSAN
                                         (CONT'D)
                        This is what you should be making 
                        from now on.

                                 ALI
                        He has a proper grill. Our stove 
                        barely works.

                                 HASSAN
                        Shut up and eat.

           As they bite into the stick meat, Hassan dials. Ali watches 
           an American Humvee drive past the car with the backpack 
           triggering an EXPLOSION, sending the area into CHAOS. As the 
           two continue eating, walking away as if nothing happened. 

           INT. BATHROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro hurls into one of the stalls, again.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           A weakened Piro returns only to find only Duelfer remaining.

                                 PIRO
                        Where is everyone?

                                 DUELFER
                        Getting some air... I thought you 
                        and I could talk.

           The concern on Duelfer's face prompts Piro to realize:

                                 PIRO
                        What is this, Charles? A coup?

                                 DUELFER
                        We are only trying to help you.

                                 PIRO
                        So, you're the one who turned them 
                        against me...

                                 DUELFER
                        They feel the same way I do: We 
                        need to be more careful with him.

           Piro and Duelfer turn to Saddam on the monitor.
                                 PIRO
                        Is this because I didn't let you 
                        sit in on the interrogation?

                                 DUELFER
                        Vic didn't hold Iraq together for 
                        thirty years by offering olive 
                        branches. He did so by taking out 
                        his enemies. The only way he's ever 
                        going to cooperate is if we can 
                        gain leverage over him. Not the 
                        other way around.

           Accepting the criticism, Piro relaxes his body language.

                                 PIRO
                        You didn't tell them about what 
                        happened on my run this morning ?

                                 DUELFER
                            (reassuring)
                        What run?

           Piro nods in appreciation, then Duelfer solemnly reports:

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 DUELFER
                        George... You should know there was 
                        another IED that went off in the 
                        Green Zone.

           On Duelfer and Piro, staring at their captive writing his 
           poetry and consuming more Doritos.

           INT. BREAK ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Irinaga starts loading quarters into a soda machine, 
           realizing he's short. Piro provides the remaining quarter.

                                 IRINAGA
                        We're at war and they're still 
                        collecting fucking quarters.

                                 PIRO
                        How long have we been friends?

           Irinaga loads the quarters in, pressing his choice.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Fifteen years.

                                 PIRO
                        Then you should know by now you can 
                        tell me when I fuck up.
           Irinaga collects his soda, then cracks it open.

                                 IRINAGA
                        The fact that you know you're 
                        fucking up is a good start.

                                 PIRO
                        What about Felix and Stroud?

                                 IRINAGA
                        With the breather from the Farm... 
                        They're already looking for a way 
                        to transfer.

                                 PIRO
                        I'll talk to them. What about you?

                                 IRINAGA
                        I'm here to the bitter end...
                            (half-joking)
                        Unless you pull that I-know-better-
                        than-you shit with me.

           Piro looks to his friend, knows he's being dead serious.

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/CAMP SLAYER - DAY

           The Iraqi Man, covered in blisters and burns, wears a 
           breathing mask with an EKG monitor and IV drip. Felix and 
           Stroud are in OR scrubs. Stroud photographs his body while 
           Felix goes through a file, dictating into a recorder:

                                 FELIX
                        Toxicology report show traces of 
                        ricin in his blood stream.

           Stroud SNAPS ANOTHER PHOTO.

                                        (CONT'D)
                                 FELIX
                        Burns and blisters appear to be 
                        from heavy exposure to Mustard Gas.

           Stroud SNAPS ANOTHER. Felix pauses recorder.

                                 STROUD
                        Looks agonizing.

                                 FELIX
                            (re: file)
                        He's lucky to be alive.

           Felix hits record again.
                                 FELIX
                                        (CONT'D)
                        Abrasions on his wrist indicate a 
                        struggle prior to exposure.

           The Iraqi's hand GRABS Stroud by the arm, YELLING IN ARABIC.

                                 STROUD
                        Call the nurse.

           The Iraqi SCREAMS LOUDER as SOLDIERS, wearing rubber gloves, 
           enter to RESTRAIN HIM as the EKG goes off the charts. 

                                 FELIX
                        Careful... He's in shock.

           The Iraqi keeps flailing as his body starts to SEIZURE OUT OF 
           CONTROL until finally the EKG FLATLINES. Felix stands frozen, 
           horrified. Tears stream from Stroud...

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/CAMP SLAYER - DAY

           Piro arrives with Irinaga to find Stroud, wrapped in a 
           blanket being comforted by Felix. Piro offers them both tea 
           as a peace offering, genuinely concerned:

                                 PIRO
                        What happened...

           Stroud quietly sips the tea, still in shock. Felix recaps, 
           still emotional.

                                 FELIX
                        He woke up, shouting. Angry.

                                 PIRO
                        He didn't hurt you?

                                 STROUD
                        No. He was trying to tell us 
                        something.

           Piro sits down, notices the recorder and kindly asks:

                                 PIRO
                        Can you play it for me?

           Felix turns on the recording as Piro carefully listens to the 
           Iraqi REPEATING HIMSELF.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Play it again.
           Piro listens even more closely this time.

                                 PIRO
                                       (CONT'D)
                        "God forgive me... I had no choice. 
                        Please understand... I had no 
                        choice... God forgive me... The 
                        chemicals were only to protect... 
                        Please God... He lied. He's a 
                        Butcher. He is Iblis”... the Devil 
                        incarnate.

           The tape ends. SILENCE. Piro turns to Stroud.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Where is he now?

                                 STROUD
                        Dead.

           Irinaga tries to restrain his anger, sighing:

                                 IRINAGA
                        When are we going to catch a 
                        fucking break?

           Piro masks his reaction with his hand over his mouth, then 
           notices how affected Stroud and Felix are. 

                                 PIRO
                        Look, I want to apologize about 
                        lashing out before, about starting 
                        off on the wrong foot, but --

                                 FELIX
                        You were doing so well.

                                 PIRO
                        If you leave now, there's no way 
                        I'm going to get him to talk.

           Stroud puts down the tea.

                                 STROUD
                        If we wanted to be punching bags, 
                        Theresa and I would've stayed in 
                        DC. 

                                 PIRO
                        Stay and I promise things will be 
                        different.
                                 FELIX
                        You have any idea how hard it is to 
                        be two women in this testosterone 
                        dust bowl?

                                 PIRO
                            (genuine)
                        I don't.

                                 FELIX
                        Then don't promise something that 
                        you can't back up with a single 
                        concrete fact.

                                 PIRO
                        I read your report on proposed 
                        interrogation methods for Vic...

           Felix looks surprised.

                                 STROUD
                        ...They're not "enhanced" like the 
                        ones the CIA has been using. 

                                 PIRO
                        True, but doesn't mean we can't 
                        still fuck with him.

           On the Team, gathering around to listen as a SEQUENCE BEGINS 
           TO UNFOLD as a deconstructed version of Mary J. Blige's 
           "Family Affair" subtly begins to play... 

           INT. GUARD POST/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Two GUARDS stand at the ready outside of Saddam's cell, when 
           another set of Hispanic GUARDS relieve their post.

                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                        He's gotten comfortable, so let's 
                        start stripping that away...

                                 HISPANIC GUARD #1
                        ¿Qué envió tu esposa esta semana?  

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam listens to the Guards speak, but clearly doesn't 
           understand what is being spoken. MUSIC CONTINUES.

                                 HISPANIC GUARD #2 (O.C.)
                        Más calcetines. Tengo hoyos de pie 
                        todo el día.

           The GUARDS then enter to do an inspection of the cell. 
                                 PIRO (V.O.)
                        Then we make him lose track of day 
                        and night.

           One Guard removes the clock on the wall. The other takes the 
           copy of 'The Old Man and the Sea, then promptly exit to:

           INT. GUARD POST/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           The Guards close the door, handing over clock and book along 
           with their watches to Felix and Stroud. MUSIC CONTINUES.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro, Irinaga, Stroud and Felix continue their conversation 
           around the table with a bag of Doritos and Froot Loops.

                                 FELIX
                        He's obsessed with processed foods.  
                        I've seen him eat a family size bag 
                        of Doritos in under ten minutes.

                                 PIRO
                        What doesn't he like?

                            (checks her notes)
                        Hates Froot Loops with a passion.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Guy has spent so many years afraid 
                        of being poisoned, Vacuum seal must 
                        give him peace of mind.

                                 PIRO
                        Then we take that away, too.

           On Piro, adding Froot Loops to his list. MUSIC CONTINUES.

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Food slot opens as a Guard slide in individual sized box of 
           Froot Loops, already opened. Saddam turns furious, BANGING ON 
           THE DOOR.

                                 SADDAM
                            (in Arabic)
                        Open the door.

           No response. Saddam BANGS HARDER. Again, in Arabic:

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        I will fuck your mother and make 
                        you watch her scream. 
           As Saddam continues to BANG. TIME CUT TO:

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro, Irinaga, Felix and Stroud watch ON THE MONITOR: a 
           sullen Saddam turning the radio dial until stopping to hear 
           the full version of "Family Affair" on the radio. He starts 
           to drum his fingers on the table to the beat.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Do you know he was a fan?

                                 STROUD
                        Yeah. He strangely loves Mary J. 
                        Blige.

                                 PIRO
                        Cut the music.

           With the flip of a switch, Stroud ENDS THE MUSIC. Felix hands 
           Piro a laptop. The SILENCE is sobering for everyone.

                                 FELIX
                        The clip you asked for is cued and 
                        ready to play.

           As Piro takes the laptop into:

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam sits with his arms folded in protest. Piro enters 
           placing the laptop on the table.

                                 SADDAM
                        I know what you're doing.

           Piro shrugs, playing dumb.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm sorry?

                                 SADDAM
                        You cannot break me. Men far 
                        stronger than you have tried.

                                 PIRO
                        Is there a problem with your cell?

                                 SADDAM
                            (takes a beat)
                        The problem lies with my 
                        interrogator.

           Piro sets up the laptop, while Saddam continues:

                        You know I had to leave my country 
                        when I was young. Earned a law 
                        degree in Egypt. All before I could 
                        return.

                                 PIRO
                        You were in exile because you 
                        failed to assassinate a political 
                        opponent.

                                 SADDAM
                        We all channel anger in different 
                        ways, Mr. George. What did you do 
                        with all your rage?

                                 PIRO
                        I watched cartoons...

           Saddam glares at Piro with contempt, who then hits play.

           On the MONITOR: a clip from South Park: Bigger, Longer and 
           Uncut PLAYS as Saddam shakes his head in disagreement.

                                 SADDAM
                        This is what Bush cares to show me? 
                        Cartoons for children? 

                                 PIRO
                        Children aren't allowed to watch 
                        this, but it did make eighty 
                        million at the box office.

           ON MONITOR: A Cartoon Version of Saddam lets out a sigh.

                        What did you do today, Satan? 

                                 SATAN [ON MONITOR]
                        You don't care.

                        Hey fella. Relax. This whole

                        Do you remember when you first got 
                        here? We used to talk all night 
                        long. Until the sun came up... We 
                        would just lie in bed and TALK. 

                                 SADDAM HUSSEIN [ON MONITOR]
                        That's because I wanted to fuck 
                        you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you 
                        get those pants down!

                        I mean cute dumb. Now bend over.

                                 SATAN [ON MONITOR]
                        How come you always want to make 
                        love to me from behind? Is it 
                        because you want to pretend I'm 
                        somebody else?

                                 SADDAM HUSSEIN [ON MONITOR]
                        Satan, your ass is gigantic and 
                        red, who am I gonna pretend you 
                        are? Helen Reddy? 

           Piro hits PAUSE. Saddam grimaces with his arms crossed.

                                 SADDAM
                        Bullshit western propaganda.

                                 PIRO
                        There’s hundreds of hours more. 
                        I’ve seen it all. And soon Iraqis 
                        will, too. One way or another. What 
                        you say here could be the last 
                        chance to define your legacy before 
                        it spirals out of control.

                                 SADDAM
                        You have children, Mr. George? 
                            (off Piro, stiff)
                        I know you wouldn't insult me with 
                        a lie.

                                 PIRO
                        A boy.

                                 SADDAM
                        Poor child... I bet his father has 
                        never taken him to see Beirut. To 
                        be surrounded by his own people. 
                                 PIRO
                        Perhaps after this is over, it will 
                        be safe there again, too.

                                 SADDAM
                        That’s right. It’d be a shame to 
                        have your son brutally murdered by 
                        enemy forces as mine were.

                                 PIRO
                        I was told your sons were given the 
                        chance to surrender.

                                 SADDAM
                        Then they would be cowards like you 
                        and your family.

                                 PIRO
                        I was also told you did not resist 
                        being taken by US forces.

           Saddam turns arch toward his Captor, raising his voice:

                                 SADDAM
                        Like Nebuchadnezzar and the ancient 
                        kings that birthed the modern 
                        world, history will never forget I 
                        ruled over the divided factions of 
                        Iraq when no other man could.
                            (stands)
                        I alone stood against the Bushes in 
                        America, Khomeini in Iran and the 
                        entire United Nations. Only Saddam. 
                        President of Iraq.

                                 PIRO
                        But you're no longer president.

           Saddam grumbles, then SLAMS HIS HAND DOWN ON THE TABLE.

                                 SADDAM
                        Enough. I'm done playing your 
                        games. Now, you play mine.

           Saddam takes the Froot Loops, pouring the box onto the table.

           INT. DINING ROOM/HOTEL/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Irinaga carries a plate full from the buffet to join Piro, 
           Felix and Stroud eating breakfast. TV plays above the bar.

                        Six days. Still no food.

                        He's testing our resolve.

           On TV: George W. Bush, wearing a tux, jokes from a podium at 
           the White House Correspondence Dinner.

                                 BUSH [ON TV]
                        Those weapons of mass destruction 
                        have got to be somewhere... 

           The AUDIENCE LAUGHS, so does Irinaga.

                                 STROUD
                        You don't joke about war.

           Irinaga regrets his pleasure.

                                 IRINAGA
                        We found one lab. We'll find the 
                        rest. Then this will all start to 
                        make sense again.

                                 STROUD
                        They said the same thing about 
                        Vietnam.

           Piro sees the tension growing as Duelfer appears.

                                 DUELFER
                        Bolton wants a word.

                        Let's not let Washington get 
                        between us, okay?

           As Piro rises, he signs the bill for his Team.

           INT. BOLTON'S OFFICE/US EMBASSY/GREEN ZONE - DAY

           A stately, but unpersonalized office space with windows.

                                 DUELFER
                        So, they finally gave you windows.

           Bolton is reviewing a document, glancing at Duelfer and Piro 
           sitting together across the desk.

                                 BOLTON
                        General Dayton said it was safer to 
                        work out of the Green Zone until 
                        the insurgency was under control.
           Bolton goes back reviewing the document. Piro waits anxiously 
           for a response until finally Bolton closes the folder 
           grasping his hands together. 

                                 BOLTON

                        that Saddam likes eating Cheetos?

                        Doritos, sir.

                                 BOLTON
                        I don't care if he jerks off to 
                        Little Debbie. Where's the WMD?

                                 PIRO
                        We've found that --  

                                 DUELFER
                        -- Our investigation is going to 
                        take more time than we thought. 

                                 BOLTON
                        There is no time. Only polls that 
                        don't like our President... The war 
                        hangs in the balance while you two 
                        sit there letting Saddam go off on 
                        a fucking hunger strike.

                                 PIRO
                        We're not at the point yet where he 
                        can be force fed. The Geneva 
                        Conventions --

                                 BOLTON
                        You think the jihadists give a shit 
                        about the Conventions? 
                            (leans in)
                        I don't care if you have to stick a 
                        feeding tube up his asshole to keep 
                        him conscious long enough to tell 
                        us where the chemical and 
                        biological weapons are hidden.

           Duelfer nods to Piro, who reluctantly pulls out of his jacket 
           pocket the iPod recording the conversation. Bolton loses some 
           of his swagger.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 BOLTON
                        Very clever, Agent Piro. Fine. Keep 
                        your recording. And I'll keep my 
                        eye on both of you. Those 
                        conversations with your wife Mehri

                        Are we done?

                        We'll be done when you deliver the 
                        WMD that our government knows are 
                        buried in this godforsaken land.

           As Piro and Duelfer rise to exit to:

           INT. HALLWAY/US EMBASSY/GREEN ZONE - DAY

           Piro closes the door, walking with Duelfer, checking to make 
           sure they are, in fact, alone.

                                 PIRO
                        Why didn't you tell him about the 
                        ricin and mustard gas from Al Abud?

                                 DUELFER
                        We need allies first or our 
                        intelligence could be used as 
                        political propaganda...
                            (off Piro, surprised)
                        Oh, don't act so innocent. This is 
                        a messaging war whether we like it 
                        or not. And frankly, our side is 
                        losing.  

                                 PIRO
                        Which side is that?

                                 DUELFER
                            (dodges)
                        I'm going back to DC for a few 
                        days. The Deputy Director at 
                        Langley is a friend. I think he'll 
                        be able to buy us more time.

                                 PIRO
                        I thought we were going to look at 
                        the latest IED blast? 

                                 DUELFER
                        You are. I have a plane to catch... 
                        Just keep me posted and Vic 
                        breathing until I get back. 

           On Piro, taken aback, watching Duelfer walk out the door.

           EXT. SOUK/BAGHDAD - DAY

           The site of the IED explosion where the detonated car remains 
           charred to a crisp.  
           Nearby VENDORS gather their belongings to recover. Piro 
           arrives, wearing a bullet proof vest, to find Wisdom and 
           Clary leading the SOLDIERS securing the area.

                                 PIRO
                        Sgt. Wisdom... Special Agent Piro.

                                 WISDOM
                            (shakes hand)
                        Duelfer said you'd be coming.

                                 PIRO
                            (re: bombing)
                        Can you tell me what happened?

                                 CLARY
                        My buddy would still be alive if we 
                        had better armor on our Humvees. 
                        That's what fucking happened.

                                 PIRO
                        How many caught in the blast?

                                 WISDOM
                        Four of ours. Half a dozen of 
                        theirs. Fifteen more hit by 
                        schrapnel. Insurgents are getting 
                        better at building explosives. This 
                        one had a remote trigger.

           Widsom tosses Piro what's left of the remote.

                                 PIRO
                        What about witnesses to ID the 
                        bomber?

                                 WISDOM
                        No one is talking to us, Agent 
                        Piro.

                                 CLARY
                        I thought we'd be getting a hero's 
                        welcome for liberating them...

           Piro refrains from responding, instead handing back the 
           remote to Clary.

                                 WISDOM
                        You're more than welcome to look 
                        around.

           Piro nods, walking into the heart of the blast zone. As he 
           notices IRAQIS carrying out BODIES from under the rubble, 
           Piro stands watching as the IMAGE TURNS INTO... 
           EXT. SOUK/BEIRUT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           FROM THE POV OF SOMEONE RUNNING FAST DOWN THE STREET.

           Reveal an emotional Young Piro, grasping a one lira note, 
           sprinting ahead of his Father, who calls out with concern:

                                 LAZAR SR.
                            (in Arabic)
                        Slow down. 

           Suddenly, a LOUD BOOM RINGS OUT followed by PEOPLE fleeing in 
           panic toward the other direction. Instead of turning away, 
           Young Piro pushes on, desperate to know what happened.

                                           (CONT'D)
                                 LAZAR SR.
                        Georgie, come back here.

           Turning a corner, he finds the Market has been wiped out by 
           an explosion. PEOPLE carry out bloody AMPUTEES while the 
           charred BODIES lay untouched. The Young Piro is frozen, 
           watching black smoke rising from the rubble. CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. OFFICE/MAIN HALL/CAMP SLAYER/VICTORY COMPLEX - NIGHT

           A bare bureaucratic space, lit only by fluorescents. Piro 
           stares frozen, like as a child, observing on the MONITOR: a 
           2003 CBS pre-War Dan Rather interview with Saddam.

                        You are suggesting, you’re urging a 
                        debate with President Bush? On 
                        television?

                        The American people, as we see on 
                        films -- are great. On films, we 
                        see that the Americans, when they 
                        are challenged for a duel, they 
                        will not -- decline the -- the 
                        offer. As the Arabs would... We are 
                        not asking for a duel. But...

                        and all of the people in the world 
                        in a debate that is shown on 
                        television, between myself and Mr.

                        This is not a joke.

                                 SADDAM’S TRANSLATOR [ON TV]
                        No, this is something proposed in 
                        earnest.

           Piro pauses the tape on Saddam, staring at his face until...

                                 IRINAGA
                        You keep staring at that mustache 
                        and you’re going to go blind.

           In the doorway, Irinaga cracks a smile at his own joke.

                                 PIRO
                        Did you know Saddam challenged Bush 
                        to a debate over WMD before we took 
                        Baghdad?

                                 IRINAGA
                        Debate? No, that'd be more like a 
                        bar brawl. And we'd still end in 
                        the same place.

                                 PIRO
                        I don't know... More time I spend 
                        with him. The more skeptical I am.

                                 IRINAGA
                        That's cause you’ve been sitting at 
                        that desk without a square meal.

                                 PIRO
                        Where are Stroud and Felix?

                                 IRINAGA
                        I sent them back to the hotel... 
                        Come on, cafeteria just opened.

           As Irinaga leads Piro to:
           INT. CAFETERIA/VICTORY COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Piro sits quietly, lost in thought, while Irinaga consumes 
           his military issued dinner and trying to make conversation by 
           sliding a small wooden bird across the table.

                                 IRINAGA
                        It's called a Chukar Partridge. I 
                        got one to bring home from this old 
                        wood carver in the Green Zone.

           Piro studies the detail on the wooden bird.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 IRINAGA
                        You think Lazar would want one?

                                 PIRO
                        I don't want Lazar to have anything  
                        to do with this place.

           As Irinaga takes back the wooden bird, Roukey and Baker 
           approach with their trays.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Mind if we join ya, fellas?

                                 IRINAGA
                        It’s a free country...
                            (stops himself) 
                        Well, almost.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Baker and I are throwing a little 
                        get together tonight, thought we'd 
                        extend an invite.

           Baker nods in agreement.

                                 PIRO
                        Sorry. We'll be working late.

           Piro shoots Irinaga a look to gain his complicity.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Can I say something out of turn?

                                 PIRO
                        ...Sure.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Baker and I have been watching you 
                        since you got here. You're a good 
                        man, George, but you're too...

                            (searching for words) 
                        Fucking nice for Iraq. Am I right, 
                        Baker?

           Baker nods kindly to confirm the truth.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 ROUKEY
                        The world don't need nice. We need 
                        kind, generous, thoughtful, but not 
                        nice. Nice is bullshit.

                                 PIRO
                        Maybe you don't know me as well as 
                        you think you do.

                                 ROUKEY
                        I know you're polite. But in war, 
                        only thing that matters is doing 
                        what's right.

                                 IRINAGA
                        And what's that platitude supposed 
                        to mean?

                                 ROUKEY
                        Means you're drinking with us 
                        tonight. Baker is DJing.

                                 PIRO
                        I wish we could --

                                 ROUKEY
                        See? More of that nice shit again. 
                        So, I'm not going to be so nice. 
                        You two are coming with us.

           On Piro, looking to Irinaga with no other option.

           INT. MESS HALL/CAMP VICTORY - NIGHT

           Baker is on a laptop connected to two speakers, pretending to 
           scratch a record and motioning for the Soldiers to the dance 
           floor. "DJ" Baker is now an extrovert as Outkast's “Bombs 
           Over Baghdad" revs up. Irinaga and Piro stand with drinks in 
           the corner, watching Roukey jump up and down in the CROWD.

                                 IRINAGA
                        No keeping up with infantry.

                                 PIRO
                            (unable to hear)
                        What?
                                 IRINAGA
                        Never mind.

                                 PIRO
                        I’m going to tell Roukey we’re 
                        calling it.

                                 IRINAGA
                        You go back out there, you're not 
                        coming back.

           Piro dismisses the warning as Irinaga playfully waves 
           goodbye. On the dance floor, Roukey clutches a bottle of 
           whiskey while dancing. The MUSIC PLAYS EVEN LOUDER.

                                 PIRO
                        Thanks for getting us out tonight, 
                        but we're about to head out. 

           Roukey motions for Piro to repeat himself:

                                 PIRO
                                       (CONT'D)
                        I said: Thanks for --  

           Roukey puts his arm around Piro, handing him the bottle.

                                 ROUKEY
                        You're not going anywhere brother 
                        until you drink your medicine.

           Piro tries to find Irinaga, but he's long gone. Roukey 
           elevates the bottle for Piro to down. Once Piro accepts, 
           Roukey starts break dancing terribly without a care in the 
           world. Piro gathers enough liquid courage to jump up and 
           down, letting go for the first time since arriving in Iraq.

           Outside of the Mess Hall, Piro, Roukey, Baker and the other 
           Soldiers gather, stripped down to their underwear, in the 
           swimming pool. All clearly drunk and still drinking.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Tell us one thing.

                                 PIRO
                        I can't.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Come on. What are you going to tell 
                        your kid one day when he asks about 
                        all this?
                                 BAKER
                            (genuine)
                        I want my boy to know I served with 
                        honor in this impossible chaos, 
                        trying to help as many as I could.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Now spill the beans, Agent Piro...

           Piro looks around to make sure they are alone.

                                 PIRO
                        Okay... He's a clean freak. 

           The Soldiers LAUGH.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        No, I mean he loves using baby 
                        wipes to clean his cell, wipe down 
                        all his food. Obsessive Compulsive.

                                 ROUKEY
                        You're fucking with us.

           Piro raises his hands and shrugs his shoulder. One of the 
           Soldiers offers Piro a pill, which he waives off.

                                 BAKER
                        They say too much hygiene can 
                        weaken the immune system.

           Everyone nods in agreement. Baker then turns serious. 

                                        (CONT'D)
                                 BAKER
                        What's gonna happen to him?

                                 PIRO
                        I honestly don't know.

           When Piro is not looking, the same Soldier decides to slips 
           the pill into Piro’s beer. Roukey raises his drink.

                                 ROUKEY
                        To the great unknown...

           All the MEN cheers. As Piro drinks up, then leans back and 
           closes his eyes for a moment, BLACKING OUT until...

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - UNKNOWN

           Piro awakens in a suit and tie loosened sitting across from 
           Saddam, also suit and tie loosened, as though they are two 
           men on a business trip. SNOW falls outside in the background. 
           Slowly fading up, they both hear Fat Boy Slim's "Weapon of 
           Choice". Saddam stands up, walks forward, then without 
           warning begins DANCING TO THE MUSIC. Piro looks confused, but 
           then suddenly starts DANCING against his own will, in perfect 
           step with Saddam. 

           Yes, this is Piro's dream choreographed as an homage to the 
           2002 Spike Jonze music video with Christopher Walken.

           Saddam and Piro jump onto one of the tables to tap dance 
           together, then Saddam leaps off as Piro dance-chases him in 
           separate elevators upstairs. 

           Piro tries to stop Saddam from jumping off the second balcony 
           into the lobby. But Saddam pulls Piro with him as they both 
           end up taking flight. Now, they are almost dance-fighting in 
           the air.

           SNOW STARTS FALLING ON THEIR HEADS. Piro tastes the flakes to 
           realize the snow is really powdered sugar. He then looks down 
           to see WMD WAR HEADS with long female legs in high heels 
           appear dancing like synchronized swimmers. 

           The image distracts Piro long enough that Saddam is able to 
           KICK PIRO SO HARD HE FALLS DOWN THROUGH THE GROUND PAST THE 
           WMD DANCERS, GOING DEEPER INTO THE DARKNESS UNTIL...

           INT. PIRO'S ROOM/HOTEL/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           KNOCK AT THE DOOR. A hungover Piro, still wearing the same 
           clothes from last night, leaps out of bed to collect himself 
           before opening the door. Irinaga stands waiting.

                                 IRINAGA
                        I tried to warn you about infantry.  

           Piro rubs his temples, feeling a splitting headache.

                                 PIRO
                        Don’t gloat. It’s unbecoming.

           Irinaga tosses Piro a bottle of ibuprofen.

                                 IRINAGA
                        You’re going to want to turn on 
                        your TV.

           Piro downs the ibuprofen like M&Ms as he powers on the 
           television to see a breaking report on ABC NEWS. IMAGES OF 
           FOUR DEAD AMERICANS strung up, hanging from a bridge.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 IRINAGA
                        Fallujah just turned into hot zone.
           Piro looks away from the startling image, then turns back 
           toward to Irinaga with a fearful question.

                                 PIRO
                        Was it chemical --

                                 IRINAGA
                        No. Insurgents blew up a Blackwater 
                        Humvee, then hung the bodies.

           On TV: Iraqis celebrate, chanting in Arabic. Irinaga looks to 
           Piro for a translation.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 IRINAGA
                        Do you know what they are saying?

                                 PIRO
                        "We are from Fallujah. This is our 
                        work... Fallujah is the cemetery 
                        for America."

                                 IRINAGA
                        Christ.

           Piro pockets the photo of Lazar on his desk, then gathers his 
           weapon and sunglasses.

                                 PIRO
                        I need to call Mehri.

                                 IRINAGA
                        What's wrong with your phone?

                                 PIRO
                        Bolton said they’re monitoring 
                        me... I'll meet you at Cropper.

           As Piro heads out to:

           EXT. STREET/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Piro walks carefully, checking to make sure no one followed 
           him before picking up a payphone and dialing.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                            (clearly, upset)
                        George?

                                 PIRO
                        Are you crying?
                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                            (pushes back)
                        You’d be bawling too if you thought 
                        your husband could end up strung up 
                        and burnt alive.

                                 PIRO
                        Baghdad is much safer than 
                        Fallujah.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        That's not what the news says. 
                        Stores are selling video tapes of 
                        the killings in the Green Zone.

                                 PIRO
                        You don't have to worry. 

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Then help me not worry. Tell me 
                        something good.

           Piro looks around, trying to satisfy her request and spots an 
           ad for "Burger King: Coming Soon to Baghdad Airport".

                                 PIRO
                        Looks like they're getting a Burger 
                        King here soon.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        That's not funny.

                                 PIRO (O.C.)
                        It's a little funny. And true.

           There is a beat between them until:

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Your mom wants to talk to you.

                                 PIRO
                        You don't have to --

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                            (dramatic)
                        Oh, Georgie.

                                 PIRO
                            (stoic)
                        Hi, mama.

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        Whatever you're doing: Finish up 
                        and come home. 
                                 PIRO
                        As soon as I can. How's dad?
                            (another beat)
                        Still not talking with me?

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        You know what he thinks about this 
                        foolishness... We left Lebanon to 
                        escape the war, not to have you run 
                        back toward it. 

                                 PIRO
                        We've been over this: There is 
                        nowhere left to run. The Towers. 
                        The Pentagon. The airlines. The 
                        world's problems are our problems.

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        But why does it have to be you?

                                 PIRO
                        Because there is no one else. They 
                        need me --

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        So does your family. Georgie, stop 
                        trying to be a hero. Just be a 
                        father. Be a husband. Be a son.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm doing this for Lazar, mama.

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        All Lazar needs is to know when he 
                        will see his father again.

           There is a pause before Piro poses an honest question:

                                 PIRO
                        Do you ever think: what would have 
                        happened if we stayed in Beirut?

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        Never. We did what we had to in 
                        order to protect our family.

                                 PIRO
                        So am I.

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        To’oborni, Georgie.

                                 PIRO
                        Please put Mehri back on. 
                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        To’oborni: "You bury us." 

                                 PIRO 
                        I can't do this right now.

                                 FRANCIA (O.C.)
                        Not the other way around.

                                 PIRO
                        I have to go.

           Piro hangs up, eyes glassy. He quicks wipes his face, 
           checking again to see if anyone is watching. After letting 
           out a sigh, Piro puts on his iPod, listening to his Son:

                                 LAZAR (V.O.)
                        Baba, did you know that Saddam's 
                        name means "the one who confronts"? 

           On Piro, summoning enough strength to go.

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           A thinner version of Saddam, beard growing, sits muttering 
           quietly to himself. Piro enters as Saddam collects himself. 

                                 SADDAM
                        Good afternoon, George.

           Piro slides a bag of Doritos across the table.

                                 PIRO
                        Thought you might be hungry.

                                 SADDAM
                        How thoughtful... 
                            (slides back the bag)
                        But fasting has brought me peace.

           Piro opens the bag and starts eating them. Saddam nods, 
           detecting something off about him.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        Shame about the Americans in 
                        Fallujah. 

                                 PIRO
                            (off guard)
                        Where did you hear that?
                                 SADDAM
                        Absolutely brutal. Showing those 
                        images in the news. I hope your son 
                        is not allowed to see such 
                        savagery, but then again, maybe 
                        he’d understand what must be done 
                        for Arab sovereignty.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm not going to ask, again.

                                 SADDAM
                            (reveals)
                        I don't need to speak Spanish to 
                        figure out what your guards are 
                        talking about...

           Piro looks toward the door where the Guards stand, realizing 
           Saddam has been gathering information from them. Piro rises.

                                 SADDAM
                        What are you doing?

                                 PIRO
                        Letting you return to your "peace".

                                 SADDAM
                        That was your plan, George? Win me 
                        over with a bag of Doritos? You 
                        must be really desperate. Is Bush 
                        sending you home already?

           Piro stops moving.

                                 SADDAM
                        Remember: while you stand there the 
                        insurgents keep getting stronger 
                        and all those supposed WMDs remain 
                        unaccounted for.

                                 PIRO
                        I almost forgot. I brought you 
                        pictures of Baghdad.

           Piro reaches into his pocket and starts laying out photos on 
           the table. The images show: Soldiers and Iraqis toppling over 
           a giant statue of Saddam Hussein, then Iraqis surround the 
           fallen bronze Saddam in celebration. Piro sits back down.

                                 PIRO
                        This was shortly after the 
                        Coalition Forces took the city. 

           Saddam studies the photo, then tosses them disinterested. 
                                 SADDAM
                        Pathetic. Clearly, staged for the 
                        camera with these paid actors.

                                 PIRO
                        What makes you so sure?

                                 SADDAM
                        Because that’s exactly what I would 
                        do if I were Bush. More propaganda.

                                 PIRO
                        Or maybe you know your support is 
                        gone, Mr. Saddam...
                            (collects the photos)
                        You didn't respond before when I 
                        mentioned the Halabja chemical 
                        attack in '88. Perhaps your people 
                        were tired of living in fear that 
                        they might be gassed again?

           Piro offers the photos to Saddam, who does not accept.

                                 SADDAM
                        You're not in a position to accuse 
                        me of anything, George.

                                 PIRO
                        I believe you were trying to tell 
                        me the truth about WMD before. If 
                        you cooperate --

                                 SADDAM
                        You don't need me. You have your 
                        tanks and your soldiers to decide 
                        whatever "truth" you desire.

                                 PIRO
                        You were the President of Iraq for 
                        thirty years. Nothing happened 
                        without your say so. The Chicken 
                        Farm was a dead end. Tell me what 
                        I'm missing?

                                 SADDAM
                        I've had time to read the classics. 
                        You are familiar with Tolstoy: 
                        "Truth, like gold, is to be 
                        obtained not by its growth, but by 
                        washing away from it all that is 
                        not gold." What else has the farm 
                        been linked to?
                                 PIRO
                        Insurgents. Part of the Al Abud 
                        Network...

                                 SADDAM
                        No. Al Abud is de minimis.

                                 PIRO
                        The farm had no other connection to 
                        you, your family or the government.

                                 SADDAM
                        Wash away the dirt. Why would the 
                        insurgents use that location?

                                 PIRO
                        A personal connection? Or maybe a 
                        way to hide --

                                 SADDAM
                        Insurgents are hiding in plain 
                        sight. They chose the farm for its 
                        significance. 

                                 PIRO
                        Significant to who --

                                 SADDAM
                        No. Now, it's your turn, George. I 
                        can't be swayed with snacks or 
                        privileges. You said after the car 
                        bomb, your parents were ready to 
                        abandon their lives in Beirut. Why 
                        -- ?

           Piro sits in silence.

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro looks off to find the painful memory.

                                 SADDAM
                        Tell me. I tell you. That was our 
                        arrangement. 
                                 PIRO
                        The bomb destroyed a spice market 
                        where we'd go for things like 
                        walnuts, sugar. They didn't feel it 
                        was safe for me, anymore.

                                 SADDAM
                        What were those ingredients for?

                                 PIRO
                        Ma'moul. Cookies my mother used to 
                        make all the time.

                                 SADDAM
                        A boy does not lose his innocence 
                        over cookies. 

                                 PIRO
                        Where are the remaining labs?

                                 SADDAM
                        Finish the story, first.

                                 PIRO
                        I will, after --

                                 SADDAM
                        No. Time is not your friend, 
                        anymore... You will finish now.

           Piro takes a breath before recounting the painful memory:

                                 PIRO
                        My father was running late. He was 
                        always late.

                                 SADDAM
                            (pushing)
                        That made you angry...

                                 PIRO
                        I was furious. I yelled every 
                        obscenity I knew, vowed never to 
                        speak with him again. 

                                 SADDAM
                        What did you do to get even?

                                 PIRO
                        I decided to sprint ahead. To get 
                        away. To do the opposite of 
                        everything he said. I didn't notice 
                        the loud booming sound until I saw 
                        all the bodies being pulled out. 
                                 SADDAM
                        What did you do?

                                 PIRO
                        Nothing at first. I couldn't move, 
                        watching the dead, the injured. But 
                        when I saw my father coming, I ran 
                        toward the market to do something. 
                        Moving the rubble. My heart was 
                        pounding. But I had to --

                                 SADDAM
                        And what did you find?

                                 PIRO
                        Another boy. Just like me. Dead. A
                        few minutes earlier and it would've 
                        been me, not him, on the ground.

                                 SADDAM
                        What happened to the boy?

                                 PIRO
                        It wasn't the blast that killed 
                        him. It was the building 
                        collapsing. I tried to pull him 
                        out. I tried so hard to lift the 
                        heavy wall. But I couldn't --

                                 SADDAM
                        Until your father showed up.

                                 PIRO
                        He had to pull me away. I couldn't 
                        understand why he wouldn't help.

                                 SADDAM
                        Do you know what ever became of the 
                        boy's family?
                            (Piro is silent)
                        You think if you can find these 
                        weapons you'll have saved another 
                        market? Another family? Another boy 
                        from the rubble?

                                 PIRO
                            (of course)
                        Why do you think I am here?

                                 SADDAM
                        I want to hear you say it.

           Piro responds, defiant and emotional:
                                 PIRO
                        Tell me where the labs are, Mr. 
                        Saddam.

                                 SADDAM
                        You want to know? 

           Saddam stands, equally defiant, about to speak... when 
           suddenly he grabs his own chest, collapsing to the ground.

           Irinaga, Stroud and Felix eyes go wide, in shock. ON THE

           Phone RINGS. Several times. Until Stroud finally answers.

                        I have only a few minutes between 
                        meetings, but wanted to see how 
                        things are going over there?

           On Stroud, not looking forward to answering the question.

           On the wall, Piro notices a map of Iraq, realizing...

           EXT. SHACK/OUTSIDE OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           Chyron: Operation Rio Grande.

           Roukey and Baker, armed with M-4 carbon rifles, lean up 
           against their Humvee for cover facing the Shack. 

                                 ROUKEY
                        Who called this in?

                                 BAKER
                        Agent Piro got the idea for us to 
                        search through every UN inspection 
                        site from the nineties.

           Three other SOLDIERS are standing armed and ready as Baker 
           looks through binoculars.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Any sign of Hajis?

                                 BAKER
                        Target is clear.

                                 ROUKEY  
                            (to other Soldiers)
                        Remember: we do not touch a fucking 
                        thing.

           The Unit puts on their hazmat suits, followed by their masks. 
           Roukey raises his arm, giving the signal to move in. Two of 
           the Soldiers point their assault rifles forward as THEY RACE 
           TOWARD THE SHACK. Roukey KNOCKS DOWN THE DOOR. 

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 ROUKEY
                        Clear. 

           Baker remains at the Humvee as the rest enter into:
           INT. SHACK/OUTSIDE OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           The windows are blacked out. Roukey and the other Soldiers 
           shine the flashlights atop their weapons to secure the space.

                                 ROUKEY
                            (into walkie)
                        Deep Dish, this is Sandman. Site is 
                        secure. Over.

                                 BAKER (O.C.)
                        Roger, Sandman. Over.

           Roukey shines his light on a crude laboratory setup that 
           surrounds a crude artillery shell covered in loose wires.

                                 ROUKEY
                            (into mic)
                        Uh, Deep Dish... I think we just 
                        hit another jackpot.

           On Roukey, his eyes growing wide at the setup.

           EXT. SHACK/OUTSIDE OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           Baker keeps a watchful eye for any enemy combatants. 

                                 ROUKEY (O.C.)
                        We need to call Duelfer.

           Baker reaches for the satellite phone, realizing he left the 
           comm inside the Humvee. As he goes to open the door...

           SHIFT TO POV THROUGH THE SNIPER SCOPE: The Humvee door blocks 
           the line of sight to fire on Baker.

           We reveal Hassan watching through the scope attached to a 
           military grade rifle as Ali keeps watch. Hassan pulls back, 
           breaking down the weapon. The two flee again unnoticed.

           INT. WAITING ROOM/ER/SADDAM GENERAL/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro, arms crossed, sleeping in his chair when the Nurse 
           wakes him with a nudge:

                                 NURSE
                        You can see him now.

           Piro, exhausted, collects himself, then follows the Nurse 
           down the hallway.
           INT. SADDAM'S ROOM/SADDAM GENERAL/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           The Nurse takes Saddam's vitals while the ex-Dictator clearly 
           enjoys the female company. Piro stands in the doorway.

                                 PIRO
                        You look better than I was 
                        expecting.

           The Nurse leaves with his chart.

                                 SADDAM
                        Seeing a full bodied woman always 
                        breathes life into me.

           Piro is in awe of Saddam's unbreakable spirit.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        Oh come on, George. You're telling 
                        me you would not fuck her?

                                 PIRO
                        I'm going to be honest, I never 
                        thought we'd have a conversation 
                        about who I'd sleep with.

                                 SADDAM
                        You can tell a lot about a man by 
                        who he wants to put his cock in...

           Piro doesn't know how to respond. Saddam continues, enjoying 
           his temporary freedom.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        Have I ever told you the story 
                        about my eight body doubles?

                                 PIRO
                        You told CIA the doubles were a 
                        myth.

                                 SADDAM
                        Listen... One day I had my deputy 
                        prime minister Tariq Aziz call them 
                        in for an urgent meeting. He says, 
                        "I have some good news and bad 
                        news." So naturally they ask for 
                        the good news first. Aziz tells 
                        them, "The good news is that there 
                        was assassination attempt on our 
                        President, but Saddam is alive so 
                        you all still have jobs." 
                                 (MORE) 
                                 SADDAM (CONT'D)
                        The men are relieved by the news 
                        and ask, "So, what is the bad 
                        news?" Aziz replies, "Our leader 
                        has lost an arm." 

           Saddam laughs at his own joke. Piro can't help but smile.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        So, will we be driving back through 
                        Baghdad this time? 

           Piro shifts back to being more restrained.

                                 PIRO
                        Don't push your luck.

           As Piro exits, GUARDS enter to keep watch on Saddam.

           INT. HELICOPTER/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro sits next to Saddam, who is restrained and wearing a 
           blindfold, as they fly over the city at night. Piro looks at 
           his Captive with a moment of empathy, deciding to reach 
           forward and remove the blindfold. Saddam locks eyes with 
           Piro, who gestures for the ex-dictator to look down.  

           From SADDAM'S POV: Baghdad is illuminated brightly by street 
           lights and car traffic flowing across the city. 

           As Saddam's face grows emotional to see Baghdad alive and 
           well without his leadership.

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - NIGHT

           The door opens. Saddam is brought inside. Guards remove his 
           chains as Piro stands over his Captive.

                                 SADDAM
                        I have decided to start eating 
                        again... for your sake.

           Piro doesn't quite know how to respond.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        There's no more for either of us to 
                        say on this matter.

                                 PIRO
                        Goodnight.

           As Piro holds out a copy of Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the 
           Sea,' Saddam gladly accepts.
           INT. BASKETBALL COURT/CAMP VICTORY - NIGHT

           Piro dribbles against Irinaga on the lone court at the base. 
           Military planes fly by overhead. Irinaga easily outplays 
           Piro, gaining a lay up. Both men are out of breath.

                                 IRINAGA
                        You would think I'd get bored 
                        beating you and yet --

           Irinaga tosses Piro the ball.

                                 PIRO
                        Okay. HORSE?

                                 IRINAGA
                        Honor is all yours.

           Piro shoots a successful three pointer.

                                 PIRO
                        Easier when I don't have you 
                        grinding up against me.

           Irinaga matches the three pointer.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Have you heard the one about the 
                        Jap and an Ay-rab playing 
                        basketball under the same flag in 
                        the middle of a war zone?

           Piro fails to land a successful lay up.

                                 PIRO
                        The American Dream, right?

           Irinaga takes the ball to swish another three pointer. Piro 
           takes back possession. 

                                 IRINAGA
                        Yeah, don't think my parents could 
                        ever dream I'd be in the Middle 
                        East.
                            (Piro misses)
                        That's an H for you.

                                 PIRO
                        If it's any consolation -- neither 
                        did mine.

                                 IRINAGA
                        How's Mehri holding up through all 
                        this? Debbie is a wreck. 
                                 PIRO
                        Really? I thought your wife would 
                        enjoy the vacation.

           Irinaga swishes a three pointer, wiping away Piro's smirk.

                                 PIRO
                                       (CONT'D)
                        Hard to tell how Mehri is doing 
                        over the phone.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Have you told her about anything on 
                        the ground here?

           Piro tries the same shot, but misses.

                                 PIRO
                        No, it'd only upset her more.

                                 IRINAGA
                        That's H-O.
                            (swishes another)
                        Don't know about you, but if I were 
                        talking to a mass murderer every 
                        day I'd need to talk to someone.

           Piro misses yet again, ignoring the question.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 IRINAGA
                        Fine. Maybe you can tell me how you 
                        knew where to send Roukey and Baker 
                        to find the second chemical lab...

                                 PIRO
                        How do you think?

                                 IRINAGA
                        You put a lot of faith in Vic.

                                 PIRO
                        I know he may seem difficult, but 
                        he is helping... in his own way.

           Irinaga misses his shot, caught off guard by Piro's comment. 

                                 IRINAGA
                        You actually like him or is that 
                        just part of the act?

                                 PIRO
                        I'm not going to dignify that with 
                        a response. That's H.
                                 IRINAGA
                        Don't bullshit me, Piro.

           Piro looks around to make sure they are alone.

                                 PIRO
                        The truth is when I look at him, I 
                        think if I didn't end up in the 
                        States, I could have ended up on 
                        the other side of this war.

                                 IRINAGA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 PIRO
                        You heard what I said about Beirut. 
                        What if I hadn't left? I might have 
                        been a soldier, a trafficker... an 
                        insurgent. People can do anything 
                        when they need to survive.

           As Piro bounces the ball, then shoots to score.

           INT. SCIF/CAMP SLAYER - DAY

           Duelfer stands furious, pacing back and forth before stopping 
           to SIGH in frustration. Roukey and Baker sit across at the 
           table. Piro watches off to the side, waiting his turn.

                                 DUELFER
                        What did I ask you to do while I 
                        was away? 
                            (beat)
                        Monitor new sites, not break down 
                        doors for search and seizure.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Agent Piro asked us --

                                 DUELFER
                        You two are supposed to be my 
                        scalpels, not mindless jackhammers. 
                        That’s why we coordinate... If the 
                        Al Abud Network didn't know we were 
                        onto them, they certainly do now.

                                 BAKER
                        What can we do?

                                 DUELFER
                        We're moving up the next round of 
                        site sweeps. Get the other units 
                        ready for another haul. And pray Al 
                        Abud won't be waiting for us. 
           Roukey and Baker rise, salute and exit. Duelfer takes a seat 
           to face Piro, who eats a bag of Doritos.

                                 DUELFER

                        And you. What the hell happened to 
                        keeping me up-to-date?

                                 PIRO
                        I'm sorry. Things got... heated. I 
                        take it Washington did not go well.

                                 DUELFER
                        Patience is wearing thin. Pressure 
                        is building high. And I hear you 
                        and Saddam have become pals.

                                 PIRO
                        I wouldn't say we're watching the 
                        Giants home opener.

                                 DUELFER
                        Then why aren't you pressing him?

                                 PIRO
                        We found another lab, Charles.

                                 DUELFER
                        No, you found scraps he’s feeding 
                        us. We have no definitive proof of 
                        a WMD stockpile.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm sorry, are you suddenly on 
                        Bolton's side?

                                 DUELFER
                        I like you, George. But you have to 
                        understand what we're facing back 
                        home: Everything we do here can be 
                        used against us. Washington doesn't 
                        want to find out that you've been 
                        laughing at Vic's jokes... Bolton 
                        isn't the only one watching.

                                 PIRO
                        Let them.

           Piro gets up to leave. Duelfer is put off by the bravado:

                                 DUELFER
                        You've the FBI thinking you're an 
                        Arab. The Arabs think you're FBI. 
                        You've got everyone fooled. Don't 
                        start fooling yourself, George. 
           As Piro exits, Duelfer stands uncertain... 

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Stroud turns on the Monitor to reveal Saddam outside 
           gardening. Duelfer enters, looks to them, alarmed:

                                 DUELFER
                        You gave him a garden?

                                 STROUD
                        Doctor said the hunger strike put 
                        him at risk for heart failure, so 
                        we were told to find a way to lower 
                        stress and up his cardio.

                                 FELIX
                        Piro's idea.

           Duefler spots Piro approaching Saddam on the Monitor.

           EXT. SADDAM'S GARDEN/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam finishes packing the dirt around his plant and looks 
           up at Piro standing over him.

                                 SADDAM
                        If the spring brings enough rain, 
                        licorice should be ready in a few 
                        weeks to make tea.

                                 PIRO
                        You were right. The Chicken Farm 
                        led us to another UN inspected 
                        site. I brought a map with new 
                        sites to review with you.

                                 SADDAM
                        Perhaps you could convince your 
                        superiors to let me have a bee 
                        hive. I would share the honey 
                        harvest with you and the guards.

                                 PIRO
                        I can look into that.

           Piro sits, laying out a map of Baghdad with several markers. 
           Saddam looks disinterested.

                                 SADDAM
                        I thought we were past patronizing, 
                        George. I thought we were friends. 
                                 PIRO
                        A friend would understand I am 
                        short on time.

           Piro taps the map, which Saddam glances over.

                                 SADDAM
                        You have been a busy...

                                 PIRO
                        This is coming from high up.

                                 SADDAM
                        Bush sent this?

           Piro nods, lying. Saddam gets closer to review the map 
           locations, nodding almost pleased to himself.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        What do you think the goals of the 
                        insurgents are?

                                 PIRO
                        They fight as loyalists to you.

                                 SADDAM
                        Even more than that...

                                 PIRO
                        They're afraid of losing Iraq's 
                        sovereignty. 

                                 SADDAM
                        Correct. The insurgents you call Al 
                        Abud are scared and frightened. You 
                        would do well to have Iraqi 
                        leadership engage with them before 
                        there is more bloodshed.

                                 PIRO
                        Perhaps, but that won't stop the 
                        raids scheduled for tomorrow.

                                 SADDAM
                        You're wasting your time.

                                 PIRO
                        Why is that?

           Saddam takes on a grim tone.

                                 SADDAM
                        Listen to me: You will find only 
                        death and destruction out there. 
           Piro tries to get a read on Saddam's face, struggling to 
           decipher his message. 

                                 SADDAM
                                         (CONT'D)
                        I realized that I became President 
                        of Iraq in the same year your 
                        family left behind Lebanon. What 
                        month was that?

                                 PIRO
                        December.

                                 SADDAM
                        I took office in June. You see 
                        Lebanon became a proxy war for 
                        Iraq's fight with the Iranians. I 
                        funded weapons, soldiers and 
                        explosives. I may have even been 
                        the one to blow up your market. I 
                        may have been the one to save 
                        others. You and I understand the 
                        nature of conflict... No good will 
                        come from your search tomorrow.

                                 PIRO
                        What are you so afraid we'll find?

                                 SADDAM
                        Maybe you were lucky to escape the 
                        Middle East when you did, George. 

                                 PIRO
                        Tell me what you meant when you 
                        said 'death and destruction'?

                                 SADDAM
                        Turn off the recoding devices.

                                 PIRO
                        You know I can't do that.

           Saddam appears genuinely concerned for Piro.

                                 SADDAM
                        You would be making a mistake to 
                        continue this search for WMD. Go 
                        home to your son, George. There is 
                        nothing for you here.

                                 PIRO
                        If you really wanted to stop the 
                        bloodshed -- you'd work with me.
                                 SADDAM
                        That's exactly what I'm trying to 
                        do. You simply do not see it yet.

           Saddam pours himself some tea from his pot just as Piro 
           rises, fed up, signaling to the Guards.

                                 PIRO
                        I think that's enough time outside 
                        for today.

           As the Guards move in, Saddam is ushered back inside past a 
           stoic Piro.

           EXT. CAMP VICTORY/BAGHDAD - DAWN

           Piro jogs through the secured base pushing himself further 
           than previously seen until he stops to watch Coalition 
           SOLDIERS line up around their COMMANDING OFFICER. They stand 
           before the Australian and New Zealand Flags at half mast. 

                                 COMMANDING OFFICER
                        "They shall grow no old... as we 
                        that are left grow old: Age shall 
                        not weary them... nor the years 
                        condemn them. We will remember 
                        them. Lest we forget."

                                 ALL SOLDIERS
                        Lest we forget.

                                 COMMANDING
                        "For all fallen brothers and 
                        sisters on the battle field..."

           As a Soldier trumpets "The Last Post", Piro continues his run 
           past their pain and memorial.

           INT. CAFETERIA/CAMP VICTORY - DAY

           Still too early for breakfast. Irinaga waits for coffee from 
           a machine as Piro, cleaned up and dressed, approaches 
           snacking on Doritos.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Since when do you eat Doritos?

           Piro chews, offering to Irinaga, who declines.

                                 PIRO
                        Duelfer was wrong to keep us  
                        behind the monitors.
                                 IRINAGA
                            (raises an eyebrow)
                        After everything we've seen, you 
                        still want to be on the frontlines?

                                 PIRO
                        Roukey, Baker, the other ISG 
                        units... They don't understand this 
                        insurgency.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Might want to check with your wife 
                        before throwing yourself in the 
                        crosshairs.

                                 PIRO
                        What's that supposed to mean?

                                 IRINAGA
                        You asked me to tell you when 
                        you're fucking up? Well, Mehri 
                        called me last night...

           Piro trashes the Doritos, thrown and defensive.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 IRINAGA
                        She's worried about you. You're not 
                        returning her calls.

                                 PIRO
                        That's not really any of your 
                        business, is it?

                                 IRINAGA
                        She called me, Piro. 

                                 PIRO
                        Do me favor: I'll stay out of your 
                        marriage, if you stay the fuck out 
                        of mine.

           As Piro heads off past Irinaga, leaving his friend to stew.

           INT. CENTRAL COMMAND/CAMP VICTORY - DAY

           Piro and Duelfer stand over an ARMY TECH manning a console 
           connected to FOUR LARGE MONITORS displaying satellite imagery 
           of different Humvees units in motion. An unhappy Irinaga 
           enters to join Felix, Stroud in the corner. Duelfer debriefs:
                                 DUELFER
                        Four teams.
                            (re: Monitors) 
                        Four separate raids on possible WMD 
                        sites with possible connections to 
                        Al Abud... Then we'll know just how 
                        much Vic has been withholding.

                                 PIRO
                        He didn't want us to go out on 
                        these raids today.

                                 DUELFER
                        We're about to find out why.

           On MONITOR #4: Two Military Humvees come to a halt.

           An old rusted warehouse lurks in the distance. From the 
           Humvees, Roukey and Baker emerge with half a dozen SOLDIERS 
           and one WAR PHOTOGRAPHER. Roukey speaks into his mic:

                                 ROUKEY
                        Observer, this is Sandman. Papa 
                        Team has arrived at target.

                                 DUELFER
                        Roger, Sandman. Observer has eyes 
                        from the sky. 

           Baker pulls out his binoculars to see the structure.

                                 BAKER
                        Observer, this is Deep Dish. We're 
                        clear on the ground, over.

                                 DUELFER
                        Copy, Deep Dish. You have clearance 
                        from the sky.

           Roukey turns to other Soldiers, gripping their weapons.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Hold the line. No one comes in or 
                        out until we get back... especially 
                        the civilian. 

           Soldiers stay on alert, holding the building perimeter. The 
           Photographer captures Baker and Roukey putting on hazmats. 
                                 ROUKEY
                                         (CONT'D)
                        Observer, wish us luck.

           Duelfer lowers his voice, hoping to not jinx the mission:

                                 DUELFER
                        Good luck, Papa Team.

           Roukey directs the SOLDIERS to surround the facility, raising 
           his arm to remain in position. As Baker opens the door to 
           enter into:

           INT. ABANDONED PAINT FACTORY/OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           The windows are blacked out. Roukey and Baker switch on the 
           flashlights attached to their weapons. Their beams of light 
           converge to reveal the mother lode: the largest lab to date, 
           beaker after beaker filled to the brim.

                                 ROUKEY
                        Observer, we have eyes on vials of 
                        yellow powder.

                                 DUELFER
                        Raw sulfur for mustard gas.

           The SOUND OF A BEAKER falling in the corner. Baker finds the 
           shattered glass with his LIGHT. Roukey speaks sotto voce:

                                 ROUKEY
                        Observer, we're not alone.

           Baker then shines the LIGHT ON HASSAN AND ALI IN GAS MASKS 
           ESCAPING through an underground tunnel within the facility. 

                                 DUELFER
                        Sandman, report.

           Baker runs towards to Hassan, but the exit is sealed shut.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 DUELFER
                        Sandman. Report in.

           Piro watches the Monitor, then realizes something that no one 
           else seems to... stepping up to Duelfer:

                                 PIRO
                        You need to get them out of there.

                                 DUELFER
                        Sandman, this is Observer. Report 
                        now.
                                 PIRO
                        They knew we were coming.

           Roukey shines his light to find a wired IED in the building. 

                                 ROUKEY
                        Observer, we have a situation with 
                        a wired explosive.

           Duelfer looks at Piro, then commands into the Mic:

                                 DUELFER
                        Observer to Papa Team. Abort 
                        mission. I repeat: Abort.

           Baker goes to inspect the IED, carefully tracing the wires 
           connected to a cellphone.

                                 BAKER
                        Motherfuck --

           INT. CENTRAL COMMAND/CAMP VICTORY - DAY

           ON MONITOR #4: A birds eye view of a tiny explosion that 
           wipes out the entire building. Piro winces, horrified. 
           Duelfer picks up the phone, frantic:

                                 DUELFER
                        How soon can we get air support?

           CONTINUING THE INTERCUT:

           EXT. ABANDONED PAINT FACTORY/OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD - DAY

           THE LARGE EXPLOSION CONSUMES THE BUILDING. Some Soldiers are 
           badly burned, leaning on each other as they race back to 
           their vehicles when one of the Humvees EXPLODES. A DOZEN 
           ARMED IRAQIS sprint toward them. 

           Soldiers quickly load into the remaining Humvee. The War 
           Photographer continues taking photos of the Iraqis, carrying 
           baseball bats and rifles. Camera keeps going as one of the 
           Iraqis climbs on top the burning military vehicle clenching a 
           baseball bat, letting out a primal cry:

                                 IRAQI MAN
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

           His SCREAM ECHOES as the Paint Factory continue to burn. As 
           one of the Soldiers throws the War Photographer into the 
           remaining Humvee...
           INT. CENTRAL COMMAND/CAMP VICTORY - DAY

           Duelfer puts down the line, then SLAMS THE PHONE DOWN AGAIN 
           AND AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL FINALLY BREAKING THE RECEIVER. Piro 
           puts his hands on Duelfer's shoulder for comfort. Duelfer 
           immediately HUGS PIRO CLOSE, BAWLING HIS EYES OUT.

           Everyone watches as Piro doesn't know what to do other than 
           accept Duelfer's embrace. Piro locks eyes with Irinaga, 
           knowing he was wrong to snap at him before. Duelfer pulls 
           back to collect himself.

                                 DUELFER
                        Get back to work.

           Everyone returns their tasks. As Piro turns to the Monitor, 
           watching a BLACK PLUME OF SMOKE RISING from the building.

           INT. BOLTON'S OFFICE/US EMBASSY/GREEN ZONE - DAY

           Bolton paces back and forth, looking out the window until he 
           finally turns to Piro and Duelfer sitting before him.

                                 BOLTON
                        You're done. Both of you.

                                 PIRO
                        Sir.

                                 BOLTON
                        Two soldiers killed-in-action. Six 
                        others in the hospital. We're past 
                        the fucking point of pleasantries. 

                                 PIRO
                        And what about the insurgency? If 
                        you want to put a stop to the 
                        bombs, I need more time in the room 
                        with Vic --

                                 BOLTON
                        That ship has sailed. This is a 
                        matter for State and Defense now.

           Piro is about to respond when Duelfer gets their first.

                                 DUELFER
                        We'll do whatever you think is 
                        best, John.

                                 BOLTON
                        Very simple: FBI's interrogation is 
                        over. 
                                 (MORE) 
                                 BOLTON (CONT'D)
                        All ISG operations will be placed 
                        under review. The White House will 
                        find out in the morning.  

           Piro sits totally powerless.

                                 DUELFER
                        I'd like to be involved in telling 
                        Roukey and Baker's families.

                                 BOLTON
                        You'll have to talk with DOD after 
                        you figure out how to dig yourself 
                        out of the six foot hole full of 
                        shit I’m going to bury you under.

           As Duelfer and Piro exit, defeated.

           INT. HALLWAY/US EMBASSY/GREEN ZONE - DAY

           Duelfer lets the door close behind them as Piro shoots a 
           furious look to his former colleague.

                                 PIRO
                        You let him walk all over us.

                                 DUELFER
                        He represents the White House, 
                        George. We don't.

                                 PIRO
                        You didn't even try to defend what 
                        we've been doing here. 

                                 DUELFER
                            (sullen)
                        John's right. We have to face the 
                        consequences for our actions.

                                 PIRO
                        Do you honestly think stepping 
                        aside will make any of this better? 

           Duelfer doesn't respond, knowing his answer will upset Piro.

                                 DUELFER
                        Listen to yourself: Vic sent us up 
                        to fail. Plain and simple. We were 
                        all blind to it. Now, we have blood 
                        on our hands.

           As Piro storms out of the Embassy to:
           EXT. LOBBY/US EMBASSY/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Piro pulls out a satellite phone, pulls up the contact for 
           his wife “MEHRI”. He turns to checks the clock on the wall -- 
           12:30pm Baghdad and 5:30am D.C. The time difference prompts 
           Piro to lower his phone, instead approaching a MILITARY GUARD 
           behind the desk.

                                 PIRO
                        I need transport to Camp Cropper.

           As the Guard picks up the phone, Piro cracks his knuckles.

           INT. SADDAM'S CELL/CAMP CROPPER - NIGHT

           Saddam reads quietly in his bed. The red light on the camera 
           in the corner turns off. A LOUD BUZZER SOUNDS. Piro opens the 
           door, then leans a chair to block any further entrance.

                                 PIRO
                        Get up. 

           Saddam slowly puts down the book and rises. Piro tosses his 
           bed, then goes through his notebooks.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        How did you tip off Al Abud 
                        insurgents to our raid --

                                 SADDAM
                        Al Abud? I've been here writing 
                        poetry...

           Saddam offers his book to Piro, who takes it and throws it 
           across the room.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm tired of your chickenshit 
                        riddles. Two men are dead. 

                                 SADDAM
                        Calm yourself.

                                 PIRO
                        I want answers.

           Piro grabs Saddam by the shirt collar, who responds calmly:

                                 SADDAM
                        How could I mastermind such a plan 
                        sitting inside this desolate cell 
                        surrounded by your guards?

           Piro squeezes tighter. Saddam looks up at the camera. 
                                 PIRO
                        Cameras are off. No more lies.

                                 SADDAM
                        I've been many things in my life -- 
                        a hero, a villain, a martyr -- but 
                        I'm not responsible for the death 
                        of your men.

                                 PIRO
                        There's something you're not 
                        telling me.

           BANG at the door with muffled VOICES, "OPEN THE DOOR, 
           GEORGE". 

                                 SADDAM
                        They're coming for you.

                                 PIRO
                        I don't care. 

                                 SADDAM
                            (surprised)
                        What about your son?

                                 PIRO
                        I'm not leaving without the truth.

           Saddam sees the desperation in Piro's eyes.

                                 SADDAM
                        I want something in return.

                                 PIRO
                        What?

                                 SADDAM
                            (in Arabic)
                        I know I will never be free from 
                        this cell. If this is my end... my 
                        son deserves a different fate.

                                 PIRO
                        Your sons are dead.

                                 SADDAM
                            (in Arabic)
                        There is a third. Ali. From my 
                        second wife. Not yet a man. He has 
                        a right to his own future.

           Saddam offers a letter to Piro. In Arabic:
                                 SADDAM 
                                          (CONT'D)
                        Get this to him. Tell him there's 
                        nothing left for him in Iraq. Tell 
                        him to get out before it's too 
                        late. 
                            (switches to English)
                        Then, I will give what you want.

           Piro reluctantly pockets the note. The DOOR BURSTS OPEN WITH 
           GUARDS THAT PULL HIM AWAY.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        I know you're a good man, George... 
                        I trust you will do the right 
                        thing.

           On Saddam, watching Piro forcibly removed from the room.

           INT. HUMVEE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro sits in the backseat in SILENCE, being driven back by 
           two SOLDIERS upfront. Staring out the window, Piro sees the 
           poorly lit empty streets, spotting IRAQI WORKERS closing up 
           their carts for the day. Once again, he spots the same IRAQI 
           PARENTS from earlier, this time TUGGING THEIR YOUNG BOY, who 
           drops his BACKPACK as he locks eyes with Piro. The IMAGE 
           FLASHBACKS BACK TO:

           EXT. STREET/BEIRUT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Young Piro is being forced to go with his PARENTS as he 
           witnesses Lebanese Soldiers start to take over the block. THE 
           CAMERA BEGINS TO SHAKE HEAVILY UNTIL...

           INT. HUMVEE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro is thrown by a BUMP, snapping him out of the vision.

           EXT. HOTEL/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro exits the vehicle, standing before the air-conditioned 
           lobby of his hotel. He waits for the Humvee to ride off 
           before deciding to turn back toward his traveled route.

           EXT. STREET/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Walking alongside IRAQIS returning to their homes, Piro 
           searches for a set of familiar faces. Many of the buildings 
           are crumbling or damaged from repeated bombings. On the 
           ground, Piro picks up the Young Boy's BACKPACK still intact, 
           finding a tag with an address.
           INT. LIVING ROOM/HOUSE/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           The Young Boy sits by the window doing homework, when there's 
           a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. The Father looks uncertain who would be 
           knocking at this hour. KNOCK AGAIN. The Father opens the door 
           to find Piro standing with the backpack in hand. In Arabic:

                                 PIRO
                        Salaam Aleikum. 

                                 FATHER
                            (nervous)
                        Alkeikum Salaam.

                                 PIRO
                        Your son dropped his bag.

           The Father accepts the backpack, surprised by the gesture. 

                                 FATHER
                        Thank you for bringing it back. 

           Piro hovers longer, looking inside their home. The Father 
           notices Piro's FBI Badge, peaking through his jacket.

                                 MOTHER (O.C.)
                        Dinner is ready. Will your friend 
                        be joining us?

           As the two men look to each other, knowing the answer will 
           undoubtedly be ‘yes’.

                                                          TIME CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN/HOUSE/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Piro sits around the table with the Father and the Young Boy 
           staring at him. The Mother brings food to the table.

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Where are you from?

                                 FATHER
                            (stern)
                        Do not be rude...

                                 PIRO
                        It's okay...
                            (to the Young Boy)  
                        I’m from Beirut, but live in 
                        America now with my family.

           The Boy notices the badge, which Piro offers him to study.
                                 PIRO
                                       (CONT'D)
                        My name is George. What's yours?

                                 FATHER
                        Forgive me. This is my son Mustafa, 
                        my wife Nadima...

           The Father looks to his Wife, who encourages him to share:

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 FATHER 
                        And I am Saddam Hussein.

           Piro stops eating, uncertain if he heard the name correctly.

                                 SADDAM #2
                            (shyly)
                        At the time, my parents thought it 
                        was an honor, but my namesake has 
                        always been a curse.

           Saddam #2 hands Piro his employee I.D. to prove his claim.

                                 PIRO
                        Can't you change it?

                                 MINA
                        There are hundreds of other Saddams 
                        in Iraq, but no government to 
                        revise our names.

                                 PIRO
                        You work for the Ministry of 
                        Electricity as an engineer?

                                 SADDAM #2
                        For now at least.

           Mina passes some rice to Piro, sparking a question:

                                 PIRO
                        What if I said I could help you and 
                        your family start over in the West? 
                        Under a new name.

           0Saddam #2 wipes his face, then puts down his napkin.

                                 SADDAM #2
                        Home matters more than a name. We 
                        will remain for as long as we can.

                                 MINA
                        Not everyone in Iraq is as 
                        fortunate as we are.
           Saddam #2 puts his hands over Mina's, squeezing tight.

                                 PIRO
                        Before I found your son's bag, I 
                        was looking for another Iraqi boy 
                        without such good fortune.

                                 MINA
                        Is this child in trouble?

                                 PIRO
                        He will be if I don't find him.

                                 MINA
                        And then your government can 
                        protect him?

                                 PIRO
                        No. They can't ever know about 
                        this.

           Mina nudges her husband, who then offers:

                                 SADDAM #2
                        How can we help?

           On Piro, moved by the offer.

           INT. GARAGE/HOUSE/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Saddam #2 pulls the cover off an old car that dates back to 
           the eighties, covered in dust. In Arabic:

                                 SADDAM #2
                        We haven't used it since the 
                        invasion. Roads haven't been safe.

                                 PIRO
                        I can't accept this, Saddam.

                                 SADDAM #2
                        Sadr city is the most dangerous 
                        part of Baghdad right now. Your 
                        Arabic is good, but you will need 
                        this...

           Saddam #2 tosses Piro a red and white keffiyeh (headscarf).

                                            (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM #2 
                        To blend in. If the car doesn't 
                        make it back, I will assume you 
                        were successful.

           As Piro realizes he's never worn one before... 
           INT. CAR/BAGHDAD - DAWN

           The sun rises on a new day. Piro drives, wearing clothes from 
           Saddam #2 and his new keffiyeh on his head. The letter from 
           Saddam sits on the passenger side as he listens to his iPod.

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        Did you know that Saddam was raised 
                        by a single mother after his father 
                        went missing one day. She sent him 
                        to live with his uncle in Baghdad 
                        so he became a Bathhhh... 
                        Bathhis... Ba'athist until 
                        returning home to Iraq once the 
                        Bathh... Ba'athists took power.

           As Piro looks to the open road, focused on what lies ahead.

           INT. CEMENT HOUSE/SADR CITY/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Four MASKED MEN, wearing keffiyeh to mask their faces, pose 
           with old Soviet kalashnikovs (AK-47s), standing on a 
           beautiful Persian rug as a CAMERA FLASHES. The Men hold the 
           position, gripping their guns, trying to look more menacing.   

           ANOTHER FLASH. Opposite the Men is a point and shoot digital 
           camera on a tripod. The masks come off, revealing Hassan as 
           the insurgent leader. 

                                 HASSAN
                        Did we get it?

           Ali, also part of the group, goes to check the camera. Out of 
           Hassan’s line of sight, Ali checks his phone.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 HASSAN
                        Ali?

           Ali reads a new text message (content hidden to us), then 
           quickly pockets his phone away.

                                 ALI
                        Yes. Very good.

           Ali pulls out the memory card, then grabs a large envelope.

                                 HASSAN
                        Where are you going?

                                 ALI
                        Bringing these to print in 
                        tomorrow's paper with our demands.

           Hassan rubs his head: 
                                 HASSAN
                        We will put the Americans on notice 
                        and recruit more brothers.

           As Ali nods, masking the real reason for his departure.

           EXT. CEMENT HOUSE/SADR CITY/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Ali exits, checking to make sure its safe to proceed. From 
           the corner, Piro spies Ali walking on, then starts to trail.

           EXT. SOUK/SADR CITY/BAGHDAD - DAY

           A CROWDED market. IRAQI WOMEN in full burqas balance folded 
           clothes on their head. Piro blends in as he follows Ali 
           walking with package-in-hand. Piro tries to keep his 
           distance, struggling to keep eyes on his target. Ali rounds 
           the corner, bringing Piro to push ahead to find Ali nowhere 
           in sight. Piro steps back, scanning in the Crowd UNTIL...

           THE SOUND OF A GUN COCKS, then the barrel presses to the back 
           of Piro's back. In Arabic:

                                 ALI
                        Step slowly back.  

           As Piro enters into:

           EXT. ALLEY/SADR CITY/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Concealed from the street traffic, Ali holds a gun to Piro's 
           head. In Arabic:

                                 ALI
                        Stay there. 

                                 PIRO
                        Ali Shahbandar?

           Ali is thrown by the mention of his name by a stranger. 

                                 ALI
                        Stay where you are.

           Piro stays still. Ali holds out his phone.

                                      (CONT'D)
                                 ALI
                        Who gave you this number?

                                 PIRO
                        I was asked to deliver a message.

           Piro starts to reach slowly into his jacket.
                                 ALI
                        Stop. Or I will shoot you.

           Ali hands keep shaking, holding the weapon. Piro carefully 
           pulls out an envelope from Saddam.

                                 PIRO
                        From your father. 

           Ali's eyes glaze over as he wields the gun. 

                                 ALI
                        That’s not possible.

                                 PIRO
                        See for yourself.

           Piro offers the envelope again, showing Saddam's handwriting 
           on the outside. Ali sees the authenticity, but refuses.

                                 ALI
                        I will not abandon him.

                                 PIRO
                            (calmly)
                        And he will not let you die for 
                        him.

           Moved by the thought, Ali finally lowers the weapon, 
           accepting the letter.

                                 ALI
                        It doesn't matter. There is no 
                        escape.  

           Piro tosses Ali the car keys.

                                 PIRO
                        It’s parked on the other side of 
                        the market. 

           Ali grips the keys and letter, shaking his head. In English:

                                 ALI
                        How do I know this isn't an 
                        American trick?

           Piro lifts up his shirt.

                                 PIRO
                        No wires.
                            (points up)
                        No snipers... No one can ever know 
                        I was here. 
           Piro slowly slides his gun over to Ali.

                                 ALI
                        Why would you risk such a thing for 
                        me?

                                 PIRO
                        Because you shouldn't have to pay 
                        for the sins of your father.

           Ali picks up the gun, adding in Arabic:

                                 ALI
                        Even when he is selfless, my father 
                        is a selfish prick. Promise me you 
                        will tell him I said that?

                                 PIRO
                            (nods)
                        Is that all?

                                 ALI
                        ...And I love him.

           A look of sadness fills Ali's eyes. 

                                 PIRO
                        Are you going to be okay?

                                 ALI
                        What other choice do I have?

           Ali takes one last look at Piro, before turning away. As Ali 
           disappear into the Crowd once again, Piro uses his keffiyeh 
           to cover his face for the walk back to the green zone.

           INT. PIRO'S ROOM/HOTEL/GREEN ZONE - DAY

           Piro enters, covered in sand and exhaustion, closing the 
           blinds to cut the light. He slips off his shoes, sore from 
           the journey, collapsing onto the bed when the PHONE RINGS. 
           Searching for his phone, Piro answers from the bed. 

                                 PIRO
                        Hello?

                                 DUELFER (O.C.)
                        Where have you been? I've been 
                        calling you all morning.

                                 PIRO
                        Took an early run.

           INTERCUT WITH: 
           INT. MAIN HALL/CAMP SLAYER/VICTORY COMPLEX - DAY

           Duelfer sits at his desk, phone against his ear.

                                 DUELFER
                        So, you don't know, do you?  

                                 PIRO
                        Know what?

                                 DUELFER
                        Abu Graib. Sixty Minutes broke the 
                        story about American troops 
                        torturing Iraqi detainees...

           Duelfer watches on the TV: SHOCKING PHOTOS OF A MAN WEARING A 
           BLACK HOOD AND ROBE, HANDS RAISED, WITH ELECTRODES ATTACHED 
           TO HIS BODY at Abu Ghraib Prison.

                        Bolton was recalled to Washington. 
                        And your friends from the Bureau 
                        just arrived.

                        You were right to hold out, 
                        George... We're not dead yet.

           On Duelfer, glued to the horrific images on the TV.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM/US EMBASSY/GREEN ZONE/BAGHDAD - DAY

           Piro, cleaned up, enters to find his superiors PISTOLE and 
           BALD seated at a long conference table.

                                 PISTOLE
                        Have a seat, Agent Piro.

           Piro takes a seat, unable to get a read on them.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 PISTOLE
                        How are you holding up?

                                 PIRO
                        Did you really travel all this way 
                        to ask me 'how I'm holding up'?

                                 BALD
                        No. We didn't.

                                 PISTOLE
                        It should come as no surprise that 
                        the White House is frustrated. They 
                        believe Vic is selling a bill of 
                        goods that you keep buying into. 
                                 PIRO
                        And what do you think?

                                 BALD
                        You've surprised us a few times... 
                        But no one cares what we think.

                                 PISTOLE
                        The administration considers the 
                        approach too soft -- the garden, 
                        the poetry... the Doritos -- for an 
                        accused war criminal. 

                                 BALD
                        Then there's the growing concern 
                        your background is keeping you from 
                        extracting intel from your subject.

                                 PIRO
                        What do you mean "my background"?

                                 PISTOLE
                        You were pitched as a young Arab. 
                        Someone Vic could relate to. But 
                        this White House feels your 
                        background --

                                 PIRO
                        I've spent six months locked in a 
                        room with him. I've been away from 
                        my wife and child. In a war zone. 
                        In service to my country. So 
                        forgive me, if I refuse to sit here 
                        and be reduced to an immigrant in 
                        conflict. Last time I checked, I 
                        graduated Quantico same as you.

                                 BALD
                        We agree.

                                 PIRO
                            (raises an eyebrow)
                        Then, what are we talking about?

                                 PISTOLE
                        The new Iraqi government takes 
                        custody of Vic in a week. Wrap 
                        things up, then you come home. 

                                 BALD
                        Use the time wisely, Agent Piro.

           Piro nods, a bit shocked, exiting the room. A TRUMPET can be 
           heard playing The Last Post again. 
           EXT. CAMP VICTORY - DAY

           COALITION FORCES stand in formation facing the Flags again at 
           half-mast. At the base of the flag pole, boots hold up the 
           rifles and helmets of Sergeants Baker and Roukey. 

           Piro joins Duelfer, Irinaga, Felix and Stroud standing as the 
           TRUMPETER finishes playing. All Soldiers SALUTE. The Mourners 
           dissipate. Piro stares at the makeshift memorial. Irinaga 
           puts his hand on Piro's shoulder, who searches for words.

                                 IRINAGA
                        You don't have to say anything.  

           On the Team, lingering a moment longer at the memorial. 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           CLOSE ON Stroud starting the recorder. Irinaga flipping the 
           switch on the Monitor. Felix pulling a document from a file. 

           Piro reviews transcripts, glancing up AT THE MONITOR TO SEE: 
           Saddam waiting in the Garden. 

                                 FELIX
                        I found the speech you were asking 
                        about... 
                            (hands over)
                        It was a regional address from June 
                        2000 on WMD.

                                 PIRO
                        Thanks.

           Piro quickly reviews the document, then rises with a 
           mysterious metal tin in his hands.

                                 FELIX
                        You going to tell us what this is 
                        all for?

                                 PIRO
                        You trust me, Theresa?

                                 FELIX
                        Enough to let you hang yourself if 
                        this doesn't work.

                                 PIRO
                            (smirks)
                        Good enough.

           The work continues as Piro exits. Duelfer watches from the 
           corner, putting on headphones to listen in. 
           INT. SADDAM'S GARDEN/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam stares at his garden, lost deep in thought. Piro 
           appears, standing over him with a metal tin.

                                 PIRO
                        Kol Sana Wa Enta Salem... 

                                 SADDAM
                            (looks up)
                        I was not sure if we would see each 
                        other again.

                                 PIRO
                        And miss your birthday?

                                 SADDAM
                        I do not need to be reminded I'm 
                        old. I have the mirror for that.

           Piro hands Saddam the metal tin.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        What is this?

           Saddam opens the tin and pulls off the napkin, immediately 
           thrown off by the sight of the traditional Lebanese cookies 
           covered in powder sugar.

                                 PIRO
                        A gift from my mother.

                                 SADDAM
                        The famous Ma'amoul? 

                                 PIRO
                        She's been waiting twenty years for 
                        me to ask her to make them again. 

                                 SADDAM
                        How did you get such a package 
                        delivered here so quickly?  

                                 PIRO
                        She knew how important they were... 
                        And in turn, I let her know just 
                        how important she is to me.

                                 SADDAM
                        I regret not sharing that sentiment 
                        with my family that more often.

           As Piro starts rubbing the napkin from the tin against the 
           nearby hidden microphone to disrupt the signal... 
           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           On the Monitor: Saddam can be seen with only the back of 
           Piro's head. As the Team listens in their headphones, only 
           the SOUND OF DISTORTION CAN BE HEARD.

                                 DUELFER
                        What is that?

                                 STROUD
                        I don't know. Everything is 
                        muffled.

                                 DUELFER
                        Do we have a back up mic?

                                 IRINAGA
                        There wasn't room in the garden.

           On Irinaga, working to fix the problem.

           EXT. SADDAM'S GARDEN/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro continues rubbing the napkin, eyes focused on Saddam.

                                 PIRO
                        Nod as I talk. They're still 
                        watching.

           Saddam nods, finishing his cookie.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Your message was delivered. 

           Saddam wipes his mouth, hiding his lips for a moment.

                                 SADDAM
                        How can I be certain?

                                 PIRO
                        Ali told me to tell you...
                            (in Arabic)
                        Even when you are selfless, you are 
                        a selfish prick. But despite 
                        that... he loves you.  

           Saddam turns emotional, moved by Piro's message.

                                       (CONT'D)
                                 PIRO
                        Now it's your turn.

           Piro hands Saddam the napkin, no longer distorting the mic...
           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL, calming Irinaga and the rest of 
           the room down. The Team goes back to listening in:

                                 PIRO (O.C.)
                        -- I wanted to ask you about a June 
                        2000 speech you gave.

                                 SADDAM (O.C.)
                        You would ruin my birthday with 
                        talk of politics?

                                 PIRO (O.C.)
                            (ignores him)
                        You said Iraq would not disarm 
                        until others in the region did. ‘A 
                        rifle for a rifle, a stick for a 
                        stick, a stone for a stone,' about 
                        weapons of mass destruction.

                                 SADDAM (O.C.)
                        I was there. I know what I said.

           As Irinaga shrugs off the temporary glitch.

           EXT. SADDAM'S GARDEN/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam stars to shift from emotional to defensive.

                                 PIRO
                        I can tell you wrote this address 
                        yourself.

                                 SADDAM
                        How can you know? I have many 
                        speechwriters.

                                 PIRO
                        I've read your poetry, listened to 
                        you speak. Your voice is distinct.  
                            (off Saddam)
                        The world had thought you disarmed 
                        at this point, but here you are 
                        declaring more weapons...

                                 SADDAM
                        If you're the great authority on my 
                        words, George, you should know.

                                 PIRO
                        Your words on this subject carry 
                        far more weight than mine.
                                 SADDAM
                        What do you want me to say?

           Piro leans in to press him:

                                 PIRO
                        Are there WMD in Iraq?

           As Piro tries to hold his poker face, Saddam remains stoic.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Duelfer, Irinaga, Felix and Stroud listen and watch at the 
           edge of their seats for a response to the question.

           EXT. SADDAM'S GARDEN/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Saddam takes a long pause to gather his thoughts. It feels 
           like an eternity. Piro doesn't blink as Saddam looks up with 
           a straight face:

                                 SADDAM
                        No. It was all a bluff.

           Piro drops his jaw at the revelation, dumbfounded.

                                 PIRO
                        You're telling me you lied to the 
                        world about the weapons?

                                 SADDAM
                        U.N. inspectors destroyed them in 
                        the nineties. And those not 
                        destroyed by the inspectors were 
                        unilaterally destroyed by Iraq.

                                 PIRO
                        You put your nation, your 
                        presidency, your life at risk with 
                        just a bluff.

                                 SADDAM 
                        You have to project strength, 
                        George. That was what kept me in 
                        power. Fear of that capability kept 
                        the Iranians from invading Iraq. 

                                 PIRO
                            (confused)
                        Wait. Iraq was more afraid of the 
                        Iranians than the Americans?
                                 SADDAM
                        Iraq could not survive without the 
                        perception that I had weapons of 
                        mass destruction. The truth is: 
                        after 9/11, I thought the United 
                        States would need our help to fight 
                        terrorism...

                                 PIRO
                        What about everything we've found? 
                        The ricin, the mustard gas --

                                 SADDAM
                        All created after the invasion. 
                        Small batches to deter your 
                        government in the event of 
                        invasion. 

           Piro processes the revelation as Saddam eyes the cookies:

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        May I have another?

                                 PIRO
                        You can keep 'em.

           As Saddam enjoy another sweet, CLOSE ON Piro visibly shaken.

           INT. HALLWAY/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Walking down the hallway, Piro is greeted by an elated 
           Stroud, Felix and Irinaga trying to catch up with him.

                                 FELIX
                        You realize what he just said?

                                 PIRO
                        Yes...

                                 STROUD
                        Do you want to review the tape?

                                 PIRO
                        No...

           Piro walks past them ALL.

                                 IRINAGA
                        Where are you going, Piro?

                                 PIRO
                        To call my wife.

           Duelfer emerges to see Piro round the corner out of sight. 
           INT. BATHROOM/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro checks under the stalls to make sure he's alone, then 
           pulls out his satellite phone, dialing. 

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                            (waking up)
                        Hello?

                                 PIRO
                        I'm done. I'm coming home.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                            (groggy, half-listening)
                        George? It's four in the morning.

                                 PIRO
                        I'm sorry. For everything I put you 
                        through these past few months. I --

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        I love you, too.

           They both take a moment to let that reminder sink in, then:

                                 PIRO
                        I want to speak to Lazar.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        He's asleep.

                                 PIRO
                        Wake him.

                                 MEHRI
                        He won't go back to bed.

                                 PIRO
                        Please?

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        Hold on...

           Mehri brings the phone over to a sleepy Lazar. 

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        Baba?

           Tears stream down Piro's face, listening to his Son's voice.

                                              (CONT'D)
                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        Baba, are you there?

           Piro collects himself, struggling. 
                                 PIRO
                        Of course, I am.

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        I thought you forgot about me.

                                 PIRO
                        Forgot about you? I listen to your 
                        recordings every day.

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        I have more facts if you need.

                                 PIRO
                        No. I've a new project for you.

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        Oh?

                                 PIRO
                        I want you to start making a list 
                        of all the things you want to do 
                        with me. As soon as I am back we 
                        will start checking off the list.

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        How long can it be?

                                 PIRO
                        As long as you can imagine. 

                                 LAZAR (O.C.)
                        Really? 

                                 PIRO
                        Put your mother back on.

           Lazar hands the phone back to Mehri.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                        You shouldn't make promises you 
                        can't keep.

                                 PIRO
                        Another week. You have my word.

                                 MEHRI (O.C.)
                            (yawns)
                        Then we're going to try getting 
                        some more sleep... 

                                 PIRO
                        Goodnight, habibata.  
           As Piro notices his reflection in the mirror, past the bags 
           under his eyes, seeing himself in a different light.

           EXT. GREEN ZONE CAFE/BAGHDAD - SUNSET

           The TEAM drinks cervezas as Piro watches the American Flag be 
           taken down from a nearby building and replaced by the 
           redesigned Iraqi Flag. Irinaga, Felix and Stroud smile, 
           drinking. Duelfer sidles up to Piro, sotto voce:

                                 DUELFER
                        I know you broke in to see him. 

           Piro plays dumb.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 DUELFER
                        That you cut the audio and video...

           Piro stands silent, waiting for Duelfer.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 DUELFER
                        I just need to know his confession 
                        was real.

                                 PIRO
                        I don't know what real means, 
                        anymore.

                                 DUELFER
                        Are you willing to bet your career 
                        on what he said as fact?  

                                 PIRO
                        We'll never know all the facts, 
                        Charles. About him. About WMD. But 
                        I believe it's the honest truth.

                                 DUELFER
                        Then say it.

                                 PIRO
                        There are no weapons in Iraq.

           Duelfer nods, then finishes his beer.

                                 DUELFER
                        Now, I need you to come with me.

           Piro raises an eyebrow, uncertain.

                                          (CONT'D)
                                 DUELFER
                        You and I need another round.

           As Piro follows Duelfer to the bar, the new Iraqi flag waves. 
           INT. CHECK POINT/IRAQ - NIGHT

           A cold desert night. Ali stands, carrying a bag over his 
           shoulder, in line with other IRAQIS heated only by a row of 
           barrel fires. U.S. Soldiers Wisdom and Clary are checking 
           passports. Inside Ali's inner jacket pocket, we briefly see 
           Saddam's letter on his person.

                                 SADDAM (V.O.)
                        My son... As father to our nation, 
                        I know you have suffered as a 
                        martyr for me and all of your 
                        people. But the time has finally 
                        come to free you of that burden. 
                        You must lower your weapon and go 
                        to your mother in Lebanon. Keep 
                        each other safe in my absence... 

           As Ali moves up at the line...

           INT. KITCHEN/CEMENT HOUSE/OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD - NIGHT 

           Hassan and three other IRAQI MEN sit eating biryani, until 
           the DOOR BURSTS OPEN WITH US SOLDIERS STORMING INSIDE. 

                                 SADDAM (V.O)
                        War has consumed my entire life. 
                        The fighting has destroyed the 
                        lives of almost everyone around me. 
                        I cannot let that same tragedy 
                        befall you, too. The occupiers may 
                        never win, but neither shall the 
                        insurgency.

           On Hassan and the other Men, surrendering, begrudgingly. 

           INT. CHECK POINT/BAGHDAD - NIGHT

           Ali presents his passport to Wisdom, who carefully checks the 
           authenticity of the fake name and forged documents.

                                 SADDAM (V.O.)
                        Your future is the only legacy that 
                        matters now. Be fruitful and 
                        multiply. Be more righteous than I, 
                        so your children may live better 
                        than both of us. As long as you 
                        carry this letter, I will be with 
                        you always. Love... Baba.

           Wisdom hands back the passport, ushering Ali toward a bus 
           with a sign that reads: "BEIRUT". Before he boards, Ali 
           tosses his father's letter into the fire to burn...
           EXT. SADDAM'S GARDEN/CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro sits across from Saddam, now with a full trimmed beard, 
           who is watering his licorice plants and enjoying the sun. 

                                 SADDAM
                        You see... things do grow in the 
                        desert. You have to harvest after 
                        I'm gone. Bring it to your son.

           Piro cuts the end off a cohiba, then hands the cigar to 
           Saddam, who feels the cohiba in his hand, then lets Piro 
           light the cigar, then his own.

                                 SADDAM
                        The future is in God's hands now, 
                        George.

                                 PIRO
                        I think God has more important 
                        things to do than worrying about 
                        us...

           Saddam nods in agreement, puffing his cigar.

                                 SADDAM
                        You've come to know me better than 
                        my own children.... And I feel I 
                        know you as a son, so indulge me as 
                        I act the part of a father... If 
                        there were more men in this world 
                        like you, perhaps there wouldn't be 
                        a need for men like me. Never 
                        change who you are.

           Piro puffs his cigar, listening.

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        They will try to make you forget. 
                        To strip you of your past. But I 
                        promise you, that is the very thing 
                        that makes you exceptional...

           Saddam begins to weep, giving Piro a traditional Arab kiss 
           with three kisses on each cheek. Saddam then wipes his eyes, 
           turning more playful:

                                         (CONT'D)
                                 SADDAM
                        You know if I can shake these 
                        charges, we can start a consulting 
                        firm together.
                                 PIRO
                        If you can shake these charges, 
                        I'll certainly think about it.

           The Iraqi POLICE appear at the door. Saddam stands buttoning 
           his jacket to appear as a leader, not as a prisoner. 

           EXT. CAMP CROPPER - DAY

           Piro, Duelfer, Irinaga, Felix and Strouss watch the Iraqi 
           POLICE take Saddam away to face trial. Accepting his fate, 
           Saddam nods goodbye to Piro one last time... FADING TO:

           INT. KITCHEN/PIRO'S HOME - NIGHT

           Chyron: December 31st, 2006. 

           Piro, no goatee, prepares a set of appetizers as Irinaga, 
           sporting a Christmas sweater, pours himself licorice tea. 

                                 IRINAGA
                        Still no word on Miami Bureau?

                                 PIRO
                        They keep dangling it over my head. 
                        Would you consider rejoining if I 
                        got it?

                                 IRINAGA
                        Private sector is good, Piro. You 
                        should be the one considering a 
                        career change.

           Mehri comes in from the Living Room, gently mentioning:

                                 MEHRI
                        They are about to broadcast.

                                 PIRO
                        You go. I'll check on the kids.

           Piro pats Irinaga on the shoulder, then kisses Mehri before 
           taking a plate of the Ma'amoul cookies, heading upstairs.

           INT. LIVING ROOM/PIRO'S HOME - NIGHT

           The Christmas tree is decorated. Mehri and Irinaga enter to 
           join Irinaga's WIFE watching on TV: Saddam surrounded by MEN 
           WEARING FACE MASKS putting the noose around his neck.

           As Mehri and Irinaga's Wife look away, Irinaga can't...
           INT. LAZAR'S BEDROOM/PIRO HOME - NIGHT

           Piro opens the door to find Lazar and Kira, Irinaga's 
           daughter, playing "SoulCalibur II" on Nintendo GameCube.

                                 LAZAR
                        Sorry, baba. Did you want us to 
                        come down?

                                 PIRO
                        No, it's okay.

           Lazar immediately grabs a ma'amoul cookie, biting into it 
           while playing. Kira looks, uncertain.

                                 LAZAR
                        Try one. They're good. 

           Kira eats one, impressed.

                                        (CONT'D)
                                 LAZAR
                        Told you.

                                 KIRA
                        Where are they from?

                                 LAZAR
                        I don't know, my grandma always 
                        makes them... Do you know the story 
                        with these cookies, baba?

           As Lazar looks to his Father, Piro smiles, finally ready to 
           share with his Son.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
