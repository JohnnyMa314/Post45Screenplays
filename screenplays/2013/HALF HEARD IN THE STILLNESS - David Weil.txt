           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MOMENTS BEFORE DUSK 

           An ABANDONED WHITE MINI-VAN pulsates as "The Green, Green 
           Grass of Home" by Tom Jones blasts from its speaker system. 

           The vehicle is unnerving. Not the chariot of car-pooling 
           soccer moms or early morning newspaper deliveries. It’s the 
           breed of mini-van that does not belong near school-bus stops 
           or playgrounds, the kind of van seeking to disrupt the 
           idyllic patina of suburbia.

           TWO POLICEMEN’S flashlights permeate the van’s interior, 
           illuminating the vehicle in a synchronized kaleidoscope. 

           An UNMARKED SEDAN anxiously pulls up to the scene and parks, 
           as the driver’s WORK BOOTS and BLUE JEANS get out.

           We PAN UP to the driver’s HANDS clad in rubber gloves. They 
           head toward the rear of the sedan, pop the trunk and grab a 
           flashlight and one can from a six-pack of Slimfast.

           The PAIR OF HANDS then approach the VAN. The policemen cease 
           their exploration, granting deference to the boots and jeans, 
           shining their flashlights on the hands’ owner, illuminating:

           DETECTIVE HILDA MORRISON. Some would guess she’s in her late 
           30s, others would venture to say 50s. She’s weathered, a no-
           nonsense, yet quirky presence. Tough as (manicured) nails, if 
           only to conceal a deep-seated fear.

           Morrison cracks open the Slimfast, as if it was a can of Bud.

                                 MORRISON
                             (pissed, re: the music)
                        A little Tom Jones to get you boys 
                        in the mood?

           The POLICEMEN stare at her, frightened.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Well, turn it off. It’s loud as 
                        heck, it’s 4 A.M., and Jesus 
                        Christ, it’s Shabbos.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        You said not to touch anything, ma’am.

                                 MORRISON
                        That was before I was aware my bat 
                        mitzvah soundtrack would warrant a 
                        noise complaint from every house 
                        from here to the L.I.E.

           OFFICER #1 leans in the side door and turns off the radio.
           Morrison fingers the perforations of the license plate.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Run the plates. Might be a rental, 
                        but looks lived in. I want a name and 
                        address. When you confirm, send a 
                        team over. Sweeny pre-OK’d all raids.

           Morrison circles toward the side-view mirror. She stares at 
           her lips. Rubs some lipstick off the side of her mouth.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Paulson, check tire marks. Start 
                        with a 20 foot radius. Find point 
                        of origin.

           Morrison gets in the driver’s seat, and is hit by a curious 
           odor. She grabs the dangling CHERRY AIR FRESHENER and 
           inhales. Orgasmic for a moment. Until the odor returns.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Hayes, scan the grounds for 
                        footprints. He was wearing those 
                        light-em-up sneakers. Sketchers, 
                        size 7. His favorite. Go as far in 
                        the woods as you need to.

           OFFICER #1 approaches the driver’s seat.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        Ma’am.

                                 MORRISON
                        Hayes.

                                 OFFICER #1
                        I don’t want to find the body.

                                 MORRISON
                        So find the boy.

           She smiles as she grabs the wheel. Tightens her grip. The 
           rubber gloves SQUISH against the leather wheel.

           The quiet then hits her. Her smiles turns cold.

           CLOSE ON Morrison’s HANDS. They start toward the VOLUME DIAL. 
           They linger for a moment. Then - they begin to rotate the 
           dial clockwise. Just as the music comes back on we - 

                                                               CUT TO:
           INT./EXT. PLACE UNKNOWN - TIME INDETERMINABLE

           CLOSE ON: a YOUNG MAN’S FACE (20). His heavy panting makes it 
           clear he’s running. As if for dear life. He occasionally 
           looks behind him, instinctively. The breaths become strained, 
           quicker.

           In. Out. In. Out. His eyes widen as we - 

           PAN OUT to reveal: the Young Man is on an OLD TREADMILL in a 
           TINY BASEMENT. The basement is its own ecosystem of sorts. A 
           fully-stocked bomb shelter like, though used, worn-in. 

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The basement is full of cabinets and cubbies. Drawings taped 
           to the walls. Books at every corner. An old TV and VCR. 
           Though it’s neat. Organized. Everything has its place.

           The Young Man slows the treadmill down until he’s jogging, 
           then hops off and takes a swig from his water bottle. 

           He takes off his running shorts - two sizes too big - and 
           puts on a pair of sweatpants - two sizes too small. 

           He spins a CHORE WHEEL on the wall, narrowly missing “SCRUB 
           SHOWER” instead landing on "BROOM and DUSTPAN."

           He organizes CHEF BOYARDEE RAVIOLI, SPAM, and other CANS into 
           a corner cabinet, taking inventory on a small NOTE-PAD. He 
           then takes a CANNED PEACHES from the shelf.

           He places a book - KIM by RUDYARD KIPLING - back into a well 
           stocked, alphabetically organized book shelf. It lands 
           between THE SHINING by STEPHEN KING and THE MAGICIAN’S NEPHEW 
           by C.S. LEWIS

           He then fans out child-like UNITED STATES themed BED SHEETS, 
           with each state as an individual character, and makes the 
           small cot. The Young Man notices a small bit of red substance 
           - BLOOD? - on the sheets. He wipes it off. When -

           BOOM! There's a massive bang from upstairs. 

           An eerie silence follows. As if underwater or shortly after 
           an explosion. The Young Man freezes.

           Then more noise from upstairs. Loud banging. Centralized and 
           moving. The noises get louder.

           The Young Man quietly turns off the light. Then sits on the 
           bed. Waiting. 
           He covers his ears with his palms, and then jumps up and 
           turns off a record player in the corner, as if unaware that 
           it was blasting Tom Jones. He gets back on the bed and curls 
           up at the edge of the cot, back pressed up against the wall.

           A breath in. Out.

           THEN - the door is broken in by a TEAM OF THREE COPS, guns 
           drawn. The same kaleidoscope of flashlights boomerang 
           throughout the basement, like spotlights at a grand opening.

           A wheezy breath in.

                                 COP #2
                        Who's there?

           A heavy breath out.

           Cop #1 shines his light and pistol on the Young Man, still on 
           the bed, shaking.

                                 COP #1
                        Bobby?

           The OTHER COPS shine their lights. Cop #1 inches closer to 
           the Young Man, until he reaches him. Cop #1 grabs the Young 
           Man and pulls him close, to see his face.

                                 COP #1 (CONT’D)
                        It’s not him!

                                 COP #2
                        The kid or the guy?

                                 COP #1
                        Neither!

           The cops now all draw their guns and begin shouting, as Cop 
           #1 pulls the Young Man off the bed and stands him up.

                      COP #1 (CONT’D)
                                                         COP #2
           Who the fuck are you?
                                              Where’s the boy?

                                 COP #3
                        What's your name? What is your name?

           The YOUNG MAN drops to the ground, in shock.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOLDING ROOM ONE - LATER

           CLOSE UP on DETECTIVE MORRISON, seated at an aluminum table. 
           She attempts to contain a giddy smile. But can't.
                                 DETECTIVE MORRISON
                        Max. (beat) Sweetheart. Max. Honey. 
                        Of course it’s you. Max, I'm 
                        Detective Morrison. I've been in 
                        charge of your case since the very 
                        beginning. (beat) I knew the two of 
                        us would meet. Would see each other 
                        again. And I've been waiting a very 
                        long time to say that you're safe 
                        now. You're safe and I'm here.

           PAN OUT to see: there is NO ONE at the other end of the 
           table, the room is empty at the moment.

                                 DETECTIVE MORRISON (CONT’D)
                             (rehearsing)
                        I'm here - I'm...I'm here - I'm 
                        here sweetheart - 

           The DOOR BURSTS OPEN as POLICE CHIEF BERNSTEIN (late 40s) and 
           the YOUNG MAN - MAX WHEELER - walk into the room. Max is clad 
           in an oversized Nassau County Police Department sweatshirt.

                                 BERNSTEIN
                        Max, this is Detective Morrison. 
                        She's been on your case since the 
                        beginning.

           Detective Morrison stands and stares. She can't speak. She's 
           star-stuck almost. Or seeing a ghost. Bernstein helps Max sit 
           down, then sits next to Morrison.

                                 BERNSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        You look for a boy for so long, at 
                        some point you choose to forget you 
                        should be looking for a man.

           Bernstein smiles as he slides over numerous "Missing Child" 
           documents from Max's file toward Max. Among them is an AGED-
           ENHANCED PHOTO of Max. It resembles him slightly, eerily.

           Max stares at the portrait. An alternate version of himself. 

                                 BERNSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        I've been waiting a long time to 
                        say that you're home now. You're 
                        safe and you're home. Do you 
                        understand?

           Morrison is crushed. It was hers to say.

           Max stares in shock.
                                 BERNSTEIN (CONT’D)
                        Another boy went missing three days 
                        ago. A vehicle was recovered early 
                        this morning near where the boy was 
                        last seen. It was abandoned. We ran 
                        the plates and they were registered 
                        to the home of a Mr. J. HAROLD 
                        CARTER. The home where we found you 
                        -

                                 MORRISON
                             (impulsively)
                        Hi.

           Morrison then stares blankly, unaware she spoke. She realizes 
           she had and quickly hands Max a picture of BOBBY WATERS (11).

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        We're sorry about doing this now, 
                        but this is BOBBY WATERS. Can you 
                        remember if you ever saw this boy?

                                 MAX
                        No. (I didn't)

                                 BERNSTEIN
                        Did Mr. Carter ever mention this 
                        boy to you?

                                 MAX
                             (concerned, re: Carter)
                        Is he OK?

                                 MORRISON
                             (covering for Max)
                        Bobby’s still missing. (beat) As is 
                        Carter. We don’t have much time, 
                        sweetheart - is there anything - 

                                 BERNSTEIN
                             (whispers to Morrison)
                        The kid's got no idea.

           Max absorbs the new reality.

                                 MAX
                        Do I still get to see them?

                                 BERNSTEIN
                        Who?

                                 MAX
                        My...him and her.
           Bernstein smiles. Morrison looks hurt, jealous almost.

                                 BERNSTEIN
                        Your parents are right on the other 
                        side of that wall. They've been 
                        waiting ten years for this. Would 
                        you like to see them now?

           Max sinks. Silence. Max's eyes widen. His head begins to 
           shake subtly, then more powerfully.

                                 MAX
                        Ten?

           His eyes begin to well. Instinctively he tries to cover it. 
           Control it. Is it instinct or conditioning? He begins to sob 
           again. He looks at Morrison. For something. For what?

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Um...

           Max shakes his head no, slightly. He is in shock. He begins 
           to shake. Then sobs. Then controls.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        That's it?

           INT. POLICE STATION - HOLDING ROOM 3 - CONTINUOUS

           DARLENE and FRANK WHEELER (Late 40s) - Max's parents - are 
           seated across from a FEMALE REUNIFICATION EXPERT (40s). They 
           are in shock, a confused dishevelment. 

                                 REUNIFICATION EXPERT
                        Given the duration your son has 
                        been missing there are certain 
                        changes he has undergone which may 
                        make him unrecognizable to you.

                                 FRANK
                        Can we see him?

                        In the coming days, you will want 
                        to make sure he understands his 
                        real identity. Name, address, date 
                        of birth. (beat) The attention will 
                        only intensify. Because you live in 
                        a gated community, we can keep 
                        reporters out, but you'll need to 
                        disconnect your phones, e-mail, 
                        everything. The outside world, all 
                        at once, can be confusing.
                                 FRANK
                        We just want to see him.

                        He may have gone years without contact 
                        with the outside world - natural 
                        sunlight or human contact, outside of 
                        interactions with the suspect.

           Frank gets up from his chair.

                        You can't force trust. He will talk 
                        about his experience when he is 
                        ready. This should not be about 
                        what happened. It should be about 
                        moving forward. (beat) Mr. Wheeler, 
                        if you'll sit please. 

                                 FRANK
                        I'm not gonna sit. I want to see 
                        him. I don’t - you’re gonna bring 
                        me to him, now.

                        your seat belt. You don't follow 
                        what I’m telling you, any chance

                        The next few days are critical. Do 
                        you understand?

           Frank sits, his head drops. Darlene stares straight ahead.

                        Most important is to bear in mind 
                        that he may have been victim to 
                        repeated physical trauma. As such 
                        any touching or embracing may be 
                        overwhelming or dangerous for him.

           INT. MEDIATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Darlene and Frank sit on chairs, waiting.

           The door opens, as Max walks in. Slowly. Darlene and Frank 
           get up.

           Max stares at them. Frank and Darlene at him. Frank and 
           Darlene inch closer to him. Max stands his ground.

           Frank and Darlene stop inches from Max. Darlene is overcome. 
           She begins to sob. Frank tries to reach out and embrace Max, 
           but fights the urge. He too begins to cry. They stand just 
           inches from Max, sobbing uncontrollably, longing for him, 
           while Max stands coldly, watching, in shock.

           A RINGING NOISE gets LOUDER, until it CRESCENDOS.

           INT. CAR - HOURS LATER

           FRANK drives as Max sits in the backseat. Darlene’s seat is 
           pulled far back. Max's knees are pressed up hard against it.

           Max plays with the door lock. Locking, then unlocking. He 
           puts his hand on the door handle and closes his eyes, as if 
           tempted to open it.

                                 SOOTHING FEMALE RADIO DJ
                        "KOST 102.3, Love Songs on the Radio. 
                        We're coasting tonight with Nina from 
                        Oyster Bay, who has a message for 
                        Glenn. Glenn, Nina knows how hard it 
                        was for you to be away all these 
                        years, but she wants you to know that 
                        you’re still her world and your 
                        return will be the silver-lining for 
                        your journey together. Nina wants to 
                        tell you how much she loves you with 
                        your special song. Here's "Making 
                        Love Out Of Nothing At All."

           "Making Love Out Of Nothing At All" by Air Supply plays.

           Max stares out the window, taking in the town of Jericho, NY, 
           the Great Hall of Suburbia. It’s now new, but ever familiar.

           MAX suddenly looks at the REARVIEW MIRROR. DARLENE's and 
           FRANK's EYES are staring at him. They linger a moment then 
           turn away. Darlene smiles warmly. Max stares at the mirror.

           Max's legs shift, his KNEES pressed up harder against 
           Darlene’s seat. Darlene turns around to see his discomfort.
                                 DARLENE
                        Oh, I didn't...here.

           Darlene struggles to move the seat up. She can't.

                     DARLENE (CONT’D)
                                                          MAX
           Frank, how do you do this?
                                              It's fine.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        No, sweetheart, I got it - 

           DARLENE tugs at the LEVER, trying to PULL the SEAT FORWARD, 
           when suddenly the SEAT JERKS forward TOO FAR. Darlene is now 
           PRESSED UP against the front dashboard, with Max having too 
           much room. But she accepts the new position, smiles warmly.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        There.

           Silence.

                                 FRANK
                        Are you hungry? You must be hungry.

                                 MAX
                        He fed me before.

           This lingers.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        The detective.

           A beat.

                                 DARLENE
                        Max, honey - there have been some 
                        big changes since you’ve - since -

                                 MAX
                        I know about it. They rebuilt 
                        pretty quickly.

           Darlene’s confused by the comment, but let’s it go.

                                 FRANK
                        Max, see where Bagel Boss used to 
                        be? Now it's Cho-Sen Village - 
                        Kosher Chinese restaurant. You 
                        believe that? Pete says they even 
                        got Kosher mu-shu pork.
                             (Frank laughs)
                        People love fooling themselves.
           INT. WHEELER HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank, Darlene, and Max shut the door behind them. An ELDERLY 
           WOMAN - ETHEL - (76) approaches them with a YOUNG BOY (7) 
           following shyly behind her.

           The Elderly Woman stares at Max, entranced, emotional.

                                 DARLENE
                        Ethel, thanks.

                                 ETHEL
                             (re: Tommy)
                        Of course, dear. He was as he 
                        always is. Sweet.

           Ethel stares at Max, wanting desperately to say hello. But 
           she doesn’t, and Max ignores her, fixated on the YOUNG BOY.

                                 DARLENE
                        Tommy.

           Tommy understands Darlene’s tone. He gets up and gives an 
           obligatory hug to Ethel, the kind that a child may give to a 
           mother’s second cousin when he just wants to go play. 

           Ethel heads out the door, as the Young Boy takes his place by 
           Frank’s leg.

           Max stares, afraid at first. Then confused as he studies the 
           boy. Eyes widen. He smiles, relieved, then stops, doubting, 
           staring at Tommy some more. He looks to Frank and Darlene.

                                 FRANK
                        This is your brother, Thomas.

           Max stares at Tommy. He doesn’t understand. 

           Max quickly closes his eyes, unsettled by a thought or 
           vision. He then opens again, as if resetting the image. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Hi.

           Tommy stands there for a moment, then walks over to Max.

                                 FRANK
                             (muted)
                        No -

           Tommy then hugs Max, an Ethel-like hug. Obligatory. Holds it 
           for a moment. Tommy then lets go, goes to sit on the stairs, 
           takes out a cell-phone and begins playing a game on it. Max 
           appears shocked. Then smiles.
           INT. WHEELER HOME - DEN - LATER

           Frank and Darlene lead Max into the den - the final room of 
           the tour. Max takes larger steps than necessary, as if wading 
           through water. Unaccustomed to this spaciousness and freedom. 

           They stand awkwardly until Max sits on the couch. Darlene and 
           Frank sit on either side of him. Max looks to Darlene, 
           anticipating the next move. She smiles broadly, warmly, 
           perhaps too overdone, as Frank stares at the turned-off TV.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh. And we re-did the basement a 
                        few years ago. Made it a playroom. 
                        Pinball, air-hockey. It’s the “fun 
                        room.” You’ll love it down there -

           Frank catches himself. Silence again.

           Max stares at their reflection on the turned-off TV, watching 
           them. Enthralled, emotional.

           Frank flips on the TV, as Max twinges, and settles back to 
           their company. A "HOME IMPROVEMENT" re-run murmurs in the 
           background. The LAUGH TRACK from the show resonates. Darlene 
           and Frank inch a bit closer to Max.

                                 MAX
                        Was he a mistake?

           LAUGH TRACK.

                                 FRANK
                        What's that?

                                 MAX
                        Did you have him by mistake? Why 
                        did you have him?

                                 DARLENE
                             (kindly)
                        No sweetie. We had Tommy because we 
                        wanted him.

                                 MAX
                             (kindly)
                        That's a good reason.

           LAUGH TRACK. Max peeks a glance at his parents, watching the 
           TV. Darlene sneaks a glance at Max.

                                 TV SHOW CHARACTER
                        Mom never said today!
           LAUGH TRACK. Darlene and Frank laugh at the sitcom.

           Max studies them, watching them watching. He’s enthralled.

                                 TV SHOW CHARACTER (CONT’D)
                        Well that's what families do.(beat) 
                        I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the hay!

           LAUGH TRACK. Max laughs. As if mimicking his parents.

           Darlene looks at Max, expectantly.

                                 DARLENE
                             (paraphrasing the 
                              Reunification Expert)
                        You can't force trust, and you 
                        can't expect to feel it right away. 
                        You have to let it come to you. 
                        This shouldn't be about what 
                        happened. It should be about moving 
                        forward.(beat) But you can tell us 
                        anything. You can talk to us. We 
                        are listening. It's important you 
                        hear that.

           A beat. Max turns to her.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, what?

           Darlene shakes her head, relieved he missed what she said.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        When is sundown?

           Frank and Darlene look at each other, confused.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Bedtime.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh. Right. Whenever - whenever you 
                        feel like going to bed.

                                 MAX
                        Well - I think I'm going to "hit 
                        the hay."

           LAUGH TRACK. FRANK looks at him, as if discovering him anew. 
           Frank smiles at Max. He laughs. Glowing. Then gets emotional.

                                 FRANK
                        Come here.
           Frank reaches for Max, brings him into him, hugs him tight. 
           Max loves this, a reward for acting "normal." Darlene looks 
           on, jealous, wistful, unable to bring herself to touch him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (teary)
                        Mine.

           Darlene stands by. The hug lingers, until -

                                 DARLENE
                        Well, let's go up.

           LAUGH TRACK. Max gets up, looks at the television. Success.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Darlene and Frank clear away a colony of unused INFOMERCIAL 
           WORKOUT MACHINES, evicting the BOWFLEX XTREME and TOTAL GYM 
           from prime real estate. There’s a bed and a dresser, but it’s 
           a de facto storage room. Tommy’s old toys. Frank’s occasional 
           work desk. Things without meaning or memory. Leftovers.

                                 DARLENE
                        We’ll move it all out, sweetie. 
                        This used to be Tommy’s room, but 
                        he always liked to sleep in your 
                        bed. We kept it, you know. Just the 
                        way...until we moved him in there.

           Max becomes fixated on the WINDOW in the room.

                                 MAX
                        Was that always there?

                                 DARLENE
                        Of course, sweetheart.

           Max slowly gets into bed. Under the covers. Frank and Darlene 
           stand over Max, tucking him in.

                                 FRANK
                        Sweet dreams, Maxxie.

           Frank leaves Max and Darlene alone. Darlene pushes herself to 
           fill the void. But just smiles, longingly. Max smiles. 

                                 MAX
                        Can you close it...all the way?

           Darlene nods, closes the door.

           Max accustoms himself to the new bed. He lies back. Smiles.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (sitcom voice)
                        “I think I'll hit the hay”...hit 
                        the hay. Good. Good.

           Max smiles big. Strangely. Then tosses, then turns, growing 
           frustrated. Scared. Unsure. He begins to sing “SAY YOU’LL 
           STAY UNTIL TOMORROW” by Tom Jones to soothe himself as he 
           closes his eyes. He takes his HAND and moves it down his body 
           and UNDER HIS UNDERPANTS, as we - 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR'S BASEMENT - ONE WEEK EARLIER

           CLOSE-UP on Max. Tense. Anxious

           There is a LOUD, INTERMITTENT, VIOLENT POPPING NOISE, 
           throughout as Schubert's Impromptus, Op. 90 plays quietly.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        Does he have brown hair?

           Max stares at him, nervously. A smile ekes out. Max contains 
           it. Coy.

                                 MAX
                        No. (beat) Does he have blonde hair?

           THE POPPING NOISE becomes more FREQUENT.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        No. (beat) Does he have glasses?

                                 MAX
                        Yes.

           Max almost laughs, but contains it.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Does he have red hair?

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        Yes. (beat) Is your person Paul?

           PAN OUT on Max and the Captor playing “GUESS WHO?” at a small 
           fold-up table. POP, POP, POP.

                                 MAX
                        No.
                                 CAPTOR
                        No?

           We see the Captor for the first time. Just a man. He stares 
           at Max, coldly. POP, POP, POP.

           Max shakes his head “no” and lets out a laugh. Playful.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Is it him?

                                 MAX
                        No. Is your person Bill?

           The Captor stares at Max.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Do you have Paul?

           Max shakes his head no, not convincingly. He squirms, 
           playfully. Then grows silent, fearful.

           Max looks at the Captor. Trying not to nod. His eyes begin to 
           water. He shakes his head side to side.

           Max tries to hold back tears. POP, POP, POP.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Bite your tongue.

           Max bites his tongue, tries to stop from crying, to be 
           defiant. But he can’t.

           The Captor shifts in his chair. Max jumps. POP, POP, POP.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t you. Not like this. I 
                        don’t want to be a certain way to 
                        you. So why do you force my hand?

           Max surrenders.

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry. It was Paul. I always 
                        had Paul.

           For the first time we Max’s PLAYER CARD. But Max has ERIC. 
           Not Paul.

           The Captor stares at Max, offers a warm smile. Max gazes 
           back. Then - BEEP! BEEP! as the POPPING comes to a stop.

           Max gets up and heads to the microwave, where POPCORN was 
           POPPING. He gets a bowl and pours the bag of POPCORN into it.
                                 CAPTOR
                        I love Game Night.

           Max brings the bowl to the table and sits down.

                                 MAX
                        Who’d you have?

           The Captor tosses his card toward Max.

                                 CAPTOR
                        I had Max.

           Max picks up the card to see the “GUESS WHO?” character MAX.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. MAX’S BEDROOM (GUEST ROOM) - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Max wakes in bed in the guest room - now “Max’s Bedroom.” He 
           CHECKS the BED for WETNESS. Then SMELLS the SHEETS.

           He makes like he has to go to the bathroom and heads to the 
           door. He stands in front of it. Hand hovering above the 
           doorknob. He can't open it. He whimpers. He shakes his head. 
           He clenches his fist and takes his hand as if to -

           INT. PARENTS’ BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           KNOCK. We hear a loud KNOCK coming from outside the room. 
           KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

           Frank wakes to the noise. Drowsy. He gets up and deliriously 
           follows the noise.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           KNOCK. KNOCK. It gets louder.

           Frank is in front of Max’s door and opens it.

           Max is standing there, clenching, holding his crotch.

                                 MAX
                        Can I...Can I use the toilet?

                                 FRANK
                        You don't have to ask here. You 
                        don't ever have to ask.

           Max hurries out to the bathroom. Frank looks on, horrified.
           INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           MAX wakes, gets up slowly. A pan is sizzling, a TV on 
           downstairs. The house is awake.

           Max heads to the door, unable to open it. His hand hovers 
           over the doorknob. Then touches it. But he can't open the 
           door. Conditioned against it for so long.

           He removes his hand and stares. Max then closes his eyes and 
           opens it. Success.

           INT. TOMMY’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max slowly opens the door. He peers into the room. Tommy’s 
           bed is empty. Max peruses around. Looking at his old world. 
           Now resettled with a new owner. 

           After a few moments, he heads to the door, but is stopped by 
           Tommy’s HEIGHT CHART etched in pencil on the door-frame. It 
           seems to be written over an even older, nearly erased height 
           chart. This was Max’s - the only visible entry is from "JUNE 
           2003" - 4’5”. Max now towers over each ETCHING. The last 
           vestige that he even existed. He measures where he is now.

           INT. DETECTIVE MORRISON’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Detective Morrison gets dressed in uniform in front of a full-
           length mirror. She stares at her reflection. It appears she’s 
           pregnant - a noticeable “baby bump” now apparent.

           As she buttons her shirt, she takes notice of the bump. She 
           rubs it, closes her eyes, smiles. Rubbing and rubbing.

           She stares for a moment longer, then removes a sweatshirt - 
           the faux baby bump - from underneath her shirt. A game of 
           pretend. If only.

           EXT. ALLENWOOD PARK - LATER THAT MORNING

           Detective Morrison sits on a park bench with a TEENAGE GIRL 
           (16). The girl wears a Allenwood Day Camp Staff t-shirt, a 
           Tiffany’s charm bracelet and Juicy Couture sweatpants. She’s 
           a classic JAP (Jewish American Princess).

           They watch a herd of 10-year-old campers play in the 
           sprinklers.

                                 JAP COUNSELOR
                        I wouldn’t say there was like 
                        anything funny about him that day.

                        I mean - he was a funny kid, not 
                        like funny but like he was kind of 
                        quiet, would like pick his nose 
                        sometimes and stuff, when no one 
                        was looking. Well I was always 
                        looking, you know, because that’s 
                        my job. (beat) He was at Arts and 
                        Crafts all day that day, though. He 
                        just like wouldn’t play kickball. 
                        He was such a shit sometimes.

                                 MORRISON
                        Did you happen to remember seeing a 
                        white mini-van that day? Parked in 
                        the lot, or circling around -

                                 JAP COUNSELOR
                        Nope. Just a white Range.

                                 MORRISON
                        A Range?

                                 JAP COUNSELOR
                        Range Rover. I remember cause my 
                        parents just got me one but in 
                        black and I was thinking like how 
                        shitty my black one was compared to 
                        the white one. And I just wanted 
                        white, but it was more expensive, 
                        and my dad’s cheap so...that’s why 
                        I have a summer job and a black 
                        Range Rover.

           Morrison takes the girl in.

                                 JAP COUNSELOR (CONT’D)
                        This is so crazy. My friends from 
                        school and camp and my teen tour 
                        are like texting me non-stop, like 
                        what is going on. And I’m just like 
                        I have no idea. (beat) You’ll find 
                        him though, right? He probably 
                        misses me. And that’s really hard 
                        for me to think about.

           Morrison stares at the girl, then watches the kids playing in 
           the sprinklers.

                        Hey, do you think they’ll interview 
                        me on TV?
           INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Max sits in a gown on a fire-truck themed examination table. 
           He is clearly too old for the room. DR. GOULD (60s), with 
           untamed ear hair, is poking and prodding Max with different 
           instruments.

           Dr. Gould checks Max's ears.

                                 DR. GOULD
                        Mmmhmm.

           Dr. Gould checks Max’s eyes.

                                 DR. GOULD (CONT’D)
                        Follow the light.

           Max follows the light left to right. Right to left.

                                 DR. GOULD (CONT’D)
                        Mmmhmm. (beat) Deep breath in for 
                        me, hold, and release.

           Max does it.

                                 DR. GOULD (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           They repeat this exchange a few more times. Then we - 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR'S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           Max and the Captor sit on the edge of the small cot. Still. 
           Max is dressed in SUPERHERO PAJAMAS, many sizes too small. 
           It’s a ridiculous costume of sorts for the young man.

           Max’s HAND moves just an inch - 

                                 CAPTOR
                             (off the hand)
                        Just stop. It’s not gonna make a 
                        difference.

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Did you even shave today?

           Max nods.
                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Your face and your hands?

           Max nods. The Captor sighs. Disinterested. Not aroused. The 
           two sit for a moment. Still. Max breathes deeply.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 DR. GOULD
                        Well, you're still breathing.

           The dry humor is lost on MAX. Dr. Gould puts on LATEX GLOVES.

                                 DR. GOULD (CONT’D)
                        If you’ll lie down please.

           Max does so as Dr. Gould moves his hands around Max's head, 
           then to his neck, and slowly down his chest, further and 
           further, until he reaches his underpants.

           Max pushes him away, instinctively.

                                 DR. GOULD.
                        It's for your own good.

           Dr. Gould begins to check underneath his underpants.

           Max is shaking. Uncomfortable. Breathes in and out.

           INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Darlene and Frank sit waiting, a wistful look on Darlene's 
           face.

           She watches Tommy playing with some of the toys at the 
           office. A COUGHING BOY plays nearby with other toys.

           Darlene watches the COUGHING BOY get closer to Tommy. Frank 
           moves his hand on Darlene’s.

                        What did he feel like? Did he feel 
                        right?

           Frank looks at her.

                                 FRANK
                        Just like he should.
                                 DARLENE
                        We’re not supposed to. Hold him 
                        like that. She said not to.

                                 FRANK
                        Honey, it’s okay. You can - 

           Darlene watches Tommy.

                                 DARLENE
                        But then I’ll know. If it’s real. 
                        (beat) Maybe this is enough. 

           Darlene looks at Frank. She shakes her head, removes her hand 
           from under Frank's.

           The Coughing Boy gets closer to Tommy, tries to play.

                                 FRANK
                        Hon -

                                 DARLENE
                        Tommy! Come here sweetheart.

           Tommy walks over to Darlene. She hugs him tight.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        That boy is very sick. I don't want 
                        you going near him. OK?

           Tommy nods, and goes back to play. Max heads into the waiting 
           room, a bit shell-shocked. Frank stands to greet Max.

                                 MAX
                             (feigned excitement)
                        He did all the tests. Everything's 
                        normal.

           Darlene looks up at him, tears in her eyes. She stands and 
           hugs him close. She doesn’t let go. He’s real. 

           INT. WHEELER HOME - DEN - LATER

           Max and Darlene sit on one side of the couch, with Frank and 
           Tommy on the other, as they are on separate teams. Tommy 
           holds a plastic disc in his hands. It’s the party game 
           “CATCHPHRASE,” a word association guessing game.

                                 TOMMY
                             (to Max)
                        You’ll get it as we do it. It’s 
                        easy. (to Frank) Okay, and...
           Tommy turns over the plastic hourglass.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Go!

                                 FRANK
                             (rushed, reading the disk)
                        You do this in October - 

                                 TOMMY
                        Soccer camp.

                                 FRANK
                        No. You were Iron Man last year -

                                 TOMMY
                        Trick-or-treat.

                                 FRANK
                        Yes!

           Frank hands the disc to Darlene. She reads the clue word.

                                 DARLENE
                             (to Max)
                        Okay, sweetheart, um...you used to 
                        love this. Maybe you still do.

           Max doesn’t respond.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a summer drink. Made from a fruit.

                                 MAX
                        Lemonade.

                                 DARLENE
                        Yes!

           Darlene hands the disc to Tommy. He reads the clue.

                                 TOMMY
                        Um, oh, ok, it’s a place. 

                                                          TOMMY
                           FRANK
           School. Bowling alley. Water 
           park.
                                              You used to take me here 
                                              every Sunday after basketball 
                                              practice, with the team - 

                            MAX
                                                          FRANK
                 (wistfully almost)
                                              McDonalds!
           McDonalds.
                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                             (to Max)
                        No, don’t help us. Only we can guess.

           Tommy passes Max the disc. Max looks at his clue. Smiles.

                                 MAX
                        Okay - “Is it that by its 
                        indefiniteness it shadows forth the 
                        heartless voids and immensities of 
                        the universe...”

           Max smiles knowingly at Darlene.

                          DARLENE
           I don’t know.
                                                          MAX
                                              “Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, 
                                              or who, that lifts this arm?”

           Darlene and Frank stare at him, mesmerized.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        “Call me Ishmael!”

                                 DARLENE
                        Oh. Oh. Moby Dick!

           Max smiles at his mother as Tommy takes the disc.

                                 TOMMY
                        You like...oh! You always say I’m 
                        your favorite little...

                                 FRANK
                        Sidekick.

           Frank smiles, then looks at Max, apologetically. 

           Tommy hands the disc to Max. He looks at the word. Confused.

                                 MAX
                        Um... (beat) I don’t...

                          DARLENE
                                                          TOMMY
           Just try, sweetheart.
                                              Ten seconds!

                            MAX
                                                         DARLENE
           I really don’t... 
                                              Is it an English word?

                                                          TOMMY
                            MAX
           I don’t think so.
                                              Five seconds!

                            MAX
                                                          TOMMY
           I don’t know.
                                              TIME! We win!
                                 DARLENE
                        That’s ok, honey. What was it?

                                 MAX
                             (struggling with the 
                              pronunciation)
                        “Barack Obama?”

                                 DARLENE
                        Barack Obama.

           Darlene looks at Frank, then back at Max.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Do you know who that is, 
                        sweetheart?

                                 MAX
                        That’s a person?

                                 DARLENE
                        That’s a person.

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s the President. Of America.

           Max laughs. Smiles at Tommy.

                                 MAX
                        Who is it, really?

           Silence. Max looks confused.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        But there’s no president anymore. 
                        Not after the war.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. DETECTIVE MORRISON'S CAR - DAY

           The sedan is parked outside a mansion in Port Washington, NY, 
           an identical suburb just fifteen minutes from Jericho.

           VOICE OVER of DARLENE's 911 call from 2003 plays:

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        What's your emergency?
                                 DARLENE
                        My son, it’s my son...he went out 
                        alone for a bike ride and was 
                        supposed to be back two hours ago. 
                        I was supposed to watch him -

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Okay ma'am, I need you to stay on the 
                        line. What is your name and address?

                                 DARLENE
                        It's um, Darlene Wheeler. 7 Fortune 
                        Lane in Jericho. Please, I don’t - 

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        Ma'am, we're going to have an 
                        officer over shortly. They're 
                        minutes away - 

           There's a CLICK in the car. Morrison hits the REWIND button. 
           We realize it wasn't a voice-over at all, but a TAPE ON LOOP. 
           She inhales. Hits Play. Exhales.

                                 911 DISPATCHER (CONT’D)
                        What's your emergency?

                                 DARLENE
                        My son, it’s my son... he went out - 

           CLICK. REWIND. PLAY.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        My son, it’s my son - 

           CLICK. REWIND. PLAY.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        My son, it’s my son - 

           Morrison closes her eyes, then shuts the engine. Opens her 
           eyes. Then opens the car door.

           EXT. PORT WASHINGTON - MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           The MANSION sits perched on a nest of perfectly manicured 
           lawn. The home could as well be the Headquarters of Suburbia. 
           The lair of some June Cleaver-Martha Stewart love child. If 
           you listen closely enough you can hear the jingle of an ice 
           cream truck or the putter of the mailman’s carrier.

           Morrison wipes lipstick from her teeth, then knocks on the 
           front door. 
           An elegant WOMAN (40s) opens the door a crack. A few too many 
           Xanax are keeping her together. Little girls’ voices are 
           heard in the background.

                                 MORRISON
                        My name is Detective Morrison with 
                        the Nassau County Police Department. 
                        I’m looking for a Helen Carter.

           The Woman nods.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        You’re the sister of J. Harold 
                        Carter, of Bayside, NY, he worked 
                        at the Jericho Public Library, I 
                        got the right one?

           INT. HELEN CARTER’S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The kitchen is grand but untouched. Morrison, visibly 
           disapproving of the plasticity, stands against the counter. 
           Helen brings a MUG OF COFFEE over, Morrison rejects it.

                                 MORRISON
                        Five years sober. (beat) Unnatural 
                        to depend on things.

           Helen dumps the coffee in the sink melodramatically, then 
           sits down and stares at Morrison. Quietly judging.

                                 HELEN
                        I thought you were a reporter.

                                 MORRISON
                        They don’t knock. (beat) When did 
                        you last speak with your brother?

                                 HELEN
                        A month ago. We went over there for 
                        dinner. (beat) You know, he was a 
                        great uncle. No matter what you 
                        say.

                                 MORRISON
                        When you would go over there, was 
                        there ever any indication of 
                        anything? 

                                 HELEN
                             (fresh)
                        Was there ever any indication that 
                        a kidnapped boy was living in his 
                        basement for ten years? No, ma’am.
                                 MORRISON
                        So you never saw Max?

                                 HELEN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Oh, Max, you’re talking about? 
                        Yeah, Harry used to bring him up 
                        from his cage, dress him in a tux, 
                        and have him serve hors d’oeuvres. 
                        The fuck you think. 

           Morrison wipes lipstick from the sides of her mouth.

                                 MORRISON
                        Ma’am, you ever show me chutzpah 
                        like that again, I’ll shuttle your 
                        ass to Mineola and book you as an 
                        accessory to kidnapping. And even 
                        if your fancy goy lawyer gets you 
                        off, I’ll spend every dime of my 
                        pension and every favor I’m owed to 
                        tell every book club and botox 
                        party from Manhasset to Montauk 
                        that you had something to do with 
                        Max’s kidnapping and Bobby’s 
                        disappearance. That happens, good 
                        luck getting your girls play-dates 
                        and carpools, cause last I checked 
                        you’re marooned on an island of 
                        scared shitless P.T.A. mothers. And 
                        they don’t want a little blood. 
                        They want a sacrifice. (beat) We 
                        got a little boy missing and we 
                        ain’t got time, so I’ll ask you 
                        again, you never saw Max, is that 
                        correct?

           By now, Helen is crying. She shakes her head yes.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        I need something, Helen.

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t see how it - but our uh - 
                        our father died a week or so ago. 
                        Ma said Harry seemed pretty beat up 
                        over it, but uh, Harry couldn’t 
                        really afford to fly down to 
                        Florida for the funeral. Dad didn’t 
                        have much to do with him anyway.

                                 MORRISON
                        Florida?
           Helen nods. Morrison stares at her. Helen looks at Morrison, 
           embarrassed at what she’s about to say.

                                 HELEN
                        It was just...just boys right?

                                 MORRISON
                        That we know of.

           Helen nods.

                                 HELEN
                             (apprehensively)
                        Should I talk to the girls? Just to 
                        see?

           She sickens at the thought. Morrison gets up to leave.

                                 MORRISON
                        You know your family best.

           INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - EVENING

           The family sits at the table, a beautiful spread covers the 
           table. Turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce, the whole works. Like 
           Thanksgiving. Almost.

           Frank, Darlene, and Tommy devour their food, while Max picks 
           at his plate, still nearly full.

           INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Darlene washes plates at the sink. Max brings his still 
           nearly full plate to her.

                                 MAX
                        Excuse me and thank you.

                                 DARLENE
                        Do you want something else, 
                        sweetheart? Some cereal maybe? You 
                        should be eating.

           Max stops for a moment. Takes her in. He smiles, subtly.

                                 MAX
                        I’m just not hungry.
           Darlene takes the plate and pushes it down the garbage 
           disposal. She smiles as she presses the switch on. A LOUD 
           GRINDING NOISE IS HEARD.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           Max sits on a chair, directly across from the TURNED OFF OLD 
           TELEVISION that can only play VHS tapes. He’s banging the 
           side, as if to reset an image that doesn’t exist.

           CLOSE ON: his warped reflection in the black screen. He’s 
           talking directly to it.

                                 MAX
                        That’s better. No, no, it’s a good 
                        time...I actually don’t know. Space 
                        time is...well there is no time 
                        here really. Just sleep and awake. 
                        Is it late by you guys?...Good, 
                        well yeah, I’m hoping they send me 
                        on this walkabout mission soon. You 
                        get to actually leave the space 
                        station and go make repairs 
                        outside...No I am. I am eating. The 
                        food here’s not so bad. Sometimes 
                        they even have space Chinese food.

           He hears a CREAK at the BASEMENT DOOR. Spins around, pauses 
           for some movement. Nothing. He turns back to the TV. He 
           pauses, as if listening to the TV.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I know, but it’s important that I 
                        stay here. Just a little while 
                        longer.

           Max pauses again, takes in the black screen, growing 
           emotional.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I can’t really see you. I think the 
                        connection is fuzzy. Satellites or 
                        something. But can you...can you 
                        describe what you look like? I 
                        can’t see, and I’m trying to 
                        remember but, well, the 
                        connection...

           Max stares at the black, emotional. Anticipating a 
           description. Silence. 
           Max begins to make the noise of faux-static with his mouth. 
           It gets louder and louder. Until he stops.

           Another CREAK from the BASEMENT DOOR. Max ignores it, drops 
           his head.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        That’s enough.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - LATER

           Max and Tommy brush their teeth. Identically. Max spits out. 
           Tommy spits out and heads to his room.

           Max studies himself in the mirror, as if for the first time. 
           Smiles. Drops it. Flexes like a bodybuilder. Stops. Smiles.

           INT. PARENTS’ BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Frank is in bed, as Darlene closes the book the reunification 
           therapist gave her, "You're Not Alone," turns off the bedside 
           lamp and gets under the covers.

           There's movement under the covers. Rustling. Darlene pushes 
           Frank’s hands away. She turns over. Silence.

           INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Max awakes in his bed. Uncomfortable. He gets up and heads 
           toward the door.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Max quietly walks down the stairs, with a pillowcase in hand.

           INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Max begins to open cabinets, searching for something.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Max walks back up the stairs, lugging his now full 
           pillowcase.
           INT. PARENTS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Darlene awakes. Uncomfortable. She slowly gets out of bed, 
           puts on her robe, and heads toward the door.

           INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Max’s moves quickly about his room, setting the pillowcase 
           down on his bed.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Quiet, strange noises permeate throughout the upstairs 
           hallway. Darlene inches closer and closer to Max’s room. She 
           turns the knob.

           INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Max sits up in his bed, in the dark, FIVE CANS OF FOOD - 
           vegetables, meats, peaches, etc. - opened, as well as 
           POWDERED MASHED POTATOES and RAW RAMEN NOODLES. Max 
           methodically lines up each can, as if taking stock of his 
           supply. Carefully he begins to slurp down the different cans, 
           taking a bit from each before moving onto the next.

           Max doesn’t notice the door open slightly, or Darlene in the 
           doorway. He eats intently. A small dribble of sauce on his 
           face. But there’s a regality to it. Dracula, in black tie, 
           perforating a victim’s neck. He then opens the RAW RAMEN 
           NOODLES and chews them as they crack in his mouth.

           INT. PARENTS’ BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING, EARLY

           Darlene is standing in a bathrobe, having just showered, 
           while Frank showers.

           She stands in front of the mirror. The glass is fogged, we 
           can't see her expression. She DRAWS a FACE on the mirror. 
           Head. Eyes. Smile. She practices her smile.

           Suddenly she clutches her stomach, lifts the toilet seat and 
           VOMITS into the bowl.

                                 FRANK
                             (from the shower)
                        What's that hon?

           Darlene breathes deeply, kneeling over the bowl.
           INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max stirs awake as there’s a knock on the door. The mess from 
           the night before is gone.

           Darlene opens the door and watches Max from the doorway. She 
           then takes a deep breath and gets on the bed, next to him.

           He’s turned toward the wall, but he’s awake. Listening.

                                 DARLENE
                        I know this is hard for you, but 
                        we’ll tackle this together. (beat) 
                        I thought we would do an exercise. 
                        Re-learn things that are true. 

           Silence.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        I made these note cards for you. 
                        Things to look back at and 
                        memorize. OK? Let’s start.

           Darlene takes a pack of note cards and begins reading them.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        What is your full name?

                                 MAX
                        Max.

                                 DARLENE
                        Max Jonathan Wheeler.

           Max breathes deeply.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Say it, sweetie. It’s OK.

                                 MAX
                        Max Jonathan Wheeler.

                                 DARLENE
                        Good. What is your address?

           Max is silent.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Your address is 7 Fortune Lane, 
                        Jericho, NY. Say it.

                                 MAX
                        7 Fortune Lane, Jericho, NY.
                                 DARLENE
                        Good, sweetheart. Okay, next. 
                        Barack Obama.

           Silence.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Barack Obama.

                                 MAX
                        The President.

                                 DARLENE
                        That’s right. What year is it?

                                 MAX
                        The tenth year.

                                 DARLENE
                        No, sweetheart. No, it’s 2013. Say 
                        it.

                                 MAX
                        I’m tired.

                                 DARLENE
                        I know you are. But say the year it 
                        is.

                                 MAX
                        Can I rest for a minute?

                                 DARLENE
                        After you say it. Now say it.

                                 MAX

                                 DARLENE
                        Good Max, that’s very good. Let’s 
                        keep going.

           Darlene smiles.

                                 MAX
                        There wasn’t a war, was there?

           Darlene considers it. Then - 

                                 DARLENE
                        No, sweetheart. There wasn’t.
           INT. JERICHO PUBLIC LIBRARY - CHILDREN’S SECTION - MORNING

           Morrison, in plainclothes, enters the Children’s Section of 
           the Library. She watches a bevy of kids with their parents, 
           longing, jealously.

           She finally approaches the LIBRARIAN’S DESK where a SILVER-
           HAIRED LIBRARIAN (70) with a large, bejeweled LADYBUG PIN on 
           her blouse, places a picture book in a plastic cover.

                                 MORRISON
                        Hello there -

           The Librarian looks up. She’s the kind who makes up voices 
           for the different characters and licks her finger before 
           turning each page. She now smiles sweetly, warmly.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                             (whispering)
                        Darling. We try to keep our voices 
                        small in these parts. For the 
                        children, of course.

           Morrison nods. The rest of the exchange is in a whisper.

                                 MORRISON
                        Ma’am, my name is D -

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Quite refreshing to see a mother 
                        picking out stories for her 
                        children. And all too rare.

           Morrison stares at her. Enlivened by the chance. As if 
           enchanted by a spell.

                                 LIBRARIAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ll read them to sleep, won’t 
                        you?... And you’ll tuck them in... 
                        And they’ll dream of you, won’t 
                        they?

           Morrison nods, tears welling, as a congress of children begin 
           to pass by the librarian’s desk. Morrison is affected by the 
           presence of each one.

                                 LIBRARIAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh honey, they are lucky to have 
                        you. (beat) And my goodness 
                        gracious, if you could only see the 
                        other mothers who come in here. 
                        They’re not half the mother you 
                        are. 
           The Librarian quits whispering, returning to a normal volume.

                                 LIBRARIAN (CONT’D)
                             (with the sweetest smile)
                        They’re all such cunts.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Max is filling up a glass of water at the sink. He sees TOMMY 
           in the BACKYARD, struggling with getting something out of a 
           BOX. We can't see what exactly. Max watches. Curious. THE 
           GLASS OVERFLOWS WITH WATER.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           The Captor sits on the cot, observant.

           He’s staring at Max, who now stands on a tiny stool and 
           struggles to hold a heavy cinder-block high above his head. 
           His body quivers and twitches. He looks to the Captor.

                                 CAPTOR
                        You’ll have to do it there.

           Max pisses himself. It streams down his sweatpants.

           Max’s body is about to give out. His muscles can take no 
           more. 

           Max steals a glance over at the spot where the old TV used to 
           be. Before it was confiscated.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let it go.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. WHEELER HOME - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

           CLOSE ON Max and Tommy, staring down the long end of 
           something. Max is holding Tommy back. Apprehensive, 
           uncomfortable to be touching him.

                                 TOMMY
                        Let me go!

           Tommy tries to go, Max pulls him back
                                 MAX
                             (nervous)
                        You want to just go head first.
                        You have to go head first or you'll 
                        hurt yourself, OK?

                                 TOMMY
                             (playfully annoyed)
                        Ok, let me go.

                                 MAX
                             (stern)
                        It won't hurt if you do it right. 
                        (beat) Okay, three...two...one.

           CLOSE ON TOMMY'S FACE as he takes off HEAD FIRST down the 
           SLIP-N-SLIDE.

           PAN OUT to reveal an OLD SLIP-N-SLIDE set up in the Wheeler 
           backyard. Max slides down head-first after him.

           Tommy laughs. Max laughs with him, then abruptly stops.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        We have to spray it down.

           Max starts spraying it down with the garden hose.

                                 TOMMY
                        Can I go?

           Max watches him, mesmerized, then horrified. Snaps out of it.

                                 MAX
                        If you want to.

           Tommy smiles, screams, and then revs up for the big run, 
           winding up his foot, like a dog does in cartoons.

           MAX stares at Tommy.

                                 TOMMY
                        Okay...one...two...three...

           Tommy runs quickly towards the SLIP-N-SLIDE, plunges head 
           first. His momentum throws him down the slide and deep into 
           the bushes.

           Max smiles, until - 

           Tommy SCREAMS loudly.

           Max darts into the bushes to discover a screaming, frightened 
           Tommy, near tears, pointing at something in the dirt.
           Max looks at the find: a half decayed DEAD CROW, flies 
           collecting around it. Max kneels down to it as Tommy runs 
           into his brother’s arms, hiding his eyes from the carcass.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to see it. 

           Max holds him tight, staring at the carcass. Tommy begins to 
           turn around slowly, dangerously, trying to score a peek.

                                 MAX
                        I know. Close your eyes.

           Tommy covers his eyes with his hand, as Max lets him go.

           Max then starts to bury it. He stops himself from growing 
           emotional. After a few handfuls of dirt, it is buried.

           Max stares at it. Then covers his eyes with hand.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR'S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           CLOSE ON: MAX, covering his eyes with his hand, smiling.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        Keep 'em closed! (beat) No peeking.

                                 MAX
                             (playful annoyance)
                        They're closed!

                                 CAPTOR
                        Okay...

           We hear a SIZZLING.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Let me just set the sun.

           The LIGHTS GO OUT.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Okay, you can open them.

           Max opens his eyes and sees A BIRTHDAY CAKE, CANDLES 
           SIZZLING. "HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOY" is written on the CAKE.

           The Captor smiles at him, tenderly.
                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        "Happy Birthday to You. Happy 
                        Birthday to You. Happy Birthday to 
                        Youuu. Happy Birthday to You!"

           Max smiles.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Make a wish.

           Max attempts to BLOW OUT the trick candle. It won't blow out.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Well, blow it.

           Max attempts again as the Captor laughs. Again and again. 
           Then he stops. Pauses. Takes it all in. Smiles.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MAX
                        Nothing. It’s just nice, is all.

           Max tries one more time, and blows it out. Darkness.

           The Captor turns the lights on.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Smear your name and put it on your 
                        nose. It's good luck.

           Max smears "BOY" and puts it on his nose.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Well, you sure are getting up 
                        there.

           Max spots the large CAKE KNIFE on the table and begins 
           cutting the cake.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        I’d get you something, but what do 
                        you get the boy who has everything?

           Max cuts a piece too big, he tries to cut it in half, but it 
           falls apart. He cuts a new piece.

           The Captor looks at the cake, embarrassed.
                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        I drove by today. I don’t know why 
                        I did it. It’s not my place. But 
                        they were outside.

           Max stops cutting for a beat. Arrested.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        He was mowing the lawn. She was 
                        pruning these chrysanthemums. 
                        Snipping away, not to hurt them. 
                        Not to destroy. But to grow. To 
                        create something even more 
                        beautiful.

           A beat. Max stares at the CAKE KNIFE. Considering it.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        The low hum of the mower. The sharp 
                        clip of the pruners.

           Max begins to break, hyperventilating, as he grips the CAKE 
           KNIFE tightly.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        The murmur of plans for later. So 
                        quiet. Hushed. Unheard. And yet so 
                        loud.

           Max can’t take anymore. He grabs the knife and lunges at the 
           Captor, holding the knife inches away from the man’s chest. 
           The Captor, shocked, doesn’t flinch. He stares at Max, 
           confused, as if to say “you don’t want to do this.”

           Max tries to steady his hand as the knife trembles. He inches 
           the knife closer and closer.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        I know your wish. And I know it 
                        came true.

           Max stops. Fixated. Unsure.

                                 MAX
                        How? How could you know that?!

                                 CAPTOR
                             (warmly, mercifully)
                        Because they were happy.

           Tears now stream down the frosting still covering Max’s face. 
           His resolve slips, overwhelmed. 
           As he lowers the cake knife, the Captor leaps up from his 
           chair and throws Max head first to the ground. Pinning the 
           young man’s head between the floor and his knee.

           Max closes his eyes as frosting falls from his face.

                                 DETECTIVE MORRISON
                             (O.S.)
                        What’d you wish for?

           EXT. WHEELER BACKYARD - THE PRESENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Max turns to see MORRISON watching him and Tommy. Max is 
           startled and quickly moves his hand away from his eyes. He 
           turns around protectively.

                                 MORRISON
                        Or was it a prayer? There’s a 
                        difference you know.

           Morrison smiles brightly. Max is spooked.

                                 MAX
                        I was just. Rubbing. My eyes.

                                 MORRISON
                        I didn't mean to startle you. Came 
                        by to see how you were doing. 

                                 MAX
                        Tommy, go get ready for dinner.

           Tommy heads inside.

                                 MORRISON
                        Just us.

           Morrison smiles, motherly.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        I used to love digging in the 
                        backyard. A whole world under you. 
                        (beat) Sweet boy.

           Morrison is lost in the moment. Then - 

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Hey Max, did Carter ever mention 
                        anything to you about Florida? 
                        Taking a trip there maybe?

                                 MAX
                        No.
                                 MORRISON
                        Right. Right. Well, just thought 
                        I'd check in.

           Morrison watches him, smiles.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Hey, don’t blame yourself.

           Morrison signals to the clump of dirt.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        You didn't kill the thing.

                                 DARLENE
                             (O.S.)
                        Max?!

           Darlene comes running into the backyard.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                             (to Max)
                        Sweetheart, go inside.

           Max heads back inside, disturbed and flustered.

                                 MORRISON
                        Darlene.

                                 DARLENE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MORRISON
                        Just had a question.

                                 DARLENE
                        You can’t do that here. They said it 
                        could be detrimental to his progress. 
                        He needs to feel safe here. 
                        Undisturbed.

                                 MORRISON
                        A boy is missing.

                                 DARLENE
                        I know. And I know what that is. 
                        How that feels.(beat) But not him. 
                        He’s found, Hilda. You have any 
                        questions, you go through me. Do 
                        you understand?

           Morrison looks on where Max left, wistfully.
                                 MORRISON
                        Sweet boy. Must feel nice.

           Darlene stares at her, as Morrison retreats toward her car.

           INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - LATER

           Darlene serves everyone a plate of delicious Chinese food, 
           from Cho-Sen Village in town.

           She places plates for herself, Tommy, and Frank on the table. 
           She then spoons lo-mein and chicken fried rice onto half of 
           Max’s plate, and pours canned food onto the other half.

                                 DARLENE
                             (to Max)
                        Small steps. If you finish the 
                        Chinese, you can have the canned. 
                        Half and half. Good deal?

           Max nods. He takes his fork and plays with the lo-mein. Then 
           slowly takes a string of noodle, puts it in his mouth. 
           Unsure. Then begins to chew. Slowly at first. Swallows. Goes 
           for another bite.

           Darlene smiles, satisfied.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - LATER

           Max and Tommy brush their teeth. Identically. Max spits out. 
           Tommy spits out.

                                 TOMMY
                        Can you tuck me in tonight?

           Max looks at him, a bit fearful, then nods. A smile emerges. 

           INT. TOMMY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max sits on the edge of TOMMY'S BED, apprehensive and excited 
           about being so close to him. Tommy gets under the sheets then 
           takes the covers and puts it up around his neck.

                                 TOMMY
                        You do it like this.

           Tommy then beats the two pillows and rests his head.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        And then like that. You got it?
           Max nods.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Oh and the nightlight has to stay 
                        on. Or else I can get scared and 
                        wet the bed. Mom says I shouldn't 
                        tell anyone that. So don't tell 
                        anyone. Except Ms. Finnegan, cause 
                        she already knows.

           Tommy gets under the covers. Max tucks him in as instructed. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You know any stories? My dad always 
                        tells me a story so I can fall asleep.

           Max picks up on “my dad” but lets it go.

                                 MAX
                        Not ones you'd like.

                                 TOMMY
                        Oh. Can you make one up?

                                 MAX
                        I don't know.

                                 TOMMY
                        Can you try?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. Sure. Um. (beat) Uh...in some 
                        other place, there lives this 
                        little boy.

                                 TOMMY
                        What's his name?

                                 MAX
                        He doesn't have a name. He doesn't 
                        need one. Cause he's the only boy 
                        in our story.

           DARLENE takes position in the door-frame, out of sight, but 
           listening carefully.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        And one day he’s playing in the 
                        woods, in this old fort he loves to 
                        play in. (a beat, Max grows 
                        uncertain) Well actually, how about 
                        the one with the man in space...

           But Max notices that Tommy is already sleeping.
           Darlene hears the stop in the story, retreats a few steps.

           Max tucks Tommy in, hesitantly. Then stares at him sleeping. 
           Smiles, tenderly. Slowly, Max becomes disturbed. Emotional.

           He moves his hand toward Tommy's face. Closer. Fighting it, 
           but it's impulsive. The hand inches closer. And closer. Until 
           he brushes Tommy’s hair out of his eyes.

           Max is relieved. He smiles.

           He then gets distracted by Tommy's nightlight. He moves to 
           unplug it as -

                                 DARLENE
                             (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Max turns around and sees Darlene in the door-frame.

                                 MAX
                        I, uh...it's too bright.

                                 DARLENE
                        No, sweetheart. That’s how he needs 
                        it. You shouldn’t be doing that. 
                        (beat) Time for bed, yeah?

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max is brushing his teeth vigorously. His gums are bleeding. 
           He looks in the mirror. His eyes water.

                                 MAX
                             (while brushing)
                        You're okay. You're okay. You're 
                        okay. You're okay...

           He spits out BLOOD. As he heads out the door to his room, he 
           spots TOMMY'S NIGHTLIGHT BLARING.

           INT. TOMMY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Max sneaks in, smiles longingly at a sleeping Tommy, looks 
           ominously at the nightlight. He bends down and pulls it out. 
           The room goes BLACK as we -

                                                               CUT TO:
           INT. CAPTOR'S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           A FLASH OF LIGHT.

           Max sits on a stool, dressed in a cheesy argyle sweater, up 
           against a bare wall. A DIGITAL CAMERA rests on a tripod a few 
           feet away. The Captor, dressed in an identical cheesy argyle 
           sweater, snaps away, the flashes illuminating the room.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Hold still.

           The Captor sets the camera, then runs around and stands 
           behind Max, his hands on Max’s shoulders.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        It’s a self-timer. Say “happy.”

                            MAX
                                                         CAPTOR
           Happy.
                                              Happy.

           They hold the last syllable and smile. The flash goes off.

                                 MAX
                        Do I have to undress?

                                 CAPTOR
                        No. No, these, are family photos. 
                        It will help him ease into 
                        everything.

                                 MAX
                        Him? I don’t understand.

           The Captor runs around to the camera and begins taking some 
           more pictures of Max. FLASH, FLASH, FLASH.

                                 CAPTOR
                        Turn left. There. Hold still. 
                        (beat) Didn’t I tell you? We’re 
                        growing our family.

           FLASH, FLASH!

                                 MAX
                        But you said - you said I was here 
                        so no other kid would.

                                 CAPTOR
                        You’re not a kid anymore.

           FLASH! Max winces.
                                 MAX
                        Aren’t I enough?

                                 CAPTOR
                        But we have so much to give. Isn’t 
                        that only fair? To protect him. 
                        From the war. And the dogs. And 
                        only we can grow food that’s safe. 
                        (beat) It’s our right. Our 
                        responsibility. And there’s nothing 
                        more important than family.

                                 MAX
                        But you said -

                                 CAPTOR
                        And now I changed what I said. So?

                                 MAX
                             (by rote)
                        So you can change what you say if 
                        you choose to, and that’s the new 
                        thing to know.

           FLASH, FLASH, FLASH! As Max processes the new situation.

                                 CAPTOR
                        And you’re going to help me grow 
                        our family. You’re so lucky. Now 
                        look into the camera and smile.

           Max looks into the camera and attempts a smile.

                                 MAX
                        No.

           A FLASH GOES OFF.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. WHEELER HOME - DEN - MORNING

           The TV FLASHES across Max’s face, as he flips through 
           channels. He’s fixated. Overwhelmed by the hundreds of 
           choices. 

                                 TOMMY
                             (O.S.)
                        Come on.

           Max lands on some early morning cartoons and turns back to 
           Tommy on the floor of the den, where the two are playing 
           JENGA. Both are in pajamas. 
           Tommy takes a piece out. The puzzle wobbles.

                                 MAX
                        You have to be more confident. If 
                        you want one, you can't move 
                        another. Or it will all fall.

           DARLENE walks in, in a bathrobe, spots the TV, doesn't hear 
           Max and Tommy on the ground. She moves closer to the TV, then 
           sees Max. She jumps a little.

                                 DARLENE
                        You scared me.

                                 MAX
                        Morning.

                                 DARLENE
                        I was thinking after breakfast, we 
                        could take a trip to the 
                        supermarket. Get some fresh air?

           Max stares then smiles.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. That would - I’d like that.

           Darlene smiles and heads into the kitchen.

           Tommy moves toward a piece, hand shaking, and is about to 
           grab it when Max grabs Tommy's wrist, HARD.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What did I say? Don’t touch another.

                                 TOMMY
                        You're hurting me.

           Max pauses a beat, then lets go, apologetically.

           INT. DARLENE'S CAR - ONE HOUR LATER

           Darlene and Max are in the car as it pulls through a hoard of 
           PRESS TRUCKS and WELL-WISHERS stationed at the ENTRANCE TO 
           THEIR GATED COMMUNITY. Max ducks his head.

           INT. DARLENE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           They drive through a more secluded area, woods on either 
           side.
                                 DARLENE
                        Remember you used to love coming 
                        here with Mike and Scotty? Make 
                        forts and all the rest.

           Max stares out the window, mesmerized.

           EXT. FOOD EMPORIUM SUPERMARKET - LATER

           Darlene and Max sit in the car, in the parking lot of The 
           Food Emporium. There is silence between them.

           EXT. FOOD EMPORIUM SUPERMARKET - SECONDS LATER

           Darlene and Max walk toward to entrance. A DOG BARKS in the 
           distance. Max jumps, gets closer to Darlene. She rubs his 
           shoulder.

           Max then notices a LITTLE BOY (6) playing on one of the coin-
           operated rides outside. The LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER (35) pays no 
           attention to the boy, yapping away on her cell phone.

           Max locks eyes with the LITTLE BOY, then turns away, looks at 
           Darlene. Smiles.

           INT. FOOD EMPORIUM SUPERMARKET - CONTINUOUS

           Darlene and Max wheel the cart in silence. Soon, the shoppers 
           around them begin to nod, smile, stare.

           Max tightens his grip on the cart as Darlene wheels. He 
           becomes uneasy.

                                 DARLENE
                        Only $3.99 for blueberries. Well 
                        that's a steal.

                                 MAX
                        How can you tell?

                                 DARLENE
                        They’re usually over 5.

                                 MAX
                        No. I mean, if they're safe to eat?

           Darlene looks at him puzzled.

                                 DARLENE
                        They’re safe sweetheart. All of the 
                        food here is safe.
           Max notices the LITTLE BOY, walking quickly down an aisle. 
           Shoppers surround him, walking close to him, arms dangling, 
           swiping the boy at points. Max grows concerned.

           They start walking down the FRUIT AISLE, as Darlene points 
           out the different foods to him.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        The fruit section. You remember? 
                        Apples, tangerines, kiwis, papaya, 
                        grapefruit, oranges, limes -  

                                 MAX
                        Mom, I know.

                                 DARLENE
                        Of course you do.

           Max looks to follow the LITTLE BOY, but soon becomes 
           overwhelmed himself by the frequency of the other shoppers.

           Max and Darlene continue down the aisle, when Max spots the 
           LITTLE BOY again, walking down AISLE 3. A SUPERMARKET 
           EMPLOYEE follows the boy closely. Max grows worried. He tries 
           to shake the impulse to follow them. He does, for a second, 
           but then looks back. Impulsively.

                                 MAX
                        I think I’d like to pick out a 
                        cereal, if that’s OK?

           Darlene smiles.

                                 DARLENE
                        Of course, sweetheart.

           She turns the cart toward AISLE 6.

                                 MAX
                        Maybe I can go alone?

                                 DARLENE
                             (apprehensive)
                        Sure, sweetheart. Of course. You 
                        know what - you pick up a cereal, 
                        and meet me by the Deli.

           Max disappears. She watches him, nervous, but proud, hopeful.

           AISLE 3. Max walks down the aisle, after the LITTLE BOY. The 
           stares of onlookers and the presence of strangers debilitates 
           him. He spots the LITTLE BOY moving past the DELI COUNTER.
           AISLE 5. Max anxiously FOLLOWS the LITTLE BOY down another 
           aisle, the SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE now hot on the LITTLE BOY’S 
           TRAIL. 

           AISLE 6. Max nervously maneuvers around carts and old women 
           and babies. Now it seems the SUPERMARKET EMPLOYEE won’t leave 
           the Little Boy alone. He has his hand on the boy’s shoulder 
           and shows him where the cereals are. Max panics, chases them.

           Max catches up to the Little Boy and the Supermarket 
           Employee. They’re alone. The Supermarket Employee goes to 
           pull a cereal from the top shelf for the Little Boy.

           As Darlene turns the corner, she sees Max grab the Little 
           Boy’s hand and drag him quickly down the other end of the 
           aisle, away from the Supermarket Employee. She stops. Frozen. 

           The Supermarket Employee stares after them, confused. As Max 
           reaches the end of the aisle, pulling the frightened boy 
           along, they BUMP INTO the LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER.

                                 LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 MAX
                        I was just - 

                                 LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER
                        What the fuck do you think you’re 
                        doing?

           Darlene watches in shock as the woman yells at Max. The 
           Little Boy pulls away from Max and hugs his mother’s leg. 

           Darlene snaps out of it, leaves the cart and rushes over.

                                 DARLENE
                        Excuse me!

           The woman spins around.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        That’s my son!

                                 LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER
                        He took my son’s hand. He had my 
                        son’s hand.

                                 MAX
                        I’m so sorry, I thought he was lost 
                        and the man  - 

                                 LITTLE BOY’S MOTHER
                        What man?
                                 DARLENE
                        I’m very sorry. He didn’t mean to.

           Darlene grabs Max and pulls him away, as the Little Boy’s 
           Mother yells after them.

           Max tries to grab their cart as they pass it.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Just leave it.

           Darlene is silent, in shock, as they head toward the exit.

           INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - LATER

           Darlene is lying down in bed, with a WARM COMPRESS on her 
           forehead, COVERING HER EYES. Frank walks in quietly, he lies 
           next to her. 

                                 FRANK
                        Just a headache?

                                 DARLENE
                        Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        Are you sure?

                                 DARLENE
                        Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        Good.

           Darlene smiles as if at an illusion.

                                 DARLENE
                        Remember when we’d see other 
                        children. The ones that looked like 
                        him. In a car on the highway, or, 
                        Home Depot that one time.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah.

                                 DARLENE
                        They said that would be the 
                        hardest.(beat) But it was nice, 
                        wasn’t it? Made me feel good. 
                        Because we knew it was never him. 
                        Not really anyway.

           Darlene and Frank lie in silence for a moment.
                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        I saw someone like that today.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s been a tough few days.

                                 DARLENE
                        Frank, please hear me -

                                 FRANK
                        But you’re doing it. And he’s good. 
                        And he’s right. And he’s here.

                                 DARLENE
                        I didn’t want to see it. But I know 
                        what I saw.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s something, isn’t it? He’s just 
                        like if we made him.

                                 DARLENE
                        Please just listen to me.

                                 FRANK
                             (all smiles)
                        But I heard you, sweetheart.

           Silence.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re right. It’s just a 
                        headache. I’ll re-heat the compress.

           Frank pulls his hand away from Darlene's. He pulls the 
           COMPRESS off of Darlene’s face, and gets up without looking 
           at her face.

           If he had, he’d have discovered TEARS streaming down it.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - DINNER - LATER

           There is a loud silence as the family eats dinner.

           Darlene gives Max three-quarters of “real dinner” with a 
           quarter of the plate reserved for canned peaches.

           Max eats the real dinner first. He looks to Darlene for 
           approval. Darlene struggles with all her energy, then smiles.

           Max smiles, it's an act. He struggles. He looks at Tommy and 
           the smile drops a bit, as he becomes fixated, remorseful.
           INT. WHEELER HOME - DEN - LATER

           Max and Tommy are playing Nintendo Wii. Max is mesmerized by 
           the world on the screen. One no longer has to pretend.

                                 TOMMY
                             (re: the video game)
                        Come on, kill him!

           He looks at Tommy remorsefully. A beat.

                                 MAX
                        I don't think this is working.

                                 TOMMY
                        You can have my controller, it's 
                        easier to use. (back to the game) 
                        Oh! Get the guy on the right!

                                 MAX
                        No, I mean - 

                                 TOMMY
                        NO!!!

           Game over. Max and Tommy lost this round.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        The Orcs come fast, so I need you. 
                        OK? Cover me.

           Max is arrested by this. A moment of realization. Max nods.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Ok. I'm gonna press start.
                             (re: the controller)
                        Do you want to try with this one? 
                        Here. Take it.

           As Max reaches for the controller, he grabs Tommy's HAND just 
           for a moment. He’s transfixed, determined. He smiles.

           He inches closer to Tommy. They play as "Til There Was You" 
           from "The Music Man" starts to play and continues, as we...

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Detective Morrison sits among cuckoo clocks and Judaic 
           tchotchkes in her mother’s kitchen, as MORRISON’S MOTHER - 
           RUTH - (82) brings two bowls of CHICKEN SOUP to the table.
           They start slurping the soup.

                                 RUTH
                        You eating OK?

                                 MORRISON
                        Yeah.

                                 RUTH
                        Why aren't you wearing the sweater?

                                 MORRISON
                        It's July, Ma.

                                 RUTH
                        And so they blast the air-
                        conditioning everywhere you go. Do 
                        me a favor - wear the sweater OK? 
                        So I could sleep at night.

                                 MORRISON
                        Sure.

                                 RUTH
                        So any dates recently? Anyone I 
                        should know about?

                                 MORRISON
                        You know I’ve been busy, Ma -

                                 RUTH
                        We're all busy.

                                 MORRISON
                        Yeah? What are you so busy with? 
                        Canasta? Shul?

           Morrison stops herself, ashamed.

                                 RUTH
                        Worrying and praying. For you. 
                        That's enough to fill a lot of my 
                        days. (beat) I do wish you'd go out 
                        with Deborah’s son. He saw you on 
                        the TV. Said you were very pretty.

                                 MORRISON
                        Where, at Bobby’s press conference? 
                        He thought I was pretty? Don’t you 
                        find that a little creepy, Ma.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s charming. That he noticed you, 
                        among all the meshuganah goings on. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTH (CONT'D)
                        You need to get out, to get your 
                        mind off all this.

                                 MORRISON
                        A little boy is missing. And every 
                        day we don’t find him, our chances 
                        of even recovering a decomposed 
                        body drop fifty percent. (beat, 
                        sarcastic) So what night did 
                        Deborah’s son say he’s free?

           Ruth looks at her daughter, stunned.

                                 RUTH
                        Well I have a child too. And I just 
                        want the best for her. So tell me -  
                        why doesn’t she deserve that? I 
                        mean what is so wrong with her? 

                                 MORRISON
                        We’re close, Ma. We’re gonna bring 
                        him home.

                                 RUTH
                        And then what, Hildy? (beat) He’s 
                        not yours. They never are. 

                                 MORRISON
                        I gotta get back.

                                 RUTH
                        Honey, you may not be ten years 
                        old. You may not be cute and 
                        innocent and get air time. But your 
                        life matters. And you, too, are so 
                        very lost.

                                 MORRISON
                        I'm just trying to save a child.

                                 RUTH
                        So am I. (beat) So find my 
                        daughter. Bring her home.

           INT. MORRISON’S CAR - LATER

           Morrison is driving on a busy road, passing strip malls and 
           chain restaurants, when she spots a LITTLE BOY in a RED CAP 
           and LIGHT’EM’UP SNEAKERS struggling as he’s pulled into a 
           CHUCK-E-CHEESE by a tall man whose face we cannot see.

           Morrison turns the car around and grabs the police radio.
                                 MORRISON
                             (on the radio)
                        Yeah, it’s Morrison. I got a 
                        possible spotting. 10-19. Right off 
                        Northern, near Old Country Road. 
                        Chuck-E-Cheese. I’m not waiting for 
                        backup.

           EXT. CHUCK-E-CHEESE - MINUTES LATER

           Detective Morrison approaches the front entrance.

           INT. CHUCK-E-CHEESE - SECONDS LATER

           Morrison enters slowly, takes a look around - skee-ball, 
           arcade games, a pizza party in the far corner. She walks 
           around slowly, scanning for BOBBY and the CAPTOR. 

           Morrison continues deeper inside. Passing vending machines, 
           animatronic puppets, children and parents.

           Then - by the back corner, she spots the YOUNG BOY with a RED 
           HAT and the TALL MAN. Their backs are turned to Morrison. The 
           YOUNG BOY looks uncomfortable holding a cup of tokens.

           Morrison follows closely, as the YOUNG BOY moves to the POP-A-
           SHOT. He inserts two tokens and grabs a basketball, as the 
           TALL MAN gets more change from a machine just a few feet 
           away.

           Morrison, shaking, rushes toward the YOUNG BOY, pushing 
           patrons aside. She grabs the YOUNG BOY from behind, pulling 
           him in close to her. She then removes her pistol from its 
           holster and aims it at the TALL MAN.

                                 MORRISON
                        Don’t fucking move! Don’t you 
                        fucking move! Put your hands behind 
                        your head, where I can see them.

           The TALL MAN does so. The YOUNG BOY starts to cry and scream 
           as he tries to escape her grip. Morrison holds him tight. 

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Turn around!

           The TALL MAN turns around slowly. She sees his face. It’s not 
           the Captor.

           She drops her arm with the gun and turns to look at the Young 
           Boy. It’s not Bobby.
                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Dad!!!!

           The Young Boy, crying, runs into the Tall Man’s arms. They 
           watch Morrison, shaken, as she slowly drops to the floor.

           INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           A CAR ENGINE PUTTERS outside as it TRIES TO START.

           It wakes Max who FREEZES IN HIS BED. HE CAN'T MOVE AN INCH. 
           He slowly gets out of bed and looks out his window, when the 
           LIGHTS from the CAR TURN OFF and the ENGINE REVS as the car 
           pulls away.

           Max shakes as he tries to fall back asleep. He can't. He gets 
           up and looks out the window. Worried. He rushes out the door.

           INT. TOMMY'S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Max stands over a sleeping TOMMY, relieved. He's safe.

                                 MAX
                             (whispering)
                        You up?

           Max shakes him gently. Then a little harder.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (whispering, louder)
                        You up?

           Tommy opens his eyes and looks at Max.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON Max sitting in a dark room. He smiles.

                                 MAX
                             (whispering)
                        You can't tell anyone about this. 
                        We could get in really big trouble.

           CLOSE ON Tommy. He nods and smiles. Then takes a spoonful of 
           ICE CREAM to his mouth.

           PAN OUT to Max and Tommy, eating ice-cream at the kitchen 
           table.

           They sit in silence. Smiling as they eat together. Max nods 
           to the WHIPPED CREAM, as if to ask Tommy if he wants more.
                                 TOMMY
                             (bashful)
                        I don't want to -

                                 MAX
                        Just do it.

                                 DARLENE
                             (O.S.)
                        What's going on?

           Max and Tommy spin around, spooked. DARLENE is standing 
           there, eyes squinting from the light, in her robe.

                                 MAX
                             (calmly)
                        It's OK.

                                 DARLENE
                        Why are you not in bed?

                                 MAX
                        We couldn't sleep.

                                 DARLENE
                             (to Tommy)
                        Bedtime.

                                 MAX
                        We'll finish up. Just go back to 
                        sleep, we didn't mean to wake you.

           Tommy doesn't move. He looks at Max.

                                 DARLENE
                        Max, honey, Tommy needs to go to 
                        bed. And so do you.

                                 MAX
                        But he wants to eat ice cream.

                                 DARLENE
                        But I decide the rules here. And 
                        you both need to go to sleep.

           Darlene grabs Tommy's arm.

           Max jumps up, grabs her arm, holding it.

                                 MAX
                             (calmly)
                        Please don't grab him. If you just 
                        ask him, he'll do what you want.
           Darlene is shaken by Max. Tommy thinks this is all fun.

                                 DARLENE
                        You can’t be doing this here, 
                        sweetheart. Now finish your ice 
                        cream and get back to bed.

           Darlene walks out with Tommy in her arms. Max sits down and 
           finishes his ice cream, as we - 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           Max paces around the basement, his body and face covered in 
           welts and bruises. He begins rehearsing, trying to approach 
           imaginary children.

                                 MAX
                             (rehearsing)
                        Hi...Hi...Hello, hi...Do you - are 
                        you...What’s your name? Hi, what’s

                        someone?...Hey, what’s up, do you 
                        need a ride? Well do you?

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. WHEELER HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - NEXT MORNING

           The doorbell rings, just as Max walks by door. THREE FIGURES 
           ARE OUT FRONT. He retreats into the living room.

                                 DARLENE
                             (O.S.)
                        Just a second! Frank!

                                 TOMMY
                             (O.S.)
                        Dad's at Bagel Hut.

           The doorbell rings again. Tommy runs to the door, with 
           Darlene close behind him.
                                 DARLENE
                        Just a minute!

           Tommy opens the door with Darlene behind him. LISA BROCKTON 
           (45) is standing with a tin-foiled meatloaf in her hand. Next 
           to her are her TWIN BOYS, SCOTT (20) and MIKE (20).

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                             (warmly, almost as if 
                              seeking refuge)
                        Ohhhh.

           Darlene hugs Lisa close. Tommy is excited to see the TWINS.

                           MIKE
                                                          SCOTT
           Little man!
                                              Hey dude.

                                 LISA
                        They wanted - we all wanted - to 
                        see if he was home? If he’s ready.

           Max watches from the LIVING ROOM, slowly creeping toward them 
           landing behind Darlene, invisible to her, but not the others.

                                 DARLENE
                             (hesitant)
                        Of course - MAX! MAX! Can you -

           Darlene turns around to see Max standing there. She jumps.

           The visitors don't know how to break the ice. Then-

                                 LISA
                        Hi, Max, it's Lisa - Lisa Brockton.

           Max stares for a moment.

                                 MAX
                        I know.

           He then goes up to Lisa, giving her an awkward hug.

                           SCOTT
                                                          MIKE
           Hey, Maxxie.
                                              What's up Max?

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (smiles)
                        Hi.

                                 DARLENE
                        Why don't you guys get some fresh 
                        air? (beat, re: the front door) But 
                        it’s this way to the backyard if 
                        those sneakers aren't coming off.
           Mike and Scott laugh as Max leads them outside.

           EXT. WHEELER BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Max, Scott, and Mike are playing basketball, a game of UTAH. 
           A RINGING OF CICADAS overpowers the silence.

           Max studies Mike and Scott - what could have been.

                                 MIKE
                             (breaking the ice)
                        You know, they made this made-for-
                        TV movie about you. And these two 
                        actors played me and Scotty, but 
                        the dude who played Scotty was some 
                        ugly fuck. It was hilarious.

                                 SCOTTY
                        We're identical twins, dipshit.

                                 MIKE
                        So?

                                 SCOTTY
                        So, so were the actors.

           Max forces a shy smile, then laughs. Scotty and Mike laugh.

                                 MIKE
                        So what was it like? To be missing 
                        all that time.

                                 SCOTT
                        Mike -

                                 MIKE
                        I feel like it must be like some 
                        weird sci-fi movie, like Planet of 
                        the Apes, the end, you know? Where 
                        you come home and everyone is a 
                        talking monkey.

                                 MAX
                        I don't know. I mean, you're never 
                        really missing if you're the party 
                        concerned. To me, I guess I was 
                        always found.

                                                               CUT TO:
           INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           LISA and DARLENE sit at the kitchen table drinking tea.

                                 LISA
                        You sleeping OK?

                                 DARLENE
                        Yeah.

                                 LISA
                        Eating OK?

                                 DARLENE
                        Yeah, yeah.

                                 LISA
                        Well make sure you have this 
                        tonight, don't even need to heat it 
                        or nothing. My special meatloaf.

                                 DARLENE
                        Did Yolanda make it?

                                 LISA
                        Yeah. My special meatloaf.

           They share a laugh.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        You know, the news people? They're 
                        starting to call me.

                                 DARLENE
                        God, I’m sorry, we disconnected all 
                        the phones -

                                 LISA
                        No, don't be sorry. Are you 
                        kidding? But Darlene, you should be 
                        getting out there, don't you think? 
                        Telling people -

                                 DARLENE
                        I'm not looking to be a cause or 
                        anything.

                                 LISA
                        But you are. You already are.

                                 DARLENE
                        It makes for a nice story. But it's 
                        not true. It's not him, Lis.
           A long beat. Darlene looks to her for something. For what? 
           Darlene puts her hands over Lisa's. Cradles them.

                                 LISA
                        Honey -

                                 DARLENE
                        I like where I am now. I've come a 
                        long way, remember? I mean, I'm in 
                        the P.T.A., and I run the bake sales, 
                        and Tommy's such a sweet kid. All the 
                        mothers know me...and they trust me, 
                        for play-dates, for school trips. 
                        Everybody says hi to me. Not because 
                        they have to now, but because...I've 
                        come a long way.

           Darlene pauses. Then -

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        When it first happened, I started 
                        growing him up with me, you know? 
                        What would he be now? How tall? How 
                        handsome? And for a while it made 
                        me feel better. It made me feel 
                        like things were alright. But one 
                        day I started thinking that if they 
                        found the body, I'd be grieving for 
                        two boys. Then and now. And so one 
                        morning I woke up and I decided to 
                        accept that he was gone. Dead. 
                        Lying in the dirt somewhere, in the 
                        ground. But that he was happy. That 
                        he didn't suffer. That there wasn't 
                        any pain.

           Darlene is holding back tears.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        So why am I still grieving for two 
                        boys? 

                                 LISA
                        Honey, he’s right outside.

           Darlene shrugs, shakes her head, smiles.

                                 DARLENE
                        You have to understand - I don’t 
                        want him gone. But he isn’t back. 
                        Not yet.
           EXT. WHEELER BACKYARD - SECONDS LATER

                                 SCOTT
                             (to Max)
                        ...We've been dating for like a 
                        year. She's pretty hot, I guess.

           Max nods shyly, unprepared for this kind of talk.

                                 MIKE
                             (to Max)
                        Where's Tommy at?

           A beat.

                                 MAX
                        What? How do you know Tommy?

                                 MIKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 SCOTT
                        Your little bro's the man. He’s 
                        hilarious.

                                 MAX
                        You spend time with him?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. Well now, just when we're 
                        back from school. Basketball. Video 
                        games. Shit like that.

                                 MAX
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        I don't know, it makes him happy 
                        when we play with him.

                                 MAX
                        When you play with him.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 SCOTT
                        Maxxie, you OK?

                                 MAX
                        You think you're so fucking smart. 
                        You need to stay away from him. OK? 
                        I'm here now.
                                 MIKE
                        What happened to you, bro?

                                 SCOTT
                        Max -

                                 MAX
                        No, I know what you do. Why do you 
                        play him, Mike? Why would you do 
                        that?

                                 MIKE
                        What? Because he likes it.

           Max PEGS the BASKETBALL INTO MIKE’S FACE, HARD, breaking his 
           nose. Mike starts screaming, blood now pouring down his face. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck!?

           Scott panics as he sees the blood. He darts toward the door, 
           as Darlene and Lisa run outside. Lisa screams at the sight. 
           Darlene is frozen in shock.

           Just then, Frank wanders into the back with Tommy and a bag 
           of bagels, dropping them. He takes in the scene and runs over 
           to Mike.

                                 LISA
                             (to Mike)
                        What the fuck did you do? What did 
                        you say to him?

           Frank holds Mike’s head back, trying to stop the bleeding.

           Max appears dazed. He's fixated on Tommy, who is scared by 
           the whole incident.

                                 LISA (CONT’D)
                        I am so sorry, Frank.

           Lisa, Mike, and Scott rush toward the front of the house.

           Darlene is crushed, motionless, defeated.

           Max runs into the house quickly.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Max bursts through the door. Darlene follows close behind, as 
           Frank follows after them, carrying Tommy, who’s now crying.
                                 FRANK
                             (to Max)
                        What the hell happened?

                                 MAX
                        How could you let that happen?

                                 FRANK
                        What? What are you talking about?

                          DARLENE
                                                          MAX
           Frank - 
                                              Let them around Tommy like 
                                              that. Don’t you even realize - 

                                 DARLENE
                             (to Max)
                        You’re creating these things, 
                        sweetheart. This isn’t you.

           Tommy is now bawling in the corner. His cries grow louder.

                                 FRANK
                        Darlene - 

                                 MAX
                        You need to re-think everything 
                        you’re doing. All the rules. He 
                        should be inside. I mean, how else 
                        are you gonna watch him? 

           Tommy cries out, louder.

                                 DARLENE
                        Frank, take Tommy upstairs!

                                 FRANK
                        He’s not safe with this behavior, 
                        Max, do you see that - 

                                 MAX
                        This behavior’s the only thing 
                        that’s keeping him safe.

                                 DARLENE
                        Frank, take him up! Max, sit down!

                                 MAX
                        You’re not watching. You’re not. 
                        You’re not listening!

                                 DARLENE
                        We are sweetheart. We are. And we 
                        know how to take care of him.
                                 MAX
                        Oh you do? Cause you did such a 
                        good job with me.

           Darlene slaps Max across the face. Everyone stops. Tommy 
           begins to bawl.

                                 DARLENE
                        Frank - take him upstairs!

           Frank gathers Tommy in his arms and takes him up.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Sit down. I’m the mother. I make 
                        the rules here. Sit down.

           Max sits at the kitchen table. Darlene stands over him, manic 
           almost.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember when you were two 
                        and the dog bit you. And there was 
                        blood everywhere and you were so 
                        scared.

                                 MAX
                        No.

           THERE’S A LOUD KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                             (O.S.)
                        Mr. Wheeler?

                                 DARLENE
                        Well you were. Say you remember.

                                 MAX
                        I remember.

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                             (O.S.)
                        Mr. Wheeler? Please open the door.

           MORE LOUD BANGING.

                                 DARLENE
                        That’s right. And what about when I 
                        took you swimming for the first 
                        time at Parkwood. And that little 
                        boy was found at the bottom of the 
                        pool. And for the smallest second I 
                        thought it was you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DARLENE (CONT'D)
                        And I wouldn’t stop hugging you for 
                        the whole car ride home. Do you 
                        remember that?

           MORE KNOCKING.

                                 MAX
                        I remember that.

                                 DARLENE
                        And remember when I used to lie 
                        with you when you were sick. And 
                        you would say no, Mommy, you’re 
                        gonna get sick too. And I said a 
                        mom can’t get sick from her child. 

           Max grows emotional, he does remember.

           MORE KNOCKING.

                                 FRANK
                             (O.S.)
                        Darlene, the door!

                                 MAX
                        Please stop.

                                 DARLENE
                        That’s real. Not what he did. Not 
                        any of that...Remember when I would 
                        rub your back? Remember when I 
                        would hold you close? Remember when 
                        you would lie on my chest, just 
                        right, and hear me breathe, in and 
                        out, and ask how my heart knows to 
                        beat.(beat) The rest isn’t real. 
                        Look at me. The rest isn’t real.

           Darlene cries.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Remember who loves you?

           Max can’t speak, he becomes overwhelmed.

           THE KNOCKING grows louder.

                                 FRANK
                             (O.S.)
                        For fuck’s sake, get the door!

                                 DARLENE
                        Who loves you?
           KNOCK! KNOCK! Frank is heard running down the stairs.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Say it.

           THE FRONT DOOR is finally opened. Murmuring in the foyer can 
           be heard.

                                 DARLENE (CONT’D)
                        Who loves you? Say it. Who?

           Just as Max tries to say something, Frank and TWO OFFICERS 
           walk in. Darlene is sitting on the kitchen table, crying.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s him. (beat) They found him.

           Max stands, stares at Frank, then at Darlene.

           We CUT TO BLACK as we hear the V.O. Of a news report:

                        Max Wheeler ten years prior has 
                        been found dead. Details are still 
                        unconfirmed, but it appears that 
                        Carter’s body was discovered early 
                        this morning in the backyard of his 
                        former middle school teacher... 

           EXT. SUBURBAN MANSION - BACKYARD - DAY

           Morrison peers over The Captor’s dead body, laying in a bush 
           of begonias as the sprinklers, on a timer, hit the body every 
           thirty seconds. A self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head is 
           visible.

           OFFICER HAYES (early 30s) covers his nose and mouth with his 
           shirt, standing beside Morrison.

                                 MORRISON
                        I imagined him differently. 
                        More...something.

                                 OFFICER HAYES
                        She’s ready for you inside.
           INT. SUBURBAN MANSION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Detective Morrison sits on a plastic covered couch. The 
           living room is beautifully decorated - tchotchkes, paintings, 
           plates, etc.

           MRS. SCHWADRON (95) sits across from Morrison. A senile 
           silence.

           Her aide, JUANA (50), walks in, a teapot and saucer in hand. 
           She hands it to Morrison.

                                 MORRISON
                        Thanks.

                                 JUANA
                             (Guatemalan accent)
                        Oh yes. Yes.

                                 MRS. SCHWADRON
                             (loudly)
                        What'd you say?

           As Juana and Morrison begin their conversation, Mrs. 
           Schwadron begins a story, CONCURRENTLY. Oblivious to the 
           conversation going on around her.

                                                        MORRISON
                  MRS. SCHWADRON (CONT’D)
           I was at the store last week. 
           On Old Country Road. 
                                              Miss Zacapa, when did you 
                                              spot the body?

                                                          JUANA
                  MRS. SCHWADRON (CONT’D)
           Used to be the Anne Taylor. I 
           went in with Shirley and we 
           were looking around for 
           different things.
                                              Oh. 10. 10 AM. Because I 
                                              know, because I bringing in 
                                              groceries for Miss Evie and I 
                                              see something in backyard.

                  MRS. SCHWADRON (CONT’D)
                                                        MORRISON
           We didn't really need 
           anything, but it was close to 
           Shirley and we thought why 
           not?
                                              And you are positive you 
                                              didn’t see a child anywhere 
                                              nearby? In the street before 
                                              you parked? In the bushes?

                                                          JUANA
                                              No. No child.
                  MRS. SCHWADRON (CONT’D)
           I found a pair of pants. They 
           were $20 but they said they 
           were on sale.

                  MRS. SCHWADRON (CONT’D)
           So I asked the girl for the 
           discount and they said that 
           the discount was already 
           listed.
                                                        MORRISON
                                              This man was a former student 
                                              of Mrs. Schwadron’s. Thirty 
                                              years ago. Do you know if she 
                                              ever had contact with him? 
                                              Did you ever see him around?
                      MRS. SCHWADRON
                                                          JUANA
           The sale was $20. There 
           wasn’t more of a sale.
                                              No. No. Many the former 
                                              student come because they 
                                              love Miss Evie, especially 
                                              when she lose memory. They 
                                              say she always inspire to do 
                                              great thing. One man come is 
                                              doctor. But no, no him.

                  MRS. SCHWADRON (CONT’D)
           And so I didn't get it.
                                                        MORRISON
                                              Did Mrs. Schwadron happen to 
                                              hear the gunshot?

                                                          JUANA
                                              No. She no hear good.
                      MRS. SCHWADRON
           But you know what? I should 
           have gotten the blouse. It 
           was only $20.

           Mrs. Schwadron puts her finger in her mouth. Chews on it.

                                 JUANA
                        I pray for child. To St. Nicholas.

           Juana shows Morrison a charm bracelet with a St. Nicholas 
           charm.

                                 JUANA (CONT’D)
                        And I pray for man. To St. Nicholas 
                        also. Saint for child and thief.

           Morrison smiles blankly.

                                 JUANA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I find this next to body of 
                        man.

           Juana hands Morrison a CHILD'S PAINTING. It's a WATERCOLOR of 
           two parents, a boy, and a dog. It has "BW" initialed on the 
           bottom right corner.

                                 MORRISON
                        You found this?

                                 JUANA
                        Yes.

                                 MORRISON
                        Next to the body?

                                 JUANA
                        Yes.

                                 MORRISON
                        You removed evidence?
                                 JUANA
                        Yes. I didn’t want picture ruin.

                                 MORRISON
                        Why would the picture get ruined?

                                 JUANA
                        (She imitates the sprinkler noise) 
                        10:30.

                                 MORRISON
                        Why didn’t you just put the 
                        sprinkler on later?

                                 JUANA
                        I no control. (She imitates the 
                        sprinkler noise again) always 
                        10:30. Time no choose sprinkler. 
                        Sprinkler choose time.

           Juana looks at the drawing. Then at Morrison.

                                 JUANA (CONT’D)
                             (re: the drawing)
                        You look like the woman.

           Morrison looks at Juana, ever gratefully. 

           INT. MAX’S BATHROOM - LATER THAT DAY

           Max showers as “I’M GONNA WASH THAT MAN RIGHT OUT OF MY HAIR” 
           by Peggy Lee blares.

           He gets some shampoo in his eyes. It burns. He washes it out.

           He shuts the water off, and opens the curtains as we...

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - BATHROOM - THE RECENT PAST

           Max opens the makeshift shower curtain of a makeshift shower. 
           It’s just a garden hose attached to the wall.

           The CAPTOR stands outside the shower, watching. Max grabs a 
           towel and dries off.

                                 CAPTOR
                        How’s the pressure?
           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Max sits in a wooden chair, with an apron draped around his 
           neck, as the Captor cuts the young man’s hair. Max reads 
           “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.”

           A LOUD RUMBLING is heard upstairs. Max looks up, frightened.

           More noises. Bangs. They sound like footsteps.

                                 MAX
                        What is that?

           The Captor hesitates. He notices Max’s book.

                                 CAPTOR
                        The clanging. Of the submarine. 
                        We’re dropping quickly.

           Max pauses, then smiles.

                                 MAX
                        I guess that makes me Pierre.

                                 CAPTOR
                        And what does that make me?

                                 MAX
                        Captain Nemo.

                                 CAPTOR
                        What do you see?

                                 MAX
                        Water. All around.

                                 CAPTOR
                        That’s it?

                                 MAX
                        It’s enough.

           There’s a loud MOAN-LIKE NOISE from upstairs. Perhaps a chair 
           being dragged across the floor. Max jumps again.

                                 CAPTOR
                        I think I was wrong. This isn’t a 
                        submarine. It’s a whale.

           Max smiles again, relaxes.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        And you’re not Pierre. You’re 
                        Jonah.
                                 MAX
                        But what does that make you?

           The Captor smiles. He finishes cutting and wipes the hair off 
           of Max’s shoulders.

                                 CAPTOR
                        God. I guess.

           A beat.

                                 MAX
                        What is it really?

                                 CAPTOR
                        They’re delivering a bed. For him.

           Max’s smile fades.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max is brushing his teeth, trying to smile in the mirror. He 
           drops it. Smiles again. Then drops it. Smiles again.

           Max stops brushing for a moment. He takes his hand and covers 
           his eyes with his hand, as if in prayer.

                                 MAX
                        He was somebody. He was. Amen.

           Max opens his eyes and begins brushing again, staring in the 
           mirror again. Resuming the routine.

           He struggles to smile. Holds back tears. He then stares at 
           the mirror, turns on the sink and spits out.

           EXT. WHEELER BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Max sits in one of the lawn chairs. The BIRDS are CHIRPING 
           LOUDLY. Frank comes out. Two beers in hand.

                                 FRANK
                        For you.

           Max jumps at Frank's voice. Frank hands Max the beer and sits 
           next to him. Max takes it, smells it, takes a sip.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Cheers.
           Max takes the beer and clinks Frank's beer. They sit. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        This is nice, isn't it?

           Frank takes a swig. Max notices the BASKETBALL with MIKE's 
           BLOOD, still on the patio from the day before. The CHIRPING 
           is still loud.

                                 MAX
                        What kind of birds are they?

                                 FRANK
                        Crows. Lots of crows.

           A beat.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You doing OK?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. I'm fine.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. (beat) Don't mind your 
                        mother. It's just been a tough few 
                        days for her. Nothing to do with 
                        you.

                                 MAX
                        I am the past few days. It has 
                        everything to do with me.

           FRANK becomes emotional.

                                 FRANK
                        You were always such a sweet kid. 
                        I'd come home from work and all you 
                        wanted was a hug. Or to show me how 
                        you made some three-pointer during 
                        recess. And you'd stay out there 
                        for hours until you made it again. 
                        Just to prove it. As if I wouldn't 
                        believe you. Remember that? (beat) 
                        Remember when I used to make 
                        pancakes on Sundays. With the M&Ms 
                        in 'em.

           Max nods his head.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        And I used to pin you down, 
                        remember? And do the tickle thing 
                        with the bird?
           Frank acts this out.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. Why'd you do that?

           Frank shrugs.

                                 FRANK
                        I'd get this image of us sometimes, 
                        out in a parking lot somewhere, and 
                        we're just playing catch. Not even 
                        saying nothing. We just throw - 
                        back and forth - like the waves or 
                        something. Just like we used to.

                                 MAX
                        Dad?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah?

                                 MAX
                        We never used to play catch.

                                 FRANK
                        Didn't we? (beat, more emotional) You 
                        know you dream about something for so 
                        long, after a while it's hard to say 
                        whether you're dreaming about the 
                        thing or the dream itself.

           Frank takes a swig.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        After a while, you start to hedge 
                        your prayers. You bargain, you 
                        know? 'I don't need to hear his 
                        voice again if I can just see his 
                        face.' Impossible things like that. 
                        And at the end of it, the one thing 
                        that was off the table...The last 
                        holdout... I just wanted to hold 
                        you one last time. Feel the weight 
                        of you in my arms. Untouched. Here. 
                        Didn't even walk away with that.

           Frank cries, Max tries to comfort him.

                                 MAX
                        I'm here now.

           Frank drinks his beer silently.
                                 FRANK
                             (re: the Captor)
                        Did you love him?

                                 MAX
                        No. (beat) But I understood him.

           Frank takes a swig.

                                 FRANK
                        You know I could still make you 
                        those pancakes. I could still pin 
                        you down and do that thing. We 
                        could still play catch, any day, 
                        you name a day, you know?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.

           They sit, trying to watch the calls of the birds, if it were 
           only possible.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe another day.

                                 MAX
                        Maybe. But this is nice, isn't it?

           The last holdout. And it's all okay.

           Until the birds chirp again. And Max shudders.

           EXT. WHEELER FRONT YARD - DUSK

           Tommy and Max collect fireflies in glass jars. Tommy swings 
           after them, but continues to miss them.

                                 MAX
                        If you wait until you see them, 
                        you'll never catch 'em. You have to 
                        go where it's darkest and be 
                        patient. They'll come to you.

           Tommy does so. He waits. Then catches one, just as MORRISON's 
           car pulls up. She parks the car and walks over to Max.

                                 MORRISON
                        You doing OK?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.
                                 MORRISON
                        I should’ve been the one to tell 
                        you. I know it’s all confusing and 
                        scary.

                                 MAX
                        I’m not confused. And I’m not 
                        scared.

                                 MORRISON
                        Well I told you we’d find him. I 
                        promised you, didn’t I? 

                                 MAX
                        Not like you say. He found you. He 
                        made the choices.

                                 MORRISON
                        A drawing of Bobby’s was found next 
                        to Carter’s body. It’s been five 
                        days. We’re twenty-four hours out 
                        from naming parks and preschools 
                        after him. You’re all the kid’s 
                        got. It’s just you.

                                 MAX
                        Look I don’t know anything about 
                        him. I don’t know anything about 
                        where he would take him. And I 
                        don’t know anything about some 
                        stupid watercolor dog he drew.

                                 MORRISON
                        Right. Well listen, sweetheart. I 
                        don’t want you to worry. We’re 
                        gonna run prints, test clothing, 
                        everything. And you know what, 
                        we’ll find him. I promise you. It’s 
                        just a matter of time ‘til we know 
                        the truth. And that’s a promise.

           Max is spooked, rattled. Morrison smiles at him. She strokes 
           his face, motherly. Forbidden and she knows it. 

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know what you’re going for.
                        But I'm not your friend. I'm not 
                        your kid. I don't know you. And so 
                        whatever you think this is...it's 
                        not.

           This hits Morrison hard. Her smile turns colder, 
           professional.
           INT. PARENTS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Darlene watches Morrison and Max from the window, as Max and 
           Morrison stare at each other.

                                 TOMMY
                             (shouting)
                        Come on, Max!

           Darlene watches Max run around back toward Tommy and Morrison 
           get into her car and drive off.

           INT. MORRISON’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

           Morrison slows, looking out the front window to see a quartet 
           of YOUNG JAPPY MOTHERS (late 20s) in matching LULULEMON 
           WORKOUT CLOTHES pushing four IDENTICAL STROLLERS in the 
           middle of the street. Morrison grows frustrated as the women 
           obliviously block the way for her now idling sedan.

           Morrison HONKS THE HORN aggressively. The women turn around 
           and stare obnoxiously as they part down the middle and make 
           way for the sedan, the babies now starting to cry.

           Morrison drives off, turns the radio on, EJECTS the TAPE 
           inside, labelled “WHEELER, 7.15.03” and stashes it in the 
           glove compartment. She then takes a DIFFERENT TAPE from the 
           front console. It reads “WATERS, 7.10.13.” She inserts the 
           tape into the tape deck and hits PLAY.

                                 911 DISPATCHER
                        911, what is your emergency?

                                 BOBBY’S MOTHER
                        Um - yes, my son was supposed to 
                        walk home from camp and now it’s 
                        late and I went to see where he was 
                        and he’s not there - 

           INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max runs the sink, dousing his face with water. He puts his 
           face under the tap. As if drowning himself.

           INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Max slams the door shut. He drops into bed.

           The DOOR SLAMS SHUT once more.
           Max spins around to find Tommy. Standing there. With a NERF 
           GUN in his hand, aimed at Max.

                                 TOMMY
                        Don't move. Don't move a muscle. 
                        Sheriff’s here.

                                 MAX
                        Get out.

                                 TOMMY
                        I know about you, partner.

                                 MAX
                        Get out now.

           Tommy aims the gun at Max. Max stands up and lunges at Tommy. 
           Tommy shoots the NERF GUN and screams with excitement. Max 
           knocks Tommy down, HARD.

           Tommy hits his head against the bed-post as Max slams him 
           onto his back. He instinctively grabs Tommy's THROAT, hard, 
           subduing him.

           Silence. Tommy stares at Max, as Max recognizes what he's 
           done. Then - TOMMY GIGGLES. Max's hand on Tommy's neck is 
           tickling Tommy.

           Max's HANDS continue to TICKLE TOMMY MERCILESSLY, as the rest 
           of him is horrified at his initial violence.

           The tickle torture continues, Tommy laughing uncontrollably, 
           as Max gets emotional.

           Max lifts Tommy up and brings him in close. Holds him.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                             (whispers)
                        You know that I'll never leave you. 
                        You know that, right? No one will 
                        ever touch you. Even when they 
                        come. You know that, right? You 
                        know that.

           Tommy tries to break free. Max holds him HARD.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           Max hugs him tight. Too tight. Tommy can't escape it. He 
           relents, goes limp.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I want you to pack a bag. OK? Your 
                        toothbrush, some clothes, and a few 
                        of your favorite things.

                                 TOMMY
                        Why?

                                 MAX
                        We’re going on an adventure later. OK?

           Tommy smiles, nods, as we - 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           BLACK.

           Until we see frames from an old movie, perhaps “FRANKENSTEIN” 
           projected onto The Captor and Max, sitting on Max’s bed, 
           watching the film on an old television with a VHS player, 
           eating popcorn. 

           Silence.

                                 HENRY FRANKENSTEIN
                             (on the TV)
                        “Oh, in the name of God! Now I know 
                        what it feels like to be God!”

                                 CAPTOR
                        What do you think his name will be?

           Silence.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        I asked you a question.

                                 MAX
                        Frank.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (laughs)
                        No. Probably not. But you get to 
                        choose whatever name you want for 
                        him. OK? So you can call him Frank 
                        if you want to. And he’ll have to 
                        answer to that. I like Brandon I 
                        think. Or Murray, after my father -

           The Captor stops himself, changes course.
                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        Will you show him the submarine? 
                        And the space station? I’m sure 
                        he’ll love it.

           Silence.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        And you’ll have to learn how to 
                        share your things with him. And 
                        take care of him. Do you understand 
                        me?

           Silence. They watch the film.

                                 MAX
                        I’m not doing any of it. Unless I 
                        get to see them. Just once. Just so 
                        I can remember. That’s what I want. 
                        That’s what I wished for. And I 
                        don’t care what the rule is. Or 
                        what you change it to. Or what you 
                        make me do. I’m not doing it unless 
                        I get that. Do you understand me?

           The Captor considers this.

                                 CAPTOR
                        All this time and we never gave you 
                        a name. I guess we didn’t need to. 
                        You were always the only boy in our 
                        story. (beat) I’m so glad you’re 
                        excited. I knew you would be.

           The Captor takes the REMOTE and turns off the TV, as the room 
           goes BLACK, and we...

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The house now asleep, MAX peers into Tommy’s room, BLINDED BY 
           THE NIGHTLIGHT. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Morrison sits at her desk, pouring through the case file. An 
           episode of WHEEL OF FORTUNE is on the TV in the background.

           OFFICER PAULSON (30s) brings her a cup of coffee. 
                                 MORRISON
                        Growing up when I’d do something 
                        wrong, my grandmother used to tell me 
                        in Yiddish, “Maidel shittern mogn 
                        ober shtyfer mogn, gezunt un tuches 
                        mogn mogn.” In a world of loose 
                        stools and constipation, it’s fine to 
                        be a normal piece of shit sometimes. 
                        (beat) But it don’t feel fine.

           Morrison looks up at him, tears well in her exhausted eyes.

                                 PAULSON
                        You afraid of losing him?

           Morrison shakes her head, looks to confess to him.

                                 MORRISON
                        I’m afraid of wanting to.

           Morrison watches as the WHEEL OF FORTUNE CONTESTANT asks to 
           solve the puzzle with just ONE LETTER on the BOARD. She 
           guesses “I’VE GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS.” It’s correct. 
           Morrison collects herself, resumes her professionalism. 

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Why the drawing?

                                 PAULSON
                        A souvenir. A trophy.

                                 MORRISON
                        Trophy means the game’s over. That 
                        ain’t something he’d celebrate.

                                 PAULSON
                        Maybe he knew good finger painting 
                        when he saw it. Art appreciates 
                        quickly.

                                 MORRISON
                        It was a watercolor. You should 
                        know that.

                                 PAULSON
                        How would I know? I’ve never seen 
                        it. You brought it to the lab 
                        before showing it to anyone.

           Morrison looks at him. A spark.

                                 MORRISON
                        You wouldn’t know if you never saw 
                        it.
           Morrison stops herself.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        You never saw it.

           She freezes.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        He never saw it. So he wouldn’t 
                        know.

           She turns to the Paulson.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        Stay here. I’ll call from the car.

           INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM - DAWN

           Darlene and Frank are sleeping when suddenly there’s a -  

           KNOCK! KNOCK!

                                 FRANK
                        Shit.

                                 DARLENE
                        Does he have to pee again?

                                 FRANK
                        I thought we fixed that.

           Frank gets up, pulls his sweatpants up, and leaves the room.

           INT. WHEELER HOME - FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The KNOCKS grow louder! Frank is about to climb the stairs 
           when he notices they’re coming from the FRONT DOOR. 

           He squints outside and sees Morrison standing there, 
           impatiently. He opens the door.

                                 FRANK
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MORRISON
                        Where is he?

           Darlene now appears in a nightgown.

                                 FRANK
                        What? It’s 5 AM.
           INT. WHEELER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Morrison, Frank, and Darlene rush into Max’s room.

           INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Morrison stares at an empty bed. Neatly made. Frank and 
           Darlene look on horrified. They rush out of the room.

           INT. TOMMY’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Darlene stands in front of another empty bed. Neatly made. In 
           shock. Frank and Morrison shuffle in behind her.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh my god.

           Darlene sees the nightlight is gone.

                                 DARLENE
                        I think I know where to find them.

           EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

           Max and Tommy, with backpacks, journey through the woods. 

                                 MAX
                        What name do you want?

                                 TOMMY
                        For what?

                                 MAX
                        Our adventure.

           Tommy thinks for a moment.

                                 TOMMY
                        Wolverine.

                                 MAX
                        Like, X-Men?

                                 TOMMY
                        No. Not like X-Men.

                                 MAX
                        Okay, Wolverine...not like X-Men.
           At once, Max stops, putting an arm in front of Tommy to stop 
           him as well. Max looks up, smiles. It’s a giant rock, with a 
           downed tree riding on top of it.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Found you.

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           “A White Sport Coat (And A Pink Carnation)” by Martin Robbins 
           blares.

           Max gels his hair, ensuring each hair is in place.

           He does sit-ups in his underwear.

           He then throws on an undershirt and socks, and begins to get 
           dressed, as if a soldier readying for deployment.

           He zips his pants up and fastens his belt snugly.

           He laces his sneakers tightly.

           He applies sunscreen to his entire body followed by bug 
           spray.

           INT. CAPTOR’S HOME - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Max stands in front of the front door. He takes breathes as 
           if an astronaut in outer space. Darth Vader-like. He then 
           readies himself, opens the door, as the SUNLIGHT BLINDS HIM. 
           And all we see is WHITE. 

           INT. CAPTOR'S VAN - THE RECENT PAST

           The van is slowly idling down a dirt road.

           Max opens and closes the door lock. Open. Close. Open. Close. 
           Max looks out the window. Squints his eyes. He hasn't seen 
           daylight in years. He stares at the trees. Wondrously.

                                 MAX
                        Why didn’t you just kill me?

           The Captor looks at him. Confused.
                                 CAPTOR
                             (incredulously)
                        Because I love you. (beat) Because 
                        you’re my favorite thing.

           The CAPTOR pulls the van to the side of the road and cuts the 
           engine. The Captor nudges Max, who now notices a YOUNG BOY 
           (11) walking home with a RED CAP and a NY GIANTS backpack on 
           the dirt road. He's holding a watercolor drawing. It is BOBBY 
           WATERS.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                             (re: the YOUNG BOY)
                        Found you.

           He looks at Max. Max almost pauses for a moment, but doesn't. 
           He unbuckles his seat belt. 

                                 MAX
                        Is it safe?

                                 CAPTOR
                        The war is long over.

                                 MAX
                        What about the dogs?

                                 CAPTOR
                        Oh, they’re long gone.

           Max slowly gets out of the van and shuts the door.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. MORRISON’S CAR

           Morrison speeds as she follows Frank and Darlene’s car which 
           is also speeding through the mostly empty streets.

           EXT. WOODS - FORT - SECONDS LATER

           CLOSE ON: Max and Tommy’s faces. Both are PUCKERED and 
           TWISTED. Suddenly, Max spits out a small green candy - a 
           WARHEAD SOUR. 

           Tommy smiles, throws his hands in the air, victorious. Max 
           smiles. The smiles evaporate into a blank stare. Max and 
           Tommy sit. Tommy looks bored.

                                                               CUT TO:
           EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE RECENT PAST - MOMENTS LATER

           Max catches up to BOBBY. Pretends to be walking as well. He 
           approaches him, then backs off. Then reapproaches and is 
           about to say something. But he backs off again, unsure of 
           himself.

           He then notices Bobby’s NY GIANTS BACKPACK.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, um, you like sports?

                                 BOBBY
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        You a...Giants fan?

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh, no I'm really a Jets fan, but 
                        Jason Rothbaum said that anyone who 
                        says they're a Giants fan knows 
                        nothing about football and is just 
                        jumping on the bandwagon.

                                 MAX
                        So why the Giants backpack?

                                 BOBBY
                        Cause fuck Jason Rothbaum.

           They laugh. Max becomes more comfortable, confident.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, um, have...you seen my little 
                        brother on your walk by any chance?

                                 BOBBY
                        Um, I don't think so.

                                 MAX
                        About your height. Yankees hat?

                                 BOBBY
                        No, didn't see him.

                                 MAX
                        He usually takes this shortcut. I 
                        think it's this way.

           Max indicates the woods.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh.
                                 MAX
                        Would you mind helping me look for 
                        him? He's probably somewhere in 
                        there and I'm really worried.

                                 BOBBY
                        I should really go home.

                                 MAX
                        This is the way home. It's a 
                        shortcut. Please?

           Darlene, Frank, and Morrison scour the woods, calling out Max 
           and Tommy’s names.

           EXT. WOODS - FORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Max and Tommy are just sitting there.

                        When can we go home?

           Max looks at him. Confused. Smiles.

                                 MAX
                        We are home.

                                 TOMMY
                        No we’re not.

                                 MAX
                        We are, Tommy. This is where we’re 
                        going to stay for a while. You’re 
                        safe. Only here. And only with me. 
                        So I can watch out for you. And 
                        they’ll never come for me. Or take 
                        me away.

           A beat. Tommy grows uncomfortable.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        So let’s go again.

                        I don’t want to.
                                 MAX
                        It’ll be fun. (beat) What’s your 
                        full name?

           Silence.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What’s your full name?

                                 TOMMY
                             (apprehensively)
                        Wolverine.

                                 MAX
                        That’s right. And where do you 
                        live? (beat) Where do you live?

                                 TOMMY
                        In the fort. In the woods.

                                 MAX
                        You’re good at this. And -

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE RECENT PAST - MOMENTS LATER

           Max and Bobby are searching the woods.

                                 BOBBY
                        I don't see him.

                                 MAX
                        Me neither. My car is on the road, 
                        maybe you can help me...

           Max is taken by a WATERCOLOR DRAWING in Bobby’s hands.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What'd you make?

                                 BOBBY
                             (growing uncomfortable)
                        It's a watercolor. I made it for my 
                        mom and dad.

                                 MAX
                        Oh yeah? What's it of?

                                 BOBBY
                             (more uncomfortable)
                        Our dog. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        He died last week, ran into the 
                        street right when a car came. We 
                        don’t know why he didn’t wait. But 
                        I think it’ll cheer them up.

                                 MAX
                        Maybe he was waiting. Maybe that 
                        was the point.

           Max stops, tears up. He stares at Bobby.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Well that’s really beautiful. 
                        They're going to love it.

           Bobby stares at Max.

                                 BOBBY
                             (scared)
                        I should go home now.

           Bobby makes to go back toward the road. Max is fixated.

                                 MAX
                        You can't go that way.

                                 BOBBY
                             (scared, impatient)
                        I should go home right now.

                                 MAX
                             (desperate, fixated)
                        I promise, we'll get you home. Can 
                        you just show me again. Please. 
                        Show me the drawing.

           Max inches closer to Bobby, who stands his ground, but begins 
           to feel cornered. As Max takes another step, Bobby SCREAMS.

                                 BOBBY
                        HELP!!!!!!!!!!!

           MAX rushes Bobby, grabs him, and COVERS his MOUTH with his 
           hand, genuinely concerned for the boy.

                                 MAX
                        No!

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        Boy?
           The Captor is now nearly twenty feet away. Max grabs Bobby, 
           still covering his mouth, as Bobby struggles. He begins 
           running into the woods.

                                                               CUT TO:

           Darlene, Frank, and Morrison frantically shout the boys’ 
           names.

           EXT. WOODS - FORT - SECONDS LATER

           Tommy sits, scared.

                                 TOMMY
                        I don’t want to be here.

                                 MAX
                        But it’s home. And - and there’s a 
                        war outside. And the only food 
                        that’s safe is the food that I can 
                        bring for you.

                                 TOMMY
                        There’s no war. And the food isn’t 
                        bad. You’re just making that up.

                         MORRISON

                             (O.S.)
                        Boys!

           Tommy looks to Max, Max to Tommy. Tommy is about to SHOUT 
           when Max GRABS HIM and covers TOMMY’S MOUTH with his hand. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE RECENT PAST - SECONDS LATER

           Max runs with Bobby in his arms, as Bobby tries to scream, 
           get out of Max’s grip.

           The Captor is closing on them, just paces behind, his 
           breathing getting louder, more violent.

                                                               CUT TO:
           EXT. WOODS - SECONDS LATER

           Frank, Darlene, and Morrison suddenly hear a muffled scream - 

                                 TOMMY
                             (O.S.)
                        Mom!

           The trio takes off toward the noise.

           EXT. WOODS - FORT - CONTINUOUS

           Max continues to wrestle Tommy, muffling his screams. 
           Morrison, Darlene, and Frank’s calls get louder and closer. 
           They must be within ten yards now.

                                 MAX
                        Listen to me. Bobby, listen to me -

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - THE RECENT PAST - MOMENTS LATER

           Max frantically runs through trees and bushes. The Captor is 
           now just paces behind when MAX TRIPS on a tree root, throwing 
           Bobby and himself to the ground. The fall stuns Bobby for a 
           moment. 

           Just as the Captor is about to discover them, Max grabs Bobby 
           and takes refuge behind a downed tree. Max covers Bobby’s 
           mouth hard, just before the boy thinks to scream. Bobby grows 
           wild. Trying to shout or yell or just grab a breath.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S., in a loud whisper)
                        Boy! BOY!

           The Captor is nearly on top of them. One small move, the 
           Captor will catch them. They’re stuck. 

           Max is holding Bobby's mouth shut, HARDER now.

                                 MAX
                             (whispering)
                        You have to stop. You have to 
                        listen to me. I am going to help 
                        you, okay? 

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        Bring him here. Come on.
           Bobby’s struggle gets more intense. Peeps of yells start to 
           bubble from the sides of his mouth, wherever Max’s hands 
           can’t cover.

                                 MAX
                             (whispering)
                        I will get you out of here, just 
                        stop, just stop. Do you hear me?

           Bobby continues to struggle. The Captor is inches from them, 
           but still can’t see them. There’s nowhere to run now.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (O.S.)
                        Let’s get him home. Family dinner.

           Max’s hand over Bobby’s mouth gets tighter. He’s trying to 
           quell Bobby’s screams, to save him, but he’s suffocating the 
           child. Bobby struggles, harder and harder. Max meets his 
           efforts with a stronger grip.

           Then - The SOUND OF A LIMP BODY hitting the dirt. The Captor 
           pounces at the noise, stumbling upon Max holding Bobby. Tears 
           streaming down Max’s face. The boy is dead. The Captor looks 
           on in shock. Max’s hand shakes as it continues to cover 
           Bobby’s mouth.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. THE WOODS - FORT - SECONDS LATER

           CLOSE ON MAX shaking as his hand covers Tommy’s mouth.

           Morrison, Darlene and Frank burst into the “fort.”

           Max is holding Tommy close, his hand covering Tommy’s mouth, 
           but not so tightly. Tommy looks around, uncomfortable, but 
           unhurt. Max is crying.

                                 MAX
                        I just wanted to save him.

           Frank runs over and eases Tommy out of Max’s grip. Tommy goes 
           to Frank easily. Max is shaking, crying.

           Morrison takes a step toward him, but Darlene stops her. 
           Darlene then steps towards Max, leans down to him, and brings 
           him in close to her, hugging him. Holding him, his head in 
           her chest, in just the right spot, listening to her 
           breathing, her heart beat.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to...I couldn’t.
           Darlene holds Max tight. 

                                 DARLENE
                        Neither could I.

           Their breaths soon find one another. Mimicking syncopation 
           and rhythm. Until their breaths are one. And in this moment, 
           they’re the same.

           INT. MORRISON'S CAR - LATER

           Max sits shotgun, staring out the window at the TOWN of 
           JERICHO, the town he passed through when he first returned 
           home. People are eating ICE CREAM, arguing with METER MAIDS. 
           A woman has her YOUNG SON on one of those BACKPACK LEASHES.

           Max stares with equal parts WONDER and DISINTEREST.

           Morrison pulls the car onto a quiet suburban street and 
           parks. She wipes lipstick from the sides of her mouth.

                                 MORRISON
                        Where is he?

           A beat.

                                 MAX
                        You can find him in the backyard. 
                        Near the rose bushes. About five 
                        feet down. Cardboard box for a new 
                        bed.

           Morrison stares ahead. Misty.

                                 MORRISON
                        How do you know?

                                 MAX
                        He made me bury him. (beat) And 
                        then he was gone.

           Max gets emotional.

                                 MORRISON
                        We’re going to leave it here, Max. 
                        We’ll search the backyard, standard 
                        procedure, and we’ll pin it on 
                        Carter. No one will know. Not your 
                        parents, not anyone. We’ll keep it 
                        between us. Just you and me.

           Morrison starts the engine, pulls away from the curb.
                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        We’re almost home.

                                 MAX
                        It's not what you think. It's not 
                        stories and three-pointers and 
                        pancakes. It's not him or her. It's 
                        not me.

                                 MORRISON
                        No. But it’s something.

           Morrison pulls up in front of Max’s home. Darlene, Frank, and 
           Tommy just beat them home. They watch Morrison’s car, waiting 
           for Max. Waiting for him to come home.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTOR'S BASEMENT - THE PAST - LATER

           Max and The Captor wash their hands. They sit down on the 
           bed. Max, dried tears on his face. Having “wept for the end 
           of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart” or something like 
           that. He shakes. 

           The Captor looks at Max. Max at him. Guilty, both. 
           Accomplices. God and Man. Creator and Creation.

                                 CAPTOR
                        He was just a kid. He was just a 
                        kid. You were just a kid.

           Max stares at him. The Captor now cries. The Captor tries to 
           speak again, but can’t. Max lies down in bed, head on his 
           pillow, exhausted.

           After a moment, the Captor wipes his tears, looks at Max, 
           stroking the young man’s back as Max drifts off to sleep.

                                 CAPTOR (CONT’D)
                        You and I are sitting on a cot in a 
                        basement in a house in a town. And 
                        I tell you a story... 

           EXT. THE WATERS’ HOME - LATER THAT DAY

           Officer Paulson knocks on the door. It’s covered with a BIG 
           YELLOW RIBBON. BOBBY WATERS’ MOTHER (40) looks at Paulson. 
           She then collapses into his arms, as he holds her close.

                             (V.O.)
                        ...In this story, people will come 
                        for you. They’ll tell you things. 
                        And put you back with them. It’ll 
                        feel close to the things you’ve 
                        known before. What you’ve seen or 
                        felt or heard. But it will be off by 
                        this much. Their bodies will be 
                        slightly warmer. The colors slightly 
                        darker. The voices will have an echo 
                        or a missed vibration. If you just 
                        listen. If you just hear...

           INT. MORRISON’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Morrison and her mother eat soup in silence. Morrison begins 
           to break down. She cries and cries, as her mother looks on. 
           Her mother gets closer, holds her daughter tight.

                                 MORRISON
                        They’re not mine.

           She tries to catch her breath.

                                 MORRISON (CONT’D)
                        And it’s such a relief.

           She collapses in her mother’s arms. Decades of heartache and 
           delusions, failure and hopelessness. Gone. All gone. She’s 
           free.

                                 CAPTOR
                             (V.O.)
                        ...Because it’s just us here. And 
                        the rest, all the rest - is just me 
                        telling you a story. It’s just my 
                        voice. And it’s just us. In that 
                        room. You and me. Our family...

           INT. WHEELER HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Frank, Tommy and Max sit at the table, awaiting dinner.

           The VOICE-OVER CUTS OUT, as if Max has turned it off.

           He smiles at the scene. Giving it another chance. Finally. 
           The home he’s been waiting for. Could this be it?

           Darlene then begins to bring over the plates for the boys. We 
           soon see it’s all CANNED FOOD on them - MEATS, VEGETABLES, 
           PEACHES.
                                 DARLENE
                        It’s all we had left.

           The family begins to dig in. Max stares at the plate in front 
           of him. He doesn’t take a bite. He can’t. His smile slowly 
           dissipates. The perfection of what never was and what never 
           will be shattered by the stuff of reality. He listens to them 
           eating. Chewing. Devouring.

           Then he hears something. As if something’s a little bit off. 
           The sounds of his family eating. An echo or missed vibration?

           INT. CAPTOR’S BASEMENT - THE RECENT PAST

           Max wakes in his cot. He slowly turns over to see the Captor 
           is gone. The basement now pulsates with an eerie silence. Max 
           slowly gets up and creeps around his room. Trying to listen.

           But it’s all silence. Quiet. Stillness. The stillness grows. 
           Louder and louder. Until we hear it. Until it’s all we hear. 
           Until -

           Max notices something about the DOOR to the basement. He 
           walks over, apprehensively. As he reaches it, he notices that 
           it’s slightly ajar. Just a pinch.

           He puts his hand on the door knob. Breathes in deeply. About 
           to push it open. Freedom. Salvation. Escape.

                                 MAX
                             (V.O.)
                        No. You’re not there. And neither 
                        are they. It’s just me. And I’m 
                        finally home.

           He grabs the doorknob tight, clenching his fist around the 
           metal, but instead of pushing it open he suddenly PULLS THE 
           DOOR CLOSED. He stares at it. And smiles. Then twists the top 
           lock, locking himself inside.

           Satisfied he heads over to an old record player on a fold-up 
           table. He takes a vinyl from its case and puts it on the 
           deck. He drops the needle, but hears nothing.

           He then turns the VOLUME DIAL clockwise.

           Finally, “The Green, Green Grass of Home” vibrates, then 
           hums, then plays, then pulsates. Then blasts.

           And Max smiles. Because he can finally hear it. All of it. 
           And it’s the sound of Home.

                                 THE END
