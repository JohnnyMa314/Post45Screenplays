          Look within. 
          Within is the fountain of good,
          And it will ever bubble up, 
          If thou wilt ever dig.

          -Marcus Aurelius
           FADE IN:

           EXT. APPALACHIAN FOOTHILLS - DUSK

           A LONE FIGURE treks through the breathtaking Appalachian 
           wilderness. Snow-sprinkled canopies top the surrounding 
           hills. A bone-white plain of powder below. 

           Not a track in sight but those behind:

           SOLOMON, known to most as SOL, on the wrong side of forty, a 
           dark, grey-specked beard, eyes that have seen too much. A 
           Thoreau-like air about him like he’s endured a silent 
           solitude and returned with wisdom we’ll never understand. 

           Sol hauls a large BACKPACK and ARROW SLEEVE through three 
           feet of fresh snow into...

           A WOODED AREA

           where he unloads his pack and snaps together a TAKE-DOWN BOW.

           Sol nocks an arrow, draws the string, and does what we will 
           see him do many times: 

           Closes his eyes                                           
           Sucks a calm breath                                     
           Releases steady and slow                                    
           And opens those eyes again -- now hard, dark, focused. 

           TWANG! The arrow launches ahead...

              Between trees.

                                  Through bushes.      

                                                   Over broken branches.   

           THWACK! And into the belly of a WILD TURKEY. A short gobble-
           gobble and its dead to rights.

           Sol inspects the kill. There’ll be good eating tonight.

           EXT. CAMP FIRE - (THAT) NIGHT

           A CHARRED TURKEY roasting on a spit. Sol’s bear claw of a 
           hand spinning it slowly.

           He removes the spit, slips off the cooked animal, sterilizes 
           his HUNTING KNIFE over the fire heat.
           THE KNIFE slices meat slivers onto two plates. Sol offers the 
           plates to two girls: EMMA and GINNY, 14 and 10. 

           Sol cuts more meat for himself, mutters to the girls:

                                 SOL
                        Eat up.

                                 GINNY
                        Gotta say grace, Daddy.

           Sol sighs, stabs his knife into the turkey. 

                                 SOL
                        Go’n, then.

           His girls hold hands, offer their free hands to him. He takes 
           them, but we may note the hesitance. 

           Sol watches them lower their heads, close their eyes. But he 
           does not do the same. 

                                 EMMA
                        We thank you, Lord, for this food. 
                        We thank you for our water. And for 
                        this place to sleep. We thank you 
                        for bringing our Daddy back to us 
                        and for keeping him safe on his 
                        hunt. We thank you for keeping us 
                        safe and we pray that you will 
                        always do so. We thank you for... 
                        For, um...

                                 GINNY
                        Keeping Momma alive. 

                                 EMMA
                        Right. For keeping our mother 
                        alive.

           Sol’s eyes gloss over. He swallows hard, a lump growing in 
           his throat. 

           We stay with Sol as he watches his girls. Something behind 
           his eyes -- lost hope or lost pride or both. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        And we pray, as we do every night, 
                        that you will allow us to keep her. 
                        Please, Lord, don’t take her from 
                        us. 

                                 GINNY (O.S.)
                        Please, Lord.
                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Please. Leave her here with us. 
                        Leave her with her family. 

                                 GINNY (O.S.)
                        Please, Lord.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Please. And thank you.

                             GINNY
                                                            EMMA
                 Amen.
                                                Amen.

           Sol watches his girls slowly raise their heads, wipe their 
           wet eyes, pick up their plates. 

           He just rips into a sliver of meat, his version of an amen.

           EXT. SOL’S TRAILER - (THE NEXT) DAY

           Sol and his girls emerge from the nearby woods, packs-and-
           all. They move toward a TRAILER that rests alone in the 
           foothills. 

           It is quiet. It is secluded. It is lonely.

           A salt-coated pickup truck rests in the driveway, its bed 
           weighed down with firewood.

           INT. SOL’S TRAILER - DAY

           Small, cluttered, even dirtier than its owner. Nothing pretty 
           about it. Nothing except for the...

           MOUNTED PHOTOS 

           of Solomon’s family that we find...

           DOWN THE HALLWAY

           as we follow the girls to their bedroom. But we don’t follow 
           them inside. We wait on them. Finding SNAPSHOTS of:

           -- Sol holding a small, naked, pinkish being. Emma at birth. 
           APRIL, her mother, rests beside them in hospital attire.

           -- A birthday party. Emma blowing out candles. Four of them. 
           With April’s help. Sol cradles a newborn Ginny behind them.
           -- All four of them at AN ISOLATED LOG CABIN. The girls are 9 
           and 5. Sol holding April around the waist.

           -- The girls and Sol, last year, without April. They both 
           kiss his cheeks. Making the best of a bad situation.

           Finally, the girls emerge. They’ve changed into something 
           comfortable. 

           At the kitchen table, they find OJ and muffins. 

           On the couch, Sol gulps a cup of water as he shuffles through 
           BILL after UNPAID BILL. Most of them with medical symbols.

           He moves to the sink, refills his cup with water. Stares out 
           a frosted window at the unforgiving Appalachian terrain. That 
           ever-present WHISTLING HOWL of winter wind echoing outside.

           EXT. SOL’S TRAILER - DAY

           Sol and his girls file out, move toward his pickup truck. The 
           girls eat their muffins. Sol carries their backpacks. 

           EXT./INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL, SOL’S PICKUP - DAY

           Sol’s pickup parks curbside. The girls climb out and their 
           daddy hands them their backpacks. 

                                 SOL
                        Have a good’n.

                                 EMMA
                        You too.

                                 GINNY
                        Love you, Daddy.

                                 SOL
                        Y’too, girls.

           Emma helps Ginny squirm her backpack over her shoulders and 
           Sol watches them until they’re safely inside the school. 

           INT. LOCAL HOSPITAL - DAY

           A frail woman resting in a hospital bed. This is APRIL, Sol’s 
           wife and the girls’ mother. She’s dying slowly, painfully. 
           But as Sol walks through her door, she brightens, seems to 
           forget her pain at the sight of...
                                 APRIL
                        Solomon. 

                                 SOL
                        How are ya, honey?

                                 APRIL
                        No, how are you?

                                 SOL
                        I’m awright.

                                 APRIL
                        How’re the girls?

                                 SOL
                        They’re awright.

                                 APRIL
                        Where are they?

                                 SOL
                        School. Like you want‘em to be.

                                 APRIL
                        Good. Good.

           As they converse, it may become clear that any day could be 
           the day for her. And right now, we may realize that April 
           senses that today is her day... 

           Today is the day. 

                                 SOL
                        We was happy, wasn’t we?

           No words needed, she simply pulls him to her. He rests his 
           forehead against hers and the room is filled only with 
           April’s labored breathing and Sol’s resistant whimpering.

           There’s love here. Something unbreakable and transcendent. 

                                 APRIL
                             (whispered)
                        Remember what I asked. Remember 
                        what you promised me.

           Off Sol’s sorrowful eyes, we:

                                                               CUT TO:
           EXT. CEMETERY - (ANOTHER) DAY

           A RUSTED SHOVEL

           forced through frozen dirt by the boot of...

           SOLOMON

           at his job, digging a grave like he does on most days. Always 
           some poor soul who needs burying. 

           DARREL, the grounds keeper, approaches Sol. He watches him 
           for a long moment. Removes his hat, speaks up:

                                 DARREL
                        Need some help on this’n?

           Sol ignores him, wipes his brow, keeps digging.

                                 DARREL (cont’d)
                        Figgered you might wanna take’is 
                        one off. You dug just’bout every 
                        grave round here. Don’t seem right 
                        havin to do it for yer own kin.
                             (still no response)
                        At least take a breather, buddy. 
                        I’ll take over fer a few.

           Sol pauses, speaks over his shoulder:

                                 SOL
                        Please leave me the fuck alone. 
                        Thank you, Darrel.

           Darrel raises his hands in a truce, replaces his hat, strolls 
           back the way he came. 

           And Sol SPEARS his shovel back into the frozen earth.

           INT. MORTUARY - DAY

           The stale stench of death-for-profit somehow in the air. The 
           last place you wanna go before you become one with the earth 
           again. All flowery and colorful, everything death isn’t.

           INT. MORTUARY BASEMENT - SAME

           Eerily lit. Concrete floor and walls. Cold even to the sight.

           A FIGURE hunches over a CADAVER. Doing everything that has to 
           be done. Everything we do not want to see.
           Finished, the figure removes his gloves and white coat. And 
           we see now, that the cadaver is April -- pale and lifeless.

           The figure strokes her face lovingly, longingly. 

           See him now: an old body ravaged by time. A war-torn veteran, 
           his face still fierce and murderous. Eyes that hardly blink 
           and burn like the dying embers of some long held flame. Cold, 
           calm, and terrifying. This is OLD LUC, April’s father. 

           He kisses her blue cheek, combs her hair, slowly applies 
           lipstick to her sewn-shut lips. 

           The sadness of this moment mirrored not in his stoic face, 
           but in those dark, lost eyes. Piercing and hollow.

           EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

           SNOW FALLS into an open grave. 

           Around it: Emma and Ginny crying, Sol holding their hands, 
           braving the day for his girls. Across from them stands...

           Old Luc watching them, studying Sol. He’s already paid his 
           dues to his daughter. He’s here for something else.

           Beside him are KURT and LAMAR, sons to Old Luc and brothers 
           to April. In their mid-30s, they’re young and virile. Kurt’s 
           GUITAR is ever-present. Lamar’s mind is not.

           A WIND-BURNT PREACHER nears the end of his sermon, Kurt 
           strumming his guitar lightly beside him.

           Now finished, the small congregation mutters an “amen.”

           Kurt’s guitar playing goes out of tune, voice chokes, face 
           tenses. He’s crying. 

                                 LAMAR
                        Kurt, it’s awright. Thats ’nough 
                        fer now. That’s enough.

           Kurt wipes his tears, leans down and tosses dirt onto April’s 
           lowered casket.

                                 KURT
                        I’ll watch over yer girls. Promise.

           Old Luc regards Solomon. Something between them, unsaid but 
           understood. 
           EXT. SOL’S PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER

           As Sol and his girls make way for his truck, Old Luc 
           approaches from behind.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Girls, don’t Pappaw get a hug?

           The girls turn about and he kneels to hug them both.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Love you girls. Now get in the 
                        truck, get yerselves warm.

           The girls climb into the truck, close the doors. Old Luc 
           turns to Sol:

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        I have a word?

                                 SOL
                        Sure, Luc. What is it?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Not now. Drop by later, affer dark.

                                 SOL
                        I got the girls, now.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Bring them too.

                                 SOL
                        Don’t want ‘em around there no 
                        more. They need to forget about 
                        death, not be reminded of it. 

                                 OLD LUC
                        Then I’ll come to you.

                                 SOL
                        Won’t be there.

           Old Luc’s demeanor seems to change abruptly. That’s the last 
           thing he wanted to hear.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Wha’for?

                                 SOL
                        Just need a few days. Give us that. 
                        Then we’ll talk. 

           Old Luc studies Sol for a winded moment, almost to himself:
                                 OLD LUC
                        Be seein’ ya.

           INT. SOL’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Sol and his girls eat dinner at a small table, a CAST-IRON 
           FURNACE roaring behind them.

           LATER,

           Sol washes and dries plates as Ginny emerges from the small 
           hallway, now in her pajamas.

                                 SOL
                        Brush yer teeth?

                                 GINNY
                        Yep.

                                 SOL
                        Yer sister?

           Ginny just shrugs. Doesn’t know.

           Sol sighs, stacks one more dry plate and heads down...

           THAT HALLWAY

           Nears a barely-cracked bathroom door.

                                 SOL
                        Em?

           No response and Sol peeks...

           THROUGH THE CRACKED DOOR

           Spots Emma leaning against the sink, toothbrush still 
           dripping with toothpaste, mouth still frothed...

           And crying.

           Frantically, desperately. Gasping for air. 

           She may seem tough, might even be tough. But not right now.
           IN THE HALLWAY

           Sol can’t stand to watch, doesn’t know what to do. April used 
           to take care of this. 

           So he just turns around, stalks slowly down the hallway, 
           returns to the...

           KITCHEN

           And continues drying dishes. 

                                 GINNY
                        ‘Kay daddy?

                                 SOL
                        Fine. Y’ready fer bed?

           Ginny nods, adjusts her pajamas. Getting too big for her now.

                                 GINNY
                        Read me a story?

           Sol pauses mid-wipe, puts down a bowl. Gulps hard.

                                 SOL
                        Not tonight, Gin.

                                 GINNY
                        But momma used to--

                                 SOL
                        Not tonight.

           Ginny huffs and crosses her arms, starts for her bedroom, 
           when...

           Emma rounds the corner into the kitchen, eyes still red and 
           puffy, hoping no one notices.

                                 EMMA
                        Whoa, where y’going speedracer?

                                 GINNY
                        Bed.

                                 EMMA
                        What’s wrong?

           Ginny pushes past her sister, disappears into the dark 
           hallway. To her dad:
                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        What’d y’do?

                                 SOL
                        Read her a story, Em? I got 
                        somewhere to be...

                                 EMMA
                        ‘Course you do.

           Emma turns to follow her sister, but...

                                 SOL
                        Em!

           Emma stops, looks back just to humor him.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        Come’ere.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 SOL
                        Just come here.

           Emma does, steps to her father as he places a callused hand 
           on each cheek, kisses the top of her head.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        It’s gone get better, awright?

           Forcing down tears, choking down the reemergence of the 
           emotion that caught her in the bathroom...

                                 EMMA
                        Awright.

                                 SOL
                        Now getcha some shut-eye. Leavin’ 
                        at sun-up.

           Off Sol’s fading smile, we...

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. SOL’S TRAILER -- (LATER THAT) NIGHT

           CLOSE ON clanking boots as they climb into that salt-coated 
           pickup. Boots that are dirty with years of wear and neglect. 

           V-V-V-VROOOM! and the truck roars to life.
           THE CHAINED TIRES roll quietly away from the trailer.

           EXT. SMALL TOWN STREETS -- MOVING -- NIGHT

           Sol’s truck maneuvers the hilltown streets, snow and slush on 
           every corner. Town’s dead save for the lit-up Waffle House. 

           Always a Waffle House in every shit town.

           EXT. SOL’S TRUCK -- NIGHT

           THOSE CHAINED TIRES roll to a stop. 

           Not sure where we are but it’s a long moment before THOSE 
           DIRTY BOOTS drop to the snow below.

           EXT. APPALACHIAN HORIZON -- NIGHT

           The tree-lined horizon backed by a FULL MOON.

           TIME-LAPSE as the moon swims its way through the night sky. 
           Nature’s ticking clock. 

           EXT. SOL’S TRUCK -- (EVEN LATER THAT) NIGHT

           THOSE DIRTY BOOTS climb back into the truck. If they were 
           dirty before, the boots are now filthy. 

           EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE -- NIGHT

           CHAINED WHEELS creep to a stop, truck parks, THOSE BOOTS drop 
           down again, clank their way to the door.

           INT. WAFFLE HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           DRING! DRING! as the entry door announces Sol’s arrival.  

           A WHITE TRASH WAITRESS wipes down the main counter, only one 
           COOK cracking and frying some eggs behind her.

           Sol eyes the only other customers. TWO FAT TRUCKERS. Probably 
           home from a long haul.

                                 FAT ASS TRUCKER
                        You seen better days fella.

                                 SOL
                        Seen better faces too.
                                 FAT FUCK TRUCKER
                        Yer wife was April Sanders?

                                 SOL
                        She was.

                                 FAT FUCK TRUCKER
                        I’s sorry to hear she’d gone.
                             (then...)
                        Finest piece-a-ass this side a the 
                        (Missis)sippi ‘fore I dropped out.

           Quicker than a snake strike, Sol’s grimy paw grips Fat Fuck’s 
           throat and pins his head to his plate of sunny side eggs.

           Finds a knife and levels it to the man’s bloodshot eyeball.

                                 SOL
                        Say again?

           Egg yolk bleeds beneath the man’s wet-wire mane as he takes 
           sight of the sharp blade inching closer.

           WHITETRASH WAITRESS 

           freezes mid-wipe as... 

           THE COOK 

           turns about, leaves hashbrowns to SIZZLE and burn behind him.

                                 FAT ASS TRUCKER
                        Now, let off’im. He ain’t mean it.

                                 SOL
                             (to Fat Fuck)
                        Is ‘at right?

                                 FAT FUCK TRUCKER
                             (barely audible...)
                        It is.

           Whitetrash Waitress leans over the countertop, offers:

                                 WAITRESS
                        Not that I wouldn’t mind seein’ 
                        Melvin here buried, but I don’t 
                        reckon yer girls wanna see you in 
                        prison garb. What y’think?

           Sol’s hand trembles, the knife’s edge so close to the man’s 
           eye that Fat Fuck would get an eyelash trim if he blinked.
                                 WAITRESS (cont’d)
                        Sol?

           Finally, Sol drops the knife, shoves the man to the ground 
           and his buddy helps him to his feet.

                                 WAITRESS (cont’d)
                        Now, then. What can I get ya, hun?

                                 SOL
                        Cup a coffee.

           She finds a stagnant pot of black coffee and a mug, pours it 
           as Sol takes a seat at a counter stool.

           Beside him, those Fat Truckers leave little-to-no tip and 
           stagger out the front entrance. No looking back.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sorry ‘bout them. And sorry ‘bout 
                        April. She’s too young.

           As she sets down the mug:

                                 SOL
                        Leave the pot.

           Waitress eyes Sol a moment, sets the pot down too.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Whatcha eatin’?

                                 SOL
                        Lemme get some eggs, sausage 
                        patties, biscuits-n-gravy. 
                             (then)
                        Coupla waffles-n-syrup. Hashbrowns. 
                        Buttered toast and jam. 
                             (oh, and...)
                        Steak topped with fried onions. 
                        Side a slaw. 
                             (after a thought)
                        And a slice a that pie up there, if 
                        y’don’t mind.

           Waitress scribbles it all down, smirks.

                                 WAITRESS
                        You’d think it’s yer last supper or 
                        sumpin.

                                 SOL
                        Y’could say.
           She glances at him shortly, slightly disturbed by that.

           But Sol just stares out a far winter-worn window, the sun 
           awakening that tree-lined horizon.

           EXT. MOUNTAINS - MORNING

           Sol and his girls hike through a clearing, a worn PACK MULE 
           striding alongside. 

           As his girls catch snow on their tongues, Sol studies the 
           mountain wilderness ahead, rubs his bloodshot eyes, yawns. 
           Clearly didn’t sleep last night. 

           He adjusts an OVERSIZED ARMY RUCKSACK saddled to the mule. 
           Carefully, softly. It’s about 2x5. Oddly shaped. Whatever’s 
           inside is apparently heavy and fragile. 

           Something important. 

           EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

           A GUARD SHACK hugging the gated entrance, the only window 
           smashed. Forced entry.

           INT. CEMETERY GUARD SHACK -- CONTINUOUS

           Kurt and Lamar cover the entrance, backs to us. 

           In a corner, Darrel cowers in his chair, eyes trembling as...

           Old Luc pushes between his sons, keeps that unwavering stare 
           on Darrel. Matter-of-factly:

                                 OLD LUC
                        Where is he.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           ON SOL’S FACE

           as he leads his girls up the mountain. Something betraying 
           his eyes, like he knows something’s after him.

           Been a long time coming.
           INT. SOL’S TRAILER -- DAY

           Front door implodes. Lamar strolls inside, then Kurt and 
           Darrel, followed by...

           Old Luc, sliding through the doorway like unwinding smoke.

           THAT PHOTO of the log cabin, Old Luc’s face reflected in the 
           glass as...

           CRACK! it shatters under the force of his fist. 

           He slips that photo out of the broken frame, stuffs it in a 
           jacket pocket.

           EXT. SOL’S TRAILER -- CONTINUOUS

           Old Luc’s burning eyes spot TRACKS that Sol and his girls 
           left behind. Leading up the foothills and into the wild.

           EXT. HORSE FARM -- DAY

           Old Luc speaking with an Appalachian HORSE FARMER. We can’t 
           hear what’s said, but it’s convincing enough for the Farmer 
           to nod with hesitant approval. 

           INT. BARN, HORSE FARM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Old Luc, Kurt and Lamar mount horses. Darrel climbs on behind 
           Kurt, wraps his arms around his waist.

                                 KURT
                        Watch the guitar, will ye?

           Darrel nods. Terrified. No mistaking it. 

           YAW! And the horses are off. 

           Riders of the storm. The four fucking horsemen. Apocalypse is 
           coming for someone. 

           EXT. FOREST -- DAY

           Trees are so thick here that sunlight and snow cannot even 
           break the canopy. 

           On the forest floor, Sol spots barely-visible ANIMAL TRACKS. 
           Motions for Emma to kneel with him.
                                 SOL
                        See ‘em?

                                 EMMA
                        What is it?

                                 SOL
                        A fox, looks like. Can y’find the 
                        next one?

           Emma searches in front of the tracks, her hand feeling 
           amongst the moss and fallen branches.

                                 EMMA
                        Here.

           Sol clears the area, finds the tracks.

                                 SOL
                        Follow’em.

           Sol and Ginny stay behind Emma as she follows the tracks.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        A fox is a predator and predators 
                        are difficult to hunt. 

           QUICK-FLASH of the four horsemen ascending the mountain.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        They are always alert, always 
                        hunting. 

           QUICK-FLASH of Luc scouring the landscape for any tracks.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        Hunting a hunter takes incredible 
                        skill, patience and will.

           QUICK-FLASH of OLD LUC’S EYES following Sol’s tracks just as:

           SOL’S EYES

           spot something far ahead.

           THE FOX’S TAIL 

           behind a large oak tree. Dull orange and white. A sharp 
           contrast to the forest surroundings. 

           Emma follows the tracks, rummaging through branches and 
           bushes, making too much noise.
           Ever alert, the fox scurries away.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        Let the fox hunt. There’s ‘nough 
                        for us all. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

           A mountain grassland. Snow collecting atop tendrils of grass. 

           Hiding at the edge of the forest, Sol’s eyes follow another 
           set of TRACKS into the open grassland. 

           A LONE BUCK grazes, burrowing his snout below the snow to 
           find his food.

           Sol kneels, slips off his rucksack and arrow sleeve. Motions 
           for the girls to do the same. 

           He snaps his take-down bow together, nocks an arrow and...

           Hands the weapon to Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        You sure?

                                 SOL
                        It’s yer kill.

           She smiles slightly, takes aim and, just like her father...

           Eyes close.                                              
           Mouth breaths in.                                           
           Releases out.                                                 
           Eyes open. Hard, dark, focused. Then:

           She draws the string, arms shaking, aim wavering. Her arms 
           aren’t strong enough to hold the arrow steady.

           TWANG! The arrow flies free...

            Out of the trees.

                                  Through falling snow.

                                                         Over snowy grass.

           THWACK! And into a tree just beyond the buck. The beast 
           startles and bounds into the forest.

                                 EMMA
                        Shit!
                                 SOL
                        It’s awright. Just takes time.

           Sol takes the bow from Emma, nocks another arrow, calmly 
           stalks into the clearing after the fleeing animal.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           A ROARING FIRE licks at falling snow. The buck has been cut, 
           stripped, and cooked. To Emma:

                                 SOL
                        Yer gonna get stronger. Stronger 
                        y’are, better the aim.

           Sol hands plates to his daughters as the pack mule WHINEYS 
           behind them, beaten and hungry.

           Sol tosses an apple at the mule’s feet, just outta reach of 
           his taught collar. 

           Emma stands and feeds the animal as she spots that oddly 
           shaped RUCKSACK nearby. To Sol:

                                 EMMA
                        Mind me askin’ what’s in there?

           Sol hesitates to answer. May or may not be hiding something.

                                 SOL
                        Supplies. Fer the cabin.

                                 EMMA
                        Why we goin’ there? We ain’t done 
                        this in two years.

                                 SOL
                        Time we did.

                                 EMMA
                        But why?

                                 SOL
                        She wanted us to git back to 
                        normal, awright?

           Emma lets the mule cough down the rest of the apple, core and 
           all, and takes her seat again. Rips into the deer meat.

                                 EMMA
                        Ain’t nothin’ normal no more.
           Sol studies his girls. Their long, sad faces. Sighs as he 
           sets down his plate.

                                 SOL
                        It’s fer one night. One night at 
                        the cabin and we’ll put it behind 
                        us. Do somethin’ fun after.

                                 GINNY
                        Fun?

           Sol nods, notices Ginny light up a bit. But Emma’s resistant. 

                                 GINNY (cont’d)
                        What kinda fun?

                                 SOL
                        Yer choice.

           Ginny looks to Emma, who finally raises her head, offers:

                                 EMMA
                        Road trip.

                                 SOL
                        Where to?

                                 EMMA
                        Somewheres warm, that’s fer sure.

           Ginny tears into a piece of meat, speaks with a mouthful:

                                 GINNY
                        Hawaii!

                                 SOL
                        Cain’t drive there, honey. It’s an 
                        island.

                                 GINNY
                        Then Australia!

                                 SOL
                        Ooookay. Maybe. How ’bout you, Em?

           Emma just stares into the fire, entranced. Finally mutters:

                                 EMMA
                        I always did wanna go to a beach.

                                 SOL
                        Did you? 
                                 EMMA
                        I wanted to be like one of those 
                        families who takes pictures in 
                        fronta their sand castles. Me and 
                        Ginny and Momma would build it and 
                        take pictures and then you’d come 
                        and destroy it. And we’d pretend 
                        like we’re mad, but really I’d just 
                        be happy that we could do it all 
                        over again. Like it would never 
                        end. We’d just spend all day right 
                        there. All day together building 
                        sand castles. 

           Sol collects himself, fakes strong for his girls.

                                 SOL
                        Florida’s still warm this time-a-
                        year. How’s Florida sound?

           Before the fire, Emma’s eyes glisten with longing. Those 
           flames reflected in her glossy blues. 

                                 EMMA
                        Anything’s better than here.

                                 SOL
                        Gin?

                                 GINNY
                        I guess that’s okay. But it ain’t 
                        better than Hawaii Island.

           Sol doesn’t have to fake a laugh after that. He pulls his 
           girls close, hugs them both.

                                 SOL
                        Get some rest. Coupla days and it’s 
                        Florida-or-Bust. 

           The girls climb into their sleeping bags as Sol feeds more 
           timber to the crackling fire.

           He eyes the darkness beyond the slumbering mule. Sips from a 
           tin of burnt coffee, determined to stay awake.

           Off Sol’s short yawn, we:

                                                               CUT TO:
           EXT. CAMPSITE - MORNING

           WISPS OF SMOKE still rising from the smoldering fire that 
           looks to have died hours ago. 

           Emma yawns herself awake, squirms out of her sleeping bag. 
           Takes her a minute before she realizes...

           SOLOMON IS GONE.

           She pulls on her boots and shakes Ginny awake. 

                                 EMMA
                        You seen Dad anywheres?

           Ginny shakes her head and yawns, finds her boots too.

                                 GINNY
                        Prolly using the outhouse.

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe.

           Emma searches the campsite. The deer jerky is gone, so is 
           Sol’s hunting knife, the mule and that strange rucksack. 

           His arrow sleeve is still here and... so are his boots? 

           That can’t be good.

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Why would he leave his boots?

                                 GINNY
                        Huh?

                                 EMMA
                        His boots. He wouldn’t walk in the 
                        snow barefoot.

                                 GINNY
                        I don’t know. Maybe he--

                                 EMMA
                             (calling out)
                        Dad!

                                 GINNY
                        He’s prolly just using--

                                 EMMA
                        Dad! You out there? Dad!
                                 GINNY
                             (calling too)
                        Daddy! Daddy, where are you?

                                 EMMA
                        Come on, get yer stuff together.

                                 GINNY
                        What, why?

                                 EMMA
                        Just do it, Gin. We gotta look 
                        for’im.

           Ginny, unable to grasp the weight of it all, slowly rises and 
           folds her sleeping bag.

           Emma does the same. Faster, frantic.

           Then, just as they’re ready to head out...

           RUSTLING nearby. Twigs CRACKING, snow SHUFFLING.      
           Someone... coughing?

                                 GINNY
                        That’s him. Daddy! Come on.

                                 EMMA
                        Wait. 

           The girls stand still, watching for something. 

           With the light breaking through the forest canopy, it’s hard 
           to see very far through the trees. But they spot:

           A FIGURE 

           far in front of them. Hard to make it out. It advances. 

           Closer and closer. 

           Until it breaks into TWO FIGURES. 

           Closer... closer. 

           And finally, they can make out:

           Kurt and Lamar on horseback, trotting toward the camp. Their 
           horses traverse the snow, squirm through the maze of trees.

           Emma steps in front of Ginny, watches her uncles approach 
           until they’re so close she can feel the horses’ breath.
                                 KURT
                        Mornin, girls. 

                                 GINNY
                        Uncle Kurt, you seen my daddy?

                                 KURT
                        Sure did. Told us he’s headin home. 
                        Said to look after you two for’im. 
                        Promised him I would.

                                 EMMA
                        He wouldn’t do’at.

                                 LAMAR
                        Why wouldn’t he, girl?

                                 EMMA
                        Cause he don’t trust you two.

                                 LAMAR
                        Why’s not?

                                 EMMA
                        Cause yer both fuckups, that’s why.

                        Now that’s just unnecessary, Emma. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s true is what it is.

                                 LAMAR
                        How’s that?

                                 EMMA
                        Cause ya fuck everything up, that’s 
                        why.

                                 KURT
                        Told ya once, Emma, that’s 
                        unnecessary. Now, come along.

                                 EMMA
                        We ain’t goin nowheres with you.

                  What do we fuck up?
                                                 Get on these horses, now.
                                 EMMA
                             (to Lamar)
                        Yer lives, genius. 

                                 KURT
                        Shut up, Lamar. 

                                 EMMA
                        You think we’re goin with you, 
                        you’re stupider than I thought.

                                 KURT
                        Get on up here, Ginny.

           Kurt extends a hand to Ginny. She takes it and Kurt heaves 
           her up onto his horse, plants her behind him.

                                 EMMA
                             (to Ginny)
                        Get off there, gi’down.

                                 GINNY
                        They’re takin us to Daddy.

                                 EMMA
                        No they ain’t neither. 
                             (to Kurt and Lamar)
                        I don’t know what’s goin on here, 
                        but my daddy don’t trust you and 
                        neither do I.

                                 LAMAR
                        Awright, then.

           Lamar swivels off his horse, wraps his arms around Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Get the fuck off me, Lamar!

           He swings Emma onto his horse, climbs on behind her.

                                 LAMAR
                        Be best to watch yer mouth, girl.

           Lamar whips the reigns and his horse trots off, following 
           Kurt’s lead.

           EXT. FOREST, ELSEWHERE - DAY

           We’re looking up at the sky, dark clouds rolling by, through 
           the bare branches of White Birch Trees. Their limbs still 
           collecting flakes of a passing snowstorm. Below:
           A SNOW-COVERED RAVINE winding inconspicuously through the 
           forest floor. 

           We follow the ravine, filled with three feet of snow. Resting 
           amidst the powder, a hardly noticeable change in terrain.

           As we close-in, this mound begins to MOVE.                
           Hard to make it out, but then the mound GROANS.         
           Closer still, and we can make out:

           A FACE.

           ... Sol’s face, to be exact. Dotted with fresh snowflakes.

           BLUEVEINED EYELIDS flutter open, eyes squinting at the broken 
           sunlight. 

           He lies motionless, shivering, breathing slowly. Tries to 
           rise, but winces. A sharp pain. 

           His frozen-stiff hand feels its way to his left side, emerges 
           stained with blood.

           He peels up his shirt, spots the wound. It’s bad. Deep. Won’t 
           heal itself but it looks to have missed his major organs.

           Sol rolls to his right, squirms his way out of the ravine. 

           He rests, composes himself, seems confused -- How did he get 
           here? And what the hell happened?

           QUICK-FLASHES:

           ... Sol feeding timber to the crackling fire.

           ... Watching his girls sleep.

           ... Falling asleep himself, leaning against a log as...

           ... Kurt and Lamar, cover his mouth, drag him away from camp.

           ... Kurt watching as Lamar stabs Sol and kicks his broken 
           body into the same ravine where we found him. 

           BACK WITH SOLOMON

           As he realizes the gravity of his predicament -- his bleeding 
           wound... exposure to the elements... his girls, now alone... 
           likely with Kurt and Lamar... likely the doing of Old Luc...
           He pulls HIS BELT from his pants, uses it to fasten around 
           his waist. A makeshift tourniquet.

                                 SOL
                        Get up... Get up... 
                             (then)
                        ... the fuck up, Solomon!

           He rises unsteadily, leans against a tree, rests his forehead 
           against the frozen, peeling bark. Moans deep, guttural. 

           After a long moment, he turns back to the ravine... searching 
           for something... muttering:

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        Find yer camp. Just find camp. Find 
                        camp, Sol, find yer girls.

           His eyes scan the blanket of snow beneath him... lock on 
           tracks... human tracks. 

           Sol follows the tracks, keeping pressure on his makeshift 
           tourniquet with his left elbow.

           EXT. CAMP FIRE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sol hobbles into camp, fire coals still smoldering. His girls 
           sleeping bags still here... but empty. 

           He rests for a moment, thinks, notices the heavy rucksack is 
           gone, it’s outline still etched in the snow.

                                 SOL
                        ... Luc.

           His boots within reach, he tugs them on, laces them up. 
           Checks his wound and grimaces at the sight. 

           He spots his HUNTING KNIFE buried partially in the snow. Jams 
           it into the remaining fire coals and lets it char. 

           Sol removes his tourniquet belt and peels up his shirt. 

           Eyes the mess... 

           Curses to himself... 

           Pulls the knife from the fire...

           Bites down on his belt, and... 

           PSSSHHHH! AS HE PRESSES THE FIRE-HOT BLADE AGAINST HIS WOUND. 
           His skin fries as he chomps his belt and GROWLS in pain.

           He removes the knife, cools it off in the snow. Checks his 
           wound: a mangled mess of dried blood and charred skin. 

           He collapses onto a sleeping bag and rests his eyes. Tries to 
           forget the pain.

           EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY

           HORSE TRACKS in the snow. The uncles and sisters up ahead, 
           moving slowly through thick trees and brush. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

           Sol sits up, searches the campsite for supplies. 

           Packs a sleeping bag, bow and arrow sleeve, hunting knife. 
           Piles snow into his metal pot, places the pot atop the coals 
           and leaves it to boil.

           LATER,

           Sol chokes down half the pot, pours the rest in a canister.

           He stands and searches the surrounding area for tracks. He 
           finds them... those same HORSE TRACKS. 

           EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY

           Sol is on the right trail. No horses or girls in sight, but 
           the tracks are still fresh and they’re easy to follow.

           FURTHER ALONG THE PATH

           Sol breaths hard, heaving for air. He takes a breather 
           against a tree. Looks about and notices...

           THAT SAME FOX

           watching him through a thicket of brush. Ears perked up, eyes 
           ever-weary, like it’s stalking wounded prey -- a meal worth 
           waiting for. 

           Sol checks his wound. Still bleeding, but not as profusely. 
           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

           The uncles’ horses stomp through the snow-covered woods. 
           Ginny holds onto Kurt. Lamar holds Emma firmly in his grasp. 

           Emma cranes her neck to look behind Lamar, searching for any 
           sign of her father. 

                                 LAMAR
                        Whatchew lookin fer?

                                 EMMA
                        Just lookin. 

           She turns to search around the other side of Lamar, who seems 
           wary now.

                                 LAMAR
                        Said what the hell you lookin fer?

                                 EMMA
                        I’m just lookin, damn. I ain’t 
                        allowed to look around, now?

           Lamar looks behind him, same way as Emma. And Emma turns to 
           look ahead, notices a TREE BRANCH hanging within reach. 

           Just before Lamar turns to face her, she SNAPS IT so it’s 
           hanging by a thread. 

                                 LAMAR
                        Ain’t nothin back there.

                                 EMMA
                        No shit.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE - DAY

           A FIRE-PIT filled with icy logs. THREE TENTS already 
           constructed. 

           Emerging from a thicket, Darrel aides Old Luc in heaving 
           another log near the fire-pit, as, in the distance:

           Those two horses mosey into the snow-covered clearing, 
           carrying the girls and their uncles.

                                 DARREL
                        There they is, Luc. Mind my 
                        leavin’, now?
                                 OLD LUC
                        Stay the night. I have use fer you 
                        still.

                                 DARREL
                        But y’said...

                                 OLD LUC
                        I said stay the night.

           Darrel nods, sits by the pit, obedient as a broken dog.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Girls.

                                 GINNY
                        Pappaw!

           The uncles tie their horses to trees and follow the girls as 
           they approach their grandfather.

                                 EMMA
                        Seen our Daddy?

                                 OLD LUC
                        I did. He gone back to town. We’ll 
                        take ya to him in the morn’. 

                                 EMMA
                        Why?

                                 KURT
                        Cause he wanted us to bring ya back 
                        to’im.

                                 EMMA
                        No, why’d he go back without us?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Didn’t say.

                                 GINNY
                        Prolly left on the lights. He hates 
                        it when we leave on the lights.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Could be, Gin. Could be that.

           Emma, clearly not convinced, doesn’t offer a response. Just a 
           shake of the head. All of this stinks and she can smell it.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                             (to Kurt)
                        Take the girls to their tent. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Show’em where to use the bathroom.
                             (then)
                        And don’t let’em outta yer sight.

           Kurt and Lamar escort the girls toward their tent as we...

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. THE GIRLS TENT - LATER

           Emma and Ginny sit facing one another. Ginny twirls a boot 
           lace, her face oblivious to the world around them.

                                 EMMA
                        Gin, do you understand what’s 
                        happening here?

                                 GINNY
                        Hmm?

                                 EMMA
                        I mean, you understand that Daddy 
                        didn’t leave us, right?

                                 GINNY
                        He sent Pappaw to get us.

                                 EMMA
                        He did not. Daddy wouldn’t do that, 
                        Gin. It don’t make no damn sense. 
                        He wouldn’t do it.

                                 GINNY
                        Only for tonight, Emma. We’ll see 
                        Daddy come tomorrow. At home. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t think you understand... 

           Emma studies the innocent face of her sister. The hope in her 
           eyes. The very definition of “ignorance is bliss.”

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        You’re prolly right. Daddy’s just 
                        waiting at home. We’ll see’im soon.

           Emma gazes above, through the see-through netting of the tent 
           as snow falls through bare tree branches. Snow falling...
           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - SAME

           ... just like it’s falling above Sol as he searches for more 
           broken branches.

           Sure enough, he finds ANOTHER broken branch. Emma’s leading 
           him right to their camp. 

           He kneels, sucks his water bottle, and checks his wound: 
           still trickling blood. 

           Sol gathers himself and sets off through the trees ahead, in 
           the direction of the next broken branch.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Old Luc rises from the fire he’s built, turns to Kurt:

                                 OLD LUC 
                        Fire some beans.
                             (re: Lamar)
                        Don’t let him near the flames.

           He turns and traverses the camp toward...

           INT. THE GIRLS TENT - SAME

           Emma and Ginny hold hands, still facing one another.

                                 EMMA
                        Just close your eyes.

                                 GINNY
                        Why’re we praying?

                                 EMMA
                        Cause we need to, okay. Just do it. 
                        Close your eyes.

           Ginny does and Emma does too.

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Dear, Lord. We pray for you to keep 
                        our Daddy safe. We pray that you 
                        watch over him down here.

                                 GINNY
                        And that you watch over Momma up 
                        there.
           EXT. THE GIRLS TENT - SAME

           Old Luc leans near the tent, listens to the girls’ prayer.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Right. Watch over our Momma too. We 
                        hope she is safe and happy with 
                        you. And that she is watching over 
                        us too.

                                 GINNY (O.S.)
                        We love you, Momma. 

           INT. THE GIRLS TENT - SAME

           Emma squints at her sister, in awe of her innocence.

                                 EMMA
                        We do. We love you. And we love 
                        Daddy too. 
                             (then)
                        Please, Lord, bring him back to us.   
                        Please?

                                 GINNY
                        And thank you.

                                 EMMA
                        Thank you. Amen.

                                 GINNY
                        Amen. 

           Ginny smiles. Emma smiles back. And Old Luc peels open the 
           tent door.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Amen.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE - MOMENTS LATER

           THE FIRE CRACKLES below a charred pot of beans. Kurt and 
           Lamar rip into the deer jerky they took from Sol’s camp. 

           The girls sit before the fire opposite their uncles and 
           Darrel, who’s very uncomfortable.

           Old Luc nears the fire, carrying Sol’s HEAVY RUCKSACK. He 
           lowers it before the fire, sits on a log behind it.

                                 EMMA
                        My Dad give you that?
                                 OLD LUC
                        Returned it to me, yes.

                                 EMMA
                             (to Kurt and Lamar)
                        My Daddy give you’at jerky, too?

                               KURT
                                                             LAMAR
                  Naw, he didn’t.
                                                 Sure did.

           Kurt eyes Lamar, shakes his head ever so slightly.

                                 KURT
                        Gave it to us to give to you. 

                                 EMMA
                        Then why you eating it?

                                 KURT
                        Just testing it. Make sure it’s 
                        safe for you.

           Kurt hands the remaining jerky to the girls. 

           Emma offers a piece to Ginny, bites into one of her own, 
           never taking her eyes off Kurt. 

                                 EMMA
                             (re: Darrel)
                        And who the hell’s this?

           Darrel glances to Old Luc as if for approval. A slight nod 
           from Luc and:

                                 DARREL
                        Name’s Darrel Quarles. I help yer 
                        daddy at the cemetery.

                                 EMMA
                        He ask you to look after us too?

                                 DARREL
                             (disgusted with himself)
                        He did.

           Old Luc reaches into the chest pocket of his winter coat, 
           pulls out a weathered wallet. Flips it open, finds something 
           in a wrinkled flap: a flattened DOGWOOD FLOWER.

                                 GINNY
                        What’s that, Pappaw?

           Luc ignores her. He’s in a world of his own.
                                 KURT
                        Dogwood Flower. Surely, yer maw 
                        tolt you the tale.

                                 GINNY
                        Doggy wood?

           Old Luc sucks down a shot of barrel bourbon, dabs the 
           remnants from his lips.

                                 OLD LUC
                        The Tale of the Dogwood Flower. 
                        T’was a favorite of yer mother’s.

           As Old Luc speaks, he stares at the flower, fixated.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        At the time of the crucifixion of 
                        Christ, the Dogwood had been the 
                        size of the oak and other giants of 
                        the forest. So firm and strong was 
                        the tree, that it was chosen as 
                        timber for the cross. 

           Ginny leans in closer, very interested. But Emma just studies 
           the campsite. Her uncles, her grandfather, the tents and that 
           strange, heavy rucksack before Old Luc’s seat. 

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        To be used for such a purpose 
                        greatly distressed the tree. And 
                        Jesus, as he was nailed upon it, 
                        sensed this. In His pity for all 
                        sorrow and suffering, Jesus said 
                        unto the tree: “Because of your 
                        regret and pity for My suffering, 
                        never again shall the Dogwood grow 
                        large enough to be cut for the 
                        cross.” He told the tree:
                             (now looking at the girls)
                        “Henceforth, ye shall be slender 
                        and bent and twisted and your 
                        blossoms shall be in the form of a 
                        cross. Two long petals and two 
                        short petals, each with nail 
                        prints, brown with rust and stained 
                        red as blood. In the center of your 
                        flower shall be a crown of thorns, 
                        and all who see you will remember. 
                        They will know of My suffering and 
                        of My forgiveness. They shall see 
                        the Dogwood Flower, and they shall 
                        never forget our sacrifice.”
           Old Luc hands the flower to the girls. As they inspect it, 
           they notice the nail prints on each petal, the resemblance of 
           a crown in the center. 

           Ginny is awed. Emma? Skeptical.

                                 EMMA
                        At’s all horseshit.

                                 LAMAR
                        Why you reckon’at?

                                 EMMA
                        Cause if He could change how a tree 
                        grows, He coulda saved my momma. 
                        But He didn’t, now did He.

           Emma hands the flower back to Old Luc, never meets his 
           unblinking eyes as he throws back another tumbler of bourbon.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Tolt yer mother that story many-a-
                        time. She believed in it.

                                 GINNY
                        I believe it.

                                 OLD LUC
                        You would. Yer just like’er, Gin. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sure she believed in a lotta 
                        things ‘fore she passed.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Yer mother gave me that there 
                        flower so I’d never fergit that 
                        story. So I’d never fergit His 
                        forgiveness.
                             (then)
                        So I’d never fergit her.

                                 EMMA
                        If you need a flower to remember 
                        all that, then I reckon you best 
                        git some post-it notes.
                             (then)
                        Come on, Ginny.

           Emma moves toward her tent. Motions for Ginny to follow her. 
           Toward Emma:
                                 OLD LUC
                        The Dogwood flower represents the 
                        Lord’s divine ability to forgive 
                        those who do things they are forced 
                        to do, who do things that are wrong 
                        but that must be done. Remember 
                        that. You look at that flower and 
                        you remember what your mother 
                        believed. 

           Luc slugs another shot as Emma stalks away from the fire, 
           disappears into the tent.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Go on, Gin. Get to sleep, now.
                             (looking at that rucksack)
                        Tomorrow is a new day. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

           Sol stalks through the thick of nightfall. Only light from 
           the rays of the moon peeking through the canopy above. 

           Ahead, Sol can barely make out a flickering orange signature 
           burning against the horizon. A beacon for the lost.

           Hope in his eyes, he limps along. Moth to a flame.

           INT. THE GIRLS TENT - NIGHT

           As the girls settle into their sleeping bags, Emma turns to 
           her sister, very seriously:

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t you believe what he says.

                                 GINNY
                        Pappaw don’t lie. 

                                 EMMA
                        You just don’t believe it, okay. 
                        Don’t no one get to do wrong and 
                        get away with it, y’hear? 

                                 GINNY
                        But Pappaw says--

                                 EMMA
                        --what he wants to hear. Don’t make 
                        it right.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (cont'd)
                        Try to sleep. We’re gonna need to 
                        rest ‘fore sun-up.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL -- NIGHT

           Sol nears the campsite, that glowing ember now a roaring fire 
           that he can see through the clearing. 

           A RUSTLING nearby pulls his attention. He quickly nocks an 
           arrow, draws the string, stalks slowly in that direction.

           Near another Evergreen, he spots:

           THAT SAME FOX

           feasting on something. Sol approaches, notices it’s 
           scavenging off of:

           THE PACK MULE’S CORPSE

           splayed beneath the tree, its entrails tugged by the animal.

           Sol covers his mouth and retches as the fox hightails it 
           outta there.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE -- NIGHT

           The four men surround the glowing fire, sharing that jug of 
           barrel bourbon, flames reflected in Luc’s dark eyes.

           Kurt strums his guitar absentmindedly, playing some faint 
           memory of a tune.

                                 OLD LUC 
                        Come sun-up, we head back. The 
                        girls ride with you two. 
                             (re: the rucksack)
                        She’s with me. 

           Lamar nods, bites some left-over jerky. But Kurt just keeps 
           playing.

                                 DARREL
                        What about me? What’s it you want 
                        me fer?

                                 OLD LUC
                        In due time...
           Old Luc rises, heaves that rucksack into his arms like a baby 
           and strides toward his tent. But behind him:

           Kurt’s guitar playing goes out of tune. Is he crying again?

                                 LAMAR (O.S.)
                        Kurt? What’s wrong, Kurt?

           Old Luc half-turns toward the fire, sees:

           KURT

           still strumming that guitar absentmindedly, in shock at the 
           sight of the:

           WOODEN ARROW

           that has pierced through both his guitar’s soundhole and his 
           stomach, nailing the guitar to him like a framed photo. 

           It’s an eerie sight and an even eerier sound. Like he’s 
           determined to keep playing, to ignore the fatal wound.

           Calmly, Old Luc hoists that rucksack over the rear of Kurt’s 
           horse, barks at Lamar:

                                 OLD LUC
                        Get the girls.

           Kurt coughs up a thick mess of blood, slumps to the ground 
           atop his guitar.

                                 LAMAR
                        Git up, Kurt. Quit yer playin’, git 
                        up! Kurt? KURT!

           Old Luc ignores his son’s suffering, douses the campfire with 
           a snow-filled bucket and what happens next we can hardly see 
           but by the filtered moonlight through the canopy above.

                                 OLD LUC
                        You get’em girls now, boy.

           Lamar wipes his eyes, strides through the snow to the girls’ 
           tent.

           Old Luc reaches into a pouch hanging from Kurt’s horse, 
           retrieves a PATTERSON COLT REVOLVER and lowers himself to a 
           knee by the beast.

           And he waits... waits... waits...
           THWACK! An arrow spears through Lamar’s thigh. A SCREAM as...

           Old Luc eyes the arrow’s origin:

           A THICKET OF BRUSH

           not ten yards from the camp.

           Luc swiftly aims that revolver, steadies, and PWOP! fires as 
           a plume of gunpowder rises before his face.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - THAT MOMENT

           The dark moonlit expanse of a silent Appalachian winter 
           broken by the rippling thunder of gunshots.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE -- SAME

           Luc advances toward the thicket, fires again, again, again.

           PWOP! PWOP! PWOP!

           He pushes branches and bushes aside, expecting to find a dead 
           Solomon before him, but there’s no one. 

           Just a depression of blood-soaked snow.

           Old Luc smirks slightly -- he now knows that Sol’s bleeding 
           out and may never make it home alive.

           EXT. FOREST PATH -- MOMENTS LATER

           Old Luc straddles the lead horse, Ginny in front of him.

           Darrel follows, that heavy rucksack over his horse’s rear.

           Lamar holds Emma firmly as before, following Luc’s lead, that 
           arrow still jutting from his thigh.

           He SNAPS the arrow, slides it through his wound.

                                 GINNY
                        What happened, Pappaw?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Hunters hunting. At’s all, Gin.

           He cracks the reigns, propels the horse up a ravine, moving 
           to higher ground. 
           Darrel and Lamar’s horses follow, Emma straining to look 
           behind her, a defiant hope in her young eyes. 

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE -- NIGHT

           Sol limps into the clearing toward the smoldering coals and 
           dying embers of the campfire. He’s holding his thigh, keeping 
           pressure on a BULLET HOLE through his trousers.

           He twists Kurt’s body onto his back -- still breathing...

           Frisks Kurt’s pockets, finds a handful of SHOTGUN SHELLS,  
           looks to the fire and then to his wound. He knows what to do.

           No words needed, Sol rips the arrow from Kurt’s body, uses 
           snow to clean blood from the wood, slips it back in his arrow 
           sleeve, and rolls Kurt back onto that guitar. 

           Lets him die slowly and alone. 

           He unearths the buried fire, uncovers still-burning embers, 
           blows life back into the flames.

           He rips open his pants, reveals the bleeding bullet wound. 

           Stabs an arrow into the fire and lets it char.

           Similar to before, he slips off his belt, bites down on the 
           leather, takes the arrow tip and...

           DIGS INTO THE BULLET HOLE. 

           He gnaws on that belt, growls and grimaces as he feels around 
           for the bullet and... finally... pops it out.

           He breaths hard, relieved, but he’s gotta close the wound. 

           He bites off the ends of two shotgun shells and pours a shot 
           of gunpowder from each into his palm.

           Sol growls as he packs the powder into his wound and snags a 
           still-burning twig from the fire. 

           He uses the twig to ignite the gunpowder and... 

           SSSSCRACK! as it sparkles and pops, burning the bullet wound 
           closed in an instant.

           Overwhelmed by the pain, Sol struggles to keep his eyes open, 
           to pour more gunpowder for his knife wound. 

           His hand shakes as he rips off the tip of another shotshell 
           and pours the powder into his palm, lifts his shirt, but...
           The pain’s too much. He collapses to the snow and passes out.

                                                               OVER BLACK:

           THE FAINT CRUNCH of horse hooves against snow and rock. 

           FADE UP ON:

           EXT. FOREST PATH -- MORNING

           The horses traverse a steep mountain path, something carved 
           by centuries of migration and weather.

           Lamar puts pressure on his thigh wound as he barks at Luc:

                                 LAMAR
                        We cain’t juss leave’im, paw.

           Old Luc stares ahead, focused on what must be done. 

                                 LAMAR (cont’d)
                        Paw! We gotta go back, we gotta git 
                        Kurt! Paw?

           Old Luc stops his horse, whips the reigns so he can see Lamar 
           as he speaks.

                                 OLD LUC
                        He’s gone, Lamar! He ain’t comin 
                        back and we ain’t goin back, y’hear?

                                 LAMAR
                        But he’d go back fer us.

                                 OLD LUC
                        No he wouldn’t neither.

                                 LAMAR
                        He’d go back fer me.

                                 OLD LUC
                        He’d do what had to be done. And 
                        he’d expect you t’do the same.

           Old Luc whips the horse back up the trail, leaving Lamar and 
           Emma to watch Darrel follow him like a lap dog.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S CAMPSITE -- MORNING

           Sol stirs awake, shivering and still exhausted. Musters the 
           strength to kick the fire coals, to salvage remaining heat. 
           But the fire’s dead.

           He checks his bullet wound. Charred and burnt skin. That’s 
           gonna leave a scar.

           He peels up his shirt, checks the knife wound, still 
           trickling blood. 

           Shotshells still in-hand, he searches for a coal hot enough 
           to restart the fire. But they’re all cold to the touch. 

           He can’t burn the knife wound closed without fire, so he 
           pockets the shells and pulls himself to an unsteady stance. 

           Eyes Kurt’s corpse. Glad that fucker’s dead.

           And pushes off through the camp, toward the direction he saw 
           those horses escape.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- DAY

           Those horses carry their riders over a ridge, finally finding 
           some level ground.

           EXT. FOREST PATH -- SAME

           Sol drags that injured leg behind him as he follows the horse 
           tracks up the mountain. His will the only thing that’s 
           carrying him now. A man possessed.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CREEK -- DAY

           Old Luc and the horses follow a slow-flowing creek, moving 
           down the mountain.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- SAME

           Sol drags himself onto that same ridge the horses found hours 
           ago. Downs his water canister and follows the tracks ahead. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN GORGE -- LATER

           The horses traversing an icy valley. The cold almost palpable 
           for us as the girls and Darrel shiver through the fog.

           Always on her game, Emma slips A FLASHLIGHT from Lamar’s 
           cargo pocket and drops it to the ground behind her.
           EXT. ANOTHER FOREST PATH -- AFTERNOON

           Old Luc leads his crew back up the mountain. Lamar and the 
           girls just as confused as we are.

           But Old Luc knows exactly what he’s doing.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CREEK -- SAME

           Sol slipping and tumbling his way down the mountain. No 
           choice but to keep moving.

           EXT. ANOTHER MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- NIGHT

           Beaten and broke-backed, the horses crest the peak, find 
           relief from level ground again. 

                                 LAMAR
                        Paw?

           Old Luc’s eyes pierce the night air, focused on the moonlit 
           peaks and ridges in the distance.

                                 LAMAR (cont’d)
                        We lost? Where we goin?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Far as we gotta.

                                 LAMAR
                        Paw, we needa bury Kurt. And my 
                        leg’s hurtin’ somethin’ awful. 
                        Cain’t we go home?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Not till it’s done.

                                 LAMAR
                        Till what’s done? Paw!

                                 EMMA
                             (realizing)
                        Till my Daddy’s done.
                             (to Old Luc)
                        He won’t stop.

           Old Luc keeps his eyes ahead, but somewhere behind that 
           fierce façade we may infer that he knows it’s true.

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        You know he won’t. He’s comin fer 
                        you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Sure as the devil is waiting, he is 
                        comin fer you. Won’t let up till 
                        it’s yer grave he digs.
                             (to Lamar and Darrel)
                        All a you.

           Old Luc ignores her, urges his horse forward. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN GORGE -- NIGHT

           Sol limps through a freezing night fog, scouting for a dry 
           patch of land to rest upon. 

           Barely awake, he actually kicks THAT FLASHLIGHT, picks it up 
           and smirks as he turns it on.

                                 SOL
                        That’s my girl. 

           He stumbles along, using his new light to gather any pine 
           needles he can find, stuffs them in a pocket to dry them out.

           For some reason, a birch tree catches his eye. He limps to 
           it, feels the bark, wet to the touch like every other tree.

           But there’s a DRY PATCH where rain and snow have yet to soak 
           through. He snags his hunting knife and pops off any dry bark 
           he can. Stuffs that in his pocket too.

           He spots A FALLEN OAK, could be used as a windbreak. So he 
           stumbles toward it and collapses to the frozen bracken.

           He empties his pockets and backpack. Pulls the contents 
           together to build a fire.

           Barely dry PINE NEEDLES. 

           Hardly dry slivers of TREE BARK. 

           A piece of STEEL WOOL.

           And that FLASHLIGHT. 

           Sol clears a small area of snow, exposing the wet dirt 
           beneath, and spreads the pine needles atop a piece of bark.

           He twists off the cap of the flashlight, squeezes the 
           lightbulb and CCCCRACK! as it shatters.

           He clicks the flashlight on and SP-SP-SPARK! from the 
           filament. Just what he needs.
           Sol puts the steel wool and flashlight filament together atop 
           the pine needles. 

           He clicks on the flashlight again and...

           WHOOSH! as the filament sparks against the steel wool and 
           ignites the pine needles.

           Sol blows life into the fire, drops more pine needles on top. 

           Plants that tree bark about the fire like an Indian Teepee.

           He nurtures the fire till it’s large enough to sustain 
           itself, then scours his nearby surroundings for firewood.

           Finds pieces of DEADFALL, drags them near the fire to dry. 

           His hands still shivering, breath still fogging, he embraces 
           the fire’s warmth, lets it give him life as he did it.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- NIGHT

           The men tie their horses to twisted spruce trees flagged with 
           leaves only on their leeward side.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Gather firewood, I’ll set up camp.

           Lamar nods, limps into the wilderness as he reaches for his 
           flashlight. But he can’t find it... Wonder why.

           He turns back to Old Luc, summons the courage to state:

                                 LAMAR
                        Cain’t find muh light.

           Old Luc murmurs to himself, tosses his flashlight to his son.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Only one we got, don’t lose it.

           Lamar nods, flips on the light and lumbers away.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        That boy’s a disease. 

           Old Luc fetches two tents and erects them by moonlight. 

           Ginny, Emma and Darrel watch on. No way they’re doing 
           anything till he tells ‘em to. 
           EXT. MOUNTAIN GORGE -- NIGHT

           Sol has the fire going now, pulls a can of Chef Boyardee 
           ravioli from his pack. Cuts it open with his knife.

           He places his metal pot atop the fire, shakes the can and the 
           pasta flops into the pot... frozen solid.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- NIGHT

           The tents now erected, Lamar and Darrel break soggy logs into 
           pieces, set them around an already-roaring fire.

           Old Luc warms a pot of beans, mutters to the girls:

                                 OLD LUC
                        Si’down, git warm.

           They do as they’re told, breathe in the warmth.

           Lamar sits down, as well, hands freezing from the moisture in 
           the wood, leg raw and ragged, lost a lotta blood already.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        I say you could rest? 

           Lamar rises to a haggard stance, snaps another frozen log. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN GORGE -- NIGHT

           Sol scarfs down that ravioli from the now-charred pot. 
           Couldn’t possibly eat it any faster.

           Lets out a belch and peels up his shirt.

           His wound looks even worse. Might be infected. 

           He snags those shotshells from his pocket, pours two shots 
           into his palm and packs it into his wound. That’s gotta hurt.

           He leans against the fallen Oak and, like before, uses a 
           still-burning twig to ignite the gunpowder and...

           SSSSCRACK! as it bursts into flame and seals the wound closed 
           in an instant. He screams shortly and...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- SAME

           Darrel, Lamar, and the girls startle as Sol’s DISTANT HOWL 
           echoes from the gorge below.
           Lamar glances at Old Luc, but he just ignores the sound. Much 
           ado about nothing for him.

                                 DARREL
                        Jesus, he’s comin’. He done found us.

           Darrel lurches to a stance, motions to Lamar.

                                 DARREL (cont’d)
                        Come on, now. We gotta get. 

           But Lamar just glances to Luc, knows who the boss is here.

                                 DARREL (cont’d)
                        What’s the hold up, dammit? 
                             (realizing, to Luc:)
                        He ain’t stoppin’. The sumbitch 
                        ain’t gone stop.

                                 OLD LUC
                        I know.

                                 DARREL
                        Kill us all is what he’ll do. 
                        Slaughter us like fuckin’ sheep.

                                 OLD LUC
                        I know.

                                 DARREL
                        Jesus, how the hell’d I get roped 
                        into all this? 
                             (to girls:)
                        I didn’t mean’im no harm. Weren’t 
                        my intentions. Self-preservation, 
                        y’know?
                             (then...)
                        I’ll explain it to him. He’ll 
                        understand. We’re friends. Friends 
                        forgive, right? 
                             (to girls:)
                        Ain’t that right?

           Emma just smirks, glances right into the man’s pupils...

                                 EMMA
                        My daddy sure as hell don’t.

                                 DARREL
                        Aw, hell! Holy hell! I don’t wanna 
                        die, goddammit.
                             (to Luc)
                        Please, I don’t wanna die.
                                 OLD LUC
                        ... I know.

           PRACK! as Old Luc sledges a kick through Darrel’s kneecap, 
           toppling the poor man in an instant.

           Darrel on his back, dragging his broken leg from the fire.

                                 DARREL
                        AHHHH! Please, Luc. Awright. I got 
                        no quarrel with you. Leave me be. 

           Luc stalking after him, slowly, like a puma readying to 
           pounce on prey as...

           Emma pulls Ginny into her chest, strokes her hair.

                                 EMMA
                        Shhh. S’alright. S’okay. 

                                 GINNY 
                        Where’s daddy, Emma? Where is he?

                                 EMMA
                        At home. He’s at home.

                                 GINNY
                        No, he ain’t.

                                 EMMA
                        Shhhh. Had to turn off the lights, 
                        like y’said.

           Ginny’s crying now, and Emma might as well be as she eyes Luc 
           approaching the broken man. 

                                 OLD LUC
                        Yer time has come, Darrel.

                                 DARREL
                        But you got use fer me, still. 
                        Remember?

                                 OLD LUC
                        I do.

           Luc flips open his pocketknife and within the firelight gleam 
           we may notice the fight drain from Darrel -- acceptance.

           Eyes brimming with tears, Darrel studies the faces of the 
           girls before him. Their innocence, their youth, their very 
           beauty magnified in this moment.
                                 DARREL
                             (to girls)
                        Tell yer daddy I’m sorry--

           SHINK! OLD LUC’S KNIFE INTO DARREL’S THROAT and Darrel’s 
           sprawled in the snowpack, WHEEZING DESPERATELY for breath.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN GORGE -- SAME

           DISTANT SCREAMING echoes through the valley, stirs Sol awake.

           He spots that fire atop the ridge, certain it’s his girls.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- SAME

           THE GIRLS SCREAMING as Darrel bleeds out beside the firepit. 

                                 DARREL
                             (muddled, choking)
                        Help, hel... Please, hel... Plea...

           Darrel’s hands around the knife in his throat, rivulets of 
           blood through his fingers, the snow beneath him growing dark 
           red as if the earth is bleeding too.

           Old Luc straddles the dying man, stares into his eyes, into 
           his soul. Studies him as if entranced by death.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Thank you fer yer assistance.

           Darrel, eyes already lifeless, drops his hands to the snow at 
           his sides and Old Luc softly closes his eyelids, slides that 
           pocketknife from the hole in his neck, glides into the dark 
           night air as gently as the rising firesmoke before him.

           Turns to face his granddaughters, eerily calm:

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        In yer tent. 

           They’re still screaming, terrified, but too frightened to run 
           from a man with a weapon.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Now.

           Emma pulls Ginny into the tent, closes the flap behind them.
           EXT. MOUNTAIN GORGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Solomon collects his gear, his backpack and arrow sleeve as 
           the SHRIEKS from the ridge die out.

           Keeping his eyes on that ridge fire, he stalks through the 
           fog-filled forest, a new desperation pushing him along.

           EXT. FOREST PATH -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sol drags himself up that same path the horses took. As quick 
           as he can.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE -- EVEN LATER

           Sol crests the mountain, stands atop that ridge and stalks in 
           the direction of the fire.

           EXT. OLD LUC’S RIDGE CAMPSITE -- NIGHT

           The fire licks at falling snow, casting moving shadows about 
           the frame of...

           DARREL’S CORPSE

           perched upright on a rock, back to the approaching Solomon. 

           Sol nocks an arrow, draws his bowstring, and stalks around 
           Darrel. A hoarse whisper:

                                 SOL
                        Turn ‘round.

           He waits for a response, any sign of movement.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        Turn around, I said.

           He pokes Darrel’s shoulder with a boot-tip and...

           Darrel collapses to the snow, face up, knife wound through 
           his bloody neck.

           Immediately, Sol spins around, aiming that arrow in every 
           direction, certain he’s stepped into a trap.

           ... Which he has.

           PWOP! PWOP! Two shots and Solomon’s on his back, hit in both 
           his shoulders.
           Suddenly, Old Luc’s overtop of him, Patterson Revolver 
           leveled between his eyes, poised to pull the trigger.

           But Old Luc just smirks, sparks with an idea, and SMACK! as 
           he slams the butt of the gun into Sol’s temple.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

                          GINNY (V.O.)
                                                         EMMA (V.O.)
                 Daddy? Daddy, wake up!
                                                DADDY!!!

           FADE BACK IN:

           INT. LOG CABIN -- MORNING

           Solomon awakens strapped to a chair by FRAYED NYLON ROPE, 
           notices he’s in his own cabin (the one we saw in that photo). 

           Years of wear here. Collected dust and stilted air. No one’s 
           been here in a long while.

           To his right:

           A DANK HALLWAY

           And the slightest glimpse of Old Luc forcing the girls into a 
           backroom and locking the door.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                             (from backroom)
                        Dad, get up! Get up, wake up!

           (Over what plays next, the girls will constantly SCREAM AND 
           STRUGGLE with the locked door. Making Old Luc’s words all the 
           more discomforting.)

           To Solomon’s left:

           A WEATHER-WORN LIVING ROOM. 

           Lamar on his back on a dust-coated couch. Skin pale, mouth 
           parched. Leg bloody and bare. 

           Old Luc stalks back down that hallway, strides into the room, 
           sits himself by his son’s side.

           Handles a wet rag from a water bucket, rings it over Lamar’s 
           cracked lips and sops up the bloodcrust from his open wound.
           Luc dunks the rag back into...

           THE WATER BUCKET

           and the water swirls blood-red. He soaks the rag full and 
           places it back on...

           LAMAR 

           who takes a snapshot glance at his father and breathes-out 
           with a final FWOOSH.  

           No final words or goodbyes. Just like that: dead without 
           notice or spectacle.

           As he pulls Lamar’s eyelids shut, he kisses his son’s 
           forehead and drapes the blood-wet rag over his face.

           A moment of silence as Luc prays and collects himself, then:

                                 OLD LUC
                             (to Sol)
                        Git ‘nough rest?

           Luc stands and takes a seat opposite the dusty oak-carved 
           table before Solomon.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Lamar sure will.

           Luc just lays that pocketknife on the table. Still closed.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        You kill Darrel in fronta them?

           Luc unbuckles his belt, drags it out of his belt loops.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Go’n then. Tell me what I’m in for.

           Luc ties that leather belt to a table leg, yanks it tight.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        I ain’t done nothin’ she didn’t ask 
                        of me. It’s what she wanted, Luc.

           Luc flips open the pocketknife, still stained with Darrel’s 
           dried blood, and sharpens it against that leather belt.

           Slow and deliberate.
                                 OLD LUC
                        When I’s a boy, my father was kilt 
                        in a hunting accident. Only it 
                        weren’t no accident. His buddy 
                        gone’n fell for my mother. So he 
                        went’n shot up my paw. Made it look 
                        right and lawful. Took up with my 
                        mother’n raised me up himself. 
                        Taught me to hunt’n fish and loved 
                        me like I’s his own. And then, I 
                        left fer the war. The day of my 
                        return home, I tolt him: “This is 
                        not yer family. May you now return 
                        to yours.” 
                             (as he stands:)
                        I gutted him as you might gut a 
                        pig, as that was his nature. Left 
                        him hanging from the bare branch of 
                        a Birch tree to drip his salt back 
                        to the earth like slit-up swine.

           Old Luc violently STABS the pocketknife into the oak table. 

           He stalks about the small room, boots clacking against the 
           floorboards. Studies...

           HIS DEAD SON 

           Stiff and lifeless. Wet rag already slipped off his cold, 
           pale face.

           Luc turns to the fireplace mantle filled with dust-layered 
           photos of Solomon’s family. 

           His eyes land and stay on a...

           PHOTO OF APRIL

           Beautiful and serene. Hair as golden as a wheat field. Smile 
           like a sunrise. The very definition of beauty and happiness.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Y’see, Solomon, if someone goes’n 
                        takes yer family, well, you take 
                        their life. It’s a simple matter. 
                        You took my family and now I have 
                        taken yours. You will die fer that. 
                        Or I will. Ain’t no way around it.
                             (then)
                        Y’don’t get to my age in a land as 
                        this without doing things of which 
                        you cannot speak.
           Old Luc moves back toward Solomon, yanks that pocketknife 
           from the table, opens and closes it repeatedly, slowly:

           FLICK. FLACK. FLICK. FLACK.

                                 SOLOMON
                        What is it you think I done?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Think? No, Solomon. I know of your 
                        actions, of your deceit and 
                        trickery. It cannot be tolerated. 

           FLICK. FLACK.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        A man’s family is all he has. All 
                        he needs. Take away the needs of a 
                        man, he’ll wither to the earth that 
                        begat him. No call for such an 
                        unwarranted thing.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You speakin’ a me or yerself?

                                 OLD LUC
                        My daughter chose you. She saw 
                        something in you and made it known.
                        You were not to be touched. I 
                        honored that. I honored her as I 
                        always had. But then you... 

           FLICK...

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        You got in her head. You took her 
                        from me, from her family. You 
                        changed her, warped her, molded’er 
                        into what you wanted. That ain’t 
                        honor. That ain’t husbandry or 
                        fatherhood. It’s sinister, my boy.

           ... FLACK.

                                 SOLOMON
                        That’s what got me here? She made 
                        her choices, Luc. Chose to let 
                        you’n her brothers go. She was 
                        happy without you. We was happy 
                        without--

                                 OLD LUC
                        You expect me to believe she would 
                        choose to ignore me? To shun me? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OLD LUC (cont'd)
                        To hurt me? The man who fed her, 
                        bathed her, clothed her, raised 
                        her, loved her. Y’expect me to 
                        believe my first born child would 
                        forget me!

           Old Luc’s steaming, now. Eyes on fire.

           FLICK-FLACK. FLICK-FLACK. FLICK-FLACK. Quicker. Manic.

           Solomon pulls at his bindings, offers only:

                                 SOLOMON
                        Believe what you will. Always have.

           FLICK! Old Luc whips that knife at Solomon and THWACK! as it 
           spears into the oak table before him.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Daddy! Say sumthin, dammit! Dad!

                                 SOLOMON
                             (to Emma)
                        I’m awrigh--

           In one swift motion, Old Luc grasps that pocketknife and 
           STABS it directly into one of Sol’s shoulder wounds.

           Solomon screams through his teeth, trying to stomach the 
           pain. Can’t let his girls hear him.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Them bullets won’t come out 
                        ‘emselves.

           Old Luc twists the knife, searching for the bullet within the 
           wound. TAP, TAP. Found it. But he doesn’t dig it out.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        In my company, there was a man 
                        called himself Jonah. Taught me of 
                        human anatomy. It’s how I came to 
                        my line a work. Showed me the 
                        strong and weak points of the 
                        body... Of yer body. 
                             (as if reading from a 
                             dictionary)
                        Deltoidius. Shoulder muscle 
                        separated into three parts. 
                        Anterior, lateral, posterior. The 
                        anterior deltoid raises the arm 
                        forward and is used in the initial 
                        phase of lifting. 
           SNIP! as Luc slices Solomon’s anterior deltoid muscle. 

           Solomon can’t hold back his scream this time. The girls panic 
           from the backroom, screaming and kicking the door.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        In the war, Jonah instructed us to 
                        take our P.O.W.’s and strap ‘em to 
                        a chair. Under his instruction, we 
                        severed their deltoids and had ‘em 
                        dig their own graves.

           He pulls the bullet out and STABS the knife into Sol’s other 
           shoulder wound. TAP, TAP. Finds the other bullet.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        You’ll be surprised how well y’can 
                        dig with only part a yer shoulders.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Don’t. You don’t gotta--

           SNIP! as Luc slices his other anterior deltoid. And then he 
           pulls out that bullet, stabs the knife back into the table.

           Solomon’s HYPERVENTILATING, doubled over in his chair.

           Old Luc strides over to a pot of water that’s been warming in 
           a furnace. Cleanses his bloody hands.

                                 OLD LUC
                        What yer gone be doin’, I cain’t 
                        have you lifting yer arms to me. 
                        Cain’t have you raising a weapon, 
                        iron or wooden. Cain’t have ye doin 
                        a thing but diggin’ the grave that 
                        yer meant to.

           Luc dries his hands on a rag, heaves that HEAVY RUCKSACK into 
           his arms and lowers it onto the table before Solomon.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Diggin’ the grave...

           He zips opens the rucksack and...

           APRIL’S LIFELESS FACE

           peaks from between the frozen zippers. Her eyes closed, face 
           blue and bloated, cold as the snow beyond the windows.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Fer her.
           Solomon and Old Luc meet eyes for the first time in this 
           conversation. And then...

           A gruff, gravelly, pain-filled whisper: 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Don’t.

           We’re not sure what he means by that, but Old Luc sure is.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Please. If there’s one thing you 
                        should be unable to do, it’s this.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Only right they know what kinda man 
                        you are.

                                 SOLOMON
                        This ain’t about them. She wouldn’t 
                        want it. You know that.

                                 OLD LUC
                        What would she want, then? This?

           Luc gestures toward the unzipped sack and April’s weather-
           warped appearance. Surely, no person would wish for this.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I made a promise. One I cain’t 
                        break.

                                 OLD LUC
                        I can’t believe that. I won’t. Not 
                        from a man like you...
                             (then)
                        Bout time yer daughters see what 
                        you’ve done to mine.

           Old Luc lumbers his way down that hallway toward the 
           backroom.

           Solomon just hangs his head. Arguing won’t change this. 

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Girls, y’can come out. Yer father 
                        and I have finished our dispute. 

           He unlocks the door, pushes it in...

           But there’s no one there.

           WHACK! as a thick piece of FIREWOOD comes within inches of 
           breaking Old Luc’s face.
           But he didn’t move, didn’t flinch. Just caught it. 

           He pulls the firewood away from Emma’s hands and corrals both 
           girls into the main room.

                                 EMMA
                        Let go a me, Goddamnit! Let go!

           Luc pushes the girls toward the rucksack, lets them take in 
           the sight, knowing they’ll be indisposed once they do.

                                 GINNY
                        Momma?

           Ginny puts her hands on the rucksack but Emma snatches them 
           away, covers her sister’s eyes.

                                 GINNY (cont’d)
                        It’s Momma.

                                 EMMA
                        No, it ain’t.

                                 GINNY
                        Why’s Momma in there?

           Emma just zips up the rucksack, hugs her little sister, and 
           burns holes through Old Luc from afar.

                                 EMMA
                        Weren’t our Momma, Gin. She’s in 
                        heaven. Heaven lookin’ over us.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Should be, Emma. She should be in 
                        heaven lookin’ over you. But she 
                        ain’t. She’s in that there bag. 
                        Like a rotting animal carcass. You 
                        thank yer father fer that.

           Emma’s pleading eyes look to Solomon who’s still hanging his 
           head, ashamed that it’s come to this.

                                 EMMA
                        Dad?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m sorry, Em.

                                 EMMA
                        Dad...

                                 SOLOMON
                        She made me promise. 
                                 EMMA
                        Promise what?

                                 SOLOMON
                        To bury her in the hills. On my 
                        family’s plot.

                                 EMMA
                        Why ain’t she just tell us? Why 
                        ain’t she tell everyone?

                                 SOLOMON
                             (re: Old Luc)
                        You think he’d’ve allowed it? Look 
                        at’im. He believes what he wants, 
                        not what is.

           Behind Old Luc’s fierce eyes we might detect a hint of 
           fragility, like he knows Sol’s right.

                                 OLD LUC
                        If yer mother wished to be buried 
                        here, she would have said it. But 
                        she wouldn’t want that. No, she 
                        would want to be buried with her 
                        ancestors. With her family.

                                 SOLOMON
                        We are her family! Us, not you. She 
                        knew you’d never allow me buried 
                        with her. She wanted to rest in 
                        peace with me by her side, plots 
                        saved for our girls and their 
                        children and their children’s 
                        children. Never to be disturbed by 
                        you and yer kin again.

           Old Luc takes Sol’s words like a shot to the chin. Refuses to 
           believe it no matter how much he fears it’s true.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Y’see, girls? The lies never stop. 
                        It’s the devil’s work, this one... 
                             (as he strides away)
                        The devil’s work.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CEMETERY -- DAY

           Old Luc escorts Solomon away from the cabin, toward an 
           ancient, weathered collection of headstones. 

           Probably the cemetery for some long dead mining village. 
           A century of brutal Appalachian winters have made the names 
           barely readable. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Why’re we here? 

                                 OLD LUC
                        You want her buried here, you dig 
                        the grave.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You ain’t gone leave’er. 

                                 OLD LUC
                        That remains to be seen.

           Luc drops a rusted PLANTING MATTOCK to the snow-topped dirt.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Git to work.

           Solomon just studies Old Luc, never realized how far gone his 
           mind was.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Dig.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I cain’t move my fuckin’ arms.

                                 OLD LUC
                        You can’t raise yer fucking arms. 
                        Yer anterior deltoids have been 
                        severed. Yer lateral and posteriors 
                        remain. Used for lateral and 
                        transverse extension. Meaning: you 
                        cain’t raise yer arms, but you can 
                        lower them... into the ground. 
                             (then)
                        Go’n and try it.

           Solomon kneels and grabs that mattock weakly. Pushes it into 
           the snow, slowly digs away. Like a dog would bury a bone. 

           Anytime he instinctively tries to raise his arms to gain more 
           power to dig with, he winces. It’ll take getting used to, but 
           this can be done. 

           Painful though it is, he can still dig.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Grave digger through and through. All 
                        y’ever were. All y’ever could be.
           INT. LOG CABIN, BACKROOM -- SAME

           The girls are locked in that room again. Emma peeks through a 
           boarded-up window, sees Solomon digging in the dirt, Old 
           Luc’s revolver trained on his back.

           Behind her, Ginny sits on a bone-bare bed, holds back tears.

                                 GINNY
                        Why’s Momma in that bag?

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t worry about that none.

                                 GINNY
                        But I thought- She’s s’posed to be 
                        in heaven.

                                 EMMA
                        She is.

                                 GINNY
                        Then why’s she...

                                 EMMA
                        Remember when dad told us what to 
                        do if we saw a bear?

                                 GINNY
                        To play...

                                 EMMA
                        Dead.

                                 GINNY
                        ... pretend. S’posed to play 
                        pretend.

                                 EMMA
                        Right. That’s all she’s doin’. She 
                        was playin’ pretend cause she knew 
                        we’d wanna see her. Now she’s back 
                        in heaven, awright?

           Emma kneels in front of her sister, wipes away a stray tear.

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Awright?

           Ginny nods, smiles bravely.
           EXT. MOUNTAIN CEMETERY -- DAY

           Solomon has dug a shallow grave. Sweat and dirt clinging to 
           his beaten body. 

           Old Luc sits on an overturned headstone. Revolver still aimed 
           at Sol, he swigs a flask and grimaces.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Ain’t gotta be deep. You git’er 
                        where you can by sundown, y’hear? 

                                 SOLOMON
                        What you gone do with my girls?

                                 OLD LUC
                        That don’t concern you none.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Concerns me quite a bit.

                                 OLD LUC
                        I’ll raise ‘em up the way you 
                        cain’t. Rest assured, they in good 
                        hands.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Same hands yer sons was in?

           Luc stops short of another swig from his flask, speaks with a 
           calm rage:

                                 OLD LUC
                        Same hands that’ll be ‘round yer 
                        throat, you mention ‘em again.

           INT. LOG CABIN, BACKROOM -- SAME

           Emma and Ginny peek through the boarded-up window, curious to 
           what Old Luc’s up to.

                                 GINNY
                        What’s he doing, Emma?

                                 EMMA
                        Diggin’, looks like.

                                 GINNY
                        Wha’for?

           Emma just sighs and moves away from the window, tries the 
           door again. Dead-bolted. 
                                 EMMA
                        Don’t worry about that. Just help 
                        me find a way outta here.

           The girls scour the room, the closet, drawers, beneath 
           furniture. Searching for weapons and exits.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CEMETERY -- AFTERNOON

           Luc throws back that flask, sucks down another shot, sighs as 
           the liquor warms him. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        She talked of you. Y’know that?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Keep diggin’.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Said she loved you, back when. 
                        ‘Fore May died.

                                 OLD LUC
                        A lifetime ago, that was. 

           Old Luc slugs another mouthful, coughs the liquor down.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Didn’t y’love May?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Course I did.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You’d a done anything fer her. 
                        Remember how y’was when me and 
                        April first married?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Did ev’thing I ever could.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Y’remember when you promised her 
                        you’d take her to see the ocean?

           Though Luc knows what Sol’s doing, he smirks. A welcomed 
           memory.

                                 OLD LUC
                        I do.
                                 SOLOMON
                        Couldn’t afford it, so we all 
                        pitched in t’help you paint yer 
                        bedroom like that postcard. 

           That strikes home for Luc. He sucks down another shot, savors 
           the fireburn in his throat.

                                 OLD LUC
                        She loved it. Said it was like 
                        sleepin’ on a beach every night. 
                        Damn woman, saw beauty in anything.

           Solomon stops digging, dirt and grime beneath his nails, 
           dried and cracking on his exposed skin.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You made a promise and you did all 
                        y’could to keep it.
                             (then...)
                        That’s all I done.

           INT. LOG CABIN, BACKROOM -- SAME

           All she could find, Emma piles discarded firewood in front of 
           the only door, finds a set of matches in her pocket.

           FLIT, FLIT, FLIT. Can’t get a spark.

           Tries another. FLIT, FLIT, FLIT... SSSSSPOOF! 

           The match ignites and Emma feeds it a wrinkled sheet.

           It burns slowly, charring and blackening the cloth. Then...

           WHOOSH! as it takes to flame. 

           Emma tosses it on the wood, lets it defrost the frozen bark, 
           her eyes reflecting the growing flame. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CEMETERY -- AFTERNOON

           Solomon bows his head, catches his breath. He doesn’t have 
           much left in him. 

                                 OLD LUC
                        You keep on.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Let us go, Luc. Just look the other 
                        way, let us walk home. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOLOMON (cont'd)
                        Lemme take my girls and bury my 
                        wife, way she wanted, and let us 
                        leave. Lemme do as my wife asked. 
                        Let me do what yer daughter 
                        wanted...

                                 OLD LUC
                        I may have been a good man once. 
                        Perhaps for a majority of my 
                        pathetic life, but no longer. That 
                        man died and rotted in me. Already 
                        decomposed and withered away with 
                        the wind. He’s but a spec of dust, 
                        now. I’ve lost all the good in my 
                        life. Lost all that made me who I 
                        was. All I have now is bitterness 
                        and hate. Festering in my innards, 
                        boiling my blood. I got only one 
                        way now.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I don’t believe that. I cain’t.

           Old Luc responds, not with pointed rage, but with an air of 
           inevitability:

                                 OLD LUC
                        You’ll believe it when my face is 
                        the last you see in this world.

           Solomon smells at the air. Turns his head toward...

           THAT CABIN

           Where a raging fire licks through its roof.

                                 SOLOMON
                        No...

           OLD LUC

           turns to the cabin, takes in the sight.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Git up. Git yerself up, now... 

           Solomon climbs from the shallow grave, starts for the cabin, 
           Old Luc on his heels, revolver still on him.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        Move, damn you!

           Solomon’s sprinting for the cabin, Old Luc pushing him along.
                                 SOLOMON
                        Emma? Ginny! EMMA!

           AT THE CABIN

           Solomon kicks at the front door, tries the doorknob but his 
           arms won’t work. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Get the door! Goddamn you, Luc, my 
                        arms are done. You git’em, dammit! 
                        Please, Luc!

           Old Luc digests the situation, decides:

                                 OLD LUC
                        Don’t you go nowheres.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Please.

           Old Luc SLAMS through the front door and a WALL OF SMOKE 
           swallows him.

           Solomon kneels in the snow, watches the smoke and flames 
           engulf the cabin.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        GINNY! EMMA!

           His watery eyes reflect the flames just like the doe eyes of:

                                 EMMA
                             (whispered)
                        Dad, over here. Dad!

           Solomon looks to his left where Emma helps Ginny out that 
           window and waves her dad over.

           He limps to his girls and they embrace him.

           INT. LOG CABIN -- SAME

           Smoke fills the air, the heat overwhelmingly palpable.

           Old Luc forces his way through the place, coughing between 
           barks:

                                 OLD LUC
                        Girls! Where is you? GIRLS! Where 
                        is you, dammit!
           Old Luc kicks in that charred door. Takes him a few tries to 
           push the firewood away, stumbles inside.

           IN THAT BACKROOM

           He waves the smoke away from his face, notices sunlight 
           exploding through that broken window.

           Knows immediately what’s happened.

           BACK IN THE MAIN ROOM

           Luc plows into that kitchen table, heaves April’s corpse 
           (still in the bag) over his shoulder.

           EXT. LOG CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Old Luc stampedes out the front door, falls into the snow 
           with April. Finds his breath and notices Sol’s gone.

           He stands, finds three sets of footprints leading into the 
           distant forest.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Bad girls. 
                             (to April’s corpse)
                        You should not have left them with 
                        that animal.

           That cabin burning behind him, Old Luc retrieves his revolver 
           and stalks after those footprints, his eyes darker than we’ve 
           ever seen them.

           IN THE FOREST

           Sol uses his girls as crutches to weave through the pines.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Keep movin’, keep movin’.

                                 EMMA
                        He won’t make it outta there.

                                 SOLOMON
                        He’ll make it outta anything.

                                 EMMA
                        Ain’t nothin’ but a mean old man.
                                 SOLOMON
                        He’s the fuckin’ devil!

           WITH OLD LUC

           As he enters the forest, eyes trained on the tracks before 
           him like a hunt-hungry bloodhound.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Girls! This is not yer fight! 
                        GIRLS! 

           WITH SOLOMON

           as he pulls the girls to a tree, has to rest his shoulders. 
           Catches his breath.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I cain’t use my arms. Goddamn him! 
                        I cain’t even run straight.

                                 EMMA
                        What do we do?

           Solomon composes himself, shuts his eyes for a moment.

                                 SOLOMON
                             (to himself)
                        My bow.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 SOLOMON
                        We gotta circle back ’round to the 
                        cabin.  
                             (to Gin)
                        Can you do that?

           Ginny just nods. Wide-eyed and terrified.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Good girl. It’ll be awright, ‘kay? 
                        It’s all gonna be awright, now.

           The girls each take an arm and help Sol limp through the snow-
           covered forest.
           WITH OLD LUC

           as he jogs after the trio of tracks before him, revolver at-
           the-ready.

           WITH SOLOMON AND THE GIRLS

           as they circle back out of the forest, towards the still-
           burning cabin ahead.

           But Sol pulls his girls back, eyes a low-hanging branch on a 
           pine tree. 

                                 SOL
                        Emma, can you reach that branch?

                                 EMMA
                        Come on, Dad, we gotta move.

                                 SOL
                        Dammit, can you reach the branch?

           Emma extends an arm for the branch Sol’s looking at. She can 
           reach it.

                                 SOL (cont’d)
                        Break it off. Quick.

           She struggles with it, twisting and bending it till...

           SSSSNAP! as it breaks clean from the tree.

           INT. LOG CABIN -- SUNSET

           Solomon cautiously traverses the burning cabin, finds his 
           arrow quiver and bow.

           EXT. LOG CABIN -- SAME

           Emma holds that branch, tries to see through the smoke-filled 
           doorway as Ginny kneels beside that heavy rucksack.

                                 GINNY
                        She’s back in heaven now?

                                 EMMA
                        That’s right. 

                                 GINNY
                        Then what’s in there?
           Emma turns around, pulls Ginny away from the rucksack.

                                 EMMA
                        Just don’t think about it none. 

           Ginny, still staring at that rucksack, just nods. Then...

           Sol stumbles out of the cabin, coughing quietly. Nods to Emma 
           and she SWEEPS AWAY their trail with that pine branch as they 
           move toward the opposite end of the clearing.

           WITH OLD LUC

           as he follows those tracks back toward the cabin. Finds only 
           tracks leading inside, none coming out.

           Searches the expanse of the clearing, can’t find any 
           disturbance. 

           EXT. FOREST -- WITH SOLOMON -- SUNSET

           Moving with the trio, Emma still clearing their tracks with 
           the pine branch. 

           They finally root themselves by a tree, spy on Luc from afar.

           EXT. LOG CABIN -- SAME

           Old Luc patiently studies the seemingly untouched terrain, 
           spots a slight inconsistency: the pine-swept path.

           No footprints or tracks, just a barely visible trail.

           WITH SOLOMON

           as Old Luc begins to follow that pine-swept path.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Move.

           WITH OLD LUC

           as he increases his speed, certain he’s on the right trail.

           WITH SOLOMON

           as his girls help him limp through the forest.
                                 SOLOMON
                        That way.

           He presses on with his girls, toward a distant...

           MOUNTAIN POND

           not far ahead. Frozen and glistening in the moonlight. 

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Almost there. We’re almost there.

           WITH OLD LUC

           as he sprints through the trees, nothing on his mind but 
           blood. A devil in the white hills.

           AT THAT MOUNTAIN POND

           Solomon and his girls limp past it, their shadows playing in 
           the moonlight’s reflection.

                                 EMMA
                        He’s coming, Dad. We gotta hurry. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Almost there, we’re close.

           Sol nods for his girls to turn into the forest, as they do...

           OLD LUC

           bursts into view, eyes that pond, the moon above, doesn’t see 
           the girls or Solomon. He presses on, follows the tracks.

           IN THE FOREST

           Solomon guides his girls toward a CAVE ENTRANCE ahead. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        There it is. There, hurry.

           The girls help Sol limp into...

           INT. SMALL CAVE -- NIGHT

           Sol nods toward his pant pocket, to Emma:
                                 SOLOMON
                        Get the flashlight. In my pocket.

           She pulls it out, clicks it on. The bulb is shattered but the 
           filament still lights up.

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t work.

                                 SOLOMON
                        That’s ‘nough light fer now.

           Solomon turns his girls into a tunnel, around another bend.

                                 EMMA
                        You know where we’re goin?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I grew up in these hills. He cain’t 
                        find us in here.

           Solomon pushes on with his girls, through the expanse of 
           these underground catacombs.

           IN THE FOREST

           Old Luc gallops after those tracks, spots that cave ahead.

                                 OLD LUC
                        He wouldn’t. 

           He approaches the entrance where the tracks disappear. 
           Nothing but blackness in there.

           If he goes in without light, he’ll never come back out.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        SOLOMON!

           IN THE CAVES

           Solomon and the girls hear Old Luc’s screams. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        We’re safe in here. All he can do 
                        is wait us out.

                                 EMMA
                        Then what?
                                 SOLOMON
                        We git some rest, I’ll think 
                        somethin’ up.

                                                               CUT TO:

           LATER,

           And Solomon has a small fire built, that flashlight and steel 
           wool laid beside it.

           He’s shirtless beneath his coat. All he could burn.

           His girls are bundled up next to him, embracing the warmth.

                                 GINNY
                        I’m hungry.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I know.

                                 GINNY
                        And thirsty.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Me too, honey.

                                 EMMA
                        Dad, how we gonna git outta here?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m thinkin’ on that, Em.

                                 EMMA
                        But he’s waitin’ for us.

                                 SOLOMON
                        I said I’m thinkin’ on it!

           Sol composes himself, sighs.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry. I got us into this and 
                        I’ll get us out, awright? Just 
                        trust me and...

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 SOLOMON
                        ... Have faith.
           EXT. THE CAVES -- NIGHT

           Old Luc has built his own fire next to the cave entrance. 
           Nothing’s getting out of there without him noticing.

           INT. THE CAVES -- NIGHT

           Solomon and Ginny have dozed off, but Emma’s awake, studying 
           their small camp: 

           The steel wool, flashlight, bow and arrows, hunting knife, 
           and that frayed nylon rope.

           Emma stares into that fire. Her mind working overtime.

                                 EMMA
                        Dad?

           She hates to wake him up, but she’s gotta do it. 

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Dad!

           Solomon jumps awake, holds an arrow tip in front of him like 
           he’s under siege. 

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Just me. It’s only me.

           He lowers his guard, yawns himself awake.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You awright?

                                 EMMA
                        ... I think I got an idea.

                                 SOLOMON
                        At’s good, Emma. Get some rest 
                        awright?

                                 EMMA
                        This cain’t wait.

           Solomon sighs, pulls himself upright.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Awright then. What is it?

                                 EMMA
                        He’s after you, not us. Right?
           Solomon searches her face, knows immediately what she’s 
           getting at.

                                 SOLOMON
                        That ain’t an option. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s the only option. 

           Off Solomon’s worried eyes, we:

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CAVES -- NIGHT

           Old Luc stabs at his fire, eyes fixed on that cave entrance 
           like he doesn’t even need sleep.

           INT. THE CAVES -- SAME

           Emma’s speaking to Ginny, reassuring her.

                                 EMMA
                        You can do this, Gin. You got to.

                                 GINNY
                        But what if...

                                 EMMA
                        What if nothin’. No what ifs. It’s 
                        gotta be this way and it’s gotta be 
                        now.

           Ginny looks to Solomon. She needs his confidence. Needs his 
           strength.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Pray with me.

           Emma and Ginny share a glance. Did they hear that right?

                                 EMMA
                        You thinkin’ straight?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’m thinkin’ straight for the first 
                        time in a long time. Now, you gonna 
                        pray with me or am I doin’ it 
                        myself?

           Solomon and his girls join hands, lower their heads.
                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Dear, Lord... well...

           He clears his throat, readies himself. Even with everything 
           that’s happened, this is the last thing he expected to do.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        It’s been a while, ain’t it? I 
                        wanna say I’m sorry fer turning my 
                        back on You. I felt abandoned and 
                        forgotten. I blamed You fer my 
                        folks and my wife. I blamed You fer 
                        not answering my prayers. Fer 
                        ignoring me. Fer punishing me fer 
                        things unknown. But I know now that 
                        I cain’t blame You for all the shit 
                        times in my life. I don’t know if 
                        You create the shit or if it exists 
                        in spite of You. But whatever it 
                        may be, I need to ask of You 
                        something that I never thought I’d 
                        ask again: 
                             (then)
                        Please, Lord, look over me and 
                        protect my girls in these dark 
                        times. Forgive me for what I must 
                        do and see fit to not punish my 
                        children fer my own sins. Allow me 
                        the strength to defend what is mine 
                        and the courage to do so. Most 
                        importantly, allow me more time 
                        with my girls. Allow me more time 
                        to show ‘em I can be a better 
                        father. More time to show You I can 
                        be a batter man. Bless me and guide 
                        me, O Lord. In Your name... amen.

                              EMMA
                                                            GINNY
                  Amen.
                                                 Amen.

           Solomon snuffs out the fire. Emma straps the arrow quiver and 
           bow on his shoulders, and she and Ginny help him limp through 
           the tunnel.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                             (to Ginny)
                        You understand what yer doin?

                                 GINNY
                        Yeah.
                                 SOLOMON
                        And yer not scared, are you.

                                 GINNY
                        No.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Anything happens t’me, you follow 
                        yer sister home, awright?

           Ginny nods and Solomon kneels to kiss her cheek. 

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Love you. Both a you.

           They hug him so tight he can hardly breathe.

           EXT. THE CAVES -- NIGHT

           Ginny hightails it out of the cave, slides right into Old 
           Luc, screaming, frantic:

                                 GINNY
                        Pappaw! Pappaw, help! Help!

           Old Luc holds his revolver on the cave entrance, even as he 
           hugs Ginny into his arm.

                                 OLD LUC
                        What’s happened? What is it?

                                 GINNY
                        Bear. Help, please. Bear! Emma’s... 
                        She’s...

           Old Luc adds it up. Knows what’s happened.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Show me. Where is she?

           Ginny pulls Old Luc into...

           INT. THE CAVES -- CONTINUOUS

           Old Luc follows her as Ginny holds her flashlight down the 
           tunnel, all the while whimpering Emma’s name.

           IN A SIDE TUNNEL

           Basked in complete darkness, Emma and Sol watch Ginny and Old 
           Luc pass them and disappear down the tunnel.
           Slow and quiet, they slip out of the side tunnel and...

           EXT. THE CAVES -- NIGHT

           They burst into the snow, sprint through...

           THE FOREST

           Weaving through trees, both of their eyes fixed not ahead of 
           them but on the...

           TREE BRANCHES

           They’re studying them for something. Then, Sol spots one 
           that’s to his liking.

                                 SOLOMON
                        There. That one, Em. Right there.

           Emma uses her father to climb up to the branch, cuts it off 
           with the hunting knife.

           Shows it to her father.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        That’ll work. Come on, hurry.

           Emma helps her father limp toward...

           THAT MOUNTAIN POND

           Where the two climb a small hill and slide onto the pond’s 
           snow-covered ice.

           Carefully, they move their way to the center of the pond.

           INT. THE CAVES -- NIGHT

           Ginny pulls Old Luc along, shining that dull flashlight in 
           every direction.

                                 GINNY
                        I don’t know. I don’t know. Emma!

                                 OLD LUC
                        Where’s yer father?

                                 GINNY
                        Emma? Emma...
           Old Luc yanks Ginny to face him, eyes ablaze.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Where’s yer dad, I said!

                                 GINNY
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Pappaw. 
                        Let’im go. Please, juss let’im go.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Goddamn you girls!

           Old Luc lifts Ginny into his arms, stalks back the way he 
           came. Down that tunnel, toward the entrance...

           EXT. THE CAVES -- CONTINUOUS

           Luc spots the tracks leading away from the cave. Knows he’s 
           been tricked. 

                                 OLD LUC
                        After I’ve killed yer father, you 
                        and yer sister have somethin’ 
                        coming. You must be broken. I won’t 
                        stand fer this.

           Old Luc follows the tracks, drags Ginny along.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        SOLOMON! Show yerself! You’re 
                        willing to sacrifice your daughter 
                        for your own life? Is that what 
                        this is? It’s her for you? 
                             (then)
                        So be it. You will pay for yer sins 
                        or she will, y’hear me? It’s you or 
                        her, you make yer choice!

           ON THAT MOUNTAIN POND

           Emma holds Sol’s takedown bow as Sol carves another. Slices 
           off imperfections till the branch is seamless.

                                 SOLOMON
                        That’ll do. 

           Behind them, the HORIZON BURNS with a predawn glow.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Over here, Luc! Y’hear me? On the 
                        pond! We’re on the pond!
           Sol bends his branch. It’s not perfect but it’ll do.

                                 OLD LUC (O.S.)
                        Show yerself!

           Sol checks behind him as the sun’s rays burn brighter. No 
           telling how long it’ll be till sunrise. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        We cain’t! Ice is too thin, we’re 
                        stuck out here!

           IN THE FOREST

           Old Luc slows his pace, mutters to Gin:

                                 OLD LUC
                        You got one dumb fuckin’ father, 
                        y’know that, girl?
                             (then, to Sol:)
                        Y’got weapons out there?

                                 SOLOMON
                        What you think?

           Old Luc pulls Ginny up that small hill.

                                 OLD LUC
                             (to Ginny)
                        You first.

                                 GINNY
                        Why?

                                 OLD LUC
                        Do as I say, damn you.

           He nudges her and she peaks over the crest of the hill, sees:

           SOLOMON AND EMMA

           on the pond. Emma splits a fray of string from that nylon 
           rope and ties it to both ends of the makeshift bow.

           Puts a finger to her mouth and nods. Shhhhhh.

           Ginny summons courage, nods back to Old Luc:

                                 GINNY
                        They got a bow-n-arrow.
                                 OLD LUC
                        That’s a good girl. 
                             (to Solomon)
                        Throw it here!

                                 SOLOMON
                        Cain’t do that.

           Sol checks the horizon again. Sun’s getting closer.

                                 OLD LUC
                        You’ll do it or yer girls’re dead. 
                        You such a coward you’ll let ‘em 
                        die fer you?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Promise me something.

                                 OLD LUC
                        You ain’t in a position ta 
                        negotiate. 

                                 SOLOMON
                        Promise me you’ll look after ‘em.

           Old Luc studies Ginny’s face. Scared shitless. Can’t hide it.

                                 OLD LUC
                        I can promise ‘at.

           SSSSSLIP! as something slides across the ice.

                                 SOLOMON
                        That’s my bow.

           Old Luc nods for Ginny to look. She does, nods an affirmative 
           for Old Luc.

           He pokes his head over the crest of the hill, sees the bow 
           resting near the pond’s edge. Doesn’t realize it’s the 
           makeshift bow.

           He studies Solomon and Emma out on the pond. 

                                 OLD LUC
                        Y’got a knife, I’m sure.

           Sol nods to Emma and SSSSSLIP! as she slides that across the 
           ice too.

           Old Luc pulls Ginny in front of him and stands atop that 
           small hill overlooking the pond.
           ON THE HORIZON: the sun’s burning brighter, the tree-topped 
           mountains seemingly ablaze.

                                 OLD LUC (cont’d)
                        How you get yerselves stuck out 
                        there?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Weren’t thinkin’.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Recurring problem a yours, ain’t 
                        it?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Y’could say.

           Solomon looks to Emma and we notice that takedown bow hiding 
           behind her back.

           They meet eyes. A kind of pre-emptive goodbye.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Since you gone’n surrendered, I’ll 
                        give you yer last words.
                             (then)
                        Go’n and say bye, if you’d like.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Thanks, but no thanks.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Sure ‘bout that?

                                 SOLOMON
                        I’ll leave it where it is. They 
                        know what they need to.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Awright, then.

           Old Luc cocks his revolver, aims at Sol.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Y’know, I do got somethin t’say.

                                 OLD LUC
                        Make it quick, then.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Ginny...

           A sly smile from Sol as he feels that sunrise seconds away. 
                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Play pretend.

           A confused glance from Old Luc to Ginny as she drops to the 
           snow and plays dead.

           Old Luc glances back to the pond as...

           THE SUN CRESTS THE HORIZON!

           An explosion of light as the sunrise reflects off the frozen 
           pond, momentarily blinding Old Luc.

           Within the blinding light, we can barely see Sol and Emma as 
           they’re blurred into one, skilled archer:

           Emma does what Sol’s arms can’t do: raises the bow, nocks the 
           arrow. 

           And Sol does what she can’t do: pulls the arrow back, 
           steadies and aims as they both...

           Close their eyes                                           
           Take a calm breath                                     
           Release steady and slow                                    
           And open their eyes again -- now hard, dark, focused. 

           TWANG! The arrow launches ahead...

              From Sol’s fingers.

                              Over ice and snow.      

                                              Past that gun as it FIRES!   

           THWACK! And into Old Luc’s gut as he falls right beside Gin.

           It all happened so quick that by the time we survey the 
           scene, we notice both Luc and Sol are on their backs.

           An arrow protruding from Old Luc’s gut like a victory flag.

           Sol holding his ribs as if he’s been shot again.

                                 EMMA
                        Dad? You awright? Dad...

           Emma lifts Sol’s head, moves his hand to see the wound.

                                 SOLOMON
                        You did good.

                                 EMMA
                        Daddy...
                                 SOLOMON
                        It’s okay. 

           She can see only blood and broken skin.

                                 EMMA
                        Please, no. 

           Solomon feels the wound, notices a BULLET HOLE in the ice 
           beside him.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Missed. Just grazed me.

           Emma studies Sol’s minor wound, sees the hole in the ice.

                                 EMMA
                        You mean to tell me don’t no one 
                        gotta dig a bullet outta you fer 
                        once?

                                 SOLOMON
                        Surprise to me too.

           Sol laughs through gritted teeth, climbs to his feet, but...

           THE BULLET HOLE IN THE ICE 

           begins to C-C-C-CCCCRACK! as a spiderweb of splintering ice 
           spreads beneath them.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Move.

                                 EMMA
                        Dad...

                                 SOLOMON
                        NOW!

           Solomon and Emma race for that small hill where Ginny waits.

           WATER SEEPING through the cracks, pieces sliding and sinking 
           like tectonic plates.

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        Run! Go, Em! RUN!

           Nearing the shore, Emma leaps but...
           SOLOMON

           slips and slides off a broken plate of ice, tumbles...

           UNDERWATER

           and sinks into the dark abyss. Can’t raise his arms, all he 
           can do is kick, but it’s not enough.

           BY THE POND

           The girls scream for their daddy. Emma’s on her stomach, 
           reaching as far as she can into the freezing water.

                                 EMMA
                        Grab my hand, grab it!

                                 GINNY
                        Swim, daddy!

           Emma leaps to her feet...

                                 EMMA
                        Cain’t work his arms.

           ... and RRRRIPS! that arrow out of Old Luc’s gut.

           UNDERWATER

           Sol’s sinking like a stone, not enough power in those legs to 
           keep him afloat. But...

           THAT ARROW dives into the water, just out of reach of Sol’s 
           dead arms. It’s no use -- Sol quits trying.

           Until... 

           THWACK! as Emma stabs that arrow right through one of Sol’s 
           shoulder wounds.

           He screams soundlessly underwater as...

           BY THE POND

           Both girls tug that arrow and heave Sol out of the pond like 
           a speared fish.

                                 SOLOMON
                        Get it out, Em! Ahh pull it out!
           Emma snaps the arrow, yanks it out.

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry, only idea I had.

                                 SOLOMON
                             (teeth chattering)
                        You’n yer ideas.

                                 EMMA
                        I got one more: gettin’ you to a 
                        fire and off this Godforsaken 
                        mountain.

           Ginny and Emma help Solomon to his feet, away from the still-
           dying Old Luc, but...

                                 SOLOMON
                        Wait.

                                 EMMA
                        What’re you doin’?

           Solomon kneels over Old Luc and grasps his discarded gun in 
           his shivering hands.

                                 EMMA (cont’d)
                        Dad...

                                 SOLOMON
                        Turn ‘round, Em. Both a you.

           They do as their told and Emma, knowing what’s coming, covers 
           her little sister’s ears.

           Sol presses the revolver to Luc’s temple, stares into those 
           eyes -- dying embers now doused -- notices they’re gazing at:

           THAT DOGWOOD FLOWER

           that’s clutched in Luc’s hand. The only thing he wants to see 
           before he becomes one with the earth again.

           Sol cocks the hammer, whispers:

                                 SOLOMON (cont’d)
                        This is not yer family. May you now 
                        return to yours.

           PWOP-OP-OP-OP! as Sol pulls the trigger and we...

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. MOUNTAIN CEMETERY -- ANOTHER DAY

           We’re back at that cemetery, searching the faces of the 
           weathered headstones. We fall upon one in particular:

                                    APRIL SANDERS

                                      1966-2012

                              Beautiful wife and mother.

                                       R.I.P.

           Standing before it: Sol and his girls.

           Sol’s healthy now. Fresh bandages still littering his body,
