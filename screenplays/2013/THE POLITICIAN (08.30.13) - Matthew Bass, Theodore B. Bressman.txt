                                 The Politician

                                      By

                       Matthew Bass & Theodore B. Bressman
           INT. FANCY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           In SLOW MOTION, we see elevator doors slide open revealing 
           HENRY CASHIN III, mid 40’s, in a ten thousand dollar suit. He 
           has a determined and elated look on his face, and what may or 
           may not be cocaine under his nose. 

           STILL IN SLOW MOTION, he starts running through the lobby as 
           fast as he can. He bursts through the front doors and on to 
           the busy NEW YORK street. WE SEE there is a HUGE CROWD of 
           reporters waiting outside his apartment who ERUPT in 
           COMMOTION when they see Henry. He SPRINTS down the sidewalk, 
           ANDERSON COOPER trying to get in front of him, shoving a 
           microphone in his face. 

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                           (slo-mo voice)
                        Gooovvveeerrrnnnooorrr 
                        Caaaaaassshhhhiiiiiin, whaaaaa-

           BOOM! Henry PUNCHES Anderson Cooper in the face. In slow 
           motion, Anderson’s face contorts and he drops to the ground. 
           Henry keeps running, the reporters following behind.

           TITLE UP: Two Weeks Earlier.

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Henry proudly reads “Oh, The Place’s You’ll Go” by Dr. Seuss 
           to a classroom of First Graders. He’s doing his best Dr. 
           Seuss voice as all the kids laugh and read along.

                                 HENRY
                           (reading)
                        You’ll get mixed up, of course, as 
                        you already know / You’ll get mixed 
                        up with many strange birds as you 
                        go. / So be sure when you step. 
                        Step with care and great tact, and 
                        remember that Life’s a Great 
                        Balancing Act. / Just never forget 
                        to be dexterous and deft and never 
                        mix up your right foot with your 
                        left.

           Henry lifts up his shoes, revealing that his left shoe is on 
           his right foot and his right shoe is on his left foot. The 
           kids howl with laughter. They love him.

                                 HENRY
                           (reading)
                        And will you succeed? Yes! You 
                        will, indeed! 
           All of a sudden, his CHIEF OF STAFF, WILLIAM (60s, 
           conscientious), walks over and whispers into his ear. Henry’s 
           expression turns from a smile to a look of great concern, 
           fear and panic. You might even say, this man was manic!

                                 HENRY
                        Kids you’ll move mountains!
                           (beat)
                        Aright, I gotta go! Tommy, get up 
                        here and finish it off!

           The kids look around. No one’s named Tommy.

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON: A line of Cocaine, as Henry snorts it up then looks 
           at William, who stands guarding the door of an empty room.

                                 HENRY
                        How bad is it?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well you’re doing cocaine in an 
                        elementary school, so - 

                                 HENRY
                        No! The rumors, man! The rumors! 
                        What’s this woman saying?

                                 WILLIAM
                        She’s claiming you gave her drugs 
                        and then sodomized her.

                                 WILLIAM
                        She gave me the drugs and she put 
                        her finger in my ass!
                           (beat)
                        You’re my chief of staff! Can’t you 
                        fix this?

           He rubs his gums with some cocaine residue. William looks 
           disgusted as he shakes his head, “no.”

                                 WILLIAM
                        You need to pull yourself together.

           Henry blows another line.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           And now he’s on his game, walking really fast, as William 
           trails him with a pen and paper, writing down what he says. 
                                 HENRY
                        Okay. Here’s what we’re going to 
                        do. Set up a press conference 
                        tomorrow, ten AM, put out a press 
                        release to all women’s groups. I 
                        want key words like love, wife, 
                        smart, education, equal opportunity 
                        in the workplace... 

           William nods as he writes.

                                 HENRY
                        Make sure Brad’s there in case any 
                        legal issues come up. We can deal 
                        with this, William.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And Shelby?

                                 HENRY
                           (unconvinced)
                        Don’t worry, we have an 
                        arrangement. It’s all good. Good in 
                        the hood. 
                           (beat)
                        Consider it contained.

           Henry rounds a corner to face a MURAL in the next hallway. It 
           shows him and a bunch of African American Children holding 
           hands on a sunny day. 

                                 HENRY
                        They were going to close this 
                        school down, William. But did we 
                        let them? No, sir. We rebuilt the 
                        fuck out of it. And that’s what 
                        we’re going to do now. With my 
                        marriage. And my reputation...And 
                        my political career. 

           Henry takes a moment to steel himself.

                                 HENRY
                        Ain’t that right, mural self?

           Henry fist bumps his MURAL fist and keeps moving. 

           EXT. THE GOVERNOR’S MANSION - MORNING

           Henry gives a press conference next to his WIFE, SHELBY (40s, 
           Hilary Clinton-esque). Behind him is William and his lawyer 
           and best friend BRAD (50, cocky, scummy, an enabler).
                                 HENRY
                        So with my wife as my witness, I 
                        pledge to the great state of New 
                        York that these charges are empty, 
                        and I want to assure you that I 
                        will continue to run this state 
                        with the gusto and professionalism 
                        that is synonymous with the Cashin 
                        name. I believe everyone will 
                        forget about this in a week and it 
                        will be business as usual up in 
                        Albany. In the mean time, my lawyer 
                        is here to answer all further 
                        questions.

           Henry whispers to Brad as they exchange places: 

                                 HENRY
                        God, I hope everyone forgets about 
                        this in a week. 

                                 BRAD
                           (whispers)
                        Cocktails tonight? I’ll bring the 
                        xanax.

           Brad winks at Henry and turns to the crowd.

           SUPER: ONE WEEK LATER

           ROLL CREDITS OVER MONTAGE OF NEWS REPORTS:

           NOTE: Credits will similarly rise and fall with Henry’s 
           approval rating.

           - Wolf Blitzer stands in the situation room.

                                 WOLF BLITZER
                        One week has passed since Governor 
                        Henry Cashin was accused of 
                        soliciting prostitutes with 
                        narcotics, and the rumors are 
                        getting worse and worse. The 
                        Governor who was once famous for 
                        his advocacy of public education 
                        and urban development is now 
                        looking to leave a different 
                        legacy.

           On the screen behind him we see an image of Governor Cashin 
           with a hard-hat shaking the hand of a CONSTRUCTION WORKER.
                                 WOLF BLITZER
                        Cashin’s approval rating is already 
                        down 10 percent as a wide scale 
                        investigation to determine the true 
                        extent of this scandal is already 
                        underway.

           We’ll leave Henry’s APPROVAL RATING on screen as it continues 
           to drop with each scandal. 

           - A TMZ Paparrazi clip shows a PROSTITUTE getting out of a 
           taxi in front of the Ace Hotel. She’s drunk and sort of 
           wobbling around with another PROSTITUTE friend. A headline 
           underneath her reads. “Prostitute Comes Forward in case 
           against Governor Cashin.”

                                 PROSTITUTE
                        Yeah I know Cashin. He hooked me on 
                        Oxycotin, then on his big, hairy 
                        (BLEEP).

           The APPROVAL RATING dips lower as we cut to: 

           - An SNL Sketch. TARAN KILLAM dressed up as Henry Cashin on a 
           private plane. He walks out and removes the flight headset.

           Reveal the plane is full of half naked women, TWO MEN IN 
           DASHIKIS and several CAST MEMBERS dressed up as POLITICIANS 
           and HOOKERS. The plane starts rockin!

                                 TARAN KILLAM

                        boy!

           The APPROVAL RATING rises slightly as we cut to:

           - Bill Maher showing an image of Henry getting into a limo 
           with a Hooker outside of an OLIVE GARDEN. Brad, the lawyer, 
           is right behind them.

                                 BILL MAHER
                        New rule. Next time you decide to

                        Henry, give me a call. I’ll do key 
                        bumps in an Olive Garden parking 
                        lot with you any time.

           The APPROVAL RATING drops back down as we cut to:

           - Henry outside the Governor’s Mansion, next to Shelby, in 
           front of a group of reporters and microphones.

                                 HENRY
                        As these false allegations pile up, 
                        and we continue to await any 
                        semblance of actual evidence, it 
                        has been a great source of comfort 
                        to have the support of my wife and 
                        partner. 
                           (beat)
                        Shelby Cashin...

           Shelby walks up to the microphones.

                                 SHELBY
                        Good morning. As Governor, my 
                        husband did great things for 
                        people. He was an advocate for 
                        education and fought for our inner-
                        city students...

           Henry smiles.

                                 SHELBY
                        But as a human being, a husband and 
                        a man, he is disgusting, dishonest, 
                        sick and perverted.

           Henry’s face DROPS.
                                 SHELBY
                        I’m here to announce that I will 
                        NOT be standing by my husband, as 
                        he goes through the process of 
                        being exposed as a drug addict and 
                        a sex addict. I am confident that I 
                        and the entire state of New York 
                        will be much, much better without 
                        him. Thank you and God Bless 
                        America! 

           Shelby blows a kiss and storms off the stage. Henry tries to 
           stop her. 

                                 HENRY
                        Wait, Shelby...I thought we had an 
                        arrangement.

                                 SHELBY
                        Who do you think I am? Fucking

                        You’re an asshole.

           Henry stares longingly at her as she turns and walks away.

                                 HENRY
                           (to himself)
                        Touche.

           He’s bombarded with questions by reporters.

           The APPROVAL RATING plummets, now at 1% as we cut to:

           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - CNN STUDIOS - DAY

           Henry sits in a make-up chair looking very depressed. William 
           paces behind him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        This is your chance to present your 
                        side of the story.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m just...I’m in pieces, William.
                                 WILLIAM
                        What’d you expect, Henry? You’ve 
                        been cheating on her for years.

                                 HENRY
                        I didn’t expect it to feel like 
                        this. My heart. It’s beating so 
                        slow.

           Henry does a tiny key bump.

                                 HENRY
                           (to himself)
                        Whoooph. 
                           (beat)
                        Yeah, sure things turned a little 
                        more loveless at the end. But she 
                        was still my roommate, my 
                        confidant. 
                           (sad beat)
                        And she made the best goddamn 
                        cupcakes.

           INT. HENRY’S OFFICE - ANDERSON 360 - DAY

           Henry, now slightly more pulled together, is being 
           interviewed by ANDERSON COOPER.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        These past couple weeks have been  
                        tough. Your wife left you, your 
                        approval rating has bottomed out, 
                        and here you are, a sitting duck, 
                        waiting to be arrested.

                                 HENRY
                           (somber)
                        It’s been a tough time, Coop.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        I guess with all the accusations, 
                        and the growing scandals and media 
                        scrutiny, my question for you is, 
                        “why not resign?” 

                                 HENRY
                        Well, the truth is there’s no 
                        concrete evidence against me. And I 
                        think we’d all agree that we live 
                        in a country where you’re innoce-

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        Let me stop you right there. 
           Suddenly, A PHOTO is projected on the screen behind them. 
           It’s Henry posing nude in an epic George Washington stance. 

                                 ANDERSON COOPER (CONT’D)
                        Can you describe the image for the 
                        viewers at home? 

                                 HENRY
                           (taken aback)
                        This wasn’t in the pre-interview - 

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        How about this one?

           Another PHOTO of Henry, is projected on the screen. It’s a 
           surveillance photo of Henry in the champagne room of a strip 
           club, getting a lapdance.

           Henry is a deer caught in head lights.

                                 HENRY
                        I thought we were friends.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        Or this?

           It’s a PHOTO of Henry passed out, butt naked. “Governor Dick” 
           is written in sharpie on his forehead.

                                 HENRY
                        You better watch your fucking back, 
                        Coop!

           Henry takes off his mic and storms off.

           INT. TOWNCAR - LATER

           Henry rides with William.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s the last time I grant that 
                        motherfucker an exclusive.

           They pull up to his house. Henry spots Brad waiting by the 
           entrance to his building. 

           EXT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry eagerly hops out of the car.
                                 HENRY
                        Braddie! Just the man I need.
                           (tapping his nose)
                        Tell me you’re packing heat. You 
                        have no idea what I just went 
                        through.

           Brad looks very anxious.

                                 BRAD
                        Easy on the lingo. We got problems.

           Brad points to a team of FEDERAL AGENTS heading straight for 
           them. Henry’s face drops.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. 59TH STREET APPLE STORE - DAY

           We pass a handful of overly energetic APPLE STORE HIPSTER 
           EMPLOYEES, everyone playing with iPads, iPhones, everything. 
           Then we land on JOE (late 20’s, smart, shouldn’t be there), 
           leaning against a counter, looking bored, as two FOURTEEN 
           YEAR OLD GIRLS, dressed in matching preppy skirts and Dalton 
           sweatshirts, play with an iPhone. 

                                 GIRL #1
                        Yeah my iPhone 4 is perfectly 
                        functional, but it's just like 
                        something about the Number 5 that’s 
                        so much cooler. 

                                 JOE
                           (disinterested)
                        Yeah. Totally. 

           Joe’s phone rings. He pulls out his shitty Motorola Flip 
           Phone as the girls stare at him in disgust. One of the 
           energetic Hipster employees shoots him a disapproving glance 
           as well...so unprofessional. 

                                 GIRL #1 
                        What are you doing?

                                 GIRL #2
                        You can’t just answer your phone 
                        when you’re talking to a customer? 

                                 JOE
                        Guys, I’m sorry, but this is really 
                        important.

           He answers it as the girl checks out his FLIP PHONE.
                                 GIRL #1
                        Wow. I had that phone...when I was 
                        like six.

           Joe turns around, trying to block out the noise.

                                 JOE
                           (into phone)
                        Hello? Yeah? This is Joe Hayworth. 
                        What? Really?

           Joe’s face lights up. Clearly he’s getting positive news.

                                 GIRL #2
                        How do you even text with that 
                        thing? Look how fat your fingers 
                        are!

                                 GIRL #1
                        Maybe if you were a better salesman 
                        you could get a real phone. That’s 
                        like really sad, actually. 
                           (beat)
                        “I’m an apple, and I’m poor, 
                        annoying...”

                                 JOE
                        Shut up!

           Joe puts his finger in his other ear to block them out.

                                 JOE
                           (into phone)
                        Fuck. Yes. I’m sorry I shouldn’t 
                        curse! It’s not becoming of a man 
                        of the court! ‘Cause that’s what 
                        I’m about to be!

           A laugh and a fist pump.

                                 JOE
                           (into phone)
                        I love you. Can I come over there 
                        and hug you? I’m literally in love 
                        with you. Thank you! Wow. Okay, 
                        great. Yeah, I can come by 
                        tomorrow. Of course.

           Joe hangs up the phone. He can barely contain his excitement 
           as he turns around to face the girls.
                                 GIRL #1 
                        Who was that? Your mom? Are you 
                        finally moving out of your mom’s 
                        house, loser?

                                 JOE
                        No. I just got a full fucking ride 
                        to Law School, which means I don’t 
                        need this job, and I don’t need two 
                        salty bitches making fun of my 
                        salesmanship!

           Joe flips them both the finger and starts dancing a little. 
           His Hipster Manager walks over, looking pissed.

                                 HIPSTER MANAGER
                        Hey, bro. What do you think you’re 
                        doing?

                                 JOE
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I was just telling 
                        these young whores to go eat out 
                        Selena Gomez.

           Joe gives excessive “suck its” to the girls and the manager.

                                 JOE
                        I quit!

           Joe walks towards the exit of the store. All the customers 
           stare at him in shock. Except one DUDE who seems kind of into 
           the whole thing, filming it on his Flip Cam.

                                 JOE
                        And another thing. Blackberrys 
                        rule! The typing is so much easier!

           Joe slaps the Dude five. 

                                 DUDE
                        I’ma put this shit on Youtube 
                        homes.

                                 JOE
                        Do it!

           Joe RUNS up the stairs. We HOLD on all of the customers as 
           everyone else still lingers around in shock. Beat.

           Suddenly Joe runs back in.
                                 JOE
                        You know what? I can afford it 
                        now...I’ll take the uh, 13 inch Mac 
                        Book Pro, please.

           INT. MAIN AND UNION CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           SAM SHANKROW (50), a real estate developer, addresses a group 
           of JAPANESE INVESTORS as he gestures to a powerpoint. On the 
           back wall we see Main and Union’s company logo.

                                 SHANKROW
                        I’m talking about a full scale 
                        housing and shopping complex, right 
                        on the Hudson. Your wallets are 
                        going to be fatter than a sumo 
                        wrestler. Ah-so!

           Just then his assistant, DMITRI, walks in and whispers right 
           in his ear.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Sorry, gentlemen we’ll have to pick 
                        this up tomorrow. I’ve arranged for 
                        us to see a Broadway Musical. A 
                        lovely matinee.

           Shankrow follows his assistant through to his office.

           INT. SHANKROW’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Shankrow turns on his giant TV from behind his desk. 

           Brian Williams is delivering the news.

                                 BRIAN WILLIAMS
                           (on the television)
                        Allegations of bribery and 
                        blackmail are the latest to surface 
                        in the growing case against Henry 
                        Cashin. Sources are showing an 
                        inordinate number of zoning permits 
                        issued by Cashin’s office, many of 
                        which are suspected to be illegal.

                                 SHANKROW
                        No! Not now! Not while the Japanese 
                        are just sitting right there, with 
                        their ballpoint pens. Oh shit. 
                        Shit. shit. shit. Cashin couldn’t 
                        keep his nose clean for five 
                        minutes!

                        What are you still doing here?

           Dmitri, shamed, leaves and Shankrow takes a deep breath.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Fuck my face...

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Joe sits at a three person booth with his awesome girlfriend, 
           JESSICA, and her stern father, Judge RONALD GUNDESON. Joe 
           taps his glass and raises it.

                                 JOE
                        I want to thank you guys for coming 
                        here tonight and letting me treat 
                        you to this dinner. Mr. Gundeson, 
                        it is an honor...your honor. 
                        Jessica, my love, ravishing as 
                        always. 

           Jessica beams. Ronald smiles, but it’s almost disingenuous.

                                 JOE
                        Today something special happened. A 
                        ripple through the legal system, 
                        caused by my tiny foot stepping 
                        into the pond of justice. 

                                 JESSICA
                        You heard!? What happened!

                                 JOE
                        Nothing, except I got a call from a 
                        little place called the City 
                        University of New York Law School. 
                        Apparently someone named Joe 
                        Hayworth has a full scholarship!

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh my god! Oh my god!

                                 JOE
                        With stipend! With stipend! From 
                        the government! 

           Joe and Jessica do a little high-five routine.

                                 JESSICA
                        We need to celebrate. I’m getting 
                        us champagne.
           Jessica excuses herself from the table.

                                 JOE
                        I’m gonna take great care of your 
                        daughter, sir. Fellow law buddies, 
                        eh?

           Ronald’s demeanor instantly shifts.

                                 RONALD
                        Did you just call me buddy?

                                 JOE
                        Well, I said ‘fellow law buddies.’

                                 RONALD
                        Listen to me, Joseph. Before I was 
                        a judge, I was on Law Review at 
                        Harvard.

                                 JOE
                        And that’s really impressive, sir.

                                 RONALD
                        I know it is. So excuse me for not 
                        being through the roof about my 
                        daughter ending up with some schmo 
                        from City University. 

                                 JOE
                        I know it’s not Harvard, but 
                        seventy percent of last year’s 
                        graduating class ended up at top 
                        law firms in the City.

                                 RONALD
                        Is that a real statistic or is that 
                        something you said because it 
                        sounds good?

                                 JOE
                        Both?

           Jessica returns with a waiter, holding a bottle of champagne.

                                 RONALD
                        Hey, Champagne is here!

           Ronald inspects the bottle.

                                 RONALD
                        Not good enough. Bring us a bottle 
                        of Henriot, ‘98. 
                           (smiling at Joe)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RONALD (cont'd)
                        Now that Joe’s got a stipend from 
                        the Government it’s peanuts for 
                        him, eh!

           Hold on Joe’s worried reaction.

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Joe is silent, staring at the window. Jessica is nestled into 
           his shoulder.

                                 JESSICA
                        Are you okay? You were acting kind 
                        of weird towards the end of the 
                        dinner. I’m sorry my dad ordered 
                        such an expensive bottle of 
                        Champagne. I will definitely pay 
                        you back for that. 

                                 JOE
                        Jess, I want you to know that I am 
                        going to take care of you, always. 
                        We’re going to have a house, and 
                        kids and they’re gonna go to good 
                        schools.

                                 JESSICA
                           (smiling)
                        I kind of want them to go to 
                        terrible schools. That way they can 
                        learn what I consider the most 
                        important thing...street smarts.

                                 JOE
                        I’m serious. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Joe, I don’t need anything, except 
                        for you and your face and your...
                           (pointing to his crotch)
                        I love you.

                                 JOE
                        I love you, too.

           Jessica touches his leg and kisses him on the neck.

                                 JESSICA
                        Now, cheer up ‘cause as soon as we 
                        get home, I’m gonna put on a 
                        powdered wig and you can fuck me 
                        like the lawyer you’re about to 
                        become.
           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           A News Anchor speaks into the camera on the courthouse steps.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        I stand outside the courthouse, 
                        where Governor Cashin was arraigned 
                        this morning on multiple counts of 
                        soliciting prostitution and felony 
                        possession of narcotics...

           INT. COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELL - SOON AFTER 

           Henry sits with Brad. There’s a SHERIFF’S OFFICER casually 
           keeping watch by the cell.

                                 HENRY
                        You know what they say. House 
                        arrest is the system giving you the 
                        chance to finally make your way 
                        through your Netflix queue. 
                        Meanwhile you can build the perfect 
                        defense, and if we lose the trial, 
                        I go Elliot Spitzer and get my own 
                        TV show. One thing’s for sure, I 
                        want to set up an MMA fight with 
                        Anderson Cooper.

                                 BRAD
                        Uhhh, Henry. I don’t know how to 
                        say this, but...they froze your 
                        accounts this morning. There’s a 
                        real chance that you might actually 
                        go to jail.

                                 HENRY
                           (incredulous)
                        C’mon. For drugs and hookers? This 
                        is America, Brad.

                                 BRAD
                        Yeah, but if they keep looking, 
                        there’s a good chance they’ll 
                        find...some of your other dealings, 
                        like... 
                           (mouths)
                        Shankrow.

           Just then, US Marshal, MILO GARDINI (mid 40s, overweight, 
           unprofessional) enters. 

                                 GARDINI
                        Which one of you is the Governor?
           Henry sheepishly raises his hand. Gardini immediately CUFFS 
           it and then cuffs the other one.

                                 GARDINI
                        Obviously, man. I’m Milo Gardini, 
                        US Marshal’s service.

           He flashes a MEDAL OF HONOR.

                                 GARDINI
                        And a distinguished man of honor. 
                        By that I mean, I’ve been shot. 

           Gardini mimics shooting a gun at Henry.

                                 GARDINI
                        I’m gonna be the one watching you 
                        until you receive your sentence.
                           (beat)
                        Let’s roll.

           Henry stands up and tries to hug Brad, but struggles because 
           his hands are cuffed.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Brad.

                                 GARDINI
                           (looking at the toilet)
                        Actually, wait. I gotta take a 
                        leak.

           Gardini walks over to the toilet and unzips, as Brad and 
           Henry are locked in an embrace next to him.

           INT. SUV - LATER

           Gardini drives, while another Marshal, WEAVER, sits in the 
           back next to a depressed Henry. 

                                 GARDINI
                           (to Weaver)
                        Make sure it’s secure around the 
                        ankle. Real secure. 

           Weaver straps on the GPS as tight as possible and takes out a 
           GPS monitor. A dot emerges on the screen. 

                                 GARDINI
                        See that? You’re like a rat in a 
                        cage.
           The car pulls up outside Henry’s apartment. There’s a media 
           mob waiting for him. Henry looks frazzled.

           INT. CITY UNIVERSITY OF NY FINANCIAL AID OFFICE - MORNING

           Joe’s texting on his brand new Blackberry. A FINANCIAL AID 
           OFFICER walks in and takes a seat across the desk from him. 

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        Thanks for coming in Mr. Hayworth.

                                 JOE
                        That’s Joseph P. Hayworth, Esquire. 
                        Mr. Hayworth was a huge loser and 
                        worked at the Apple Store.

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        Okay. What I’m about to say might 
                        be a little...unappealing.
                           (beat)
                        So you know how the Governor made 
                        public education a top priority?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I know everyone’s been 
                        talking so much smack about him, 
                        but education, that’s awesome, so 
                        he’s good in my books.
                           (beat)
                        My law books...

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        Yeah, well. Not everyone in Albany 
                        agreed that was the best way to use 
                        the State’s limited resources, what 
                        with the economy being how it is, 
                        and all, so...

                                 JOE
                        Yeah?

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        So. Yesterday, as you probably 
                        know, the Governor was indicted 
                        and, um...a lot of his public 
                        initiatives were frozen, cancelled 
                        or postponed.

                                 JOE
                        Frozen?

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        That’s the one you choose? 
           Joe shrugs.

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        Unfortunately, Mr. Hayworth, we no 
                        longer have the money to finance 
                        your tuition.

                                 JOE
                        Wait, what? That’s impossible. I 
                        got a phone call yesterday. Just 
                        yesterday. From you. 

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        I know how this probably sounds - 

                                 JOE
                        No you don’t! You’re telling me 
                        that because the Governor’s a 
                        fucking drug addict, I don’t get to 
                        go to Law School. How could you 
                        know what this feels like? Are you 
                        applying to Law School?

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        I’m sorry. I don’t know what to 
                        tell you. If you’re able to find 
                        the money to pay your way, we’d 
                        love to have you, but for now the 
                        stipend and scholarship just won’t 
                        be possible...

                                 JOE
                        Please. You don’t understand. Do 
                        you know what it’s like to date the 
                        daughter of a judge? It’s one cross-
                        examination after the other!

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        I’m sorry, this is really out of my 
                        control. 

           Joe puts his head in his hands.

                                 JOE
                        Fuck!

                                 FINANCIAL AID OFFICER
                        The best I can offer is maybe 
                        sometimes, when one door closes, 
                        another opens?
           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           AXEL, one serious-looking motherfucker, is staked out in his 
           SUV with a couple THUGS riding in the backseat and shotgun. 
           Axel spots his target, a GUY crossing the street.

                                 AXEL
                        Buckle up, please.

           Axel pumps the gas and runs right into the guy, almost 
           killing him. He puts the car into reverse and points to the 
           screen in the center console. It’s the image from the rear 
           camera.

                                 AXEL (CONT’D)
                        You just watch the movie now.

           Axel guns the car in reverse. 

           The Man looks up just as the car is about to run him over. As 
           he gets slammed into the car, we see the expression of 
           surprise and pain on his face through the video screen. 

           Axel pulls the emergency break, so the video screen is still 
           on. He exits the car. 

           EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Axel grabs the man by the collar.

                                 MAN
                           (crying)
                        Please! Please God! I’ll give you 
                        the money.

           Axel just starts pummeling him.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The thugs continue to watch on the Center Console, but the 
           feed is interrupted by an incoming call, from “S Shankrow.” 
           The Thug in shotgun sticks his head out the window.

                                 THUG
                        Yo, Shankrow’s calling for you.

           Axel hops back into the car and hits “answer.” 

                                 AXEL
                        Yo, Shankrow, it’s been a while.

           INTERCUT with Shankrow back in his office, panicked.
                                 SHANKROW
                        Been trying to keep clean, but 
                        times are tough. You know, things 
                        are changing and - 

           Axel notices the guy on the ground is struggling to get up.

                                 AXEL
                        I really don’t have time for this.

                                 SHANKROW
                        No, no! Please! I need 
                        your...uh...services. 

                                 AXEL
                        Okay. What’s the deal? 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Okay. How do I put this?
                           (beat)
                        I ordered a pizza a long time ago, 
                        and now that the pizza has gone 
                        bad, I need it disposed of.

                                 AXEL
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about? 

           Axel looks through his mirror and sees the Man struggling to 
           get up. Axel puts the car in reverse, but stays on the brake. 
           We see the man’s crying face on the screen.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Look. I’m...back in college when 
                        we’d order grass, we’d use code 
                        words. That’s all. 

           Axel points to the screen. He hits the gas once more and we 
           see the man’s face smash against the camera.

                                 AXEL
                        Whatever. I’ll use whatever analogy 
                        you want. As long as you pay up 
                        front.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Of course. Of course. So, how much 
                        do you charge for pizza? Thirty 
                        thousand? Fifty thousand?

                                 AXEL
                        Two hundred thousand.
                                 SHANKROW
                        Two hundred thousand dollars! 
                        Jesus! Are you serious?

                                 AXEL
                        You don’t like the price, do it 
                        yourself. Digornio.

           Long pause. Axel turns back and smiles to his Thugs. He knows 
           he’s got this.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Fine. Take it! Take it!

           Axel hangs up and drives off.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry walks in. William is waiting for him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Henry.

           Henry b-lines straight for the bathroom. William follows him.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Henry desperately scavenges through pill bottles, looking for 
           anything. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Are you okay?

           Henry pushes past him into the bedroom.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Henry continues tearing through his apartment, looking for 
           drugs. Finally, he spots a framed photo of Shelby on his 
           bedside table. He stares at it for a beat, with what we think 
           is a look of remorse, then suddenly he rips off the back 
           where he’s stashed a bag of cocaine. He bumps a line as 
           William watches in disbelief. We see the color and the pep 
           immediately come back.

                                 WILLIAM
                           (awkward)
                        How was jail?
                                 HENRY
                        Fucking terrifying. I don’t know 
                        how to turn a sock into a weapon! 

           Henry bumps another line.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Look, in a weird way, maybe jail 
                        will be good for you. Give you a 
                        chance to start over.

           Henry rubs his gums, his mind elsewhere.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT’D)
                        Are you even listening?

           Henry looks to William. 

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. You’re right. I do need to 
                        start over. But not in jail.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What?

                                 HENRY
                        I was wrong. House arrest is when 
                        the system gives you a second 
                        chance to escape.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’re joking, right? There are 
                        Federal Agents stationed outside. 

                                 HENRY
                        Do you know what the other men are 
                        gonna do to me in prison? They’re 
                        gonna fuck me, William. They’re 
                        gonna fuck me in my asshole, and I 
                        don’t want to be fucked there.

           Henry starts digging through his desk. He finds a few hundred 
           bucks. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Do you really think you can just 
                        walk out that door, take a cab to 
                        JFK, and fly away?

                                 HENRY
                           (to himself)
                        Fuck JFK, I can use Brad’s private 
                        jet. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (cont'd)
                        I’ll pick up some coke for the road 
                        and then fly to fucking freedom.

                                 WILLIAM
                        There’s no freedom for you.

                                 HENRY
                        There is. At my cleverly placed 
                        house in the non-extradition 
                        country of the Maldives. And that’s 
                        why I need cocaine. They might not 
                        have it there. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        HENRY! You aren’t going anywhere! 
                        You’re a goddamn criminal, and 
                        everyone knows what you look like. 
                        Listen, I’m tired, I’m stressed 
                        out, and all I want is to mix 
                        bourbon with lipitor and sleep for 
                        a month. So please just sit here 
                        with me and cooperate with the 
                        terms of your arrest.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, but I’ve come to realize 
                        there are two types of men in this 
                        world. Those who stand and face the 
                        music and those who run. I believe 
                        I was born to run.

           He does the last line of coke he laid out. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m done dealing with all these 
                        problems, William. I gotta go.

           EXT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Gardini chills in a parked car, shotgun side, just down the 
           street from Henry’s apartment. He fidgets with some 
           handcuffs, bored. He’s approached by FBI AGENT KATHERINE 
           JEFFRIES (mid 30s, uptight, professional).

                                 JEFFRIES
                        You must be Gardini. I’m Katherine 
                        Jeffries, FBI. White-Collar 
                        division.

           She extends her hand, but he’s preoccupied with the cuffs.
                                 GARDINI
                        Hey, I got a question for you. If a 
                        blue collar worker commits tax 
                        fraud is it still considered a 
                        “white-collar” crime? 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Right. Okay, so...I’m here to 
                        interrogate Governor Cashin. I have 
                        a feeling he’s in the pocket of a 
                        lot of people around this state, 
                        and I’m here to figure out who 
                        those people are.

                                 GARDINI
                        No one is allowed up there until my 
                        back-up arrives.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (holding out her badge)
                        See this badge. This gives me full 
                        access.

           Gardini opens his jacket revealing his MEDAL.

                                 GARDINI
                        See this medal. It gives me rank, 
                        because I’m a hero. A badass. Like 
                        Jackie Chan. But real.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I read your file. You got shot ten 
                        years ago, by friendly fire.

                                 GARDINI
                        Well, that kind of fire cuts the 
                        deepest, so...please wait ‘til my 
                        back up arrives.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I’m calling this in. 

           Jeffries dials her phone.

                                 GARDINI
                        Go ahead! But this is the way it 
                        works in the field. 

           Gardini puts one of the handcuffs on himself and tries to 
           shake his hand loose. Jeffries just watches on in disbelief.
                                 GARDINI
                        I heard Houdini could get out of 
                        handcuffs without a key or 
                        anything.
                           (purposefully obnoxious)
                        Hey Jeffries, do you believe in 
                        magic?

           Jeffries rolls her eyes and walks away to talk. When she’s 
           out of sight, Gardini leans over and cuffs himself to the 
           steering wheel and attempts to free himself.

                                 GARDINI
                           (singing)
                        Do you believe in magic...

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           Axel and his car of Thugs drive down the street.

                                 THUG #1
                        How are we gonna do this? 

                                 AXEL
                        I’m gonna go to his apartment. Walk 
                        through the front door. Take out my 
                        gun, and shoot him in the fucking 
                        head.

           Axel waves his gun for dramatic effect. 

           INT. FANCY APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

           We see the elevator doors open, and Henry run through the 
           lobby, the same image from the start of the movie, but this 
           time, not in slow motion. He SPEEDS through the lobby and 
           BURSTS out the front doors, to see the mob of journalists. 

           He SPRINTS down the sidewalk, ANDERSON COOPER trying to get 
           in front of him, shoving a microphone in his face. 

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        Governor Cashin, what-

           BOOM! Henry PUNCHES Anderson Cooper in the face. Henry keeps 
           running down the block, the reporters following behind.

           ANGLE ON: Gardini, still cuffed to the steering wheel, unable 
           to free himself.

           He looks up when he hears the commotion and sees Henry 
           running in the opposite direction. 
                                 GARDINI
                        What the...? Oh shit! That’s 
                        Cashin! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

           Gardini fumbles for the KEY and drops them. He watches as 
           Henry hops in a cab, slamming the door just as the reporters 
           reach him. Gardini sticks his head out the window, panicked.

                                 GARDINI
                        Fuuuck!!! Somebody! I need a hand!

           INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

           The mob of reporters slam on the window, yelling questions at 
           Henry. Henry throws a hundred bucks at the DRIVER.

                                 HENRY
                        DRIVE!

           The driver takes off.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeffries walks around the corner, to see Gardini screaming 
           out the window. 

                                 GARDINI
                        Where the fuck is everybody?!
                           (spotting Jeffries)
                        Jeffries! Help! Cashin’s gone! He 
                        escaped and got in a cab!

                                 JEFFRIES
                        WHAT?!

           Jeffries rushes over to the car.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        How did this happen?! Why didn’t 
                        you go after him?!

           Jeffries opens the car to see Gardini cuffed to the wheel.

                                 GARDINI
                           (ashamed)
                        I- I wanted to see if I could...

                                 JEFFRIES
                        You’re the worst! 

           Jeffries checks the GPS. Sees the Red dot moving a few blocks 
           away. She runs to the drivers seat and starts the engine. 
                                 GARDINI
                        Wait! The keys are on the floor, 
                        could you just-

           Jeffries tries to speed out of the parking spot, but ends up 
           CLIPPING the car in front of them. She reverses back and 
           BUMPS the car behind them.

                                 GARDINI
                        Have a little respect!

           She finally has the clearance and whips the car out onto the 
           street. She jerks the wheel with absolutely no regard for 
           Gardini’s arm, still attached to the wheel.

                                 GARDINI
                           (in pain)
                        AHHHHHH!!!!

           INT. CAB - SAME

           Henry’s cab pulls up to a standstill in traffic.

                                 HENRY
                        Come on! Hop the sidewalk or 
                        something! 

           In the distance he hears SIRENS. He looks down at his ankle 
           bracelet and sees a flashing red light.

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck this.

           He gets out of the cab and starts running, looking back 
           towards the SIREN. BAM! He runs right into a STREET VENDOR 
           selling knock-off bags and “I love New York” shirts. They 
           fall hard, knocking the stand over. 

           Henry grabs a T-Shirt and a hat, regains his footing and 
           keeps running. He scans the area and spots a SHOE COBBLER’s 
           SHOP next to the entrance to a Subway Station. 

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Jeffries speeds down the street, she pumps the brakes back 
           and forth. Jerking the car as she tries to navigate the 
           traffic and pedestrians, too timid for this kind of driving.

                                 GARDINI
                        Just stop so I can uncuff myself. 
                        You drive like shit, you fucking 
                        Desk Jockey!
           Jeffries guns the car forward, ripping around a truck causing 
           Gardini to bang his head on the dash.

                                 GARDINI
                        I’m sorry. Just stop turning! No 
                        more turns!

           Jeffries approaches the intersection. She sees the commotion 
           of the Street Vendor. She looks at her GPS monitor, sees 
           Henry has changed directions.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Gotcha!

           Jeffries gets out of the car and takes off running, 
           struggling to get through the crowd of people. 

           Gardini breathes a sigh of relief and finally un-cuffs 
           himself, gripping his swollen wrists. 

                                 GARDINI
                        Wait for me! Wait for...damn it.

           INT. SHOE COBBLER - CONTINUOUS

           Henry sits in a chair, frantic, changing into his “I Love New 
           York” T-Shirt and Hat. An old HISPANIC SHOE COBBLER kneels in 
           front of him.

                                 HENRY
                           (re: his ankle bracelet)
                        Get this off me!! I’ll pay you tres 
                        hundred dollars! 

                                 SHOE COBBLER
                        Ok. 

           The Cobbler takes out a leather cutting knife CUTS the strap 
           off of Henry. Henry throws some cash at the cobbler, takes 
           the ankle bracelet and runs out of the store. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Henry hops a turnstile, runs to the downtown platform and 
           throws the ankle bracelet through the open doors of a stopped 
           train car and runs out of the station.
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries looks around. She’s standing literally at the point 
           on the GPS monitor. Suddenly the dot starts speeding up, 
           headed downtown. Gardini catches up, out of breath.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I don’t get it. He just sped away 
                        into thin air. We lost him! You 
                        lost him!

           Gardini grabs the GPS monitor.

                                 GARDINI
                        Easy there, princess. He’s on the 
                        subway. Just call the MTA. Have 
                        them hold the train at the next 
                        station. 

           Jeffries takes out her phone as they run back to the car. 

           They miss Henry, in the background, walk out of the station, 
           blending in a bit better in his new outfit. He turns the 
           corner and disappears. 

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER

           An intoxicated Joe throws an empty bottle in the trash can as 
           he walks inside.

                                 JOE
                        I’ll take a bottle of Wild Turkey 
                        and some Sunflower seeds if you got 
                        ‘em.

           The CASHIER points to the Sunflower Seeds, which are right 
           next to Joe on his side of the counter. He takes a bottle of 
           Wild Turkey from the shelf behind him and hands it over to 
           Joe. Joe hands him his credit card and immediately takes a 
           huge sip of the Wild Turkey. The Cashier runs the card.

                                 CASHIER
                        It’s declined, sir. 

                                 JOE
                        Run it again!

                                 CASHIER
                        Do you have cash? Total’s $35.14.

           Joe rummages through his pockets and pulls out a five.
                                 JOE
                        I got a five...
                           (looking around)
                        and this.

           Joe lazily sticks his hand in his sweatshirt pocket to affect 
           the look of having a pistol.

                                 CASHIER
                        That’s clearly you’re hand.

                                 JOE
                        No, this is my hand.

           Joe takes his hand out of his sweatshirt, grabs the sunflower 
           seeds and throws them at the cashier, stunning him for a 
           moment. This allows Joe to haul ass the front door. 

                                 CASHIER
                        Get back here asshole!

           But Joe’s gone.

           EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Axel’s car pulls up beside Henry’s building. He and his thugs 
           get out of the car and casually walk into the lobby.

           INT. APARTMENT - LOBBY

           Axel and his thug’s enter the elevator. 

           INT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           William sits in Henry’s apartment watching news coverage of 
           Henry’s escape. Distraught, William sips a scotch and pops 
           open his bottle of LIPITOR. Suddenly, the DOOR BELL rings. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        One sec!

           William puts the bottle down, and heads to the door. He looks 
           out the peep hole and sees Axel and his men in the hallway. 

           EXT. STREET - ALLEY - DAY

           Henry walks, head down. He notices a CHINESE FOOD DELIVERY 
           CAR pull into the alley. 
           He hides behind a dumpster as the DELIVERY GUY gets out of 
           the car and runs into the service entrance of a building. The 
           engine still idles. Henry stares at the car for a moment.

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck it.

           Henry runs and steals the car, peeling off down the alley. 
           The Delivery Guy runs out into the alley and curses at him in 
           Chinese. But it’s too late.

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

           Gardini waits on the platform as the Swat Team investigates 
           the empty subway car, returning with the ANKLE BRACELET.

           Jeffries storms over to Gardini.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        How could you let this happen! How 
                        did you let my key witness go?

                                 GARDINI
                        “My” witness? How selfish are you, 
                        Jeffries? Besides, what about your 
                        team? Where were they? Preoccupied 
                        with their spreadsheets and 
                        conference calls?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        He was your prisoner! But 
                        unfortunately you cuffed yourself 
                        to the steering wheel!

           Gardini tries to hide his swollen wrists from the FBI AGENTS 
           who snicker at him. Gardini clearly feels a little stupid.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Forget it. It happened. Now unless 
                        you want to lose your job, step 
                        aside and let the FBI take over. 

                                 GARDINI
                        No. He’s a fugitive. Which means 
                        this case belongs now more than 
                        ever to the US Marshals office.

           Jeffries jams a MEMO in Gardini’s face.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Tell that to Judge Davis.

           Gardini reads the memo.
                                 GARDINI
                        Joint-jurisdiction?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Yes. 
                           (pointed)
                        And since the USMS is incompetent, 
                        please just stay out of my way.

           Jeffries walks over to her crew.

                                 GARDINI
                           (calling out)
                        We’re the oldest federal agency, 
                        but I’m sure you know that from all 
                        your research! We’re number one!
                           (calling out)
                        We are...

                                 WEAVER (O.S.)
                           (calling back)
                        ...Marshals!

           Gardini turns to Weaver and gives him a fist pump of 
           solidarity.

           INT. JOE’S CAR - DAY

           Joe is parked recklessly far from the curb. He swigs from the 
           half-empty bottle of Wild Turkey, on the verge of tears, as 
           he scribbles notes onto a brown paper bag. We see words like 
           “apologize” “failure” and “disapproving father.” 

                                 JOE
                           (muttering)
                        Jessica, you deserve the world. No, 
                        no...shit. Um...Mr. Gundeson, 
                        Jessica deserves the world. I mean, 
                        people who aren’t lawyers support 
                        their wives all the time.

           His phone buzzes. A Text from Jessica.

           INSERT MESSAGE: “Ur officially my second fav lawyer named Joe 
           :)” 

           His phone buzzes again. This time it’s a picture of JOE PESCI 
           from MY COUSIN VINNY.

                                 JOE
                           (on the verge of tears)
                        I’ll never be anyone’s cousin 
                        Vinny.
           A song on the radio ends and we hear the DJ’s voice.

                                 RADIO DJ
                        This just in. The Governor is on 
                        the LOOSE after spending just 20 
                        minutes under house arrest! Now the 
                        whole city is on the look-out for 
                        this devilish cat. This next track 
                        goes out to the biggest, nastiest 
                        pimp fugitive in New 
                        York...Henryyyy Cashinnn!

           As the opening hook of Juvenile’s BACK THAT AZZ UP starts to 
           play, Joe can’t take it anymore. He rips up the bag and 
           starts to cry in defeat.

           INT. HENRY’S STOLEN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Meanwhile, Henry is listening to the same station, sort of 
           grooving to BACK THAT AZZ UP, eating the delivery man’s food, 
           doing coke out of the corner of a fortune cookie, driving 
           about 80 miles an hour down the side street.

           He’s so excited that he fumbles the bag of cocaine, dropping 
           it in his lap. He looks down to retrieve it, totally ignoring 
           the wheel, when....BAM!!!!

           HE REAR ENDS JOE.

           INT. JOE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Joe drops his bottle, totally dazed by the accident.

                                 JOE
                        What the -

           Enraged, he gets out of the car.

           INT. HENRY’S STOLEN CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Henry is dazed as well. His airbag has popped and he can’t 
           tell what’s cocaine and what’s just powder from the airbag. 
           There’s powder on his shirt so he takes his shirt and rubs 
           his gums with it, but it repulses him.

                                 HENRY
                           (sadly)
                        My party supplies...
           There’s a knock on the window. It’s Joe. Henry looks behind 
           him and sees that no one is around. He tries to start the 
           engine back up, but it’s totaled. Joe pounds on the window.

                                 JOE
                        Hey! What the fuck, man?

           Henry rolls the window down, but only a couple inches.

                                 HENRY
                           (calmly)
                        Oh, hello. Sorry didn’t see you 
                        there.

           As Henry flashes his perfect political smile, Joe is hit with 
           a moment of recognition. 

                                 JOE
                        What the -- This can’t be 
                        happening. Are you...you’re fucking 
                        Henry Cashin! 

                                 HENRY
                        What? Who’s he? Who’s that?

                                 JOE
                        You are Governor fucking Cashin! 

                                 HENRY
                        Oh! The wrongly accused, down to 
                        earth, chilled-out Governor!? No, I 
                        get that all the time, but I’m just 
                        a delivery man, my name is...

           Henry reaches over to the glove compartment and pulls out the 
           insurance papers.

                                 HENRY
                        ...Lu Xang. See?

           He shows Joe the papers.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m half Asian. That’s why my skin 
                        is so soft. Want to feel?

                                 JOE
                        You fucked my life!

           Joe reaches through the window and starts strangling Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Ahhh, what are you doing, you crazy 
                        bastard!
           Henry bites Joe’s hand. 

                                 JOE
                        ARGH!!!

           Joe lets go and Henry pulls his arm back into the car. He 
           does up the window. Joe starts banging against it.

                                 HENRY
                        Hahaha!

           Joe steps back and KICKS the window, SHATTERING it. Henry 
           recoils as Joe reaches in and unlocks the door. Joe opens the 
           door and jumps in, again, trying to strangle Henry. 

                                 JOE
                        RRRARR!!!

           They fight in the car and the glove compartment is knocked 
           open. A large stack of Chinese food MENUS fall out, revealing 
           a GUN. They both pause and stare at the gun for a second, 
           then instinctively jump for it.

           But Henry’s seatbelt is still on, limiting his mobility. This 
           gives Joe the chance to squirm over Henry and grab the gun. 
           He aims it at Henry.

                                 JOE
                        You took everything from me! 

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t even know you! Look, why 
                        don’t you just hand me back my gun 
                        so I can continue making 
                        deliveries.

                                 JOE
                        I had it all. I had a fucking 
                        scholarship and a generous stipend. 
                        I was gonna be a lawyer! 

                                 HENRY
                        Look I’m kind of high right now so 
                        I don’t know what you’re saying, 
                        but if you’re a lawyer, you 
                        probably do a lot of coke. Any on 
                        you, uh...?

                                 JOE
                        What? No! I was gonna be a lawyer! 
                        You owe me a free fucking ride to 
                        Law School.
                                 HENRY
                        Well, you owe me about a thousand 
                        dollars worth of cocaine, so we’re 
                        even.

                                 JOE
                        No. We’re not even! Not even close. 
                        You’re gonna pay me what you owe 
                        me, fair and square, so I can 
                        continue with my life!
                           (beat)
                        Now, get out!

           Henry slowly gets out of his car, looking nervous, with his 
           hands up.

                                 JOE
                        We’re taking my car.

           Henry walks towards Joe’s car. 

                                 JOE
                        You drive, so I can hold the gun to 
                        your face.

           Henry gets in. Joe runs around to the passenger side. The car 
           peels off down the street.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           William’s hands are tied behind his back to a chair. Axel 
           looms over him.

                                 AXEL
                        So you’re saying you have no idea 
                        where he is? You lyin’? You seem 
                        like a wily gray-haired mothafucka.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t know! Honestly, I’m telling 
                        you the truth! 

           Axel takes out a gun and aims it right at William.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Look...look. I don’t know where 
                        Henry went. He was high as a kite, 
                        just muttering about the Maldives. 
                        He’s lost it. 

           Axel walks to the table and grabs a corkscrew.
                                 AXEL
                        You ever had one of these in your 
                        eye? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Please. I’m begging you.

           William starts hyperventilating. 

                                 AXEL
                        From what I can tell, the pain is 
                        excruciating. 
                           (beat)
                        So tell me: who would know where 
                        Mr. Cashin is?

           A thug holds William down as Axel approaches with a 
           corkscrew. William starts shaking and coughing. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        NO! I DON’T KNOW! Please! 
                        Wait...wait! Let me...Let me think! 

                                 AXEL
                        Think faster, motherfucker!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Urgh...ahhh...ow...

           William cringes in pain. 

                                 THUG #1
                        What’s going on?

                                 AXEL
                        Is this old fucker having a heart 
                        attack? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes...heart...help...

           Axel gets in close to William. 

                                 AXEL
                        I’ll call an ambulance as soon as 
                        you tell me where to find this guy. 

           William doesn’t say anything, convulsing too hard.

                                 AXEL
                        Come on.
                                 WILLIAM
                        His lawyer... 
                        Brad...Silverman...lawyer.
                           (beat)
                        Doctor...hospital...

                                 THUG #1
                        Should we help him?

                                 AXEL
                        I don’t know!

           William takes one last gasp and DIES. Axel and his men are 
           shocked. They stare at William’s lifeless body for a few 
           silent moments. 

                                 THUG #1
                        That...was fucked. I didn’t sign up 
                        for this natural cause stuff, man. 
                        That shit was for real.

                                 AXEL
                           (taken aback)
                        Very fucking unsettling. 
                           (shakes it off)
                        Okay! Snap to it. We gotta get out 
                        of here. Somebody check a Rolodex 
                        and find this dude Brad Silverman’s 
                        address. And toss a blanket on him 
                        or something. 

           A thug throws a blanket over William.

           INT. JOE’S CAR - DAY

           Henry drives Joe’s car as Joe holds him at gunpoint.

                                 HENRY
                        Look...psycho.

                                 JOE
                        My name is Joe. 

                                 HENRY
                        Look, Joe. I’m really sorry you 
                        failed out of Law School, but I 
                        don’t know how that’s my fault.

                                 JOE
                        What! I didn’t fail! I never got to 
                        go. I need money, so I can go.
                                 HENRY
                        How much do you want? 

           Joe considers this.

                                 JOE
                        $150,000.

                                 HENRY
                        Are you serious? Sure. Of course!

           Joe eyes Henry suspiciously.

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean, ‘of course?’ Are 
                        you fucking with me?

                                 HENRY
                        No, man! I’m seriously really 
                        fucking rich. I have millions 
                        stashed offshore.
                           (beat)
                        Look, Joe. Just cuz I ruined your 
                        life, doesn’t mean I can’t fix it. 
                        That’s what politicians do. We fix 
                        things. Trust me.

           Henry flashes his campaign winning smile.

                                 JOE
                        Well if you have money, where is 
                        it? 

                                 HENRY
                        Close. We’ll go to my lawyer’s 
                        place. He keeps like, 200k in a 
                        safe for emergencies.

                                 JOE
                        200K? Why would he have that much 
                        in cash?

                                 HENRY
                        That’s pocket change to a 
                        successful lawyer. You’ll see one 
                        day. I ball with high rollers, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Well...what makes you think he’s 
                        just gonna hand it over? 

                                 HENRY
                        He's my best friend. And that's 
                        what best friends do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (cont'd)
                        They give their BFF’s two hundred 
                        large, no matter the circumstances, 
                        no questions asked.

           Joe considers this for another moment.

                                 JOE
                        Fine. 

                                 HENRY
                        Awesome! I just need to make a 
                        quick stop first. Get some road 
                        coke.

                                 JOE
                        What?! Fuck that. We’re not 
                        stopping for cocaine, just take me 
                        to the money. Show me the money.

                                 HENRY
                        No. You don’t understand! I need 
                        cocaine to function! My dealer’s 
                        house is literally four blocks from 
                        here.

                                 JOE
                        I don’t fucking care! Do you not 
                        see that I’m holding a gun to your 
                        head?!

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah! I do! And do you not see the 
                        mania in my eyes? 
                           (points at his eyes)
                        I’d literally rather have my face 
                        blown off than have to go another 
                        minute without coke! Does that give 
                        you an idea about how serious this 
                        addiction is?!

           Joe looks in Henry’s eyes and realizes that he’s serious.

                                 JOE
                        Fine. Get your goddamn coke. Then 
                        we’re getting my money.

                                 HENRY
                           (relieved)
                        Thank you.

           Henry looks down and sees the bottle of Wild Turkey on the 
           floor at Joe’s feet.
                                 HENRY
                        Hey you mind if I have a sip of 
                        that to tide me over? 

                                 JOE
                        Are you serious?

                                 HENRY
                        Please...I need it...

           Joe, still pointing the gun at Henry, takes a swig of Wild 
           Turkey.

                                 JOE
                        Fuck you.

           INT. AXEL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Axel speeds down the street, dialing his phone.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. SHANKROW’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Shankrow picks up the phone.

                                 AXEL
                        Hey, just called to let you know 
                        the Cash-

                                 SHANKROW
                        Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Don’t just spell 
                        it out over the phone!
                           (beat)
                        You were saying something about 
                        pizza?

                                 AXEL
                           (annoyed)
                        I went to make the delivery like 
                        you asked. But the guy wasn’t there 
                        to receive it.

                                 SHANKROW
                        So, you’re telling me you’re just 
                        sitting there with a cold pizza?!

           Axel rolls his eyes.
                                 AXEL
                        Pizza’s still warm. I just gotta 
                        drop it off at a different 
                        location. And I have a good idea of 
                        where that is.

                                 SHANKROW
                        So you have the pizza? 

                                 AXEL
                        No! I don’t know! Fuck.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Well, hurry. The longer this 
                        pizza’s out there, the greater the 
                        chance it’ll ruin my life.

           EXT. STREET - LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY

           Joe holds a gun on Henry as they walk down a crumby street. 
           Henry rubs his nose, anxiously and quickly checks his gums 
           for cocaine residue.

                                 JOE
                        In and out, alright? Just get your 
                        stupid drugs so we can get out of 
                        here.

                                 HENRY
                        Sure. But you need to put that gun 
                        away.

                                 JOE
                        Uh, no?

                                 HENRY
                        You don’t walk into someone’s house 
                        brandishing a loaded weapon. It’s 
                        rude.

                                 JOE
                        Fine. But the gun’s in my pocket, 
                        and it’s pointed at your nuts.

           Joe puts the gun in his pocket, his hand still on it. He 
           holds Henry’s arm with his other arm.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           A real hipster loft. An old 1990’s Knicks vs. Pacers game 
           plays on a huge projector.
           Joe and Henry sit on what was once someone’s grandmother’s 
           couch. Out walks JAY (late 20s, tall and skinny), a man with 
           a serious case of ADD coupled with cocaine use.

                                 JAY
                        Henry motherfucking Cashin the 
                        Third. 

           Jay holds up three fingers. 

                                 JAY
                        Triple Sticks in the flesh! One, 
                        two, three, triple fucking sticks. 
                        What up, dog? You still 
                        politicking?

                                 HENRY
                        To the grave, my man. 

                                 JAY
                        Shit, holding down a job like that 
                        and still finding time to party 
                        like an OG?! How you do that, yo?!

                                 HENRY
                        It’s thanks to your cocaine, 
                        really.

           They share a laugh. Jay pours a bag of cocaine onto a table 
           and starts cutting up lines. Joe is totally shocked as to 
           what’s going on.

                                 JAY
                        Well you’re just in time, player. 
                        Bout to get my snort-on.
                           (re: Joe)
                        Who’s this stiff-ass, sorry-ass cat 
                        over here?

                                 HENRY
                        Oh...he’s my new intern, Joe. He’s 
                        cool.

           Joe awkwardly waves.

                                 JAY
                        Haha. Joe. This is your training 
                        day. Beam me up, Scottie!

           Jay smiles at him, sincerely. Then gestures invitingly to the 
           table.

                                 JAY
                        Voila. Cocaine.
           Henry eagerly jumps in there and does a line. 

                                 HENRY
                        Boy-yoy-yoy-yoing!!!

           Jay does a line and hands the straw to Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Nah, I’m good thanks. I, 
                        uhh...don’t share straws. 

           Jay looks really taken a back and suddenly suspicious of Joe.

                                 JAY
                        Hah! Funny, man. You’re funny. 
                        Seriously, take a snifter. This 
                        shit’s pristine.

                                 JOE
                        No, really. I’m good. 

           Jay looks at Henry, concerned. 

                                 HENRY
                        Joe, just do a line.

                                 JOE
                        No. I don’t do coke.

                                 JAY
                        Oh really? Hey Joe, let me tell you 
                        what I’m thinking then: you’re a 
                        narc. 

                                 JOE
                        I’m not a narc!

                                 HENRY
                        He’s not a narc. 

                                 JAY
                        Well he’s acting like one! See, in 
                        my house, when I offer someone a 
                        line o’ coke, and they won’t do it, 
                        it means one thing: narc.

                                 JOE
                        OR, it means that I don’t do 
                        cocaine. Like most people on earth. 

                                 JAY
                        Most people do coke!
                                 JOE
                        No they don’t! You only think that 
                        ‘cause you’re a coke dealer.

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s just both calm down...

                                 JAY
                        So...you’re saying you’re not going 
                        to do this coke? 

                                 JOE
                        Yes. 

                                 JAY
                        Yes, you’ll do it? 

                                 JOE
                        No! Yes as in, “No, I won’t be 
                        doing any cocaine”. 

           Jay looks at Henry, pissed. 

                                 JAY
                        Well then guess what fellas? No 
                        one’s doing fucking coke. Both of 
                        you narc’s gotta get the fuck out 
                        of my loft pronto. 

           Henry takes out his wallet and tosses all his remaining cash 
           onto Jay.

                                 HENRY
                        Please! Please! There’s four 
                        hundred bucks there, it’s 
                        everything I’ve got! Just gimme a 
                        few baggies and we’ll be on our 
                        way! Please! Here! Take my watch 
                        too! 

           Henry takes off his Rolex and tosses it onto Jay’s lap. Jay 
           crosses his arms, adamant in his stance. 

                                 HENRY
                        Joe, you fucking idiot! Just DO THE 
                        GODDAMN COKE! YOU’RE RUINING 
                        EVERYTHING!

                                 JOE
                        DON’T YOU YELL AT ME, YOU FUCKING 
                        DEGENERATE! You don’t have a leg to 
                        stand on! You’re a fuck up, a 
                        fugitive, and an addict! And now 
                        you’ve got me-
                                 JAY
                        Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wha - A 
                        fugitive?! Did he just say the word 
                        “fugitive”?

                                 JOE
                        Do you not watch the news? 

                                 JAY
                        No, I don’t watch the goddamn news, 
                        thank you very much. I have NBA 
                        classics playing on this projector 
                        24/7. I’m trying to create a vibe 
                        here. And you fugitive narc fuckers 
                        are ruining it! Now get the fuck 
                        out my loft before you bring the 
                        heat straight into my motherfuckin’ 
                        living room! 

                                 HENRY
                        Please, Jay! We are fugitives, 
                        straight up, but we just need some 
                        coke so I can get to my private 
                        plane and fly the fuck out of here. 
                        It’s all good.

                                 JOE
                        Henry, let’s just go.

           Henry pauses for a second, then lunges at the COFFEE TABLE 
           and frantically shoves two fistfuls of coke in his pockets.     

                                 JAY
                        You slippery piece of shit! DROP 
                        IT! 

           Jay pulls out a gun and points it at Henry. Henry pauses, 
           then turns to Joe. 

                                 HENRY
                           (whispering to Joe)
                        Joe. Shoot him! 

                          JOE
                                                      JAY
           What? 
                                          WHAT?

                                 HENRY
                        Shoot him with your gun! 

                                 JAY
                        You motherfucker’s packin’?! 
           Jay starts to swing his gun towards Joe, who frantically 
           whips out his gun. Unbeknownst to him, Joe drops his WALLET 
           on the floor. Jay and Joe have guns pointed at one another. 

                                 JAY
                        Motherfucker. A Mexican stand off. 
                        And Yo soy not budging.

           The room is tense. 

                                 JOE
                        Look, I just wanna leave. 

                                 JAY
                        Not until I get back my shit. 
                           (to Henry)
                        You betrayed me, Triple Sticks. 

                                 JOE
                        Cashin, give him back his coke! 

           Henry has his hands jammed in his pockets. He shakes his 
           head, defiantly. 

                                 HENRY
                        NO! I’d rather die than not have my-

           Joe tries to swat the coke with his free hand.

                                 JOE
                        GIVE HIM BACK HIS FUCKING-

           BANG! Joe’s gun goes off. Jay falls to the ground, shot in 
           the shoulder; his gun slides across the room. 

                                 JAY
                        AHHHHHHHHHHH!!! YOU SHOT ME!!! YOU 
                        MOTHERFUCKER!!! 

           Joe stands there, shocked.

                                 JOE
                           (to himself)
                        Oh my God...oh my God...I’m sorry! 
                        I didn’t mean to!!! 

                                 HENRY
                        Holy Shit! Run! 

           Henry pushes Joe out, stepping over a wounded and crying Jay 
           as they leave through the front door.

                                 JAY
                        TRIPLE STICKS!!! WHY!?!?!
           EXT. JAY’S APARTEMNT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Joe haul ass around the corner to their car. 

                                 JOE
                        This didn’t happen. This didn’t 
                        just happen. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck. You’re right. I must’ve left 
                        ten grand worth of coke sitting on 
                        the table. I gotta go back.

                                 JOE
                        No! No, you stupid fuck. I just 
                        shot someone. It was an accident, 
                        right? I never even held a gun 
                        before. Ah, fuck.

                                 HENRY
                           (sensing an opportunity)
                        I don’t know man. You’re the 
                        lawyer, but you kind of shot him in 
                        cold blood.

                                 JOE
                        What? No! I didn’t mean...the gun 
                        went...the trigger was 
                        just...sensitive. Oh my god.

           Joe leans over and VOMITS on the side of the road.

           They hear sirens in the distance. He grabs Henry and runs him 
           to the car.

                                 JOE
                        We need to leave. Now.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           Jeffries and Gardini lead their team down the hallway. 

                                 GARDINI
                        Classic office “groupthink.” 
                        Returning to the scene of the 
                        crime.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        That’s not what group think means.

                                 GARDINI
                        Well, it is a term that people 
                        might use in an office.
           Jeffries ignores him, noticing that the door has been busted 
           open. She motions for Gardini to enter while she covers him. 
           He shakes his head, and calmly walks in.

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries and Gardini enter and search the premises. Jeffries 
           finds a large fur blanket covering a huge lump on the floor.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        What the-

           She pulls off the blanket to reveal William’s corpse, still 
           tied to the chair. Shocked, she almost falls over backward. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Oh Jesus Christ? Is he dead? 

           Gardini swiftly moves in and checks his pulse.

                                 GARDINI
                        Someone get this motherfucker a toe 
                        tag.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Great. So now we have a body count.

           Jeffries gingerly examines William’s body.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I don’t see any signs of physical 
                        trauma. This doesn’t make sense.

                                 GARDINI
                        It makes perfect sense. Cashin is a 
                        murderer.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        It is way too soon to jump to that 
                        conclusion.

                                 GARDINI
                        Have you ever been raped? Like hard 
                        in the ass?

           Jeffries is disgusted by the question.

                                 GARDINI
                        Imagine it. Imagine the pain and 
                        trauma that would cause. Would you 
                        do just about anything to avoid 
                        that? Like, I don’t know...kill 
                        some old fuck who’s in your way? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GARDINI (cont'd)
                        Yes! 
                           (beat)
                        And there’s no sign of a struggle, 
                        ‘cause he probably poisoned him. 
                        That’s what these rich bastards do. 
                        Fucking Macbeth style. So, in 
                        conclusion, Henry’s a murderer, 
                        case closed. That’s how it’s done!
                           (calling out)
                        We are...

                                 WEAVER
                           (calling back)
                        ...Marshals.

           Weaver, who is searching through a drawer, gives Gardini a 
           fist pump.

           Jeffries dials her phone and paces the room. A framed photo 
           of Henry and John Travolta giving thumbs up in the cockpit of 
           a private plane catches her attention. She frowns.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (into phone)
                        Yeah. It’s Jeffries. There’s a dead 
                        body in Cashin’s apartment. Send 
                        someone from forensics. And see if 
                        the building has security cam 
                        footage. 
                           (beat)
                        We’re on our way.

           Jeffries hangs up and turns to Gardini.

                                 GARDINI
                        What was that?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Shots fired off 4th and Avenue A in 
                        Manhattan. The description of the 
                        assailant matches Henry Cashin. 

                                 GARDINI
                        Sounds like the desperate, violent 
                        act of a man looking to avoid being 
                        raped.
                           (with a smug smile)
                        I accept apologies in any and all 
                        forms.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Just c’mon.

           Jeffries and Gardini run out of the apartment.
           INT. JOE’S CAR - DAY

           Henry drives as Joe holds the gun to him.

                                 JOE
                        Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I 
                        can’t believe I just shot someone. 
                        This was a bad idea...oh god was 
                        this a bad idea...

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, man. It was. As I always say, 
                        “you kidnap me, you kidnap my 
                        problems.”

           Henry does a line as he drives. Joe stares at Henry in 
           disbelief.

                                 JOE
                        You’re a disgrace. How are you a 
                        politician? You’re a fucking drug 
                        addict!

                                 HENRY
                        No, I’m a functional drug addict. A 
                        lot of us are. 

           Henry does another line. Joe shakes his head.

                                 HENRY
                        I mean, I was once on acid with Ted 
                        Kennedy and he was trying to jump 
                        off a building, and I was saying, 
                        no man, you can't fly. And he was 
                        like “I'm a bird”. And I was like 
                        “No man, you're not. You're a 
                        human. You're just wearing a 
                        feathered cap”. 

           Henry sticks his arm out the window, his hand surfing the 
           wind.

                                 JOE
                        You did acid with Ted Kennedy?

                                 HENRY
                        We also did the wobbly H with his 
                        wife. Kind of ruined our friendship 
                        after that. 
                           (beat)
                        Wait, what was I even talking 
                        about? Oh, yeah. Drugs. Look, Joe, 
                        you ever watch C-Span? Boring, 
                        right? Right. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (cont'd)
                        Well, you get to change the 
                        channel. I have to sit there. My 
                        life is C-Span...except when I'm on 
                        coke.

                                 JOE
                        No more coke. Or coke stories. Just 
                        shut up and concentrate on the road 
                        from here on in. 

                                 HENRY
                        Man, that’s what coke does. It 
                        allows you to fully focus on the 
                        road ahead and anticipate shit.

                                 JOE
                        No, it doesn’t. 
                           (beat)
                        God, what the fuck am I going to 
                        tell Jessica?

                                 HENRY
                        Who’s that? Your favorite whore? 
                        Tell her you’re on an adventure. 
                        Whores like that sort of thing.

                                 JOE
                        What world are you living in!? 
                        She’s my girlfriend. And she’s 
                        going to fucking break up with me, 
                        because I just shot someone. I 
                        should call her. I need to call her 
                        before this gets any worse.

           Joe takes out his phone. Henry grabs it and throws it out the 
           window. 

                                 JOE
                        What the fuck?

                                 HENRY
                        That’s not a phone. That’s a 
                        tracking device for the Federal 
                        government. 
                           (beat)
                        Relax. Okay. Just relax. Take a 
                        break from acting drastically. You 
                        need to solve the problem, to be 
                        the solution. Only then, should you 
                        call her. From an untraceable line.

           Henry reaches into his pocket and pulls out a business card, 
           which he hands to Joe. It’s Brad’s. 
                                 HENRY
                        Look. This is our meal ticket. He 
                        has a shit-ton of money and a 
                        private jet, and he’s going to hook 
                        us up, okay? Maybe he can be a 
                        mentor to you, I don’t know!

           Joe studies the card, unsure.

                                 JOE
                        Just get me my money. I don’t give 
                        a fuck about your jet. 

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           In an ambulance parked outside of Jay’s apartment, Jay lays 
           on the gurney. Jeffries sits next to him holding JOE’S 
           LICENSE up to Jay. Gardini stands beside her, looking bored.  

                                 JAY
                        Yep! That’s the guy who shot me. 
                        Him and Henry Cashin busted into my 
                        apartment, shot me in the shoulder, 
                        and then just started throwing 
                        piles of cocaine everywhere. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        That’s really your story? 

                                 JAY
                        I know! I’m as shocked by it as you 
                        are. It’s truly appalling. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        And what is it that you do for a 
                        living?

                                 JAY
                        Dog trainer. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Dog trainer? And your tax records 
                        confirm that? 

                                 JAY
                        Oh, officer it’s a cash only 
                        business. But fortunately, I keep 
                        immaculate records. Which are now 
                        covered in cocaine due to the 
                        mayhem I had to endure. 

           Jeffries turns to Gardini.
                                 JEFFRIES
                        We’re not gonna get anything out of 
                        this guy. 

           Gardini looks annoyed like he actually has to do some work.

                                 GARDINI
                        Out of the way, Fed.

           He casually sticks his finger in Jay’s bullet wound. 

                                 JAY
                        AAAHHH!! FUUUUUCK!!! 

                                 GARDINI
                        What’s the real story, 
                        motherfucker?!

                                 JAY
                        Ahh! I sell coke to Cashin! He came 
                        in with this Joe guy trying to buy 
                        some off me, but I didn’t trust Joe 
                        and in retrospect, I may have 
                        overreacted, and it turned in to a 
                        gunfight, and I was really scared, 
                        and he shot me! Please pull your 
                        finger out of me!!

           Gardini pulls out his finger and wipes the blood on Jay’s 
           shirt. He looks over to Jeffries and taps his medal of honor. 

                                 GARDINI
                        If you think my investigative 
                        skills are top notch, say nothing 
                        and storm off.

           She takes out her phone and storms off. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (on phone)
                        This is Agent Jeffries. Cashin’s 
                        got an accomplice. Put out an APB 
                        on a Mr. Joseph Hayworth.

           She turns around to see Gardini and Weaver high-fiving.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (to Gardini)
                        Can I see you in the car for a 
                        second?
           INT. JEFFRIES’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries waits until Gardini closes the door, then:

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Let’s get something straight. You 
                        don’t torture a witness to get 
                        answers. There are rules and 
                        regulations we have to abide by.

                                 GARDINI
                        If I hadn’t done that, you’d still 
                        be talking to that prick and 
                        getting nowhere. I don’t know, 
                        maybe if you had a set of balls 
                        instead of...
                           (pointing to her crotch)
                        ...then you’d understand that by 
                        now. This is the jungle, nerd.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Look, I’m sending teams to cover 
                        the airports. We need to follow up 
                        on this Joseph Hayworth.

           An OFFICER approaches the car. She lowers the window and he 
           hands her a DVD.

                                 OFFICER
                        Got the security footage you asked 
                        for. Cued it to some suspicious 
                        looking guys. 

           Jeffries puts the DVD in the dash computer. She FAST-FORWARDS 
           the tape until she sees AXEL and his THUGS enter the 
           apartment with GUNS DRAWN. She REWINDS and freezes it.

                                 GARDINI
                        Wait, that doesn’t look like 
                        Cashin.

           Jeffries stares at the image. She rewinds it again and re-
           watches. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Congrats, you nitwit. You finally 
                        got something right.

           Jeffries takes out the DVD and hands it to the Officer.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Send this to every agency and 
                        department. Let me know if his face 
                        pops up on any radars.
           The Officer nods and runs off. She turns the ignition and 
           speeds off.

           EXT. BRAD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry starts humming ‘Back that Azz up’ as he and Joe walk up 
           to Brad’s front door.

                                 HENRY
                           (under his breath)
                        Girl you look good, won’t you back 
                        that azz up. You’s a big fine 
                        woman, won’t you back that azz up? 

           They approach Brad’s door.

                                 HENRY
                        Here we go, Joseph. Salvation is 
                        nigh. Me and you against the world.

           Henry knocks on the door.

           Henry knocks again. The door finally opens. It’s Brad, in a 
           robe and slippers.

                                 BRAD
                        No way! No way! 

                                 HENRY
                        Braddie!

           Henry jumps in his arms, but Brad is cold and doesn’t hug 
           back.

           INT. BRAD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           They step inside.

                                 BRAD
                        What are you doing here?

                                 HENRY
                        Friendly favor, amigo. Just need to 
                        borrow your private jet. And I’ll 
                        take some pills if you got ‘em. 
                           (beat)
                        Oh! Also, this is Joe. He needs all 
                        the money you have. And maybe some 
                        mentoring, but you two can figure 
                        that out on your own time.

           Joe sheepishly waves.
                                 BRAD
                        Henry, you’ve gotta be kidding me. 
                        You can’t be here right now. Do you 
                        even realize what you’re involved 
                        in? 

           Brad turns on the news. Joe’s face drops as he sees a picture 
           of his DRIVER’S LICENSE with the headline “Cashin’s 
           Accomplice. Wanted for Charges of Attempted Murder.” 

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                           (on TV)
                        From this security footage, police 
                        expect we are dealing with a very 
                        unstable man in Mr. Hayworth. This 
                        was taken just yesterday at the 
                        Apple Store on Fifth Avenue.

           We see grainy Youtube footage of Joe berating the Fourteen 
           year old Girls.

                                 JOE
                           (on TV)
                        I was just telling these young 
                        BLEEPS to go BLEEP out Selena 
                        Gomez. 

                                 HENRY
                        Look at the temper on this man!

           Joe shuts off the TV and turns to Henry.

                                 JOE
                        How the fuck?
                           (reaching for his wallet)
                        No. Oh no. My wallet. Oh no, oh no, 
                        oh no, oh no...

           Joe frantically paces around the room.

                                 BRAD
                        Since when did you get an 
                        accomplice? 

                                 JOE
                        I’m not his accomplice!

                                 HENRY
                        Come off it, Joe. You’re totally my 
                        accomplice! 

                                 JOE
                        I’m not your fucking accomplice!
                                 BRAD
                        Look, I don’t care! You need to get 
                        out of my house!

                                 HENRY
                        Why is everyone pushing me away?!

           Joe is stunned. Henry sees Joe, crushed. He looks at Brad 
           guilty and desperate. 

                                 HENRY
                        Brad, I’m begging you. I need your 
                        help.

                                 BRAD
                        You just need help...in general. 
                        Not from me. 

                                 HENRY
                        But, you’re my best friend. 

           Brad laughs in a very mean-spirited way.

                                 BRAD
                        I’m your lawyer, Henry. People like 
                        me just act like your friend so we 
                        can take your fucking money, you in 
                        particular, because I knew how much 
                        of a degenerate you were. So as 
                        your lawyer, not your friend, I 
                        advise you to get the fuck out of 
                        my house before I take legal action 
                        against you and your accomplice.

                                 JOE
                           (quietly)
                        I’m not his accomplice.

           Henry looks devastated. 

                                 HENRY
                        Brad, you don’t really mean that. 

           Brad stares down Henry. The look says it all. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fine. It’s clear we’re not wanted 
                        here. Joe, let’s be on our way. 

           Henry takes a step towards the door and suddenly turns, jukes 
           left and runs past Brad into the office. 
           INT. BRAD’S TOWNHOUSE - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry runs to the desk and immediately starts rummaging 
           through the drawers. Brad runs after him.

                                 BRAD
                        What are you doing? 

           Brad tries to push Henry back, but he fends him off and 
           continues tossing the drawer.

                                 BRAD
                        You’re destroying the order of my 
                        documents!

           Henry looks over at a Warhol PAINTING on the way. He makes a 
           moves for it.

                                 BRAD
                        Don’t do it! Don’t touch my Warhol.

           Henry rips it off the wall, revealing a WALL SAFE. Brad runs 
           towards him, but Henry throws the painting at him. Brad tries 
           to protect it, but it RIPS over a LAMP.

                                 BRAD
                        Lucky for you that’s a fake!

           Henry punches in a CODE on the safe and it opens. He grabs 
           the SECURITY KEY CARD.

           Brad tackles Henry and the card slides across the floor. They 
           start wrestling over it.

                                 HENRY
                           (calling out)
                        JOE!! JOOOE! Help!

                                 BRAD
                        You can’t beat me, addict. I 
                        wrestled at Princeton. 

           Brad elbows Henry in the back. He gets up to grab the key, 
           but Henry trips up his legs, bringing Brad crashing to the 
           ground.

           Joe runs into the room and sees the chaos.

                                 HENRY
                        Hold him down!

                                 JOE
                        What the - 
           Henry lunges for the card. Brad socks him in the face.

                                 HENRY
                        Help! Get the card! We need the 
                        card!

           Joe rushes over, he cracks Brad over the head with a legal 
           textbook, stunning him. Brad clutches onto the card. 

                                 BRAD
                        That’s assault, motherfucker!

           Suddenly they hear a loud THUD against the front door. All 
           three turn their attention towards it. The thud is quickly 
           followed by another, as the front door breaks down. Axel and 
           his thugs step into the house.

           They all make eye contact. It’s an awkward moment as all 
           parties involved are shocked to see each other.

                                 AXEL
                        Cashin? What the fuck? 

           Axel quickly fires a shot at Henry, and misses. Joe, Henry 
           and Brad, dive behind a couch. 

                                 BRAD
                           (calling out)
                        Take them. I am not who you are 
                        after!

                                 JOE
                        Who the fuck is that? 

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t know!

                                 AXEL
                        Don’t do anything stupid now, Gov. 
                        Just come out, no one will get 
                        hurt. 

           Axel winks to his Thugs as Henry, Joe and Brad tremble behind 
           the couch.

                                 BRAD
                           (loud whisper)
                        You think we’re safe behind here?

                                 HENRY
                           (loud whisper)
                        Yeah! Of course! It’s a couch! It’s 
                        thick!
           Axel just shrugs and starts unloading into the couch. The 
           bullets go straight through it. One of them HITS BRAD. He 
           falls back, blood splattering all over Joe, who is disgusted. 
           Brad passes out.

                                 HENRY
                        Brad!

                                 JOE
                        Oh my God. Oh my God. 

           Joe starts to dry heave, about to vomit again.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t fucking throw up again! 

           But Joe can’t help it. He vomits.

                                 HENRY
                        Goddamnit! You’re leaving DNA 
                        everywhere! 

           Henry scans the area and sees a room directly in front of 
           them. He grabs the KEY CARD off the ground and points.

                                 HENRY
                        Aright, if you can manage to just 
                        shoot at these guys once, we can 
                        run into that room. You think you 
                        can do that?

           Joe cocks the gun.

                                 JOE
                        Fuck you. One. Two...three.

           Joe stands up and wildly fires several rounds, CLIPPING ONE 
           OF AXEL’S THUGS. As the rest duck for cover, Henry and Joe 
           make a break for it. 

           INT. BRAD’S TOWNHOUSE - GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Joe run in and slam the door behind them. 

                                 HENRY
                        You can’t just shoot at the air. 
                        You gotta shoot at people!

                                 JOE
                        The last gun I shot was a fucking 
                        supersoaker. At summer camp! 
                                 HENRY
                        No, the last time you shot someone 
                        was ten minutes ago.
                           (sotto)
                        In cold blood.

           Suddenly Axel and his thugs begin their attempts at breaking 
           down the door.

                                 HENRY
                        We gotta barricade ourselves. Come 
                        on.

           They drag a desk over towards the door. The thugs slam 
           against the door, pushing the desk back.

                                 HENRY
                        Shoot through the door!!

                                 JOE
                        What? No! Then they’ll shoot back 
                        at us through the door!

                                 HENRY
                        Not if we shoot them first! Fuck. 
                        Fine! I’ll do it!

           Henry grabs the gun and unloads the clip into the door and 
           walls. There’s a moment of silence.

                                 HENRY
                        You think I got ‘em?

           They pause for another moment. Suddenly a parade of bullets 
           rip through the wall towards Joe and Henry who drop to the 
           ground. The shooting subsides and the door pounding 
           continues. Joe angrily takes back the gun. 

                                 JOE
                        Gimme that!

           Henry looks for an escape route. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck this.

           Henry grabs a chair and throws it through the window; he 
           jumps out and Joe follows.

           INT. BRAD’S TOWNHOUSE - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           One of the thugs is on the ground clutching his bleeding arm. 
           A couple more thugs prepare to take another run at the door.
                                 AXEL
                        Wait!

           Axel peeks through one of the bullet holes and sees Joe 
           jumping out the window.

                                 AXEL
                        They’re outside. Get around back!

           Axel and his team run out the door.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Joe haul ass down the street and around the corner. 
           Axel and his thugs comes barreling down the street, firing at 
           them. They get to their car. Henry gets in, but Joe 
           hesitates.

                                 HENRY
                        Come on!

           Just then Axel fires at them, blowing out the back window of 
           the car. Henry starts the engine. Joe gets in and Henry 
           immediately floors it. Axel runs back to his car, but it’s 
           too late. Henry and Joe are long gone.

           EXT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

           Jeffries and Gardini approach Joe’s apartment. Jeffries 
           KNOCKS.

                                 GARDINI
                        Why the fuck you knocking? You 
                        looking to borrow an extension 
                        cord?

           Gardini leans in to bust down the door with his shoulder. 
           BANG! The door doesn’t budge. Gardini stumbles back in pain.

                                 GARDINI
                           (under his breath)
                        Ah, fuck.

           Jeffries tries the door handle. It’s unlocked. She swings the 
           door open, giving Gardini an obvious, arrogant look.

           They enter.
           INT. JOE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries and Gardini look around the shitty apartment. 
           Jeffries is confused, but Gardini immediately goes towards 
           the new APPLE PRODUCTS Joe bought after he quit.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        This doesn’t make sense. This can’t 
                        be right.

                                 GARDINI
                        This makes perfect sense. We just 
                        spread this bitch’s legs wide open.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        This isn’t an accomplice. This is a 
                        college student. At best. 

           Gardini holds out his middle three fingers together towards 
           Jeffries.

                                 GARDINI
                        You gotta read between the lines.
                           (gesturing to Joe’s stuff)
                        This apartment is clearly a front. 
                        Brand new Laptop. Bose Speakers. 
                        Unopened Beats by Dre headphones. 
                        This guy is clearly living off the 
                        books.

           Jeffries looks at a dorky PHOTO of Joe and Jessica at Senor 
           Frogs. She doesn’t fully believe Gardini, who is tapping 
           along the walls.

                                 GARDINI
                        There’s gotta be a safe hidden in 
                        one of these walls.

           Gardini’s phone RINGS. He answers it.

                                 GARDINI
                        This is Gardini.

           INTERCUT

           EXT. NYPD PRECINCT - ROOF TOP - SAME

           Detective PEREZ stands on the roof, holding onto a file. A 
           cigarette dangles from his mouth.

                                 PEREZ
                        Yo, Gardini. What up, you still fat 
                        as fuck?
                                 GARDINI
                        Perez you dirty spic, you still got 
                        nine illegals squatting in your 
                        apartment?

                                 PEREZ
                        You know it, baby. Look, I heard 
                        you were asking around for an ID 
                        off the Cashin footage.

                                 GARDINI
                        Whatcha got for me?

           Gardini snaps for Jeffries attention.

                                 PEREZ
                        His name’s Axel Wallace. We’ve had 
                        a wire up on him for months. ‘Cause 
                        of budget cuts we can’t man it 
                        24/7, but I went through it. We’re 
                        sending you the audio files right 
                        now. You might want to give a 
                        listen. It’s some fucked up shit, 
                        bro.

           Gardini starts gyrating, air-fucking the couch with 
           excitement.

                                 GARDINI
                        Perez, you’re a life saver. If they 
                        try to deport your family. Let me 
                        know and I’ll marry your wife...and 
                        fuck her. Many, many times.

           The line goes dead. He rushes over to Joe’s computer and logs 
           into his USMS email.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        What’s up? What’s going on?

                                 GARDINI
                           (tapping his medal)
                        Fucking Gold medaling here. Just 
                        got an ID on the guy from Cashin’s. 
                        Some thug named, Axel.

           Gardini opens the e-mail and pulls up the AUDIO FILE. It’s 
           the conversation between Shankrow and Axel from the 
           beginning.

                                 SHANKROW (V.O.)
                        I ordered a pizza a long time ago, 
                        and now that the pizza has gone 
                        bad, I need it disposed of.
           Jeffries eyes light up. Her brain immediately starts turning. 
           She rewinds the tape and plays Shankrow’s voice again.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I know that voice. That’s Sam 
                        Shankrow. 

                                 GARDINI
                        Who the fuck is that?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        He’s a huge real-estate developer. 
                        He practically financed Cashin’s re-
                        election campaign. 

                                 GARDINI
                        So what you’re saying is, Cashin’s 
                        the pizza?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Not if we get to him first.

                                 GARDINI
                        Don’t get it twisted, y’all. It’s 
                        my audio file. The Marshal service 
                        is taking the collar...And the 
                        pizza!

           Gardini, with a weird lust in his eyes, runs out of the 
           apartment, leaving Jeffries standing bemused.

           INT. BRAD’S TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Axel sits on the couch, holding Brad at gunpoint, while he 
           talks into his phone. Brad is badly injured. The thug who was 
           errantly shot is now dead on the floor.

                                 AXEL
                        News about your pizza. Delivery 
                        went a little awry-

                                 SHANKROW
                        Forget the pizza talk! Just tell me 
                        what the fuck’s going on. 

                                 AXEL
                        Shots were fired. He got away. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        You let him get away?! Where’s he 
                        headed?! 
                                 AXEL
                        In the process of figuring that out 
                        right now. 

           Axel nods at Brad and winks at him. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Hurry it up! I’m paying for speedy 
                        service.  

           Axel hangs up the phone and turns his attention to Brad. 

                                 BRAD
                           (terrified)
                        You guys don’t have to hurt me. 
                        I’ll tell you anything you want! 
                        You want Henry, right? I’ll tell 
                        you right where he’s going! He’s 
                        trying to escape and he’s going to 
                        steal my fucking plane. White 
                        Plains Executive Airport. Go there! 
                        Please!

                                 AXEL
                        Thanks. 
                           (to Thug #1)
                        Kill him. 

           Axel turns to leave. 

                                 BRAD
                        What?! NO! But I told you 
                        everything! 

           When he reaches the door, Axel turns back. 

                                 AXEL
                           (to Thug #1)
                        I don’t understand. Why is he still 
                        talking? Why isn’t he dead yet? 

                                 THUG #1
                        I-I don’t know if I can do it. 
                        Seeing that old man die. Just 
                        watching his life slowly ebb out of 
                        him...it really fucked with me. I 
                        mean-

           BLAM! BLAM! In one swift motion, Axel shoots Brad and Thug #1 
           dead. He turns to Thug #2 and Thug #3. 

                                 AXEL
                        Let’s go. 
           Thug #2 and Thug #3 look at each other, scared, then follow. 

           INT. JOE’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Henry drives at the speed of traffic in attempt to blend in, 
           despite the car being totalled and shot through. Joe is 
           looking behind, to make sure Axel isn’t still in pursuit.

           Both men look depressed and worn out.

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t believe Brad got shot. He 
                        had some really harsh words, that 
                        if I go to jail I’ll probably play 
                        back in my head many times, but 
                        he’s an asshole, so how am I 
                        supposed to feel right now?

                                 JOE
                           (totally ignoring him)
                        I’m gonna go to jail. I’m gonna 
                        spend three to five years in jail. 
                        Oh my God. What the fuck am I 
                        doing?

           Joe puts his head in his hands. Henry tries to pet him.

                                 HENRY
                        There, there, Joe. Come on!

           Joe springs up. He slams the dashboard.

                                 JOE
                        PULL THE FUCKING CAR OVER!

                                 HENRY
                        Jesus. Okay.

           Henry pulls over next to a PARK. Joe gets out of the car and 
           starts walking down the sidewalk. Henry slowly drives 
           alongside of Joe.  

                                 HENRY
                        You sure about this? We’re wanted 
                        fugitives, man. Come on, get back 
                        in the car.

                                 JOE
                        Every second I spend with you, my 
                        life gets exponentially worse. 
                        Everything you touch turns to 
                        complete shit. The state. Your 
                        marriage. My life. 
                                 HENRY
                        Don’t act like you’re completely 
                        innocent in all this. You were the 
                        one that kidnapped me, remember? 
                        Bang, bang, Lu Xang?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, and it was the worst decision 
                        of my life. 

                                 HENRY
                           (hurt)
                        Come on, man. Don’t say that. We 
                        can still get your money. I have so 
                        much money in the Maldives, it’s 
                        insane. I’m talkin’ eight duffle 
                        bags full of $100 bills.

                                 JOE
                        I don’t even care about the money 
                        anymore. I need my girlfriend.

                                 HENRY
                        The last thing you need is a woman. 
                        My wife, your girl, they’re all the 
                        same. Sure, behind every great man 
                        is a great woman. But behind every 
                        broken man is a woman running.

                                 JOE
                        That’s you. ‘Cause you’re a whore-
                        mongerer. That’s not me. Drive 
                        away. Please.

                                 HENRY
                           (sadly)
                        But...it’s us against the world. 

                                 JOE
                        No, it’s not. It’s been you against 
                        the world. You don’t care about me. 
                        All you care about is your coke and 
                        your plane. So I’m leaving Henry. 
                        I’m gonna get my girl back.
                           (beat)
                        Fuck you.

           Joe walks across the street, away from Henry. We STAY ON 
           Henry in the car. Totally alone. He feebly parks the car and 
           starts rummaging through his pockets. A microscopic amount of 
           cocaine powder is on his finger. He rubs his gums with it. 

           He turns on the radio. “Breathe Me” by Sia is playing. Henry 
           starts to tear up.
           EXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe gets to a PAY PHONE. It smells bad and is covered in 
           grease and dirt. He braces himself and picks it up. 

                                 JOE
                        I’d like to make a collect call...

                                                    INTERCUT WITH: 

           INT. JESSICA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jessica picks up the phone. Ron is there, looking furious.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hello? Joe, is that you?

                                 JOE
                        Yes! It’s me! This phone is 
                        disgusting. Oh, Jesus.

                                 JESSICA
                        Joe, where have you been?! I’ve 
                        been trying to call you all day! 
                        They’re saying really bad stuff 
                        about you on the news.

                                 JOE
                        Jessica, I’m so sorry. I don’t know 
                        what to do. They took away my 
                        scholarship, and I tried to fix 
                        things, but I fucked everything up. 

                                 JESSICA
                        What? Joe. I told you, none of that 
                        matters to me. We can figure this 
                        out. Just turn yourself in--

           Ronald grabs the phone.

                                 RONALD 
                        Joe, I’m gonna be quick and frank 
                        in case they’re monitoring this 
                        phone call, but you have one 
                        option. Run. Fucking run.

                                 JOE
                        What? Ron?! What kind of option is 
                        that?

                                 RONALD
                        You’re gonna go to jail, buddy. 
                        Kidnapping. Attempted murder. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RONALD (cont'd)
                        That’s 20 to life. I don’t want 
                        that criminal baggage anywhere near 
                        my daughter!

                                 JESSICA
                        Dad! Shut up! Give me the phone 
                        back.

           Jessica grabs the phone back.

                                 JESSICA
                        Don’t listen to him. Just come 
                        home. We can work this out.

                                 JOE
                        Your dad’s right. I’m sorry, 
                        Jessica.

           Joe drops the phone, crushed. He looks across the park at 
           Henry in the car, passed out, finally having come down from a 
           day full of cocaine. Joe looks around, searching for options. 

           He notices a COP CAR, rounding the park, about to turn onto 
           the street on which Henry is parked. Joe watches for a beat. 

                                 JOE
                           (to himself)
                        This is a bad idea.

           Joe runs towards Henry as the COP CAR turns onto the street. 
           Joe slips through the pedestrians and gets back into the car.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Joe slams the door shut.

                                 JOE
                        Henry! Drive!

           Henry is startled. Still in a daze.

                                 HENRY
                        Joe?

                                 JOE
                        We gotta go! Cops.

                                 HENRY
                        You came back for me. 
                           (beat)
                        Your skirt left you in the lurch?
                                 JOE
                        She didn’t leave me, I’m leaving 
                        her. She’s too good for me. We need 
                        to leave. Now.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s really romantic, Joe. I wish 
                        there was a girl version of you. I 
                        think I could have sex with someone 
                        like that without being high.

           The COPS are now out of their car. Approaching. Guns drawn. 

                                 COP #1 (O.S.)
                           (yelling out)
                        Take your hands off the wheel and 
                        slowly exit the vehicle!

           Henry looks in the mirror and sees the cops getting closer.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh shit, cops.
                           (turning to Joe)
                        This is it. I hit the gas there’s 
                        no turning back. You’re with me to 
                        the end.

                                 JOE
                        I’m fucked either way. So just go!

                                 HENRY
                        Say it, amigo. You want to go to 
                        the Maldives with me.

           Joe looks in the mirror, panicked. 

                                 JOE
                           (softly)
                        Yeah, yeah, the Maldives, whatever. 
                        DRIVE!

                                 HENRY
                        What’d you say? I can’t hear you!

                                 JOE
                        I WANT TO GO TO THE FUCKING 
                        MALDIVES!

                                 HENRY
                        With who?!

                                 JOE 
                        I WANT TO GO TO THE FUCKING 
                        MALDIVES WITH YOU!
                                 HENRY
                        YES!

           Henry guns it out onto the street. The cops run back into 
           their car as Henry weaves his way through traffic.  

                                 HENRY
                        You’re gonna love life on the lam, 
                        Joe.
                           (he whips another turn)
                        You can dye your hair, grow a 
                        moustache. We’ll get you set up 
                        with University of Phoenix’s online 
                        law school. But you better be a 
                        self-motivator! 

           Henry whips onto another street, just narrowly missing some 
           pedestrians. More COP CARS have joined the pursuit.

                                 HENRY
                        You ready to see something special? 
                        I used to drive Ferrari’s for 
                        sport.

                                 JOE
                        Well, we’re not in Monaco, and this 
                        is a fucking Honda!

                                 HENRY
                        Doesn’t matter. It’s all in the 
                        technique. Man, I wish had my 
                        driving gloves right now.

           Henry slams on the brakes. The cop car directly behind them 
           runs into them full steam. The back of Henry’s car slides up 
           on the hood of the cop car, blocking the cop’s view.

           Henry guns the gas again, the back tires spinning onto the 
           hood, eventually catapulting them forward.

           Henry and Joe glance back at the piled up cop cars. A couple 
           of the cops manage to get around it and stay on pace.

                                 HENRY
                        Ha! See? Three down! Only a couple 
                        more to go.

           Two blocks down, Joe sees a police barricade. They’ve laid 
           down tire spikes.

                                 JOE
                        Shut up, you idiot! Tire spikes! 
                        Tire spikes!
           Henry guns it and the car flies over the tire spikes...WHAM!

           The tires explode, sparks fly off the wheels, but this 
           doesn’t slow them down. 

                                 HENRY
                        When’s the last time you got this 
                        car serviced, Joe? It sucks!

           The car is rocking back and forth, it’s becoming increasingly 
           difficult to control the wheels.

                                 JOE
                        We’re gonna get cornered!

                                 HENRY
                        No! They can’t corner what they 
                        can’t predict!

           Henry scans the neighborhood. The streets are pretty empty. 
           Henry points to a pizza shop down the block.

                                 HENRY
                        There! We’re gonna drive through 
                        it! 

                                 JOE
                        Are you out of your fucking mind!

                                 HENRY
                        No! I’m in my fucking mind! We 
                        gotta bust right through that pizza 
                        shop!

                                 JOE
                        We can’t do it! It’ll kill us!

           Henry grabs Joe’s arm, doing his best impression of a real 
           politician.

                                 HENRY
                        Yes, we can. Yes. We. Can.

           Joe braces for impact.

                                 HENRY
                        By the way, close your eyes and 
                        mouth. Airbag powder tastes like 
                        shit.

           Henry speeds forward and starts honking the horn to clear the 
           sidewalk and hops the curb.
           He crashes through the front window of the Pizza Place. The 
           airbags explode out from the dash, smacking each of them hard 
           in the face.

                                 JOE
                        Holy fuck! We’re alive.

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck yeah! Let’s run!

           Joe looks over to see a shard of glass sticking out of 
           Henry’s left arm.

                                 JOE
                        Your arm!

           Henry looks down and sees the glass.

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t even feel it! The 
                        adrenaline is crazy!

                                 JOE
                        C’mon let’s go!

           INT. PIZZA PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           The place is a total warzone. The OWNER is freaking out.

           Henry and Joe run towards the back of the store. Meanwhile 
           the Owner has grabbed his shotgun and begins unloading clips 
           towards them. 

                                 OWNER
                        You sons of bitch! 

           They cover themselves as they reach the back of the store. 
           Henry grabs the door handle. It’s jammed. 

                                 JOE
                        Go! Go! Open it!

           Henry looks back at the Owner. 

                                 HENRY
                        Get down!

           Henry grabs Joe and pushes him down. The owner shoots off the 
           door handle. 

                                 JOE
                        Fuck! Thanks!
           Henry sees the Owner reloading.

                                 HENRY
                        Suck me off later. We gotta go!

           Henry kicks the door open and they escape through the back 
           just as the cops arrive through the front.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Joe look around the alley. Joe spots a garden.

                                 JOE
                        There! Let’s go!

           Joe and Henry take off through the garden and disappear. 

           INT. SHANKROW’S OFFICE - DAY

           Shankrow is SHREDDING stacks of documents. His intercom 
           crackles to life. 

                                 DMITRI (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                        Mr. Shankrow, there’s an Agent 
                        Jeffries and Agent...
                           (beat)
                        I’m sorry, Marshal Gardini here to 
                        see you.

                                 SHANKROW
                           (to himself)
                        Oh god. Oh no. Calm down, Sam. They 
                        don’t know anything. You’re fine. 
                        Everything is fine.

           Shankrow stops himself, takes a deep breathe, and exhales. 

                                 SHANKROW
                           (into the intercom)
                        Send them in, Dmitri. 

           Shankrow composes himself. Jeffries and Gardini walk in. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I’m sorry to bother you Mr. 
                        Shankrow. As you may have heard, 
                        Governor Cashin is on the loose.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Yes, I’ve been following it on the 
                        news. 
                                 JEFFRIES
                        We were just wondering if you could 
                        help us out.
                           (holding out a photo of 
                           Axel)
                        What do you know about this man? 
                        Look familiar to you?

                                 SHANKROW
                           (shaking his head)
                        Not even a little. In fact, I’m 
                        very unfamiliar with that 
                        gentlemen. Anything else I can help 
                        you with? 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        That’s interesting because you had 
                        a conversation with him this 
                        morning.

           Jeffries holds out her iphone and plays the recording.

                                 SHANKROW (V.O.)
                        I ordered a pizza a long time ago, 
                        and now that the pizza has gone 
                        bad, I need it disposed of.

           Shankrow hides his fear and tries to play it cool.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Yeah, so what? I don’t get it. Some 
                        guy ordered a pizza.  

                                 GARDINI
                        Had any pizza lately?

                                 SHANKROW
                        No, but obviously you have. 

                                 GARDINI
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

           Shankrow shrugs coyly. Gardini steps forward, but Jeffries 
           holds him back.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        It’s clearly your voice on the 
                        tape, Mr. Shankrow, and we will 
                        prove it.
                                 SHANKROW
                        I appreciate the compliment. That 
                        voice does have a certain je ne 
                        sais quoi mysteriousness about it, 
                        but again, it’s not mine, so please 
                        leave.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Let me ask a question. How did you 
                        get the zoning permit for the 
                        Gateway National Park?

                                 SHANKROW
                        It’s called acumen. Something you 
                        and the dough boy should learn, 
                        before you start harassing the good 
                        citizens of this city.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        By acumen, do you mean you bribed 
                        Governor Cashin? 

                                 SHANKROW
                        The only time I’ve given money to 
                        Cashin is when I donated to his 
                        campaign, which if you’ve done your 
                        research, was totally above board 
                        and legal.

                                 GARDINI
                        Is “campaign” D.C. lingo for hooker 
                        fund?

           Gardini smiles to Jeffries, like “good one, right?”

                                 SHANKROW
                        I don’t know what you’re implying 
                        and frankly I’m offended. I support 
                        our democratic system. Period.

           Shankrow points several framed photos on the wall.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Look, if I’d known Cashin was such 
                        a freak, I never would have backed 
                        him. But I did, and I’ll chalk it 
                        up as one mistake in a career of 
                        otherwise incredible decisions.   

           He points to another photo of him on the back of a yacht 
           holding a GIANT MARLIN, along side another man, who we 
           recognize as Brad. The name on the boat: Street Cred.
                                 SHANKROW
                        You see, I operate with style and 
                        class. I don’t associate myself 
                        with scumbags.

           He shoves back the PHOTO of Axel. Jeffries ignores it and 
           steps toward the photo of Shankrow and Brad.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        One last question. What are you 
                        doing with this man?

                                 SHANKROW
                        He’s my lawyer.

           Jeffries smiles and taps Brad’s face. She looks at Gardini 
           and they share a look of delight.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Henry and Joe walk through a totally run down neighborhood.

                                 JOE
                        That was fucking sick. We just 
                        outran the police! 

           Henry reaches for his shoulder in pain. We reveal a PIECE OF 
           GLASS bulging out. He turns to Joe.

                                 HENRY
                        How bad is it? 

                                 JOE
                           (clearly lying)
                        It’s not that bad?

           Henry looks around. He scans the cross-streets. His light-
           bulb turns on.

                                 HENRY
                        Come on.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. DON MATTINGLY ELEMENTARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry leads Joe up the steps to the front door of the school.

                                 JOE
                        Don Mattingly?
                                 HENRY
                        Nurse and I had a little...not a 
                        rendezvous...a, uh tryst...when I 
                        was rebuilding this place.
                           (beat)
                        She had a real nice cabinet full of 
                        pain killers and gauze.

                                 JOE
                        We can’t just break into the 
                        school.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh look! I found the hidden key!

           Henry picks up the rock and HURLS it through the window, 
           smashing it. He then motions for Joe to give him a boost.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Joe takes stock of the nice amenities. We recognize this 
           school from the first scene of the film.

                                 JOE
                        This school is actually pretty rad. 
                        Who knew.

                                 HENRY
                        State senate wouldn’t give me 
                        the money I needed to rebuild it, 
                        but the kids in this neighborhood 
                        deserve the best, just like any kid 
                        upstate. So I said fuck it and paid 
                        for it myself. Anonymously. By 
                        naming it after my favorite 
                        baseball player.

           Joe nods approvingly.

                                 HENRY
                        Alright, this way to the nurse’s 
                        office.

           INT. SUV - DAY

           Jeffries and Gardini race through the streets.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        The lawyer. Cashin’s goddamn 
                        lawyer. The guy goes everywhere 
                        with him.
                                 GARDINI
                        Yeah. He was there when I picked 
                        Cashin up. They were hugging in a 
                        really weird way.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Exactly.

                                 GARDINI
                        And another thing. Who the fuck 
                        does that guy think he is calling 
                        me fat? That bastard is gonna pay 
                        and so is his crooked-ass lawyer.

           Her phone RINGS. She answers it.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (into phone)
                        This is Jeffries. What?! How long 
                        ago? Was anyone injured? Alright, 
                        keep me posted. We’re going to 
                        question his lawyer now. WHAT?! 
                        When? Why wasn’t I notified!

           She slams down the phone.

                                 JEFFRIES (CONT’D)
                        Silverman’s body was found shot up 
                        in his home.

                                 GARDINI
                        What the fuck? It’s like the 
                        bubonic plague with these 
                        witnesses. 

           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe rummages through the medicine cabinet as Henry sits on 
           the patient table. 

                                 HENRY
                        You know, I was sitting right in 
                        that chair the first time I 
                        realized being Governor could be 
                        cool. My hands were covered in 
                        paint, Trudy was fellating me, and 
                        it finally felt like I had reached 
                        some kids.
                           (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (cont'd)
                        I would have been happy marrying 
                        Trudy that day, taking up as a 
                        Principal with an ounce a week weed 
                        habit...but there’s no way that 
                        would’ve been good enough for the 
                        Son of Henry Cashin II.

                                 JOE
                        I don’t get it. Why didn’t you just 
                        leave? Light your own path?

           Joe turns back to Henry, holding out a bunch of pill bottles 
           and bandages. 

                                 HENRY
                        Let me see those.

           Henry scans the pill bottles and spots one for ADDEROL.

                                 HENRY
                        Jackpot.

           He pops one as Joe begins to bandage his arm.

                                 HENRY
                        At first I thought I could make a 
                        difference. Actually help people 
                        out. But it’s crazy, it’s all 
                        unions and contracts, and people 
                        offering you up money and hookers. 
                        After a while, when everyone’s 
                        telling you stuff like “you’re the 
                        Governor, you can do whatever you 
                        want,” you start to think you can 
                        actually get away with it. So I 
                        began dabbling in cocaine, then I 
                        dabbled a bit more, and more...and 
                        before I knew it I was mixing acid 
                        with ecstacy, fucking between six 
                        and ten prostitutes a week. 
                           (beat)
                        I should’ve probably just resigned, 
                        now that I say it out loud like 
                        this. 

           Henry pops another adderol pill. Joe looks extremely taken 
           aback, but doesn’t want to spoil this moment.

                                 JOE
                        You know I never even wanted to be 
                        a lawyer.

                                 HENRY
                        Why’d you kidnap me then, man?
                                 JOE
                        It was all for Jessica’s father. 
                        He’s a fancy judge and I just felt 
                        I could never be good enough for 
                        her if I wasn’t a lawyer too. 

                                 HENRY
                        Wait, he’s a judge? Can he help 
                        you?

                                 JOE
                        No. He hates me.

                                 HENRY
                        You can’t be afraid of fathers. 
                        Look where it got me. Buried up to 
                        my neck in hookers. And after about 
                        five or seven years, that starts 
                        getting a little lonely. So fuck 
                        him, man. And fuck being a lawyer. 
                        Do what you want. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s a little late for that now.

                                 HENRY
                        When you were in school, what did 
                        you want to be? Like in third grade 
                        or whatever.

                                 JOE
                        Are you serious?

                                 HENRY
                        Alright in eighth grade.

           An embarrassed beat. 

                                 JOE
                        A professional basketball player, 
                        an astronaut or a teacher. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well, you’re white and shockingly 
                        slow, and there’s no way Nasa’s 
                        going to hire a known criminal, but 
                        if I was a principal, you’d be my 
                        first round pick. 

                                 JOE
                           (laughing)
                        Oh really? Maybe we can start a 
                        little school in the Maldives. 
                        Maldive prep.
                                 HENRY
                        We can teach all the natives 
                        English, and sex ed. That’s a great 
                        idea. 

           Henry pops like four Tylenol.

                                 HENRY
                        The wonders of the West. 

           EXT. DON MATTINGLY ELEMENTARY - SAME

           A COP approaches the school. He notices the broken window. He 
           tries to open the door, but sees that it’s locked. He takes 
           out his radio.

                                 COP
                        I’ve got a broken window here at 
                        Mattingly elementary.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry walks out of the PRINCIPAL’s OFFICE with a set of car 
           keys to find Joe staring at the MURAL on the wall. The same 
           mural we saw earlier with Henry and the kids. 

                                 JOE
                        Is that you?

           Henry nods and points to a fat black woman in a Nurse’s 
           outfit in the background.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. And there’s Trudy.

           Joe smiles.

                                 HENRY
                        I look pretty handsome, I think. 

                                 JOE
                        You actually look like a 
                        Politician.

           Henry takes one last look at this better version of himself. 
           He smiles as his nose begins to bleed. 

                                 HENRY
                        Jesus, I need help.

                                 JOE
                        I know you do.
                                 HENRY
                        I really fucked everything up. I’m 
                        sorry for that.

           There’s a beat.

                                 JOE
                        I’m in it now. Us against the 
                        world.

           Henry smiles.

                                 HENRY
                        Us against the world.

           Just then they hear the cop’s RADIO. They freeze.

                                 JOE
                        Shit! 
                           (looking around)
                        Through the playground!

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Joe climb over a fence to get to the parking lot 
           and run onto the bus.

           INT. BRAD’S TOWNHOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The area is taped off and crawling with police. Gardini and 
           Jeffries make their way through the scene. 

           They’re not even concerned with the dead bodies of Brad and 
           Axel’s thug. They start rummaging through the files Henry 
           threw around earlier.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Keep your eyes open for anything. 
                        Signatures, account numbers, 
                        anything that ties Shankrow’s dirty 
                        money to Cashin. 

           Gardini spots a RECEIPT lying on the floor. It says “WHITE 
           PLAINS EXECUTIVE AIRPORT: LOT 4B”. 

                                 GARDINI
                        I think I just got something 
                        better.
                           (handing over the receipt)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GARDINI (cont'd)
                        That tweaked-out drug dealer said 
                        Cashin was headed for a private 
                        plane. What if that’s why he came 
                        here?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Nice work. Call it in.

           Gardini takes out his phone. Jeffries starts pulling out 
           FILES from the safe. She rifles through some DOCUMENTS. 
           Several in particular catch her attention.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Son of a bitch. These are deposit 
                        slips for off-shore accounts in the 
                        Maldives.
                           (beat)
                        The fucking Maldives. That’s where 
                        he’s going!

                                 GARDINI
                        I got a feeling there’s gonna be 
                        some shiny-ass medals waiting for 
                        us on the tarmac.

           EXT. WHITE PLAINS EXECUTIVE AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           Axel drives towards the entrance of the airport. His thugs 
           load their clips. Axel’s phone rings.

                                 AXEL
                        Yeah?

                                                     INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Shankrow, frazzled, is on a pay phone. He holds the dirty 
           PHONE with a handkerchief.

                                 SHANKROW
                        You’re phone is being tapped! You 
                        need to call me from a clean line, 
                        on whatever number came up on your 
                        call display. Immediately!

           Axel memorizes the number on the phone and then casually 
           throws it out the window. He snaps to the THUG in shotgun, 
           who opens the glove compartment and pulls out a new PHONE. He 
           rips off the wrapper and hands it over to Axel. He dials.
                                 SHANKROW
                        Is this clean? Are you sure?

                                 AXEL
                        Like a fairy’s asshole. Now talk.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Updates! I need updates! I now have 
                        the FBI sniffing around my office. 
                        The F.B. FUCKING I!

                                 AXEL
                        Pulling up to Cashin’s location 
                        now. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        I need you to add those Feds to our  
                        to-do list.

                                 AXEL
                        Text me the details. You better hit 
                        an ATM, motherfucker.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Wait! Don’t hang up. I want to be 
                        there. 

                                 AXEL
                        What?

                                 SHANKROW
                           (nervous, rambling)
                        Look, I respect you, and don’t take 
                        this the wrong way, because I think 
                        you’re awesome, Axel. I think 
                        you’re fantastic. But seeing as 
                        today has been, how do I put it...a 
                        little more loose than usual? I 
                        just think I’d feel a little more 
                        comfortable if I was there to see 
                        it through. See it with my own 
                        eyes.

                                 AXEL
                        Absolutely not. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        I’ll pay you extra! 50,000 more!

           Axel sighs.

                                 AXEL
                        Fine. Hold on a sec.
           Axel and his thugs roll up to the airport’s security 
           entrance. Two SECURITY GUARDS greet them at the gate.

                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                        Driver’s license and key card 
                        please.

                                 AXEL
                        Here you go.

           Axel reaches down and pulls out a gun. He KILLS both guards. 
           One of the thugs gets out and grabs a Security Guard’s key 
           card. Axel picks the phone back up.

                                 AXEL
                           (into phone)
                        I’ll send one of my guys to pick 
                        you up. Should be there in 15-

                                 SHANKROW
                        Wait, wait, wait, were those 
                        gunshots?! Did you just kill him?! 

                                 AXEL
                           (into phone)
                        15 minutes. Be ready.

           Axel swipes the key card and the gate opens up. His car pulls 
           onto the tarmac.

           INT. JEFFRIES’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries and Gardini speed down the highway. Gardini drives 
           as Jeffries reviews the files from Brad’s. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Check this out. Since Shankrow made 
                        his first donation four years ago, 
                        Cashin has also made 28 different 
                        deposits. And each one coincides 
                        with a donation...
                           (reading a document)
                        Every 3 months. God damn it! That’s 
                        how he’s camouflaging the bribes.

           She holds up more files.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        God knows how many other 
                        “Shankrows” he’s got on his hook.

                                 GARDINI
                        Fuck! Cashin’s such a dickweed.
                                 JEFFRIES
                        And we got him! And Shankrow.

                                 GARDINI
                        Together.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Together.

           Jeffries and Gardini smile at each other. They then see the 
           White Plains Executive Airport SIGN up ahead.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        You ready for this?

                                 GARDINI
                        I was born-

           SMASH!!! A BULLET rips through the windshield.

           EXT. JEFFRIES’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car swerves off the road, flies over the highway railing, 
           and barrel-rolls down a hill, SLAMMING into a tree. There is 
           no movement in the overturned car, the wheels still rolling. 

           EXT. HANGER - CONTINUOUS

           Axel lowers a SNIPER RIFLE. 

                                 AXEL
                        Hah! That’s 400k in the 
                        motherfuckin’ bank. 

           Axel’s picks up his phone and dials Shankrow.

                                 AXEL
                           (into phone)
                        Here’s your update. Feds are dead. 
                        Cashin’s next.

                                 SHANKROW (O.S.)
                        Great. Don’t do him without me. I’m 
                        almost there.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT

           Henry drives as happy as a little school boy. Joe sits up 
           front looking a little nervous.
                                 HENRY
                           (singing to himself)
                        Call me Big Daddy when you back 
                        that...
                           (to himself)
                        Why has that song been stuck in my 
                        head all day?

           Henry turns to Joe.

                                 HENRY
                        So let’s talk about Maldive Prep. 
                        Should we enforce a Dress Code? I 
                        feel like that encourages 
                        discipline, but by the same token 
                        we don’t want to stifle their 
                        imaginations.

                                 JOE
                        I’m more concerned about whether 
                        you can actually fly a plane in 
                        your condition.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m an excellent pilot, Joe. 
                        Remember that acid story about 
                        Kennedy? What if I told you it all 
                        took place while I was flying a 
                        plane.
                           (beat)
                        Trust me.

           Joe cracks a smile.

           EXT. WHITE PLAINS EXECUTIVE AIRPORT - LATER

           Henry and Joe drive up to the security gate. The bodies have 
           been removed and most of the blood is covered up; they don’t 
           notice. Henry swipes the Key Card. The gate opens and they 
           pull forward.

                                 HENRY
                        See. How easy was that?

           Henry drives down the tarmac along a row of hangers and other 
           planes. They park next to HANGER 4B. Inside they see a JET 
           AIRPLANE. It glistens with freedom.

                                 HENRY
                        There she is. Our steel chariot.

           They exit the car and walk towards the plane.
                                 SHANKROW (O.S.)
                           (audible whispering)
                        Hey Axel, watch this...
                           (loudly)
                        Bad news, Governor. I think your 
                        flight’s been delayed.

           Henry and Joe turn to see Shankrow, excited to have delivered 
           this line. He’s with Axel and a gang of armed thugs.

                                 HENRY
                        Shankrow. You fucking dick! You 
                        sent these guys to kill me?

                                 SHANKROW
                        Yeah. Pretty rough, huh? I like to 
                        think of it as protecting my 
                        investment...in myself.

                                 AXEL
                        Get on your fucking knees!

           The thugs push Henry and Joe onto their knees. Axel gestures 
           to them with his gun.

                                 AXEL
                        Hands behind your head.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Hope you understand. I couldn’t 
                        have you talking, Henry.

                                 JOE
                        He wasn’t going to talk! We’re 
                        literally at an airport, trying to 
                        escape!

                                 HENRY
                        It’s true! I’m practically doing 
                        this for you! This is so I’m not 
                        put in a position to jeopardize 
                        your freedom! 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Oh, and I’m supposed to trust a 
                        degenerate drug addict? Or some 
                        fucking guy named Joe? I can’t take 
                        that chance. Sorry, boys. 

                                 HENRY
                        Oh, so instead you’re going to kill 
                        us in cold blood?
                                 SHANKROW
                        Exactly.

           Axel cocks his gun and points it at the back of Henry’s head.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Hold on. 

                                 AXEL
                        What?

                                 SHANKROW
                        I want to do it myself.

                                 AXEL
                        Do I still get paid? 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Yeah! Of course!

                                 AXEL
                        Fine.

           Axel hands Shankrow his gun. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Wow. This gun is so heavy. 

           Shankrow points the gun in Henry’s face. Henry squirms and 
           flinches away from the gun. A long beat passes by wherein 
           Henry keeps squirming, anticipating the end. 

                                 AXEL
                        What are you doing? Fucking shoot 
                        him. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Chill out, Axel. I’m just getting 
                        in the zone. We’re not all seasoned 
                        killers like yourself.

           Henry looks at Joe with sad eyes.

                                 HENRY
                        Joe, I...I’m sorry you’re about to 
                        lose your life. 

                                 JOE
                        It’s okay, Henry. It’s not much of 
                        a life to lose. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well I’m sorry about that, too.
           Shankrow steadies his resolve and focuses his aim on Henry.

                                 SHANKROW
                        You know, Axel, it’s 
                        almost...sexual. I get it, I see 
                        why you do this for a living. 

                                 AXEL
                        Will you just-

                                 SHANKROW
                        Okay! Okay! 

           Shankrow starts to slowly pull back on the trigger. 

                                 HENRY
                        See you on the flip side, hombr- 

           BLAM!!! Blood sprays onto Joe’s face. 

                                 JOE
                        Henry!!!

           Joe looks over and sees that Henry is unharmed, but Thug #2 
           been shot in the neck.

                                 AXEL
                        Where the fuck did that come from? 

           ANGLE ON: Jeffries

           A cut up and bruised Jeffries emerges from the distance 
           holding a smoking gun, her hair matted from blood.

           ANGLE ON: Shankrow, Axel and the Thugs

                                 SHANKROW
                        You said she was dead!

                                 AXEL
                        She was!!

           Axel and the Thugs unload on Jeffries, who deftly dives 
           behind a stack of CRATES.

           From the opposite direction, bullets start whizzing by 
           Shankrow, Axel, and the thugs.

                                 SHANKROW
                        What the fuck?!

           ANGLE ON: Gardini 
           Gardini slowly limps out of the woods, his left arm clearly 
           broken, firing wildly and missing.

           ANGLE ON: Shankrow, Axel and the Thugs

           They turn their attention to Gardini and open fire. A bullet 
           hits Gardini in the leg. He drags himself behind an SUV.

           ANGLE ON: Henry and Joe

           Henry and Joe make a break for it. Shankrow and Axel fire at 
           them. Henry and Joe run into HANGER 1.

                                 AXEL
                           (to Thugs)
                        Deal with the cops first!

           Thugs #3 and #4 run off. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Alright! I’ll take the Governor! 

                                 AXEL
                        No! Just stay put-

           Too late. Shankrow runs towards the Hanger, wildly shooting 
           his gun in Henry and Joe’s direction. Axel chases after. 

           INT. HANGER 1 - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry and Joe split off. Henry hides behind a stack of crates 
           while Joe hides behind a small plane.

                                 HENRY
                           (whispering)
                        Joe! What are you doing over 
                        there?! Come over here!

                                 JOE
                           (whispering)
                        No! Shut up! You come here!

           Henry shakes his head defiantly. Just then, Axel enters the 
           hanger, cautiously, his gun drawn. Henry and Joe look to each 
           other, scared shitless. Axel raises his gun to the ceiling 
           and shoots. 

           BANG!! Startled, Joe jumps out from his hiding place. 

                                 JOE
                        AHHH!!!
           Joe desperately scrambles as Axel takes aim and unloads his 
           clip, almost hitting Joe numerous times. 

                                 AXEL
                        Oh no. You’re not getting away.

           Out of bullets, Axel TACKLES Joe to the ground. Henry watches 
           as Joe gets pummelled by Axel.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh fuck. Joe.

           Henry feels a tap on the shoulder and turns to see Shankrow 
           pointing a gun at him. CLICK. Out of bullets. Henry smiles, 
           but Shankrow quickly punches him in the face.

           EXT. HANGER - CONTINUOUS

           Gardini is in bad shape, leaning up against an SUV.

                                 THUG #3 (O.S.)
                        I think the fat one’s hiding behind 
                        the SUV!

                                 GARDINI
                        Oh shit.

           Jeffries peeks out from a crate, and sees the two Thugs 
           converging on the SUV. 

           Thug #3 is about to shoot Gardini, when Jeffries suddenly 
           rushes the SUV, leaps forward, and shoots Thug #3 dead.

                                 GARDINI
                        Jeffries. I- I-

           Thug #4 appears behind Gardini. Jeffries spins around and 
           deftly shoots him in the head. Jeffries rips off the sleeve 
           of her shirt and ties it around Gardini’s upper thigh.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Stay here. 

           Jeffries reloads and runs towards Hanger 1.

           INT. HANGER 1 - CONTINUOUS

           Shankrow has Henry pinned on the ground, and he’s choking him 
           with his tie. 
                                 SHANKROW
                        Oh yes! This is fucking great! I 
                        feel so fucking powerful! I’m 
                        taking your life, Henry. I’m taking 
                        it!!!

           As Henry struggles, he spots across the hanger...

           ANGLE ON: JOE

           Joe is getting the shit beat out of him by Axel.

                                 JOE
                        Please man! You don’t need to do 
                        this. You don’t even know me!

                                 AXEL
                        And I don’t want to. I just want 
                        you to finally fucking die.

           Axel punches Joe in the chin, knocking him unconscious. 

           ANGLE ON: HENRY AND SHANKROW

           Seeing Joe hurt, a rage builds in Henry. He grabs hold of 
           Shankrow’s foot and bites him hard on the leg.

                                 SHANKROW
                        ARGH!!!

           Henry punches Shankrow, causing him to fall back. Henry 
           starts to unwrap the tie, when-

                                 JEFFRIES (O.S.)
                        Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!

           Henry and Shankrow look up to see Jeffries, gun drawn. They 
           put up their hands.

                                 HENRY
                           (motioning to Shankrow)
                        He’s trying to kill me! Arrest him!

                                 SHANKROW
                           (motioning to Henry)
                        Fuck that, arrest him! He’s your 
                        fugitive! He’s made you look like a 
                        complete fucking idiot!

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Shut up. You’re both under arrest.
           Jeffries takes out her HANDCUFFS and-

           BAM!!! Axel violently KICKS Jeffries into the wall. Jeffries 
           GUN slides across the floor. Axel grabs Jeffries by the hair 
           and drags her over to the door.

                                 AXEL
                        I’ve had about enough out of you. 

           Henry and Shankrow watch, stunned. Shankrow stays focused on 
           the Axel/Jeffries fight, so Henry takes the opportunity to 
           PUNCH Shankrow in the back of the head. They start fighting 
           again. 

           Meanwhile, Axel CUFFS Jeffries to a railing, and beats her 
           down to the ground. He puts his gun to her head.

                                 AXEL
                        This time you better stay dead.

           BANG!!! Axel collapses to the ground.

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        EW!!!

           Jeffries looks up to see JOE holding her gun.

                                 JOE
                        Okay...I saved your life now, 
                        right? So will you just please 
                        leave us alone now?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I can’t do that.

           Joe’s hand shakes as he points the gun at her. He can’t shoot 
           her. After a moment, he runs away from her towards Shankrow 
           and Henry.

           ANGLE ON: Henry and Shankrow

           Henry and Shankrow wrestle. Henry kicks him in the back and 
           Shankrow’s head hits the wing of a small plane. He’s 
           momentarily dazed, then looks up at Henry with rage. Henry 
           runs. Shankrow gets up and CHARGES at Henry with great 
           strength and speed. The second before he makes contact, Joe 
           steps forward and TRIPS Shankrow, causing him to face-plant 
           into the ground. Henry starts to shit kick Shankrow. 

                                 HENRY
                        What now, motherfucker? You don’t 
                        mess with the Governator!!!

           Joe grabs Henry.
                                 JOE
                        Come on! Let’s go!

           Henry and Joe run past Jeffries, out of the hanger.

                                 HENRY
                        Good-bye Jeffries! We’ll send you a 
                        post card!

           Enraged, Jeffries struggles to get out of the cuffs.

           EXT. HANGER 1 - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Joe run past Gardini towards Hanger 4B. Gardini is 
           bleeding out, barely alert. 

           INT. HANGER 4B - MOMENTS LATER

           Henry opens the doors to the plane and they climb inside.

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry runs into the cockpit and starts flipping switches and 
           turning dials.

                                 HENRY
                        C’mon. C’mon.

           The engine starts up.

                                 HENRY
                        Yes! Joe! Pull up the stairs!

           Joe goes to pull up the stairs as Henry pulls the plane out 
           of the Hanger. 

                                 JOE
                        I can’t! They’re heavy as shit!

                                 HENRY
                        Just do it!

           Joe is too beat up and weak to pull up the stairs.

           I/E. HANGER 1 - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries watches Shankrow get up and step outside the hanger, 
           murder in his eyes. Shankrow breaks into a sprint, hauling 
           ass towards the plane as it slowly pulls out of the hanger.
                                 JEFFRIES
                        Gardini! They’re getting away.

           Gardini comes to and sees Jeffries cuffed to the railing of 
           the hanger. He then looks over and sees Shankrow catching up 
           to the slow moving plane.

                                 SHANKROW
                        SHANKROW!!!

           Shankrow leaps onto the stairs of the plane. Joe tries to 
           fight him off, and they wrestle on the steps.

           Gardini takes out his gun with his weak bloody hand. He 
           trembles as he aims it at Shankrow.

           BANG!! Gardini fires but MISSES, shooting Joe in the back! 
           Joe falls back into the main cabin.

                                 GARDINI
                        Fuck.

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Henry looks back and sees Joe in the main cabin, motionless 
           and bleeding.

                                 HENRY
                        Joe! Oh Jesus Christ, Joe!

           Shankrow enters the main cabin.

                                 HENRY
                        You killed my fucking friend!

                                 SHANKROW
                        I actually didn’t...it was the fat 
                        cop...but I am glad he’s dead.

           Henry releases the steering wheel and runs after Shankrow. 
           Shankrow grabs a mini fire extinguisher and swings it wildly 
           at Henry. The plane wildly swerves along the runway.

           I/E. HANGER 1 - CONTINUOUS

           Gardini watches the plane veering off the runway.

                                 GARDINI
                        Jeffries! They’re getting away!

           Gardini sees Jeffries violently pulling on the handcuffs.
                                 JEFFRIES
                        NO! NO! NO!

           Jeffries looks defeated. She looks at Gardini.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Give me your gun.

           Gardini slides it across to her.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Fuck Houdini.

           Jeffries SMASHES the gun against her thumb, breaking it. She 
           then slides out of the cuffs and hustles after the plane, 
           which is almost finished taxying to the runway. Jeffries 
           double times it, sprinting like a mad woman. Gardini stares 
           in awe, truly impressed.

                                 GARDINI
                        Wow.

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Jeffries jumps into the plane. She doesn’t hesitate for a 
           moment and goes right after Shankrow.

                                 SHANKROW
                        Ah man!

           Henry crawls into the cockpit and slams the door behind him.

           INT. PLANE - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry guns the throttle and the plane speeds its way down the 
           runway. Tears well up in his eyes.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m sorry, Joe.

           INT. PLANE - CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           The take off is extremely rocky, causing Shankrow and 
           Jeffries to once again lose their footing. The jolt into the 
           air temporarily wakes up Joe. He’s in very rough shape, but 
           alive. Jeffries takes notice.

                                 SHANKROW
                        You just won’t fucking quit, will 
                        you?
           They try to fight, but between the horrible turbulence and 
           the chaotic air pressure, it’s near impossible. 

           Shankrow lands a hard PUNCH, knocking Jeffries back towards 
           the open door. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Hope you can fly. Because if I know 
                        one thing, it’s that pigs can’t-

           With her one good hand, Jeffries grabs Shankrow by the 
           collar; with her other hand, she fights through the pain of 
           her broken thumb, forms a fist, and PUNCHES Shankrow in the 
           face, dazing him. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Can you? 

                                 SHANKROW
                        Can I what? 

           She then rolls backwards and uses the momentum to flip him 
           over her head and out the plane door. 

                                 SHANKROW
                        AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

           And thusly, Shankrow perishes.

           Jeffries heads towards Joe and buckles him into his seat. She 
           then makes her way to the cockpit, wind furiously bristling 
           in her face. She kicks in the door.

           INT. PLANE - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry, crying, turns to see Jeffries. She is covered in 
           blood, clothes are tattered, hand broken. Looking as bad-ass 
           as one can without being dead.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Land the plane, Cashin. It’s over. 

           Henry wipes away his tears in total disbelief.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Door’s open. You go up any further 
                        we’re all gonna die.

           Henry looks at some instruments on the dashboard. Cabin 
           pressure definitely isn’t right.
                                 HENRY
                        So what? Joe’s dead. Everyone hates 
                        me. I deserve to die. 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Joe is still alive! But if you 
                        don’t land this plane now, he will 
                        die.

           Jeffries points to Joe, sitting, buckled to his seat, in the 
           windy cabin. Joe waves meekly.

                                 HENRY
                        JOE!!!

           Henry’s tears are now tears of joy. He switches on auto-pilot 
           and limps back to Joe, clutching on to anything he can to 
           make sure he doesn’t get sucked out of the plane.

                                 HENRY
                        Joe, buddy, you’re looking great. 
                        Real healthy.

                                 JOE
                           (faint whisper)
                        Henry...

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, buddy?

                                 JOE
                           (faint whisper)
                        ...my back...

                                 HENRY
                        Look Joe, I’m gonna get us into a 
                        safe country where we’ll get the 
                        best medical attention fugitives 
                        can buy. If you agree with this 
                        plan, give me some sort of sign.

           Henry stares at him for an extended beat. He sees the pool of 
           blood at Joe’s feet. He’s hanging on by a thread.

                                 HENRY
                        Alright new plan. We’ll get you 
                        home.

           Joe moans again, but it’s unclear whether he’s agreeing with 
           the plan or just painfully dying.

                                 HENRY
                        Stay with me Joe!
           Henry pats him on the shoulder and limps back to the cockpit.

           INT. PLANE - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Henry takes the wheel again.

                                 HENRY
                        Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m 
                        gonna land the plane. Then you’re 
                        gonna take me in and get Joe to a 
                        hospital.

           Jeffries nods.

                                 HENRY
                        Then Joe goes free.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Can’t do that. He’ll be arraigned 
                        after he recovers.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s bullshit! I’m the one you’re 
                        after. Not him! 

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I’m sorry, but he’s suspected in 
                        several crimes including attempted 
                        murder.

                                 HENRY
                        I shot Jay. That was me. Not Joe! 
                        Think about it. We were at my drug 
                        dealers, and at my lawyers. He was 
                        my hostage. I used him for his car.

           Jeffries looks back at Joe, putting the pieces together.

                                 HENRY
                        He’s a good man. And he deserves 
                        better than this.

                                 JEFFRIES
                           (thinking about it)
                        I’m sorry, I just don’t have the 
                        power to - 

                                 HENRY
                        I know how the system works! I’m 
                        the fucking Governor! You only need 
                        me. If I take the rap for Jay, and 
                        everything else that happened 
                        today, that’s all you need. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (cont'd)
                        We both know that. He just saved 
                        your life, Jeffries.

           Beat. Jeffries looks back at Joe. She thinks for a moment.

                                 HENRY
                        Plus, I’ll give you names. Dirty 
                        politicians, bankers, CEOs. That’s 
                        gotta be more important to you than 
                        Joe.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Fine. Joe goes free, I promise.

           Jeffries and Henry shake hands.

           INT. HANGER  - LATER

           Agents and medical teams surround the landing strip as the 
           plane lands. An inflatable slide pops out from the cabin door 
           frame. Henry, in cuffs, slides down and is immediately 
           swarmed by two Agents. A bloody and beaten Jeffries gently 
           slides down with Joe.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Joe Hayworth is to be rushed to the 
                        hospital for immediate medical 
                        assistance. It’s clear he was an 
                        unwilling hostage in the situation. 
                           (to the Agent)
                        The Governor is under arrest 
                        for...a lot of stuff. Take him 
                        away. 
                           (beat)
                        I need a five minute break.

           Jeffries, on the verge of passing out, sits down on the 
           ground cross-legged. Gardini is wheeled past her, already on 
           a gurney and being attended to.

                                 GARDINI
                        Jeffries, you okay?

                                 JEFFRIES
                        I’ll be fine. I just need three 
                        pints of blood and a new fucking 
                        pant suit.

                                 GARDINI
                        For a desk jockey, you are one bad-
                        ass motherfucking killer. Stone 
                        cold. 
           Jeffries smiles, motioning to his bullet wound.

                                 JEFFRIES
                        Looks like you finally took some 
                        enemy fire. Who knows what kind of 
                        medal they’re gonna get for you 
                        now. We are...

                                 GARDINI
                           (so proud)
                        Marshals.

           Gardini is wheeled off, smiling ear to ear.

           ANGLE ON: Henry

           As the Agents escort Henry away, they pass Joe on a 
           stretcher.

                                 JOE
                           (barely able to speak)
                        Freedom...you gave your...freedom 
                        for me.

                                 HENRY
                        Some guys run and some guys stay 
                        and face the music.

           Henry squeezes Joe’s hand.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t make the same mistake I did. 
                        Go home, face the music, and get 
                        your girl back.
                           (beat)
                        Put on some R & B, dim the lights--

           The Agent grabs Henry.

                                 AGENT
                        We gotta go.

           TITLE UP: 6 MONTHS LATER

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

           Winter’s in the air. Christmas decorations line the 
           buildings.
           INT. JOE AND JESSICA’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Joe sits in a lazy boy chair, reading an email off an iPad. 
           His wounds are starting to fade, but he still has a cane, and 
           he’s using it to direct Ronald as he moves a Christmas tree 
           around the living room. 

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        Dear Joe. How’s my favorite hero 
                        teacher? You fuck Trudy yet? Just 
                        kidding. I know you’re a one woman 
                        kind of guy...pussy. 

           Jessica walks into the room and kisses him on the head. We 
           notice a giant ENGAGEMENT ring on her finger. 

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        Speaking of which, a formal 
                        congrats on getting engaged. Mazel 
                        Tov! I hope you like your gift. 
                        Sorry you have to travel all the 
                        way to the Maldives to pick it up, 
                        but you know how prying the 
                        Government can be.

           Ron scowls as Jessica gestures for him to move the tree 
           slightly to the left.

           EXT. PRISON - YARD - DAY

           Nestled up near the rear fence is a lovely manicured putting 
           green. Henry, along with some WALL STREET looking men lounge 
           on the course, smoking ARTURO FUENTES. Henry lines up a long 
           putt and sinks it. 

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        Life in jail isn’t so bad. I 
                        haven’t had to make a shiv or lift 
                        weights or anything. And I get to 
                        hang out with stockbrokers, hedge 
                        fund analysts, and bankers. They’re 
                        pieces of shit, but they’re kind of 
                        like me in a way, and I like that. 
                        I’m sober now, which isn’t 
                        terrible, but I still miss the 
                        hookers. More for the 
                        companionship, though.  
           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - MORNING

           A RANGE ROVER pulls up to the curb. Joe and Jessica get out. 
           Ron, biting his tongue, pops the trunk, hops out and starts 
           lugging two large SUITCASES to the curb.

                                 HENRY (V.O.)
                        I’m so proud of you for making the 
                        choices you made, Joe. It’s your 
                        life. Not anyone else’s. Always 
                        remember that. I’ll leave you with 
                        a piece of advice that I’ve really 
                        taken to heart, here in jail...it’s 
                        not gay if he’s sucking your dick. 

           Joe plants a big, messy kiss on Jessica. Mid kiss, he makes 
           eye contact with Ron who couldn't look more furious, but then 
           he forces a smile as Jessica turns to hug him goodbye. Ron 
           watches them disappear into the airport and slams the trunk 
           as hard as he can.

                                                          THE END.

           OVER END CREDITS:

           EXT. BEACH - MALDIVES - DAY

           On an exotic private beach, in front of a large HOUSE, Joe 
           and Jessica relax, sipping cocktails out of PINEAPPLES.

           We pull out to reveal their legs propped up on DUFFLE BAGS.

                                 JESSICA
                        So there’s six more of these in the 
                        basement?

                                 JOE
                        Not bad for a government stipend.

           They toast their pineapples and sit back in complete 
           relaxation, staring out into the ocean.

           They notice a small fishing boat out in the horizon. They 
           watch as it draws nearer and nearer, until it finally lands 
           on the beach. They look at each other totally confused. A 
           little worried.

           Suddenly, a figure jumps onto the beach. He looks slightly 
           crazed, almost manic, wearing an orange jumpsuit. Joe strains 
           his eyes to see that it’s Henry. He looks the same, only he 
           has a TEAR DROP TATTOO under his left eye.
                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck? Henry?!

           Henry runs up, out of breath.
