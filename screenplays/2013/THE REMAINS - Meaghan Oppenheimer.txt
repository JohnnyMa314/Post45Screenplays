                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Fourth grade science class. Our 
                        teacher tells us we're starting 
                        dissections later that week.

           YOUNG MARY SHINE, 10, soulful eyes, raises her hand sharply.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Mary was the first to object.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        Isn’t it unfair? ‘Cause we didn’t 
                        ask him for permission?

                                 TEACHER
                        Ask who for permission? For what?

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        The mouse. To look at his insides.

           Mary sits miserably with her ultra conservative parents.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Mary’s parents were these right 
                        wing bible lovers. Her dad worked 
                        as a political commentator and 
                        thought everyone was secretly a 
                        communist.

           Mary's Dad gives a knowing nod and thumbs up to his wife, 
           signifying his certainty of Dole's victory.

           INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - 1997

           She’s surrounded by black Barbies and dolls.
                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        They put Mary in therapy when she 
                        was six, because she said she was 
                        going vegan and would only play 
                        with the black Barbies.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        The dissection was her first 
                        protest.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        Everyone deserves to die with 
                        dignity!

           Nobody pays any attention, Mary is extremely frustrated.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        But eventually she realized she was 
                        gonna need some help.

           YOUNG LUKE, 10, a golden boy, juggles balls with a proud, 
           shit eating grin while his parents and maid applaud. Mary 
           goes unnoticed, dancing aggressively in the background.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Luke was her fraternal twin, and by
                        all accounts everyone's favorite.

           Mary falls violently into the pool, thrashes helplessly while 
           Luke continues to juggle for the adults.

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - 1997

           Luke plays basketball. He scores and a group of girls stand

           INT. CAFETERIA - 1997

           Luke and Mary sit, she hands him $20 and a candy bar.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        He was also really easy to bribe.
           EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - 1997

           Mary and Luke hold protest signs. YOUNG NORA BEAU, bookish 
           and 10, listens raptly, focused on Luke, full of puppy love.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        That’s when Nora got involved.

           INT. NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS MEETING. - OCTOBER, 2011

           JADE, 25, a beautiful wreck, unleashes her angry story on the 
           rest of the N.A attendees; they watch the outburst awkwardly.

                                 JADE
                        Nora fucking Beau. My best friend 
                        at the time. Best friend for a long 
                        time - turned out to be the 
                        shadiest asshole of all of us.

                        What did she do?

                                 JADE
                        Oh - we’ll get to that.

           Young Nora, her mom and her dad, DAVID, each read a 
           newspaper.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Nora's parents were struggling 
                        writers who worked like ten jobs to 
                        keep her in private school. They 
                        always taught her education was God 
                        and God was a myth.

           INT. FUNERAL - 1996

           A coffin sits in front of Young Nora and her dad in the front 
           row.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        When she was nine her mom ate some
                        under cooked meatloaf and died of 
                        salmonella poisoning.

           INT. FUNERAL RECEPTION - 1996.

           An older woman speaks kindly to a stoic Nora.
                                 WOMAN
                        You know your mother will always be
                        with you. She's not really gone. 

                                 YOUNG NORA
                        Do you think I'm a fucking moron?

           INT. CLASSROOM - 1997.

           Teacher speaks, Nora listens attentively in the front row.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Nora made the best grades, won all
                        the awards... everyone assumed 
                        she'd be the first female 
                        president... cure cancer, or, you 
                        know, whatever. Succeed at anything 
                        she ever attempted.

           In response to the Teacher's question, Nora's hand shoots up 
           in the air. Jade's voice dubs over Nora's moving mouth.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        I'm Nora Beau, and I'm so fuckin’
                        smart.

           YOUNG JADE, 10, beautiful and stylish, draws in her 
           sketchbook, Nora studies Mary's anti-dissection poster.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Anyway, after Nora joined the 
                        protest she convinced me to join 
                        also.

                                 YOUNG NORA
                        I think we should help them, Jade.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        Now, I’m not saying I didn't care
                        ahout animal rights or humanitarian 
                        issues, or whatever, but I had 
                        other shit going on.
                                 YOUNG JADE
                        I’m never getting expression lines, 
                        Mom.

           INT. NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS MEETING. - OCTOBER, 2011

           Jade speaks proudly of herself.

                                 JADE
                        I was also a blossoming artist.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Young Jade, in a Madonna costume, holds a statue of Jesus as 
           a microphone and paints a huge, purple penis on her wall as 
           “Dance Magic Dance” blares in the background.

           EXT. RYE JUNGLE GYM. - 1997.

           Nora drags Jade to where Mary and Luke sit plotting.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        But Nora was my best friend, and 
                        she convinced me the mouse thing 
                        was important.

           Mary gestures to crayon drawn diagrams covering the ground.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        Here's what we do.

           INT. CLASSROOM - 1997 - DAY OF DISSECTION.

           Mary, Nora, Jade, and Luke sit at different tables. Teacher 
           places mice before them. Suddenly Mary throws firecrackers.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        Team Mickey, go!

           All four of the “team” grab the dead mice from their tables 
           and rush towards the door.

                                 YOUNG MARY (CONT'D)
                        Freedom!!!

           Jade holds the mouse far from herself, disgusted, looks ill.
                                 YOUNG JADE
                        Ew Mary, it’s so dead!

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        FINISH THE MISSION!

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - 1997

           The group runs in slow motion, heroic - except for Jade, who 
           looks sick. A male teacher stands in their way.

                                 MALE TEACHER
                        Hey, no running in the hallway!

           Their teacher runs out of classroom behind them.

                                 TEACHER
                        Stop them!

           He grabs Jade, she vomits on him. The rest of the group stop 
           and stare. Jade holds out the dead mouse in defeat.

           INT. DETENTION - 1997.

           The four children sit in detention.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        I don't know if it was the bond of
                        failing together, but after that 
                        first detention we were 
                        inseparable.

           MONTAGE OF THE KIDS BONDING

           The group sits on school steps, laughing, a nun shushes them.

           In Nora’s living room, the kids sit with all their feet 
           stretched out, peace signs painted on their drying toenails. 
           Mary paints peace signs on her own toenails last.

           Luke teaches girls to play basketball, Mary tackles Nora 
           violently.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. CLASSROOM - 1997

           Mary holds back tears as a mouse is dissected.
                                 JADE (V.O.)
                             (bitterly)
                        We still had to dissect the mice, 
                        though.

           Jade squeezes Mary's hand.

           EXT. RYE JUNGLE GYM. - 1997

           Mary sobs - unnaturally upset - as the rest of the group 
           watches, awkward and confused.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        I guess we should have figured it
                        out then, that Mary was kind of 
                        different... that something in her 
                        was sadder than it should've been. 
                        But we were kids, so we didn't.

           INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - 1997

           Mary lays crying on bed, her mother consoling her.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        It’s so unfair.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        But honey, they were already gone.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        But if I died, I wouldn’t want 
                        people to dissect me.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Things don't always seem fair, but
                        in the end, whatever happens, 
                        happens for a reason.

                                 YOUNG MARY
                        You promise?

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        I promise. Everything works out 
                        like it’s supposed to.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        It was a terrible lie to tell a 
                        child.

           Music begins as we are close on Mary's sad little face. 
           Blackout to Title. Credits begin against black, then-
           EXT. RYE CEMETARY. - SEPTEMBER, 2011 - DAY

           Two weeks prior to Jade’s Narcotics Anonymous Meeting.

           Sweeping shots of tombstones. As the music builds the frame 
           widens revealing the cemetery's place within Rye, New York. A 
           police car blares by, we follow it to a scene of commotion at-

           EXT. SURBURBAN MANSION. - CONTINUOUS

           Police car pulls up to where an ambulance, firetruck and 
           crowd have gathered. As we pan up the house, we see bare feet 
           hanging off the roof with peace signs painted on them. 

           Reveal MARY, now 25, holding a joint and bottle of wine, 
           sitting on the roof. A REPORTER speaks to a camera crew.

                                 REPORTER
                        We're live from 23rd street in Rye, 
                        New York, where 25-year-old 
                        protester Mary Shine has positioned 
                        herself on the roof of a house 
                        which is set to be torn down today 
                        to make room for a new hotel.

           A policeman speaks into a megaphone.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        This is not the way to make
                        yourself heard.

                                 MARY
                        I grew up under this roof! It’s 
                        over a hundred years old!

           RICK, 35, has appeared.

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Your parole officer is here.

                                 MARY
                        Oh, awesome.

                                 RICK
                        Mary, come down. This is just like 
                        the time you protested ATT. You sat 
                        up in that cell tower for a week, 
                        and what happened then, Mary?

           Mary smokes her joint.
                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        ATT is still providing service to
                        millions, and you went to jail.

           Inside the room someone tries to break down the locked door.

                                 MARY
                        You sent someone up here? You think 
                        they can force me in? Against my 
                        will?!

                                 RICK
                        Put the marijuana down and come
                        back inside.

           More banging, Mary accidentally drops bottle, it shatters.

                                 MARY
                        If they break down my door I'll
                        jump!

                                 RICK
                        How many times have we done this? 
                        No you won’t.

           Mary smokes the joint thoughtfully. Beat.

                                 MARY
                        What'd you say? I won't?

                                 RICK
                        Mary. 

           She takes another puff and stands. She smiles.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Mary, people love you.

                                 MARY
                        Then they’ll keep loving me.

           INT. NORA'S BEDROOM. - NEXT MORNING

           Nora’s childhood bedroom. Childhood photos, high school 
           academic awards and Honor Roll plaques line the walls.

           NORA, now 25, sleeps. Suddenly CHARLIE, 6, jumps on the bed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom, wake up!

           Nora wakes groggily.
                                 NORA
                        Why?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m hungry.

                                 NORA
                        Five more minutes.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m hungry now!

           Nora pulls him to her, tickles him into submission.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        David says you should be up by now!

           Nora puts a pillow over his face.

                                 NORA
                        Don’t call him David. Call him 
                        Grandpa.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (muffled under pillow)
                        He said he's too young to be called
                        Grandpa and that it's not his fault 
                        you made bad decisions senior year.

           Nora removes the pillow, gives him a look. He smiles naively.

           INT. NORA'S KITCHEN. - MOMENTS LATER

           Her childhood home, very modest and low income. 

           Nora multi tasks. Makes breakfast, drinks coffee and buttons 
           her shirt, frazzled. Charlie goes for a cookie.

                                 NORA
                        Charlie, no cookies for breakfast.

           Charlie gives Nora a very serious death stare while slowly 
           replacing the cookie. David enters, annoyed.

                                 DAVID
                        So Nora, you use the last of the 
                        toilet paper?

                                 NORA
                        Oh - sorry, I -
                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t want scrambled eggs, Mom, I 
                        wanted them fried!

                                 NORA
                        But you love scrambled eggs!

                                 DAVID
                        Tell me Nora, do you think the 
                        paper magically appears in the 
                        bathroom? Do you think little elves 
                        come in and put it there?

                                 NORA
                        Charlie, sit and eat your eggs.

                                 DAVID
                        Nora? Are you going to answer my 
                        question?

                                 NORA
                        What question?

                                 DAVID
                        The one I just asked. 

                                 NORA
                        You asked if I think elves come in 
                        and replace the toilet paper. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah.

                                 NORA
                        No Dad, I- I know that’s not what 
                        happens.

           Beat. David sits with his coffee and paper. Nora turns to 
           Charlie, he chews a stack of cookies with a smug grin.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        (whispering to Charlie)
                        You’re dead.

           Nora struggles with Charlie for the cookies, David's unaware.

                                 DAVID
                        You going into the city today?

           Nora squeezes the contents of Charlie's mouth onto the floor.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You must be learning a lot, working 
                        with an author like Albert.
                                 NORA
                        I’m just his assistant. It’s not 
                        like we sit around giving each 
                        other writing tips.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to David)
                        A blowjob is when a boy puts his 
                        weiner in a girl’s mouth.

           Beat. David looks at Nora.

                                 NORA
                        He’s been curious about sex lately.

                                 CHARLIE
                        (ominously)
                        I know what it is.

                                 DAVID
                        Not doing your hair today, Nora?

                                 NORA
                        I did do my hair. A messy bun is a 
                        legitimate hairstyle now, Dad.

           Charlie farts on Nora intentionally. David mumbles while 
           reading the paper.

                                 DAVID
                        What the hell's wrong with your
                        generation... some suicidal idiot 
                        jumping off a house in protest of 
                        it being torn down.

                                 NORA
                        I doubt that’ll stop them from 
                        tearing it down.

                                 DAVID
                        (looks up in shock)
                        Mary Shine.

                                 NORA
                        What?
                             (grabbing paper)
                        Oh my god.

                                 CHARLIE
                         Who is it?
                                 DAVID 
                             (to Nora)
                        When's the last time you talked to 
                        her? Or any of those kids?

           Nora reads the paper in horror, slowly sits down.

           INT. GEORGE AVERY’S BATHROOM - NYC. - SAME DAY.

           Jade, hungover, vomits in the toilet. A knock is heard.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Jade, you've been in there all 
                        morning. I’m getting concerned.

           Jade moans unintelligibly, climbs into the bathtub. 

           INT. OUTSIDE BATHROOM.

           Jade’s dad GEORGE, 55 and gay, knocks on the door. His lover 
           MARK, in partial drag, watches, annoyed.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Okay Jade, I’m coming in. 

           INT. GEORGE AVERY’S BATHROOM.

           George enters, closing the door behind him. Jade acts 
           nonchalant, forcing herself to sit up in the tub.

                                 JADE
                        What’s up Dad?

           A bottle of shampoo falls on Jade's head. Beat.

                                 GEORGE
                        Mark's trying to work. The sound of
                        your vomiting is very distracting.

                                 JADE
                        Okay, I’m almost done.

           She vomits into the toilet again.

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you using again?

                                 JADE
                        No, this is just a hangover.

           Mark speaks from other side of door.
                                 MARK (O.C.) 
                        Tell her what we decided!

                                 GEORGE 
                        We have to be sure.

           George apologetically holds out a plastic cup.

                                 JADE
                        I'm not peeing in that. Mark can go
                        fuck himself.

                                 MARK (O.C.)
                         I can hear you!

                                 JADE
                        Good! You’re a pervert!

                                 GEORGE
                        This isn’t working. You being here.

                                 JADE_
                        But I'm your daughter. And I'm
                        nice.

                                 MARK (O.S.) 
                        YOU'RE A HOT FUCKING MESS!

                                 JADE_
                        YOU'RE WEARING MY BRA!
                             (to George)
                        Where am I supposed to go, Dad?

                                 GEORGE
                        To your mom’s?

                                 JADE
                        In Rye? I can’t leave Manhattan.

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        It's not our problem! Didn't you
                        used to have friends at one point?!

           INT. LUKE'S HOUSE IN LOS ANGELES. - SAME DAY

           On the TV an interview plays, LUKE, 25, is the interviewee.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Some have called your book the
                        bible for emotional unavailability.
                                 LUKE (ONSCREEN)
                        I think those are mostly people who
                        watch too many Lifetime movies.

           As the show continues we see half packed suitcases strewn 
           across the floor of Luke's gorgeous home.

                                 LUKE (ONSCREEN) (CONT'D) 
                        In all seriousness. I don't preach
                        emotional unavailability. I just 
                        think emotional capital is valuable 
                        - where you spend your emotion - 
                        too many people throw it around 
                        without thinking. That doesn't get 
                        you anywhere. And my book is about 
                        going places. Moving forward. Too 
                        many people look to the past for 
                        answers.

           The TV is suddenly muted and we see Luke in the flesh, 
           holding the remote and smoking a cigarette. The doorbell of 
           Luke's home rings.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s open.

           HEATHER, 21, a beautiful but vapid model, enters.

                                 HEATHER
                        Hey baby... I left as soon as I got
                        your message.
                             (seeing suitcases)
                        Are you going somewhere?

                                 LUKE
                        New York. The funeral’s this week.

                                 HEATHER
                        Aw Lukie. Do you want me to come?

                                 LUKE
                        It's family only. And I have to 
                        deal with some business there.

                                 HEATHER
                        What kind of business?

                                 LUKE
                        There's an apartment in Manhattan
                        my grandmother left my sister and 
                        me when we were sixteen. It's been 
                        empty for years. I'm gonna go ahead 
                        and sell it.
                                 HEATHER
                        What can I do to help?

           Luke pulls her to him, kissing her. She gets it, kissing him 
           back, letting him undress her.

           Later, Luke lays alone in bed, epitome of emptiness. He flips 
           through old photos of him and Mary. Stops at one of Mary, 
           Nora and Jade. He grabs his phone, hesitates, then dials.

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION. - SAME DAY

           Jade gets on train to Rye, New York. She sits next to WOMAN.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m sorry, aren’t you that model? 
                        Who was on all the billboards?

                                 JADE
                        No.

           She puts earphones in. Her cell rings, caller ID says “Luke 
           Shine.” She's surprised, rolls her eyes and presses Ignore.

           EXT. CANDY'S HOUSE IN RYE. - AN HOUR LATER

           Jade gets dropped off by taxi, rings doorbell. Candy answers.

                                 CANDY
                        Oh shit.

                                 JADE
                             (walking past her)
                        Pretend you've missed me, Mom. By 
                        the way, I think it's extremely 
                        tacky that you changed the locks.

           INT. JADE'S BEDROOM. - SAME DAY

           Gym equipment surrounds her childhood things. Jade stares 
           glumly at a collage of her old modeling photos. The phone 
           rings again, it's Luke. She finally answers.

                                 JADE
                        Normally I don't answer calls from
                        bastard ex boyfriends, but since 
                        you called twice and are obviously 
                        desperate to hear my voice.

                                 LUKE (V.O.)
                        How are you?
                                 JADE
                        Um, not too well, Luke. I'm on the
                        phone with you, for one thing, so 
                        that sucks. How's L.A? How's my 
                        dog? You know he hates you, right?

                                 LUKE (V.O.)
                        Mary died.

           Beat, Jade sits up, horrified.

                                 JADE
                        Wait. Is this a joke to make me
                        feel bad for being cunty just now?

           EXT. THE SHINE'S OLD HOUSE. - LATER THAT EVENING

           The location of Mary's suicidal jump, deserted except for a 
           construction crew, which has begun to demolish the house.

           Jade sits in her car staring up at the Shine's old house. 
           She's been crying. Finally she begins to drive forward, ready 
           to leave, when she notices another car has pulled up in front 
           of the house. Driving forward, Jade realizes the other car 
           belongs to Mrs. Shine, who stares at the house in grief. 
           Suddenly Mrs. Shine sees Jade. From their separate cars they 
           stare in shock at each other; there’s serious history between 
           the two. Jade gives an awkward wave, slowly Mrs. Shine's face 
           transforms into an expression of pure hate. She drives off 
           angrily, leaving Jade alone and guilty in her own car.

           INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM. - SAME NIGHT

           That evening. Nora and Charlie watch “Silence of the Lambs.” 
           Hannibal Lecter speaks on screen. Nora looks at her watch.

           INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM. - SAME NIGHT

           Few minutes later. Nora gets Charlie ready for bed.

                                 CHARLIE_
                        Today in Mass my butt fell asleep.
                        Why do I go to Catholic school if 
                        we aren't Catholic?

                                 NORA_
                        It's the best school in Rye. I
                        hated Mass too when I went there.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maybe we shouldn't live in Rye.
                                 NORA
                        I'm trying. Manhattan’s expensive.
                             (tucking him in)
                        But when we do move you won’t ever 
                        have to go to mass again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ben's mom says when you die you go
                        to a waiting room and either Jesus 
                        lets you into heaven or the devil 
                        drags you to hell. Is that true?

                                 NORA
                        No. That’s a fabrication.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She says in hell, everyone has
                        their own house, but every house is 
                        on fire. And you can't get out and 
                        you can't have any friends over-

                                 NORA
                        Well, that’s not-

                                 CHARLIE
                        -and once a day the devil comes
                        over and he stabs you in your toes 
                        and rapes you.

                                 NORA
                        Oh my god!

                                 CHARLIE
                        We don’t believe in any of that?

                                 NORA
                        No! Shit, that's - You're not going
                        over there anymore.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay. (beat) What do we believe?

                                 NORA
                        You get to believe whatever you
                        want. But you have a lot of time to 
                        figure that out.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do you think happens? When you
                        die?

                                 NORA
                        I don’t think anything happens. I 
                        think it just ends. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NORA (CONT'D)
                        But that doesn’t mean that’s what 
                        you have to believe.

           Beat. Charlie considers this seriously.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think something happens.

           EXT. THE SHINE'S NEW HOUSE. - THE NEXT DAY.

           Luke pulls up in a towncar. Driver opens his door, he gets 
           out, stares up as the driver gets out his luggage, he lights 
           a cigarette.

           INT. SHINE'S LIVING ROOM. - SAME DAY

           Luke stares mutely at a trio of taxidermy dogs - former pets.

           Luke crosses to a side table, picks up an old family photo in 
           which one of the taxidermy dogs is still alive. Mr. Shine 
           enters, goes to mix himself a drink.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        The new house is nice, isn't it?

                                 LUKE
                        You didn't tell me Skipper died.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Skipper died. Got eaten by coyotes.

                                 LUKE
                        (gesturing to taxidermy dog)
                        But he's right there. 

           Mr. Shine looks.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Oh, right. Missy was eaten by
                        coyotes. Skipper died naturally. He 
                        had a seizure and swallowed his 
                        tongue.

           Disgusted, Luke sets the picture down. Mrs. Shine enters.

                                 MRS. SHINE.
                        I forgot to tell you. I saw Jade 
                        Avery yesterday. In her car. You 
                        haven't spoken to her, have you?

           Luke is surprised, shakes his head no.
                                 MRS. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        Good. After the mess she got Mary 
                        into your senior year... don't know 
                        how you ever spoke to her again.

                                 MR. SHINE.
                        He already learned his lesson from
                        that mistake. Didn't you, Luke?

           Luke picks up a high school photo of him playing basketball. 
           A slight pain crosses his face but is quickly gone.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m selling the apartment.

           Luke notices a stack of worn papers, handwritten. The top 
           page reads, “The Living Will of Mary Shine.”

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Why don't you keep it, honey? For
                        when you visit.

                                 LUKE
                        (distracted by the will)
                        I don't visit that often.

           Luke has turned to a page in the will with a hand drawn map 
           of the US - several places marked with stickers.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        What is this? Mary left a will?

           Mr. Shine looks up. Immediately annoyed.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Judy, I told you to put that away.
                             (to Luke)
                        It's not a will. It's a bunch of 
                        papers she was carrying around in 
                        her backpack - a will is a legal 
                        document.

           Mr. Shine tries to grab the will, Luke holds on, reads.

                                 LUKE
                        She listed where she wants her
                        ashes spread? I thought they said 
                        the suicide wasn't premeditated.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        It wasn't. She wrote that months
                        ago - probably longer.
                                 MRS. SHINE 
                        “Just in case.”

                                 LUKE 
                        Just in case?

                                 MR. SHINE
                        That's the point of a living will.

                                 LUKE
                        What kind of twenty-five year old
                        writes a will “just in case?”

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        The suicidal kind.

           Beat.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Luke, honey... do you know what's
                        in Atlanta? Or Boston? Why Mary 
                        would want her ashes there?

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Judy.

                                 LUKE
                        How would I know? She hadn’t talked 
                        to me in seven years either. 

                                 MR. SHINE
                        She wasn't in her right mind when
                        she wrote that - she outlined it 
                        like some kind of scavenger hunt.

                                 LUKE
                        A scavenger hunt is when you're
                        looking for something. Not getting 
                        rid of something.

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        Don't be a smart ass.

                                 LUKE
                        You're right, we should just
                        taxidermy her.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Luke!

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        I'm going to sleep.
           Mr. Shine leaves. Mrs. Shine rubs Luke's shoulder briefly 
           before following her husband, Luke's alone with the will.

           Later that night, Luke sits with the will, has been studying 
           it for a while. Finally puts it down, after a long moment he 
           gets his cell phone. Goes to Nora's number, dials.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, Nora? It's Luke. (beat) I'm in
                        Rye. I need to see you guys.

           EXT. DINER. - THAT EVENING.

           Nora and Charlie wait outside having a thumb war, laughing. 

           Suddenly Jade has appeared across the street. She and Nora 
           stare at each other; it's been a long time.

           INT. DINER. - MOMENTS LATER

           Nora and Charlie drink water, Nora eyes Jade's beer.

                                 JADE
                        So you're a writing assistant now?

                                 NORA
                        No. Assistant to a writer. 

                                 JADE 
                        Is there a difference?

                                 NORA
                        Yeah. 

                                 JADE
                             (genuine)
                        It’s so funny. I always thought 
                        you’d be like the first one of us 
                        to leave Rye.

                                 NORA
                        How’s your beer? I thought you were 
                        sober nowadays. 

                                 JADE
                        I was for a while. I mean, “sober”
                        is relative, but-

                                 NORA 
                        Are you clean?

                                 JADE
                        Yes I'm clean. Jesus, Nora.
                                 NORA
                        Well I heard a lot of stories.

                                 JADE
                        Well I'm sure they're not true.

                                 NORA
                        What about that story about you at
                        the San Diego Zoo?

                                 JADE
                        The Bronx Zoo. And I don't know
                        what story you're referring to.

                                 NORA
                        They said you had this fanny pack
                        full of cocaine and-

                                 JADE 
                        Let's not do this.

           Beat.

                                 NORA
                        So, do you and Luke still talk?

                                 JADE
                        Not since I broke up with him in 
                        L.A. Best decision of my life.

                                 NORA
                        His sister just died.

                                 JADE
                        He’s still an asshole. And he 
                        thinks he's better than me because 
                        he wrote one successful book.

                                 NORA
                        One very successful book.

                                 JADE
                        A self help book. On how to be a
                        successful bastard and get women to 
                        lower their standards. I'm offended 
                        not only on behalf of women, but, 
                        on behalf of books.

                                 NORA
                        They're turning it into a sitcom.

                                 JADE
                        I don't care. I never wanted to
                        write. You did.
           Suddenly Luke enters. Beat. Nora stands, hugs him lovingly.

                                 NORA
                        I'm so sorry, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah. Thanks. Me too.
                             (beat. Turns awkwardly to 
                              Jade)
                        Jade.

                                 JADE
                             (gives an awkward wave)
                        Hiii.

           Beat. Luke turns towards Charlie, super awkward.

                                 LUKE
                        And this is the little uh - person
                        you had - wow. Hello. I’m Luke.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How big is your penis?

           Beat, Luke looks uncertain.

           Little while later, Nora and Jade finish reading the will.

                                 NORA
                        This is so Mary. 

                                 JADE
                        Does she say anything about me?

                                 NORA
                        (Ignoring Jade) 
                        Did you notice the spot she listed 
                        here in Rye?

                                 LUKE 
                        Yeah. I saw.

                                 NORA
                        The other spots - are those places
                        she’d been living?

                                 LUKE
                        Not sure. I hadn’t spoken to her 
                        anymore recently than you guys. My 
                        parents think it’s pretty crazy.

                                 JADE
                        That’s really surprising. Your
                        family’s usually so open minded.
                                 LUKE
                        Well, not everyone can be as open
                        minded as you, Jade. There aren’t 
                        enough rehab centers.

                                 NORA 
                        Come on guys.

                                 JADE
                        It’s fine. I’ve always been less
                        judgemental than him.

                                 LUKE
                        Right. Lacking all sense of 
                        judgement whatsoever. Senior year 
                        of High School, for example.

           Beat. Something has struck a chord. Luke back tracks.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m just kidding. I didn’t really 
                        mean that.

                                 JADE
                        Did your mom tell you she saw me?
                             (beat, stares him down) 
                        What do you say when they talk 
                        about me? Do you defend me? Tell 
                        them how hard I searched for Mary 
                        after she disappeared?

                                 LUKE
                        We don’t talk about you anymore.

           Jade rolls her eyes, then stands, gathering her things.

                                 NORA 
                        Jade, wait.

                                 JADE
                        Really good to see you again, Nora.

           Jade leaves. There’s an awkward silence.

                                 LUKE
                        I shouldn’t have said that.

           Beat. Nora agrees but doesn’t have the heart to say it.

                                 NORA
                        I didn’t know Mary was back in New
                        York.
                                 LUKE 
                        No one did.

                                 NORA
                        What about your parents?

                                 LUKE
                        No. She just showed up on the roof.

                                 NORA
                        I wonder if she ever forgave us.

           Beat.

                                 LUKE
                        I should probably get home.
                             (He rises)
                        I’m glad you’re doing so well.

           He kisses her on the cheek, Nora forces a smile and nods.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Charlie. Good to meet you, buddy.

           Charlie has been staring in his pants, he looks up at them.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        It did something.

           Beat. Luke gives an awkward wave, leaves. Nora watches sadly.

           INT. NORA’S CAR. - THAT EVENING.

           Charlie sleeps, Nora drives. Outside she passes Rye Country 
           Day School. It is ghostly. Something begins to stir in her.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL MASS. - 7 YEARS EARLIER.

           Nora, Jade, Mary and Luke, all 18, sit in school mass, heads 
           bowed in prayer as PRIEST leads. Of the four only Luke prays; 
           Jade sleeps, Mary and Nora make faces at each other.

                                 STUDENTS
                        I confess to almighty God, and to
                        you, my brothers and sisters, that 
                        I have sinned through my own fault, 
                        in my thoughts and in my words, in 
                        what I have done, and in what I 
                        have failed to do.
           INT. SCHOOL BASKETBALL COURT. - LATER THE SAME DAY.

           Luke practices with his team while Jade, Nora and Mary watch 
           from the bleachers. Nora is especially fixated on Luke.

           EXT. OUTSIDE SCHOOL - LATER THE SAME DAY

           Mary dances in the street as the other three laugh from the 
           sidewalk, Luke still in his basketball clothing.

                                 MARY
                        These are the moves that are gonna
                        make me a legend.

           ALLISON, 18, passes. Luke smacks her ass, she grins over her 
           shoulder. Nora’s secretly bothered, Jade laughs at him.

                                 JADE
                        You’re a whore. And Allison’s so
                        dirty. You should get tested. 

                                 LUKE
                        I haven’t had sex with her.

                                 NORA
                        You can get herpes from oral. And
                        with a condom. Cause the blisters 
                        are- they’re not just on the shaft.

                                 LUKE
                        You know a lot about STDs for such
                        a raging virgin.

                                 NORA 
                        You can’t be a raging virgin, 
                        that’s- it’s an oxymoron.

           Suddenly a parked car begins to backup into Mary. Shocked, 
           Mary smacks the back of the car, it keeps going, knocking her 
           slightly off balance. She stumbles but recovers, moving aside 
           to safety. She pounds on the back of the car.

                                 MARY
                        Hey fucker! You almost ran me over!

           Car has stopped. Mary pounds on the back of it again.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You gonna apologize, cocksucker?!

           Car door opens, the school’s Priest steps out. He stares at 
           Mary, shocked. She’s surprised but undeterred.
                                 PRIEST
                        Mary. Do you have anything you want
                        to say to me?

                                 MARY
                        Do you have anything you want to
                        say to me?

           INT. THE SHINE’S DINING ROOM. - AN HOUR LATER

           Jade, Luke, Nora and Mary eat with Mr. and Mrs. Shine.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        I’m tired of getting angry calls
                        from the school, Mary.

                                 MARY
                        Believe me, I don’t enjoy the
                        persecution either, Dad.

                                 JADE
                        Thanks for having us for dinner.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        You’re both welcome anytime. Did
                        you get your math test back, Mary?

                                 MARY 
                        (glancing at others) 
                        No.

                                 LUKE
                        I got an A on my history essay.

                                 MARY
                        Nora writes all your essays.

                                 NORA
                        I just edit. He’s a great writer.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        What schools are you applying to?

                                 NORA
                        Somewhere with a strong writing
                        program. Stanford probably.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Stanford. My alma mater. I’d love
                        for these two to go there.

                                 LUKE
                        Their basketball team sucks.
                                 JADE
                             (sly smile)
                        Maybe Mary will go to Stanford.

           Mary rolls her eyes at Jade, they share a secret smile.

                                 MRS SHINE
                        Nora, maybe you could help Mary
                        with her schoolwork too. Luke 
                        already makes straight A’s.

           Mary deliberately knocks over a filled gravy dish.

                                 MARY
                        Well fuck me, look at that. Oh
                        shit, I said Fuck! And now I said 
                        Shit. God damn it.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. NORA’S CAR. - EVENING

           Nora keeps driving through Rye.

           INT. JADE’S MOM’S HOUSE. - COUPLE DAYS LATER - DAY

           Jade studies her tired reflection. Candy enters, watches.

                                 CANDY
                        You’ve been here a week.

                                 JADE
                        I just need to make a little cash.

           Candy makes a noise.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make passive aggressive 
                        glottal sounds at me. It just so 
                        happens that I’m headed into the 
                        city to meet with Elliot.

                                 CANDY
                        The agency’s taking you back?

                                 JADE
                        All I know is that Elliot is very
                        excited to see me.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MODELING AGENCY WAITING ROOM - SAME DAY.

           Close on a RECEPTIONIST’s unwelcoming face.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Elliot doesn’t want to see you.

           Reveal Jade, standing in front of the Receptionist’s desk.

                                 JADE
                        Nina. I was with this agency since
                        I was eighteen.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (whispering 
                              compassionately)
                        And now you’re twenty-five.

                                 JADE
                        Someone besides Elliot, then?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Nobody here is going to meet with
                        you, Jade.

                                 JADE
                        I sent you Santa cookies and
                        Jesus cards every Christmas for 
                        four years.

                                 RECEPTIONIST 
                        And I’m Jewish.

                                 JADE
                        But you’re blonde...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        My name is Nina Finkelstein.

           Jade whispers, desperate.

                                 JADE
                        I gave you a tampon at that Fashion
                        Week cocktail party. And you were 
                        wearing white! That could’ve been 
                        catastrophic for you!

                                 RECEPTIONIST 
                        I’m sorry, Miss Avery.

           Jade begins to storm out, bumps into YOUNG MODEL entering.

                                 JADE
                        This girl’s like twelve!
                                 YOUNG MODEL 
                        I’m thirteen.

                                 JADE
                        (exploding in Young Model’s face)
                        BLAHHHHH!

           INT. SHINE’S LIVING ROOM - SAME DAY.

           Luke stares at the URN on the mantel. Mr. Shine enters, sits 
           down with a paper. Luke looks at the taxidermy dogs, then 
           back at the urn.

           INT. CAR. - AN HOUR LATER.

           Luke drives, smoking a cigarette. He passes a BASKETBALL 
           COURT, watches the players briefly then looks quickly away.

           INT. ALLISON’S HOUSE. - SAME NIGHT

           Luke waits at the door, Allison Dranger opens it.

                                 ALLISON
                        I had a feeling I’d be hearing from 
                        you.

           He says nothing, he’s clearly not okay. She sighs.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Come on in. I’ll lick your wounds.

           He follows her inside.

           INT. RYE BAR - COUPLE HOURS LATER.

           BARTENDER hands Jade her bill, she looks at it.

                                 JADE 
                        Oh shit.
                             (to the bartender)
                        I’m just gonna address the elephant 
                        in the room. I’m too pretty to pay 
                        for all of these.
                             (beat. she leans in.)
                        Look. These aren’t happy drinks. 
                        They’re lonely, unemployed drinks. 
                        I’m not trying to enjoy this 
                        moment. I’m trying to forget it. 
                        And all the moments that led to it.
                                 BARTENDER
                        Is that something that’s worked for
                        you before? The drinking till you 
                        forget your problems thing?

                                 JADE
                        No, but I’m optimistic.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Usually you gotta examine the past
                        pretty close before it’s actually 
                        the past.

           Beat, this resonates with Jade. Bartender pushes bill to her.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        And you always have to pay for it.

           Jade watches bartender walk away.

           INT. NORA’S HOUSE. - THAT NIGHT

           Nora sits at laptop, a blank word document, she has writer’s 
           block. Doorbell rings. She answers it, it’s Jade, wasted.

                                 JADE
                        Do you have any water? Or bread?

                                                                CUT TO:

           NEXT MORNING - JADE SNORES LOUDLY ON COUCH, HUNGOVER MESS.

           Charlie stares, eating a boulder of cheese. Jade wakes.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck. Hi.
                        (beat)
                        This isn’t real. You’re dreaming. 
                        Go back to bed.

           Charlie continues to stare blankly, chewing. Nora enters, 
           giving Charlie a look. Charlie exits into the other room.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        You let him just eat cheese like
                        that? How often does he shit?

           Nora stares Jade down, not amused. Jade moves on.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        I wish I could remember my dreams.
                        I woke up in the middle of the 
                        night and I was laying like this.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                             (demonstrates)
                        Flat on my back with my legs 
                        crossed and my hands guarding my 
                        vagina. What do you think that 
                        means?

                                 NORA
                        What are you doing here, Jade?

                                 JADE 
                        Reconnecting with you.

                                 NORA
                        Where are you living? Are you 
                        homeless?

                                 JADE
                        (whining) Just love me again!!!

           Beat. Nora’s not amused.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I had something I wanted to
                        talk to you about. 
                             (beat)
                        Let’s spread Mary’s ashes.

                                 NORA
                        Like... around the country?

                                 JADE
                        It’d be two weeks tops. Boston 
                        first, Atlanta last, then come back 
                        and do the final spot here in Rye 
                        right in time for Mary’s birthday.

                                 NORA
                        Have you forgotten that I have a 
                        child?

                                 JADE
                        Your dad could watch him.

                                 NORA
                        I can’t leave for two weeks. I know 
                        your life doesn’t involve any 
                        responsibilities, but mine does.

                                 JADE
                        My life involves responsibilities.

                                 NORA
                        Like what? Other than diet and 
                        exercise? 
                                 JADE
                        Mary didn’t want her ashes to just 
                        sit in an urn.

                                 NORA
                        You and I aren’t friends anymore, 
                        Jade.

                                 JADE
                        But we could be. I get why Mary
                        stopped talking to me. But, I never 
                        understood where you went.

                                 NORA
                        I never went anywhere. I’ve been
                        here the whole time, raising my 
                        son. You went to California with 
                        Luke.

                                 JADE
                        I had to go. Luke was going to 
                        Stanford and... he was my 
                        boyfriend. And shit got crazy here. 

                                 NORA
                        No, I’m not - obviously you weren’t 
                        going to stay in Rye. That’s not 
                        what I meant. I don’t care.

           Silence.

                                 JADE
                        Please Nora. I’m failing so hard at 
                        everything. Don’t you want to do 
                        something important?

           Beat. Nora’s eyes fall on her writing attempt on her laptop.

           EXT. LUKE’S FRONT STEPS - HOUR LATER. 

           Luke, Nora and Jade talk. Luke smokes a cigarette irritably.

                                 LUKE
                        No.

                                 JADE
                        Why not?

                                 LUKE
                        Because it’s crazy. We don’t know
                        how long ago Mary wrote that will - 
                        and she changed her mind everyday.
                                 JADE
                        So you don’t think she meant the
                        things she said?

                                 LUKE
                        Mary always meant everything she
                        said. For about ten minutes.

                                 JADE
                        Don’t you want to know where she’d
                        been all these years?

           Beat. Jade’s phone rings, she answers it, walks a few feet 
           away. Luke turns to Nora.

                                 LUKE 
                        You’re into this?

                                 NORA
                        Yeah. I think I might be.

           Luke watches Jade on the phone out of earshot. She’s still 
           the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen.

           INT. NYC SUFFOLK STREET APARTMENT IN NYC. - NEXT DAY

           Luke wanders through the empty apartment. He stops, sees 
           “Mary is King” carved into the wall.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. RYE JUNGLE GYM. - SEVEN YEARS EARLIER - DAY

           The same jungle gym from their childhood. Luke and Nora do 
           homework. Mary carves “Mary is hot” into a tree, Jade takes 
           photos with her camera.

                                 JADE
                        Is there a wooden surface in Rye
                        you haven’t carved your name into?

            Mary grins. Nora hands Luke a marked up paper.

                                 NORA
                        I fixed some grammar things.

           From the street a car honks, it’s Mr. and Mrs. Shine.

           INT. MR. SHINE’S CAR. - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

           Luke and Mary in the back, parents in front. 
           Suddenly they get to a road block - an ambulance and police 
           cars surround a crime scene. A policeman directs traffic, Mr. 
           Shine slows the car, rolling down his window to talk to him.

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        What happened?

                                 POLICEMAN
                        Teenager, beaten to death by some
                        punks.

           As they drive forward they look out the window, suddenly a 
           body on a stretcher is visible. Mary stares, fixated.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look!

           Mary continues to stare. Luke obediently averts his eyes. 
           Outside a mother weeps into the arms of a policeman.

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        Mary! Don’t look!

           As they drive past, Mary continues to stare out window, 
           ambulance lights flashing across her face.

           Several minutes later Mr. Shine pulls into their driveway. 
           Mary looks ill. Mr. Shine looks at her, perturbed.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        We told you not to look. It’s your
                        own fault you’re upset.

           The parents go in the house. Mary doesn’t budge. Luke waits.

                                 MARY
                        Do you ever feel like, when you see
                        something really bad... the more 
                        you feel it - the less someone else 
                        will have to?

                                 LUKE 
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Come inside. You’ll feel better.

                                 MARY
                        Did you see the woman crying? I
                        think it was the mother.

                                 LUKE 
                        I didn’t look.

           Mary is silent for a moment.
                                 MARY 
                        You can go inside.

           Luke hesitates, then finally goes inside. Mary’s alone.

           INT. THE SHINE’S OLD HOUSE.

           Mr. Shine watches Mary from the window as Luke enters.

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        Masochism. That’s her problem.

           Luke makes a slightly disagreeable face, Mr. Shine notices.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        You think that’s normal out there?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t care. I’m tired.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        That shit - that’s what you wanna
                        avoid. Emotional capitol is a 
                        valuable thing. You can’t waste it 
                        on bullshit. Here’s the difference. 
                        A strong person - you hit them - 
                        they hit you back. A weak person, 
                        you hit, they go to the mirror and 
                        study the bruise.
                             (beat)
                        I hit you, what do you do?

           Luke is silent, really wants this conversation to end.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        What do you do?

           He shoves Luke, Luke’s startled.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           He shoves Luke again. Luke’s finally fed up, shoves him back.

                                 LUKE
                        Dad, stop!

           Mr. Shine smiles at Luke for a moment, touches the top of his 
           head lovingly.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Your sister’s gonna be okay. She
                        just needs to toughen up a bit.
           Mr. Shine leaves. Luke is bothered, he looks out the window, 
           can make out Mary’s figure alone in the car.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. NYC SUFFOLK STREET APARTMENT.

           Luke’s cell rings, he snaps back to the present. He answers, 
           lighting a cigarette.

                                 LUKE 
                        Hello?

                                 HEATHER (V.O.)
                        Baby, when are you coming back? 
                        Sharon wants us to meet her new 
                        boyfriend. He’s huge in TV, and
                        he’s a big fan of your book. 

           Luke stares at Mary’s writing on the wall.

           EXT. NORA’S HOUSE.

           The group piles luggage into a vintage Mercedes, Luke smokes 
           a cigarette.

                                 JADE
                        How’d you get your dad to let you
                        borrow the Mercedes?

                                 LUKE
                        He thinks I’m going to a Young
                        Republicans conference. 
                             (staring in awe at car)
                        I’ve been wanting to drive this car 
                        for twenty-five years. I knew it’d 
                        take something apocalyptic for my 
                        dad to let me.

                                 JADE
                        So you played the dead sister card?

                                 LUKE
                        The dead twin card, yeah.

                                 NORA
                        Do you have the ashes?

           He holds up a PIGGY BANK. Long awkward beat.

                                 LUKE
                        I had to smuggle them.
           INT. CAR. - SAME DAY

           Luke drives, Nora in front, Jade in the back. Jade sings 
           along loudly and annoyingly to the radio.

           Suddenly a bird splatters into the windshield, Jade screams.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Several minutes later. Jade weeps quietly in the back, Nora 
           and Luke try not to laugh. Music begins.

           MONTAGE: DRIVING TO BOSTON - MUSIC FADES AND MONTAGE ENDS AS;

           INT. BOSTON BED AND BREAKFAST LOBBY.

           The receptionist hands room keys to Nora, Jade and Luke. Nora 
           shows the receptionist a piece of paper.

                                 NORA
                        Do you know where this address is?

           INT. CAR.

           The trio drives through a sketchy neighborhood. They arrive 
           at a slightly creepy house at the end of the street.

                                 LUKE
                        I wonder who the fuck lives here.

           INT. CARMEN’S HOUSE.

           CARMEN, 30s, gothic, reads KIM’s Tarot Cards.

                                 CARMEN
                        I’m not liking what I’m seeing. You 
                        have a lot of negative energy
                        around you. Do you feel it?

                                 KIM
                             (horrified)
                        I didn’t, but I think I do now.

                                 CARMEN
                        Like a cloud of black poison.

                                 KIM 
                        Holy shit.
                                 CARMEN
                        There’s a ritual I can perform to
                        break through it and let positive 
                        things come to you again. It will 
                        require a lot of energy though.

                                 KIM
                        I want it. How do we start?

                                 CARMEN
                        First, cut off a few strands of 
                        hair. Then take the hair and fold 
                        it in between two one hundred 
                        dollar bills. Then put it all in an 
                        envelope and bring it to me. I’ll 
                        do the rest.

           The doorbell rings. Carmen is annoyed, goes to the door. 
           Luke, Nora and Jade wait.

                                 CARMEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m with a client, you’ll have to
                        call if you want an appointment.

                                 NORA
                        Actually, we wanted to talk to you 
                        about Mary Shine.

           Carmen freezes.

                                 CARMEN
                        I don’t know what she told you, but
                        I run a legitimate business here-

                                 NORA
                        She didn’t tell us anything - she’s 
                        dead.

           A few minutes later - the group sits in Carmen’s living room, 
           Kim’s gone. Jade studies a photo of Carmen and Mary, Mary’s 
           hair is short in it.

                                 JADE
                        She cut all her hair off. (beat) It
                        looks awesome.

                                 LUKE
                        So how did you know my sister?

                                 CARMEN
                        She was a client first, became a 
                        friend.
                                 JADE
                        A client? Of what?

                                 CARMEN
                        I practice hoodoo. I also read
                        tarot and do energy healing.

                                 NORA
                        Hoodoo... what is that?

                                 CARMEN
                        I harness energy and use it to help
                        manifest people’s wants. 
                             (she opens a beer)
                        When Mary came to me she thought 
                        there was bad energy that had 
                        attached itself to her.
                             (holding out the beer) )
                        You want some?

           Nora and Luke decline, but Jade begins to take one - a look 
           from Nora stops her. Nora speaks with a very obvious bite.

                                 NORA
                        So how much did Mary pay you to get
                        rid of this “bad energy?”

                                 CARMEN
                        Please. I let Mary live
                        here for free. And I did try to 
                        help her, but she had self 
                        destruction in her blood. Energy 
                        work alone couldn’t fix her.

                                 NORA 
                        No shit.

                                 JADE
                        So... when Mary came to you...

                                 CARMEN
                        She was a baby. Right out of high
                        school. There was a relationship 
                        she’d just gotten out of. In New 
                        York... a photographer. It ended 
                        badly. But you guys probably 
                        already know that story.

           Nora, Jake and Luke exchange a look; they do know this story.

                                 CARMEN (CONT’D)
                        I taught her a little of what I do.
                        It was a passing interest for her, 
                        though.
                                 JADE
                        Why did she leave?

                                 CARMEN
                        She didn’t agree with certain
                        aspects of my business.

                                 JADE 
                        Where did she go?

                                 CARMEN
                        If I knew I’d have looked for
                        her. She took four hundred dollars 
                        in cash from me. She wrote me a 
                        couple years later, said she was 
                        living with some girl named Sonya, 
                        “the best friend she’d ever had.”

           Beat, the group looks at each other.

                                 CARMEN (CONT’D)
                        If you’d like to spread the ashes
                        here, there’s a stream out back.

           EXT. BACKYARD. - MOMENTS LATER

           The three stand with the piggy bank at the stream. In the 
           tree next to it is carved “Mary is famous.” Luke lights a 
           cigarette, Nora looks at him.

                                 LUKE
                        What?

                                 NORA
                        I think you should smoke more 
                        cigarettes. If possible.

                                 LUKE
                             (dismissing the comment)
                        So how are we doing this?

                                 JADE 
                        Let’s all take some.

           They pour a small amount into all their hands. Awkward beat. 
           Nora starts to toss hers, Jade stops her.

                                 JADE (CONT’D) 
                        Shouldn’t we say something?

                                 NORA 
                        Like what?
                                 JADE
                        I don’t know. Anything.

           Beat. Nora begins tossing ashes.

                                 NORA 
                        Anything.
                             (tosses more) )
                        Anything!

           Laughing, they all awkwardly begin tossing ashes, yelling 
           “Anything!” After a moment they’re done, laughter subsides.

           EXT. FRONT OF CARMEN’S HOUSE.

           The three head back to the car, Jade a little bit behind. 
           Carmen exits the house, calls to Jade.

                                 CARMEN 
                        One moment.

           Carmen catches up to Jade, hands her a deck of Tarot cards.

                                 CARMEN (CONT’D)
                        These were Mary’s. She was never
                        very good with them, but...

                                 JADE 
                        Thanks.

                                 CARMEN 
                        One other thing.
                             (she speaks low, gesturing 
                              towards Nora and Luke)
                        They’re not being honest with you 
                        about something.

           Jade’s skeptical, Carmen goes inside. After a moment Jade 
           shrugs it off and follows the other two to the car.

           INT. BED AND BREAKFAST BEDROOM. - THAT NIGHT

           Nora lies in bed, Jade undresses, gets in bed with Nora.

                                 JADE
                        I wonder who Sonya is. “Best friend 
                        Mary ever had.” Yeah right. We were 
                        the best friends Mary ever had.

                                 NORA
                        At one point.
                                 JADE
                        Do you think Mary’s watching us?

                                 NORA
                        No.

                                 JADE
                        You’re just a bummed out atheist.
                        She’s totally watching.

                                 NORA 
                        Don’t be gay.
                             (squeals in pain)
                        Ow! You pinched my nipple!

                                 JADE
                        Don’t use gay as a derogatory term.

           Jade rolls over in bed, both girls stare into the dark. 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. MARY AND LUKE’S SUFFOLK STREET APT, NYC.

           Mary lies naked but covered with a sheet while Jade paints 
           her. Nora does homework.

                                 MARY
                        I feel so naked without my... 
                        clothing.

           They laugh.

                                 JADE 
                        You up next, Nora?

                                 NORA
                        Not a chance, you fucking lesbians.

           They laugh. Jade keeps painting. Although she tries to hide 
           it, Mary’s vulnerability is palpable.

                                 JADE 
                        What?

                                 MARY 
                        Nothing. You’re pretty.

                                 JADE 
                        You are.

           To break the vulnerability of the moment, Mary makes a 
           hideous face. Jade laughs.
                                 JADE (CONT’D) 
                        You want to see?

           Mary nods. Jade turns her canvas to show Mary the beautiful 
           picture she’s painting; Mary is angelic, ethereal in it.

                                 MARY
                        This is what you think I look like?

                                 JADE
                        I know this is what you look like.

           Mary is touched. Beat. She reposes, Jade paints. 

           Nora shakes her head, staring at her book.

           EXT. NYC SIDEWALK. - LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Jade, Nora and Mary (in a full body jean jumpsuit) walk.

                                 MARY
                        I feel like people are pretending
                        that I’m not wearing a full body 
                        jean jumpsuit. But I am.

           ELLIOT, 40, approaches Jade.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Sorry to bother you. I’m Elliot.
                        I’m an agent at Wilhemina Models.

                                 JADE
                        Jade.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Are you from here?

                                 JADE
                        We live in Rye. It’s an hour
                        outside the city, in Westchester.

                                 MARY
                        Imagine like a huge Lacoste store 
                        with golden retrievers everywhere.

           Elliot ignores Mary, speaks to Jade. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        You’ve got a great face. Have you
                        ever thought about modeling?

                                 MARY
                        She’s an artist. And photographer.
           Mary runs over, grabs Jade’s notebook, shows Elliot Jade’s 
           paintings and photos, the large majority are of Mary.

                                 ELLIOT
                        These are cute.
                             (touching Jade’s face)
                        You’ll make more money off this, 
                        though. Call me if you want to set 
                        up a meeting.

           He hands her his card and leaves. After a moment Mary laughs.

                                 MARY
                        Oh my god. What a predator.

           INT. BASKETBALL COURT. - A WEEK LATER.

           Big game. Mary’s in the bleachers with her parents. A few 
           rows ahead the school’s Priest (from earlier car scene) moves 
           to his seat. He makes eye contact with Mary. Mary gives him a 
           death stare, cracking her knuckles intimidatingly. 

           Nora enters, sits next to Mary and the Shines.

                                 MARY
                        Jade’s on her way. She was having
                        pictures taken in the city.

           Mary and Nora roll their eyes at each other. TIM, 18, 
           squeezes by the girls, he smiles firtatiously at Nora.

                                 TIM
                        Hey Nora. Nice socks.

                                 NORA 
                        They’re stockings.

           He smiles, walks off. Nora’s confused, not used to flirting. 
           Luke and the team enter court. Mr. Shine cheers too loudly.

           Jade enters, looks GORGEOUS. Luke notices her, they wave at 
           each other; Nora watches. Jade sits with the group.

           Later. Game continues. One player is giving Luke a 
           particularly hard time, being too aggressive. He purposefully 
           bumps into Luke, Luke’s getting pissed. Mr. Shine watches. As 
           the game continues, the kid suddenly knocks Luke over, Luke 
           shoves him, the ref whistles. The group watches as the ref 
           and coaches have a word with them. Flustered, Luke looks up 
           at his dad, who seems to be daring him with his eyes. As the 
           game continues, a new fire burns in Luke. He plays as 
           aggressively as the kid, doing well, then suddenly something 
           goes wrong. 
           He goes too hard, as he collides with the kid he falls 
           horribly on his knee. Rolling in agony, the game stops, 
           coaches run out.

           INT. HOSPITAL. - THAT EVENING

           In the hall, Mrs. Shine talks to a doctor, the girls watch.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. - CONTINUOUS

           Luke lies glumly, Mr. Shine is bedside.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        You’ll do something else in
                        college.

           Luke is silent, looks like he’s going to cry.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D) 
                        Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
                        There’s more to life than 
                        basketball.

           The girls enter. Mary touches his face, he turns it away.

                                 MARY
                        If you want to wail at the top of
                        your lungs, I’ll wail with you.

                                 MR. SHINE 
                        He’s fine.

                                 MARY
                        He’s allowed to not be.
                             (to Luke)
                        Do you want to throw a tantrum?

                                 LUKE
                        Fuck off, Mary. I’m not- I’m not a
                        masochist.

           Mary is stung. Mr. Shine is pleased by the show of strength.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Let’s give him some alone time.

           The group leaves awkwardly. Luke stares at the ceiling. 

           Suddenly he realizes Jade has reentered by herself.

                                 LUKE 
                        What?
           She walks to him, after a moment leans down and kisses him. 
           It’s long and sweet. She pulls away, they stare in silence.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. - FEW DAYS LATER.

           Nora and Mary at locker, Luke enters on crutches, heads over 
           to them, before he can speak Allison approaches.

                                 ALLISON
                        Luke, I’m so sorry about your knee. 
                        I’m sure Jesus has a bigger plan. 

           Nora and Mary exchange a look, Mary snorts.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        You think your brother’s injury is
                        funny?

                                 MARY
                        No, I think Jesus is funny.

           Allison storms off. Luke turns to Nora, Mary turns to her 
           locker, digging through it. Nora forces a smile to Luke.

                                 NORA
                        Are you feeling better?

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve been thinking. What would you
                        say about me majoring in writing?

                                 NORA
                        You know I think you’re a good
                        writer.

                                 LUKE
                        Stanford writing’s where it’s at?

                                 NORA
                        It’s my first choice.

                                 LUKE
                        You think I could get in there too?

           Nora smiles, then nods. She really likes this idea.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll help me with my admissions?

                                 NORA 
                        Of course. 
                             (smiles bigger)
                        Stanford writers.
           Jade approaches, hands the group some of her modeling shots.

                                 JADE
                        Look at this fancy bitch.

                                 MARY 
                        You’re a sell out.

           The bell rings, Mary drags Nora to class, Jade lingers.

                                 JADE
                        How you feeling gimpy?

                                 LUKE 
                        Weird. But good.

           A beat. Mary calls from the classroom in Forrest Gump voice.

                                 MARY
                        Lieutenant Dan! Liuetenant Dan!

           Jade sneakily strokes Luke’s hand, hurries into classroom.

                                                        BACK TO PRESENT

           In the Bed and Breakfast bedroom, both Nora and Jade stare 
           into the dark, wide awake but in their own thoughts.

           INT. THE SHINE’S HOUSE. - SAME NIGHT

           Mr. Shine drinks a glass of whiskey, stops at urn. He stares 
           at it for a moment then picks it up. He stops, something’s 
           wrong. He takes the lid off, looks inside. His eyes widen.

           Few minutes later Mr. Shine paces angrily, Mrs. Shine 
           watches. Finally he goes to the phone, Mrs. Shine stops him.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Wait. We should call Luke first. 

                                 MR. SHINE
                        He needs to learn a lesson. 

           He dials. We hear a police dispatcher over the phone.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        I want to report a stolen
                        vehicle.
           INT. CAR - NEXT DAY.

           A New England road. Luke drives, Jade in back. Nora goes 
           through a grocery bag, pulls out an at home bikini wax kit.

                                 NORA
                        Jade, is this yours? The Do It
                        Yourself Bikini Wax?

                                 JADE 
                        Yeah, so?

                                 NORA
                        Why do you need this right now?

                                 JADE
                        Because. It’s getting a little...
                             (makes face)
                        Rowdy. Down there. It’s all like -

                                 NORA 
                        - okay.

                                 JADE
                        If I have some leftover you can use 
                        it. God knows what kind of cactus 
                        you’re working with.

                                 NORA
                        You have the social skills of a 
                        gorilla.

                                 JADE
                        Gorillas are almost as smart as 
                        humans.

                                 NORA
                        But not quite.

           EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH. - SAME DAY

           The car pulls up. They stare at the map, confused.

                                 NORA 
                        This is the right address.
                             (beat)
                        Why would Mary want her ashes 
                        spread at a church?

                                 JADE
                        Yeah. That seems out of character.
           INT. CHURCH.

           The trio enters; the church is dark, and old. A voice echoes 
           from the back.

                                 SISTER EDNA (O.S.) 
                        Good afternoon. Can I help you?

           They turn to see Sister Edna, a nun. They look to each other, 
           deciding who’s gonna answer. Nora speaks up.

                                 NORA
                        Yeah, um... Do you know a girl 
                        named Mary?

                                 SISTER EDNA 
                        I know a lot of Marys.

                                 JADE
                        Not like... that Mary.

                                 LUKE
                        Mary Shine?

           Sister Edna’s face lights up with recognition.

                                 SISTER EDNA
                        Of course. Mary Shine. She was a
                        regular here for a time.

                                 JADE
                        Really? That’s weird. I mean, she 
                        wasn’t really into like... “God.”

           Nora and Luke give Jade a look.

                                 SISTER EDNA
                        She didn’t really come in for
                        services. She mostly came when it 
                        was empty. She said once it 
                        reminded her of where she came 
                        from. We didn’t speak much, 
                        though... she was fairly reserved.

           The group exchanges a look - this seems out of character.

                                 LUKE
                        Mary was not reserved. If anything 
                        she was compulsively unreserved.

                                 SISTER EDNA
                        Well, sometimes we go through 
                        periods of introspection... that 
                        seemed to be the case with Mary. 
                                 NORA
                        Was she ever with a girl named 
                        Sonya? Probably about our age?

                                 SISTER EDNA
                        Not that I remember... But she had 
                        a little girl with her sometimes.

           The group is now very confused. They look at each other.

                                 NORA 
                        A little girl?

                                 SISTER EDNA
                        About two years old? Maybe three.

                                 JADE
                             (under her breath)
                        Holy shit.

           INT. MOTEL BATHROOM. - THAT EVENING

           Jade lies in the bath, lost in thought. Nora enters.

                                 NORA 
                        How you doing?

                                 JADE
                        Did Mary seriously get knocked up
                        also? Both of you? What the fuck. 

           Beat. Jade’s oblivious to the fact that she’s been offensive.

                                 NORA
                        First of all, go fuck yourself. 
                        Secondly, we’ll find out who the 
                        kid was. I’m gonna go eat with 
                        Luke. Join?

           Jade gives a “buh-bye” wave. Beat. Nora leaves Jade alone.

           Several minutes later, Jade’s at the sink, applying wax from 
           her bikini wax kit confidently. She yanks a strip off - gasps 
           in horror at her reflection, SOMETHING’S WRONG.

           INT. DINER. - SAME EVENING

           Nora and Luke eat. Luke is withdrawn.
                                 NORA
                        We have to find out about the kid. 
                        I looked up the rest of the 
                        spots... mostly parks and stuff. I 
                        doubt they’ll be that informative.
                             (silence)
                        It’s weird, how little we knew 
                        about her.

           Luke is disengaged, moodily eating his food.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do that thing you do. When 
                        you withdraw because something’s 
                        unpleasant to talk about.

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t do that.
                             (beat, he softens)
                        I want to figure it out too. And we 
                        will, even if it’s after the road 
                        trip. We’ll figure everything out.

           Nora’s calmed. She eats, bouncing her fork around. He smiles.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D) 
                        You’ve done that forever.
                             (imitates her)
                        Bounce your fork around when you 
                        eat something you like.

                                 NORA
                        I don’t really do that, do I?
                        (she takes a bite, bounces fork)
                        I don’t know. It just feels right.

           They smile. Silence.

                                 NORA (CONT'D)
                        So why’d you and Jade break up in
                        California?

                                 LUKE
                        Apparently modeling careers and 
                        drugs don’t mix with monogamy. 
                             (beat)
                        She cheated on me my senior year at 
                        Stanford, with some idiot in LA.

                                 NORA
                        Wow. I always figured you’d be the 
                        cheater. So why’s she so mad?
                                 LUKE
                        Well. After I found out, I felt the 
                        need to, you know, fuck all of her 
                        friends. But I figured that was 
                        just... fair. Evening things out.

                                 NORA 
                        Right.

                                 LUKE
                        Just trying to save our 
                        relationship.

           Nora rolls her eyes. Beat.

                                 NORA
                        So I read your book.

                                 LUKE
                        What’d you think?
                             (silence)
                        You hated it.

                                 NORA
                        I can give you my notes. For old 
                        times sake.

           He rolls his eyes but they both smile. Silence.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        Ever wonder what would’ve happened 
                        if I’d gone to Stanford with you?

                                 LUKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 NORA
                        Nothing. 

           She takes a bite, bouncing her fork. He grins, she realizes.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit.
                             (they laugh)
                        I hate you. You’ve ruined eating 
                        for me. That’s the thing about you, 
                        Luke, you ruin everything.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM. - LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Jade’s in a robe, extremely weepy. Nora enters.
                                 NORA 
                        Hey. Are you okay?

           Jade shakes her head. Nora goes to her comfortingly.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. If Mary had a kid
                        we’ll find her.

                                 JADE
                        It’s not about that.
                        (she whispers, distraught) 
                        Something terrible happened.

                                 NORA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JADE
                        My puswa. I butchered it.

                                 NORA 
                        Your what?

                                 JADE
                        Puswa. It’s french for pussy.

                                 NORA 
                        No it’s not.

                                 JADE
                        The damage is really bad, Nora.

                                 NORA
                        Wait, this is about your vagina?
                        Jesus Christ, Jade. You always do 
                        this, make everything about you.

                                 JADE
                        I know, but you don’t understand!
                             (beat)
                        Stuff came off that isn’t supposed 
                        to come off.
                             (horrible silence)
                        Will you look at it?

                                 NORA
                        I really don’t want to.

           Jade opens her towel, Nora gasps in horror.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD!
                             (shields eyes)
                        Oh no - no no no no -
                                 JADE 
                        Please help me.

                                 NORA
                        Put the towel back on.

                                 JADE
                        Do you think it’ll ever look the
                        same?

                                 NORA
                        Put the fucking towel back on! This
                        is rude, Jade!

                                 JADE
                        Help me!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR. - THE NEXT DAY.

           Nora drives, Jade sits awkwardly and miserably in passenger 
           seat with an ice pack down her pants. Luke in the backseat.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - 7 YEARS EARLIER.

           Jade and Luke makeout heavily, half dressed.

           EXT. JADE’S HOUSE. - AN HOUR LATER.

           Jade & Luke exit, they glance around before sneaking a kiss. 
           He heads down the sidewalk around the corner. Jade smiles and 
           heads in the other direction, a car honks, it’s Mary.

                                 MARY 
                        Hey tranny!

           Startled, Jade glances after Luke, knows Mary didn’t see him.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        We had plans. You forget about me?

                                 JADE
                        Shit. I’m sorry. I have to go into
                        the city for this photo shoot now.

                                 MARY
                        I waited for like two hours. I got
                        people to see bitch. Shit to do.
                                 JADE
                        Wanna come with me? You can watch.

                                 MARY 
                        Yeah.

           EXT. ALEX’S STUDIO. - SAME DAY. 

           Jade rings bell, she and Mary wait.

                                 JADE
                        This photographer, Alex Clemente,
                        he’s like a really big deal. Pervy 
                        reputation though.

           ALEX, 35, sexy and dark, opens door. Looks them over.

                                 ALEX
                        You brought a friend.

                                 JADE
                        This is Mary. She’s a good girl.

                                 ALEX 
                        Uh oh.

           They follow him inside.

           INT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO. - MOMENTS LATER.

           The wardrobe team fits Jade while ALICE, anorexic and “edgy” 
           model, sits silently having makeup done and chain smoking. 
           The zipper of Jade’s dress won’t close.

                                 WARDROBE WOMAN 
                             (to her assistant)
                        This is too small.

           The assistant goes back to the rack, Jade is embarrassed.

                                 JADE
                        I could probably diet a little.

                                 WARDROBE WOMAN
                        You’re fine for commercial stuff.
                        But for editorial- Alice’s size is 
                        perfect.

           Jade glances at Alice, who is chain smoking and humorless. 
           Wardrobe Woman takes out a pill bottle, hands it to Jade.
                                 WARDROBE WOMAN (CONT’D) 
                        You ever try Adderall? Cuts the
                        appetite completely. Give it a try.

           She walks off, Jade sits next to Alice, suddenly bummed out.

                                 JADE
                        Do you think I’m fat?

           Alice takes a long drag of cigarette, speaks in heavy accent;

                                 ALICE 
                        Everybody’s fat.

           On the other side of the studio Alex shows Mary some of his 
           art, a picture of a model in an ostrich feather gown.

                                 ALEX
                        This was one of my favorites...

           Mary stares him down.

                                 MARY
                        Do you know how many ostriches are
                        killed yearly for their feathers?
                             (beat)
                        A lot.

                                 ALEX
                             (exaggerated concern)
                        Oh, I know. I was actually weeping 
                        behind the camera when I took this.

           Beat. Mary’s not sure if he’s serious, then he smiles. She 
           can’t help it, she smiles also, in spite of herself.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        So what do you want to be when you
                        grow up?

                                 MARY 
                        An activist.

           Alex smirks, finds this charming and ridiculous.

                                 ALEX
                        Jade says you model too.

                                 MARY
                         No. Only for her.

                                 ALEX 
                        Thank god.
                             (off Mary’s look)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEX  (CONT'D)
                        Models are boring. You seem 
                        interesting.

           Mary blushes. Jade approaches, all dressed up.

                                 JADE
                        How do I look?

                                 ALEX
                        Like a model.

           Jade’s pleased, rushes off. Alex and Mary share a smile.

           EXT. RYE JUNGLE GYM. - SAME DAY

           Nora and Luke study. He’s distracted by something, she sees.

                                 NORA 
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        I have to tell you something.

                                 NORA
                        You can tell me anything.

                                 LUKE
                        I haven’t told anyone but...

           Nora nods, thinks she knows what it is, hopeful.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been hooking up with Jade.

           Nora is shocked, speechless. This is not what she expected.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s weird, it just sort of 
                        happened... don’t say anything.
                             (studies her face)
                        You think it’s a bad idea?

                                 NORA
                        No. I’m just... I didn’t - do you 
                        really like her, like that?

                                 LUKE
                        I think- I don’t know. Maybe. Yeah.

           Nora fumbles for an answer, finally forces a smile.
                                 NORA
                        Well then that’s... that’s awesome.
                             (silence)
                        Why am I the one you’re telling?

                                 LUKE
                        Because. You’re my best friend.

           Nora nods, devastated but hiding it. 

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. CAR. - DAY

           They drive. Calm countryside around them.

                                 JADE
                        She would’ve liked this stretch.

           Jade gets Piggy Bank, unceremoniously tosses some ashes out 
           the window. Nora and Luke stare at her in shock. She notices.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Relax, there’s plenty of her to 
                        spread around.

           Nora and Luke shake their heads as they drive into the 
           countryside. Montage music begins.

           MONTAGE:

           The three spread the ashes in a beautiful field.

           Driving, group laughs as Jade flashes her ass at a truck. The 
           three spread the ashes at a beautiful lake, swans swim.

           CUT TO: Nora is chased by swan. She turns, holds up the Piggy 
           Bank in defense, about to throw - Luke & Jade intervene.

           In a garden, Jade holds the ashes over her head with her eyes 
           closed. Unbeknownst to her, a small shaggy dog has run up to 
           their feet. She pours the ashes directly onto the dog. 
           Realizing her mistake, she bends down to dust the dog off, it 
           shakes the ashes off of itself and all over her; she sneezes.

           Luke sleeps in back as the girls talk, catching up on years. 
           END MONTAGE.

           INT. CAR. - DAY

           They drive through Atlanta. Nora in the driver’s seat.
                                 JADE
                        Fulton Ave. I’m betting it’s 
                        another park. Fulton. Sounds like 
                        an Avenue that’d have a park on it.

           They arrive at an extremely low income apartment complex. It 
           looks like the kind of place drug deals and murders occur.

                                 NORA 
                        Well. Not a park.

           INT. JEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING.

           The trio wait at the door, a sign on the door says “No 
           Pissing or Shitting. People Live here.” Jade rings the 
           doorbell. Silence. A voice is heard, heavy southern accent.

                                 JEN (O.S.) 
                        Who is it?

                                 JADE
                        Um... we’re friends of Mary Shine?

           Beat. Multiple locks are undone. Door opens but the chain is 
           left hooked, just enough to show the worn face of JEN, 35.

                                 JEN
                        You come for that lunatic’s shit?

           INT. JEN’S APARTMENT. - MOMENTS LATER

           A filthy shithole. Jen, smoking a cigarette, pulls an old 
           trunk out of the closet. The group kneels and begins looking 
           through it. Jade pulls out a picture of Mary.

                                 JEN
                        There’s nothing valuable in there.
                             (to Luke)
                        I didn’t know she had a brother.

                                 LUKE 
                        It’s complicated.

                                 JEN
                        Yeah, I bet. You preppy kids, you
                        got some interesting problems.

                                 NORA
                        So were you guys friends?

                                 JEN
                        No. Just roommates. 
           An obese man walks by in his underwear, scratching his balls.

                                 JEN (CONT’D) 
                        That’s Mark.

           Luke pulls out a picture of Mary with ANNA, 6 years old.

                                 LUKE
                        Who is this? Her daughter?

                                 JEN
                        Mary’s? Christ, you really didn’t 
                        know shit about her anymore did 
                        you? Mary didn’t have a kid. That’s 
                        Anna. The immigrant’s daughter.

                                 NORA
                        What are you talking about? What 
                        immigrant?

           Jen digs until she finds a photo of SONYA, 26, and Mary.

                                 JEN
                        Sonya. Mexican. Mary’s only friend.

                                 JADE
                        I hate the name Sonya.

                                 JEN
                        Mary said they had to stay with her 
                        for awhile, made up some bullshit 
                        about an abusive husband. I thought 
                        it was weird, I ignored it at 
                        first, cause they paid rent on 
                        time. Mary made pretty decent money 
                        bartending. But finally I figured 
                        out they were illegal immigrants. 
                        Apparently Mary’d been letting ‘em 
                        tag along with her for two years.

                                 NORA
                        What happened to them?

                                 JEN
                        Well they got arrested. I had to 
                        call the police.
                             (off their looks)
                        It’s not like Mary got in trouble 
                        for it, Mary got off fine - Sonya 
                        claimed Mary didn’t know they were 
                        illegal - I’m sure she did. But 
                        Sonya got deported, they took her 
                        ass straight to jail.

                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        Turns out she was wanted in Mexico 
                        for all kinds of shit. Mostly 
                        stealing stuff.

                                 NORA
                        Where’s the little girl?

                                 JEN
                        Anna, yeah, that’s the only part i 
                        felt bad about.
                        Last I heard she ended up in some 
                        kid’s home in Mexico City - called 
                        House of the Hope. Mary was real 
                        upset about it. 

           Jade, Luke and Nora stare at the pictures of Mary with Sonya 
           and Anna, growing sadder.

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        She threw a real fit after the 
                        police came. Smashed a window, had 
                        to kick her ass out.

                                 NORA
                        How long ago was that?

                                 JEN
                        Eight months? I dunno.

                                 NORA
                        And you don’t know where she went?

           Jen shrugs, lights a cigarette. Luke stares her down.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re a piece of shit, you know 
                        that, right? You white trash-

                                 JEN
                        You wanna talk to me like that you 
                        can get the fuck out of my house -

                                 NORA
                        Wait. Everyone just stop. 
                             (to Jen)
                        Where can we spread the ashes? This 
                        is important to us. Please.

           After an angry moment Jen opens the window curtain, points to 
           an enormous tree.

                                 JEN
                        She carved her name all over that
                        fucking tree.
           INT. CAR - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.

           They drive in silence, sickened from what they’ve just seen, 
           the previously happy road trip now darkened.

           Jade digs through MARY’S TRUNK in the backseat, Luke lights a 
           cigarette, turns the music loud, the air thick with tension.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. ALEX’S STUDIO.

           Jade waits. Alex enters from a back room door.

                                 ALEX
                        Sorry I’ve kept you waiting.

           Alex begins setting up his camera. Mary enters from the same 
           back door, buttoning her shirt, walks over to a stunned Jade.

                                 MARY
                        Don’t make that face.

                                 JADE 
                        He’s thirty-five.

                                 MARY
                             (a grin)
                        I know. Don’t tell anyone.
                             (heading out door)
                        Call me when you’re back in Rye!

           Door shuts behind Mary. Jade looks to Alex, she knows this 
           isn’t right. He’s fidgeting with his camera - unfazed.

                                 ALEX
                        I wanted to ask you, Jade- I’d like
                        to use you in a campaign I’m doing. 
                        French designer, I showed her your 
                        pictures. It should be pretty big.

           Jade’s taken off guard, torn between her discomfort with what 
           just happened and this new opportunity. Alex notices, amused.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        You upset about something?

                                 JADE
                             (a pause, makes up mind)
                        No. I’m good. I’d love to do it. 
                        Thank you for the opportunity.
           EXT. RYE JUNGLE GYM. - COUPLE DAYS LATER

           Mary rolls a joint while Nora studies a magazine photo of 
           Jade. Next to them Mary has carved “Mary is a Roman Goddess” 
           into the wood. Mary offers joint to Nora. Nora shakes head.

                                 NORA
                        I get really weird when I smoke.

                                 MARY 
                        That’s the point.

           Nora finally smokes the joint, coughs hard. Mary leans back, 
           revealing a huge bruise on her thigh, Nora stares.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, it’s a sexy bruise.

                                 NORA
                        From who?

                                 MARY
                        My imaginary friend. Top secret.

           A WOMAN calls to them from the sidewalk.

                                 WOMAN
                        You know, this playground is
                        supposed to be for the children.

                                 MARY 
                        We are children!

           The woman walks off, annoyed. Mary laughs. Nora is very high.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck is Jade anyway? She
                        hasn’t answered any of my texts.

                                 NORA
                        You check your brother’s bedroom?

           Mary’s head shoots towards Nora, who’s immediately regretful.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHINE’S HOUSE. - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary’s car screeches to a stop in front of house. Mary storms 
           out, Nora stays in the passenger seat, stoned.
           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM.

           Luke and Jade make out, half dressed. Mary bursts in, groans.

                                 MARY
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

           EXT. SHINE’S HOUSE. - MOMENTS LATER

           Nora sits in the car, very stoned, not feeling well. Mary 
           bursts out of house, pissed. She gets in the car and starts 
           it. Jade runs outside after her, buttoning her shirt.

                                 JADE
                        Mary wait! I’m sorry!

           Mary drives. Around the corner she stops, banging the wheel.

                                 MARY
                        Those creeps! This is going to ruin
                        everything!

           Nora’s having a reaction to the pot, looks ill. Mary notices.

                                 MARY (CONT’D) 
                        Are you okay?

                                 NORA
                        My heart... it’s going really fast.

           Nora puts her head between her knees. Mary softens.

                                 MARY
                        Shhh... You’re fine. You’re just 
                        panicking because you’re high.

           Nora breathes heavily, Mary rubs her back.

           A little while later- Mary drives, Nora eats fast food, 
           feeling better. They pass a house where a party’s going on.

                                 MARY (CONT’D) 
                        Tim’s having a party.

           Mary begins to park her car. Nora looks at her, surprised.

                                 MARY (CONT’D) 
                        Let’s get fucked.
           INT. TIM’S HOUSE.

           Mary and Nora enter. A drunk guy stumbles into Mary, grabbing 
           at her. Mary punches him, he falls to the ground.

                                 NORA
                        You know how to make an entrance.

                                 MARY
                        That’s what it’s all about.
                        Entrance-ing and exiting.

                                 NORA
                        You just said “entrance-ing.”

                                 MARY 
                        Exactly.

           Moments later in the kitchen, Mary pours shots. She hands one 
           to Nora, who hesitates. Mary grabs Nora’s face and forces the 
           shot down her throat. Tim enters.

                                 TIM
                        Nora. You came.

                                 NORA 
                        Yeah.

                                 TIM
                        Hey Mary.

                                 MARY
                        Hi. I’m having a nervous breakdown.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I’ve heard that about you.

           Later, the girls play beer pong against Tim and his friend. 
           The girls lose, have to chug their beers. Tim comes over, 
           rubs Nora’s shoulders. He is chatting her up, giving her 
           extra attention. Mary sees the flirting and sneaks away.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You look really pretty tonight.
                             (off Nora’s eye roll)
                        You do. Just take the compliment. 
                             (hands her a drink)
                        And take this. 

           Nora sips it, smiling.

           In the other room, Mary preaches to a group of teen boys.
                                 MARY
                        I’m not saying the government
                        planned 9/11, but they definitely 
                        knew it was going to happen. You 
                        guys ever hear of Raytheon?

           The group of boys stare mutely, all wasted and high. 

           Elsewhere, Tim pulls Nora into a bathroom, they make out.

                                 TIM
                        I’ve wanted to do this for so long.

                                 NORA 
                        Really?

           Back in the other room, Mary continues her preaching.

                                 MARY
                        You guys don’t think a plane
                        actually flew into the Pentagon, do 
                        you? Wake up! We’re puppets!

           The boys have stopped listening. Finally one speaks.

                                 BOY
                        You guys wanna take Jello shots?

           The group leaves Mary alone. She gets out her phone, dials.

                                 MARY
                        Hey. If I hurry I can catch the
                        last train into the city... want to 
                        do dirty things to me?

           Mary smiles, hangs up, starts gathering her stuff to go.

           In the bathroom, things are getting heated with Tim and Nora.

                                 NORA 
                        I’m too drunk. I should find Mary.

                                 TIM
                        Mary left. Let’s go upstairs. We
                        can sleep.

                                 NORA 
                        Just sleep?

                                 TIM
                        Sure.
           INT. TIM’S BEDROOM.

           They make out in bed, he pulls her underwear off.

                                 NORA 
                        Wait. I don’t know.

                                 TIM
                        Come on. You’ve been so cool 
                        tonight.

                                 NORA
                        I haven’t had sex before.

                                 TIM
                        That’s okay. I like you.

           They continue making out, he starts to put it in her.

                                 NORA
                        What about a condom?

                                 TIM
                        I’ve been tested. I’m fine.

                                 NORA 
                        But-

                                 TIM
                        I’ll pull out. I promise.

           Nora isn’t sure but they keep making out, he puts it inside 
           her, she grimaces in pain, but they keep going.

           EXT. TIM’S HOUSE.

           Mary’s leaving, has been looking for Nora. A Girl passes by.

                                 MARY 
                        Have you seen Nora?

           Girl shakes her head. Mary gives up, heads towards her car.

           INT. TIM’S BEDROOM.

           They continue having sex, Nora is drunk and in pain. Tim 
           starts to finish, he pulls out. He rolls over. Silence.

                                 TIM
                        I’ll get you a towel.

           Tim gets up, goes to bathroom. Nora covers face with hands.
           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - NEXT MORNING

           Jade sleeps. Her cell rings. She answers.

                                 JADE 
                        Hello?

                                                          INTERCUT WITH

           INT. ALEX’S STUDIO. 

           Alex is on phone. In the background we hear Mary’s tantrum.

                                 ALEX
                        You gotta come get your friend.

           Mary is heard screaming in the background, something crashes. 
           Back in her bedroom, Jade sighs, begins getting out of bed.

           INT. ALEX’S STUDIO. - LITTLE WHILE LATER.

           Alex talks outside locked bathroom door to a sobbing Mary.

                                 ALEX
                        Are you done with your tantrum yet? 
                        You’re not sexy when you act like 
                        this. 

                                 MARY (O.C.)
                        I hate you. Leave me alone.

                                 ALEX
                        I would gladly, but that’s MY 
                        bathroom you’ve locked yourself in.

           The doorbell rings, Alex answers it, it’s Jade.

                                 JADE 
                        What happened?

                                 ALEX
                        I don’t know. We had a fight. But 
                        do you know how fucked up she is?

           Jade pushes past him, blowing him off, goes to bathroom door.

                                 JADE
                        Babe, it’s me. Let’s go home.

                                 MARY (O.C.)
                        Oh Christ. YOU go home!
                                 JADE
                        I’m sorry I lied, okay? I love you.

                                 MARY (O.C.)
                        You just care about Luke.

                                 JADE
                        Mary, you’re the closest person to 
                        me. Please, let’s go home and talk.

           Beat. Mary opens the door, she’s a mess. On the inside of the 
           bathroom door is carved “Mary hates you.”

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - FEW HOURS LATER.

           Mary lays on the bed, she has calmed. Jade sits.

                                 JADE
                        It doesn’t have to change anything.

                                 MARY
                        It’ll change everything. I promise.
                             (silence)
                        Just... don’t choose him over me.

                                 JADE 
                        I would never.
                        (beat, plays with Mary’s hair)
                        I’ve been thinking. I want to see 
                        where this modeling thing goes.  
                        Will you move to the city with me 
                        after graduation? I can model, you 
                        can save the world? 

           A pause, then Mary slowly smiles, delighted by this idea.

                                 MARY
                        I can’t imagine anything better.

           They smile for a moment. Then Jade gets serious again.

                                 JADE
                        Do you and Alex always fight like 
                        that?
                             (silence)
                        Maybe you should stop seeing him.

                                 MARY
                        Whatever. It’s not a big deal.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:
           INT. CAR. - EVENING

           Nora wakes to Luke driving, Jade going through Mary’s trunk.

                                 LUKE
                        We’re ten hours to New York.
                        We should stop for the night soon. 

           Jade is reading a letter from the trunk.

                                 JADE
                        What the fuck? Stop the car.

                                 LUKE 
                        What? Why?

                                 JADE
                        STOP THE FUCKING CAR!

           He pulls over. Nora and Luke watch confusedly as Jade gets 
           out of the car, opens Luke’s door and shoves envelope at him.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell does this mean?!

           Luke looks at paper, an expression of “Oh fuck” dawning.

                                 NORA 
                        What is it?

                                 JADE 
                        Ask Luke!

           Nora has grabbed the envelope. It is addressed to Mary’s 
           Atlanta address, the return address is Luke’s in LA.

                                 LUKE
                        I can explain. Calm down.

                                 JADE
                        (smacking him repeatedly)
                        You ass! You knew where she was?!

                                 LUKE
                        No, it wasn’t like that-

                                 NORA 
                             (reading the letter)
                        “Mary, I hope you’re okay and that 
                        this helps. I’ll send more next 
                        month. If you need anything else 
                        let me know.”
                             (looking up)
                        You were sending her money?
                                 LUKE
                        Only a couple times.

                                 JADE
                        You said you didn’t know where she
                        was.

                                 LUKE
                        I didn’t. She didn’t reach out 
                        until a year ago - I didn’t know 
                        where she was before or after that.

                                 JADE
                        Why didn’t you tell me? I had so 
                        much I still needed to say to her!

                                 LUKE
                        You and I weren’t speaking, 
                        remember? And Mary didn’t want to 
                        see any of us.

                                 JADE
                        You were just too big a pussy to 
                        deal with it! Never do things based 
                        on other people’s emotions, right?

           Suddenly sirens are heard, they look up to see a cop car 
           pulling up to them. An officer gets out.

                                 LUKE 
                        Oh perfect.
                             (to the cop)
                        We’re fine, officer - we were just-

                                 OFFICER
                        Everyone out- hands over your head!

                                 NORA
                        Oh, sir, it’s really nothing, we-

                                 OFFICER
                        I said everyone out! Right now!

           They get out, confused. The officer gets out a walkie talkie.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Hands up! 
                        (into walkie) 
                        Need back up on Grove - we’re gonna 
                        be tearing some assholes tonight.

                                 LUKE
                        Sorry, whose assholes are we 
                        tearing?!
                                 OFFICER 
                        Hands over your head!

           They put their hands up, the Officer begins handcuffing Luke.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        You’re under arrest for grand
                        theft auto -

           The group bursts into confused protests.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        You have the right to remain silent-

           INT. JAIL CELL.

           Nora and Jade are led into a jail cell, both pissed. The 
           guard closes the cell. They sit in silence. Finally -

                                 JADE
                        Remember when we were impressive?

           They each stare ahead silently.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE NORA’S HOUSE. - DAY

           Nora walks home in uniform. At doorstep she sees a PACKET 
           FROM STANFORD. She freezes then tears into it, reads-

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE SHINE HOUSE. - MOMENTS LATER

           Nora sprints ecstatically to the Shine’s door, rings the 
           doorbell. Luke answers-his face similarly ecstatic - they hug 
           each other joyfully. From inside we hear Mr. Shine.

                                 MR. SHINE (O.C.)
                        Is that Nora? Tell her to come in!

                                 LUKE
                        They’re opening up champagne.

           Mary appears in the doorway. She gives Nora a weak smile.

                                 MARY
                        Congratulations.

           Mary starts to leave past Nora as Luke goes back inside, 
           laughing with his parents. Nora follows Mary back outside.
                                 NORA
                        Hey, where are you going?

                                 MARY 
                        The city.

                                 NORA
                        You’re not celebrating?

                                 MARY
                        It’s not my celebration.

                                 NORA
                        Why do you keep going to the city
                        alone? What are you doing there?

                                 MARY
                        Don’t worry about it. Go have
                        champagne with my family.

           Mary leaves Nora alone with the Shines’ celebratory laughter.

           INT. ALEX’S STUDIO. - THAT EVENING

           Mary’s naked, wrapped in sheets. She’s very sad. Alex 
           photographs her.

                                 MARY
                        I’m sad, Alex. I don’t like 
                        watching my friends grow up.

           Camera in hand, Alex pulls her to him, reaching under the 
           sheets to touch her. They kiss. He’s rough, grabbing her 
           throat and hair. Normally she’d like it, but not right now. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s be nice to each other this 
                        time.

           He’s still rough. They keep kissing. Finally he pulls away, 
           takes more photos.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Jade painted me like this once,
                        naked but wrapped in a sheet.

                                 ALEX
                        Guess we’ll have to be more
                        creative then. Take the sheet off.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:
           INT. JAIL CELL. - NIGHT

           Time has passed. Nora and Jade sleep, Jade’s hands cover her 
           crotch. A guard opens the cell, waking them.

                                 GUARD
                        You two. You’re out.

           EXT. JAIL. - A HALF HOUR LATER

           Jade, Luke, Nora stand with their luggage but no car. Luke 
           smokes.

                                 LUKE
                        Of course he dropped the charges.
                        He just wanted the ashes.

                                 NORA 
                        Which are where?

                                 LUKE
                        With the car, in police custody.

                                 JADE
                        This is bullshit. What do we do
                        now? How are we getting home?

           A taxi pulls up. They begin loading their stuff into it.

                                 LUKE
                        I’ll drop you guys at the hotel and 
                        go rent a car. When we’re home I’ll 
                        talk to my dad about the ashes.

                                 JADE
                        Your dad. What a gem. I miss him.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM. - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jade sits on the bed, Nora exits from the bathroom.

                                 JADE
                        What about the last spot in Rye?
                        That’s the most important one.

           There’s a knock on the slightly open door, Luke enters.

                                 LUKE
                        I got a rental car for tomorrow.

           Jade gathers her purse, heading to the door.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D) 
                        Where are you going?

                                 JADE
                        The bar downstairs. You’re not 
                        invited.

           Jade exits haughtily. Luke sits on the bed.

                                 LUKE
                        You want to yell at me too?

           Nora is silent, she sits next to him.

                                 NORA
                        Why didn’t you tell anyone you
                        heard from her?

                                 LUKE
                        I didn’t know how much trouble she
                        was in.

           Nora says nothing, they both know this isn’t a very good 
           excuse.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Mary chose to cut us off. I chose
                        to respect that.

                                 NORA 
                        Why?

                                 LUKE
                        I didn’t know it was going to be a
                        forever thing.

           He sighs, putting his head in his hands. 

                                 NORA 
                             (softening)
                        Hey... it’s okay.

                                 LUKE
                        Those people that say they look
                        back on mistakes and wouldn’t 
                        change anything, because they 
                        learned from all of it - I never 
                        know if they’re lying or if my 
                        mistakes are just worse than 
                        theirs. Because I’d change a lot.

                                 NORA
                        Luke, those people are obviously
                        full of shit. 
           Silence.

                                 LUKE
                        I know it wasn’t Mary’s fault, but
                        worrying about her got really 
                        exhausting.
                             (beat)
                        I’m not a good person.

                                 NORA 
                        Yes you are.

           Nora hugs him, rubbing his back. Finally they pull apart, 
           looking each other in the eyes. The stare is full of emotion. 
           Finally Nora kisses him. The kiss is returned, continues for 
           several moments until Nora finally pulls away.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LUKE
                        No, it’s okay-

           Nora hurries into the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM. - CONTINUOUS

           Nora breathes heavily, leaning on the counter, overcome by 
           the moment. She stares in the mirror.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. RYE SIDEWALK. - DAY

           Nora and Jade window shop. Jade takes a prescription pill. 
           Nora notices, says nothing. Jade’s phone rings, it’s Luke.

                                 JADE 
                        Hello?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. SHINE’S KITCHEN. 

           Luke on the phone, Mr. and Mrs Shine watch him like hawks.

                                 LUKE
                        Do you know where Mary is? She
                        hasn’t been home in three days.
           EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX’S NYC STUDIO. - SAME DAY

           Nora, Jade and Luke hurry down the sidewalk, Luke is livid.

                                 LUKE
                        So this is where Mary’s been 
                        disappearing to for the past three 
                        months? Why didn’t you tell us?

                                 JADE
                        She’s allowed to have secrets.

           They ring the doorbell. Alex answers.

                                 ALEX
                        Okay guys, we can all calm down-

           Luke shoves him -

                                 LUKE 
                        You’re disgusting -

           Alex puts his hand to Luke’s chest, stopping him.

                                 ALEX
                        You don’t wanna mess with me, kid.

           Mary has appeared at the door, dressed and ready to go.

                                 MARY
                        Let’s play nice. I’m coming home.

           She kisses Alex goodbye, Luke is seething. Alex is amused.

                                 ALEX
                        You need to calm this asshole down,
                        he’s about to have a seizure.

           Luke goes towards Alex, Jade grabs Luke, stopping him.

                                 NORA 
                        Mary let’s go.

           Mary kisses Alex goodbye again, he shuts the door. Mary 
           starts off down the street.

                                 MARY
                        So what, it’s me versus you guys
                        now?

           As Mary hurries ahead of them, Luke glares at Jade.

                                 JADE
                        This is not my fault.
                                 LUKE 
                        He’s your friend.

                                 JADE
                        No. I work with him.

                                 LUKE
                        So it’s your career you’re thinking
                        about when you let him fuck with my 
                        sister?

           Jade glares at him, then storms off after Mary.

           EXT. RYE SIDEWALK. - THAT EVENING

           Nora and Luke walk, Luke drinks beer hidden in a paper bag.

                                 LUKE
                        Fuck Jade. And Mary. I’m so sick of
                        her shit. It’s always something.

                                 NORA
                        I think she’s really unhappy.

                                 LUKE
                        Maybe. But I bet she’d feel a lot 
                        better if I was unhappy too.

           Suddenly Tim and a group of boys pass, going into the diner. 
           Nora looks away, Tim gives her an unsettling look. His 
           friends laugh as they go inside. Nora is clearly upset.

                                 NORA
                        Can we go somewhere else?

                                 LUKE 
                        What was that?

           Nora sits on a bench, puts her head in her hands.

                                 NORA
                        I let something stupid happen.

                                 LUKE 
                        What? Tell me.

           INT. DINER. - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim and his friends eat. Suddenly Luke enters angrily.

                                 TIM
                        Yo, Luke, what’s -
           Luke punches Tim solidly in the face, commotion follows.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM. - LATER THAT EVENING

           Luke drinks whiskey, black eye and bloody lip, but happy. 
           Nora presses a cold compress to him.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s fine, it really doesn’t hurt.

                                 NORA
                        That’s because you’re drunk. It
                        will when you sober up.

                                 LUKE
                        Then I guess I should keep
                        drinking.

           He drinks. Hands her the whiskey, she sips.

           A little later. They’re drunk, curled up on bed watching TV.

                                 NORA
                        Am I going to be the only person at
                        Stanford who’s never had good sex?

                                 LUKE
                        I doubt half the people at Stanford
                        have had any sex.
                             (beat)
                        I should sew his balls to his dick.

                                 NORA 
                        That’s really gross.
                             (beat)
                        I just didn’t think that’s how my 
                        first time would be.

                                 LUKE
                        First times usually suck.

                                 NORA
                        I know. Still. I kind of figured
                        there’d be like... some romance 
                        and... you know. Unicorns.

                                 LUKE
                        You thought you’d lose your
                        virginity to a unicorn?

                                 NORA
                        No. But I assumed there’d be one
                        present.
           They smile. Luke puts his arm around Nora.

           Later, Nora sleeps on Luke’s chest. He sips the whiskey, 
           watches TV. She wakes. They look at each other, something is 
           different.

                                 LUKE 
                        Hey.

                                 NORA 
                        Hello.

           Awkward laughter, then silence, they’re locked in a stare. 
           Finally they kiss. After a moment they pull away, surprised, 
           then keep kissing, intensity building. She climbs on top of 
           him, still kissing. She unbuttons his pants, he stops her.

                                 LUKE
                        Wait. This is a bad idea.

                                 NORA 
                        No it’s not.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, this is a terrible idea.

                                 NORA
                        You care about me, right?

                                 LUKE 
                        Of course.

                                 NORA
                        Then it’s fine. I promise.

           Nora kisses him, after a moment he begins kissing her back.

           Next morning - Nora sleeps, Luke smokes at window, she wakes.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know you smoked now.

                                 LUKE
                        Just once in a while.

           Silence. Luke puts his cigarette out, sits by her.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D) 
                        I feel really shitty.

                                 NORA 
                        Don’t. I wanted to.
                                 LUKE
                        I don’t want to be like Tim.

                                 NORA
                        You could never be like Tim.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not an asshole. I really don’t
                        think I am.

                                 NORA
                        Nothing changes. We’re still best
                        friends.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m still, you know...with Jade. 

                                 NORA
                             (hiding her feelings)
                        I know. She doesn’t have to
                        know about this.
                             (beat)
                        And who knows what’ll happen, 
                        right? When you and I are at 
                        Stanford together.

           Luke’s distracted by nerves, doesn’t register her comment.

                                 LUKE
                             Right, yeah.

           Nora watches him. Music starts, Pink Floyd “Summer ‘68,” 
           continues into-

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY.

           Nora shuts her locker. Down the hall she sees Luke and Jade 
           reconciling. They kiss. Luke notices Nora, they share an 
           awkward smile before Nora turns away. As she walks stoically 
           down the hall the music builds, when lyrics start we cut to -

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           Nora stares in the mirror of the hotel bathroom as we left 
           her before. Music montage continues as we see -

           Luke pacing in the hotel room.

           Jade downs a drink in the hotel bar.

           Nora stares in bathroom mirror, makes up her mind, exits into-
           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM.

           Luke stops pacing as Nora enters. They stare at each other.

                                 LUKE 
                        Tell me what to do.

           Beat. Nora goes to him in a passionate kiss, he kisses her 
           back, they stumble onto the bed, undressing each other.

           Montage continues with Jade drinking, cut between that and 
           Nora and Luke having sex.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM. - COUPLE HOURS LATER

           Luke and Nora in bed. He stares at the ceiling.

                                 LUKE
                        Mary used to say I wouldn’t have
                        loved her if she weren’t my sister.

                                 NORA 
                        Would you have?

                                 LUKE
                        It doesn’t really matter. She was
                        my sister.
                             (beat)
                        Guess I should go back to my room.

                                 NORA
                        Yeah. That’s probably wise.

           Luke puts his clothes on, Nora watches.

           Later that night, Nora is asleep, Jade stumbles into the 
           room. Nora wakes, but pretends not to. Jade whispers.

                                 JADE
                        You awake? I’m not mad anymore...

           Nora’s silent. Jade undresses and gets into her own bed.

           INT. LUKE’S HOTEL ROOM. - THE NEXT MORNING.

           Luke sleeps. A knock on door wakes him. He groggily goes to 
           door, opens it. It’s Jade and Nora. A pause, he’s scared.

                                 JADE
                        I came to make peace.
           Jade walks into the room past him, Luke and Nora exchange a 
           look before following Jade inside.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        I overreacted. I still think you 
                        should’ve told me where Mary was 
                        but, I know you and I weren’t 
                        speaking and... it’s not like you 
                        knew where she was the whole time. 
                        Anyway. I think we should be able 
                        to drive home without any drama.

           Luke and Nora nod eagerly.

                           NORA 
           Yeah. I agree. 
                                                          LUKE
                                              Definitely. Completely agree.

           Jade hears music coming from outside.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Is that coming from the hotel?

                                 NORA
                        There’s some party going on.

                                 JADE
                        I could do a daytime fiesta before
                        we head out. I’m gonna go brush my 
                        teeth, then let’s go down there.

           Jade exits, Nora and Luke exchange a look. Nora follows Jade.

           INT. BATHROOM. - FEW MINUTES LATER

           Jade brushes her teeth as Nora gets dressed in other room.

           Jade wipes mouth with a napkin, tosses it in the trash. 
           Suddenly her eyes fall on something in the trash; a condom 
           wrapper. Jade leans down, picks it up. Stares, dumbfounded.

                                 NORA (O.C.) 
                        I’m ready to go. Are you?

           Jade stares at the wrapper, no idea what to think.

                                 JADE
                        I’m gonna be a few. Go ahead.

           The door is heard closing as Nora leaves. Jade sits down on 
           closed toilet seat, the wheels in her head turning rapidly.
           EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD. - MOMENTS LATER

           Luke sits at a table. Nora enters, sees him and heads over.

           INT. BATHROOM. 

           Jade is still sitting, thinking this over. She finally stands 
           up, a look of fierce determination on her face. She stares in 
           the mirror, has decided on a plan.

           Montage music as Jade gets ready - dolling herself up to the 
           max; Squeezing into a tiny minidress. Propping her boobs up 
           obscenely. Putting bright lipstick on. Finally she stares at 
           the finished product - she’s ready. Music continues as-

           EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD.

           Nora and Luke sit innocently at a table. Jade appears across 
           the courtyard - a VISION. She struts towards Luke and Nora, 
           both a bit surprised by her appearance. She sits with them.

                                 NORA
                        Wow, Jade, you look-

                                 JADE
                        (grabbing a drink in front of her)
                        Is this for me?

                                 NORA
                        Oh, no, it’s mine actually-

           Jade is already drinking it quickly.

                                 NORA (CONT’D) 
                        That’s cool though.
                        (flagging down a waitress) 
                        Can I have another vodka soda?

                                 JADE
                        Two more. And a shot of tequila.

           Waitress leaves, Jade finishes drink as the other two stare.

                                 JADE (CONT’D) 
                        Lets dance!

           Jade jumps up, pulls a very confused Luke to his feet.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t mind, do you Nora?
           Jade pulls Luke into a dance, she is crazy and overly sexual, 
           Nora watches uncomfortably.

           Montage of partying continues, Jade gets drunker and drunker, 
           and flirtier with Luke. Nora grows more and more annoyed.

           Jade dances provocatively around Luke. 

           Jade takes a shot, handing Nora her bra.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Will you watch this for a minute?

           Jade continues the act. Luke’s like a confused monkey pulled 
           between his attraction to Jade and desire to not anger Nora.

           Finally Jade slow dances, leaning against Luke sweetly, he 
           looks incredibly confused. Nora’s had enough, she storms out.

                                 LUKE
                        Fuck...

           Montage music ends as Luke follows Nora inside into -

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY. - CONTINUOUS

           Nora is pacing angrily. Luke approaches her.

                                 LUKE 
                        Nora, she’s drunk-

                                 NORA 
                        Don’t touch me.

                                 LUKE
                        What did you want me to do?

           Jade has entered, approaches them. She is pissed but calm.

                                 JADE
                        Obviously there’s something the 
                        three of us need to talk about.

           Terrible silence, CUT TO -

           INT. HOTEL ROOM. - MOMENTS LATER

           Jade is furiously throwing her shit in a bag while Luke and 
           Nora watch.

                                 LUKE
                        Jade, please-
                                 JADE
                        Fuck off. You both disgust me.
                             (to Nora)
                        You know, I’d expect this from
                        Luke, but not you.

                                 NORA
                        I’m sorry, Jade, I don’t-

                                 JADE
                        You can have him. I’ve been done
                        with him for years.

                                 LUKE
                        So just to clarify - were you
                        faking out there? With the dancing?

                                 JADE / NORA
                        SHUT UP! 

                                 JADE
                        I’m getting a flight home.

                                 LUKE
                        Jade, it didn’t mean anything.

           Nora is stung by this, Luke doesn’t notice.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        We were upset, and sometimes
                        when you’re emotional and - there’s 
                        someone there that you’ve already 
                        slept with before...

                                 JADE
                        What do you mean “before?”

           Luke realizes his huge mistake.

                                 JADE (CONT’D) 
                        This wasn’t the first time?

           Beat, they try to cover it but it’s too late.

                           LUKE
                                                          NORA
           No, of course it was -
                                              That’s not what he meant-

                                 JADE (CONT’D) 
                        THIS WASN’T THE FIRST TIME?!

           Deafening silence. Jade is seething with rage.
                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        When.

           Silence. Luke finally speaks.

                                 LUKE
                        Senior year. Just once. When you
                        and I were in a fight.

           Jade is silent, she looks at Nora, crushed and hurt.

                                 JADE
                        I’ve never done anything to hurt
                        you.

                                 NORA
                        I’m so sorry, Jade. I -

                                 JADE
                        You’ve always resented me.

                                 NORA 
                        That’s not true.

                                 JADE
                        And judged me. You’ve never taken
                        me seriously.

                                 NORA 
                        Yes I have - I do.

                                 JADE
                        No. Mary was the only one who ever
                        took me seriously. She was  
                        whatever she was- but she’d never 
                        do something so shitty to a friend.

                                 NORA
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 JADE
                        That’s because there is nothing to
                        say.

           Jade picks up her bag, leaves. Nora and Luke are left alone.

           INT. RENTAL CAR. - FEW HOURS LATER.

           Luke drives, Nora in passenger. They ride in tense silence.

                                 NORA
                        How many hours to New York?
                                 LUKE 
                        Seven.

                                 NORA 
                        Let’s not stop.

           Beat.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m sorry shit fell apart.

                                 NORA 
                        Which time?

           Silence. They drive.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. SPRINGTIME, DAY.

           Mary sits alone on the hallway floor in her graduation cap 
           and gown, happy voices seeping in from the outside.

           EXT. RYE HIGH SCHOOL. SAME DAY.

           Everyone in caps and gowns. Jade, Luke, Nora and their 
           parents mingle. Nora looks uneasy.

           INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM. - SAME DAY

           Nora vomits into the toilet. She flushes, leaves the stall, 
           is startled when she sees Mary standing there.

                                 MARY
                        Yum.

           Nora goes to sink and starts washing her hands; feeling sick.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have a tampon, do you?

           As Nora shakes her head, something begins to dawn on her.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 NORA
                        How long ago was Tim’s party?

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know. Like December?
           A look of horror is spreading across Nora’s face.

           INT. SUPERMARKET. - AN HOUR LATER

           Nora, still in her cap and gown, hurries frantically down the 
           aisle, stopping at the pregnancy tests.

           INT. NORA’S BEDROOM. - THAT EVENING.

           Jade and Nora sit silently on the foot of the bed. The 
           absolute worst has happened. Finally Jade speaks.

                                 JADE
                        I can get the money from my mom.
                        We’ll fix it - and you won’t ever 
                        have to think about it again.

           Nora nods, terrified.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Nora, we can erase this.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           EXT. AIRPORT. - DAY

           Jade arrives at the airport, struggling with her bags.

           INT. AIRPORT. - SAME DAY

           Jade stands in line at ticket counter, finally it’s her turn.

                                 JADE
                        One way to New York.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. EXAM ROOM. - DAY

           Nora, in hospital gown, listens to the DOCTOR. Jade sits in 
           the extra chair.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re carrying the baby higher 
                        behind your rib cage than usual, 
                        which explains why you might not 
                        have noticed a huge physical 
                        change, but why didn’t you talk to 
                        someone after missing your period?
                                 NORA
                        I’ve always been irregular. It 
                        didn’t even cross my mind. But I 
                        definitely want to... deal with it. 
                        I’m going to Stanford in the fall.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re well into the second 
                        trimester. An abortion at this 
                        stage is a very serious procedure. 
                        It’s not something I’ll perform, 
                        and I don’t know many reputable 
                        doctors who would, unless medically 
                        necessary.

           Silence. 

                                 NORA
                        I’m going to Stanford.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’m going to give you some 
                        information on late term abortions. 
                        You should know exactly what you’re 
                        doing here. 

           Little later, Nora reads pamphlets, horrified, Jade watches.

                                 JADE
                        Nora, this is propaganda. You’re in 
                        charge here.

           Nora keeps reading, growing more and more frightened.

           EXT. NYC.

           Luke strolls the street of NY. He passes Alex’s gallery, sees 
           something in the window that stops him. It’s a nude photo of 
           Mary, crude and demeaning. Luke stares in horror.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. RENTAL CAR. - DAY

           Luke and Nora stop at a stoplight. A couple in the car next 
           to them laughs loudly. The couple drives off. Silence.

                                 LUKE
                        Some people laugh too loud.
                             (silence)
                        Like Jade. I hate Jade’s laugh. I 
                        think she fakes it to piss me off. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                        Prove she’s having fun when I’m 
                        not.

                                 NORA
                        I don’t think she’s thinking about
                        you. I think that’s just how she 
                        laughs.
                             (silence)
                        Did Jade ever tell you I tried to 
                        get an abortion at first?

                                 LUKE
                             (uncomfortable)
                        No. She didn’t.
                             (beat)
                        She always said she thought it was 
                        really brave of you. Keeping it. 

                                 NORA
                        That’s just Jade being a good 
                        friend. She knows it was the 
                        complete opposite. 

                                 LUKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 NORA
                        I didn’t make the choice to have a 
                        kid, I just got scared out of the 
                        other option. I was acting out of 
                        fear, not “bravery.”

                                 LUKE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NORA.
                        Don’t be. Charlie’s fucking 
                        awesome. He’s the only good thing 
                        that came out of senior year.

           Silence. They stare straight ahead as they drive. 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. SHINE’S HOUSE. - DAY

           Mr. Shine reads paper. Luke bursts in, upset.

                                 LUKE
                        Dad. There’s a big problem.
           INT. MARY’S BEDROOM. - SAME DAY

           Mr. Shine tears through Mary’s things. Luke and Mrs. Shine 
           watch terrified. Jade’s paintings of Mary and Alex’s nude 
           photos are scattered around. Mary enters.

                                 MARY
                        What are you doing in here?!

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. AIRPORT. - DAY

           Jade waits for her plane. A guy sits next to her despite 
           plenty of empty seats. He smiles at her. She stares blankly.

                                 JADE
                        Lot of empty seats, dude.

           Beat. He moves to another seat. Jade slumps miserably.

           INT. RENTAL CAR. - SAME DAY

           Luke and Nora continue to drive.

                                 LUKE
                        I gotta admit, at the diner last
                        week, I was pretty relieved to see 
                        what blue eyes Charlie had.

                                 NORA 
                        Why?

                                 LUKE
                        Because. You and I have brown. No
                        way we could make a blue eyed kid. 

           Nora stares at him, after a moment he notices.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 NORA 
                        Pull over.  

                                 LUKE
                        Why? What did I say?

                                 NORA
                        Just pull the car over, please.

           Luke pulls over, confused.
                                 LUKE 
                        Are you okay?

                                 NORA
                        You thought Charlie might be yours?

                                 LUKE 
                        I was kidding.

                                 NORA
                        Kind of kidding or completely
                        kidding?

                                 LUKE
                        I didn’t think he was mine. But, I
                        mean, sure, I thought there might 
                        be the slightest possibility.

                                 NORA
                        Well he’s not. He’s Tim’s. One
                        hundred percent.

                                 LUKE
                        Ok. Good. 

           Silence. Nora’s slowly getting more heated but remains calm.

                                 NORA
                        If you thought that - why didn’t
                        you ask six years ago?

                                 LUKE
                        I figured if you’d wanted me to
                        know you would have told me. 

           Nora meditates on this. It grates on her.

                                 NORA
                        You thought I might be letting you
                        off the hook.
                             (silence)
                        And you would have let me do that?

           Beat. She gets out of car, starts walking. Luke follows her -

                                 LUKE
                        Nora! Where are you going?

           Nora stops and suddenly screams at the top of her lungs.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:
           INT. MARY’S BEDROOM.

           Back to previous confrontation between Shines and Mary.

                                 MR. SHINE
                        What the hell is this shit, Mary?

                                 MARY
                        Those pictures are private!

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Luke told us everything. Who the
                        fuck is this guy?! Jade introduced 
                        you to him?

                                 MARY
                        He’s an artist- I wouldn’t expect
                        you to understand anything about it-

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Artist? I didn’t think you could
                        possibly be this stupid. There are 
                        pictures of you up in Manhattan. In 
                        public. Did you know that?

           Mary has no response. Mrs. Shine rushes out - tearful.

                                 MR. SHINE (CONT’D) 
                        Jade’s not allowed in this house.

                                 LUKE
                        This isn’t Jade’s fault, Dad-

                                 MARY
                        How could you do this, Luke?

                                 MR. SHINE
                        Be grateful to him. What else do
                        you let this pervert do to you?

                                 MARY
                        I’m eighteen. It’s none of your
                        business!

                                 MR. SHINE
                        I don’t know how you turned out
                        this way, but it’s heartbreaking. 

           Mr. Shine exits, Mary rages against Luke.

                                 MARY
                        Get out of my fucking room!
                                 LUKE
                        Mary, please, you know I was-

                                 MARY
                        I DON’T RESPECT YOU, LUKE.

           Silence. Finally Luke leaves Mary alone, fuming.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           EXT. SIDE OF ROAD.

           Nora continues her road side tantrum, kicking at the ground.

                                 LUKE
                        What’s the matter with you?!

                                 NORA
                        You! You’re a fucking sociopath!
                        You would have let me go through 
                        that alone?

                                 LUKE
                        You just said Charlie wasn’t mine -

                                 NORA
                        But you thought he might be! And
                        you would have let me deal with it 
                        while you went off to California?
                             (beat)
                        Why did you sleep with me, Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        What do you mean? The same reason
                        you slept with me.

                                 NORA
                        How would you know what my reason
                        was?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not completely sure what we’re
                        talking about here.

                                 NORA
                        Why did you choose Stanford?

                                 LUKE 
                        Because it’s the best.

                                 NORA
                        It had nothing to do with the fact
                        that I was planning on going there?
                                 LUKE
                        I mean, of course, that was a plus.

                                 NORA
                        And if I had gone? If I hadn’t had
                        to stay in Rye instead?

                                 LUKE
                        What are you trying to get me to
                        say?

                                 NORA
                        I know it’s always been Jade. But
                        was there ever a time, even a short 
                        time, when you thought it might be 
                        me?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t know what you mean.

                                 NORA
                        If I’d gone to Stanford. If I
                        didn’t get pregnant. Would it’ve 
                        been different? Would we maybe...

           Silence.

                                 LUKE
                        I didn’t know you ever wanted that.

                                 NORA
                        Just tell me the truth. Yes or no?

           Beat, Luke doesn’t want to answer but does.

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t think so.

           Silence, a car passes them.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. NORA’S HOUSE IN RYE. - DAY

           Mary, a crying mess, runs down the sidewalk. She gets to 
           Nora’s house, rings bell.

           INT. NORA’S HOUSE. - SAME DAY

           Nora sits with David. She’s been crying, he’s furious, she’s 
           obviously just told him about the pregnancy. The doorbell 
           rings, Mary’s voice can be heard.
                                 MARY (O.S.) 
                        Nora, it’s Mary!

           Nora quietly goes to the door, Mary is a total wreck.

                                 MARY (CONT’D) 
                        Oh my god, Nora -

                                 NORA
                        Now’s not a good time, Mary.

                                 MARY
                        I need you, something happened-

                                 NORA
                             (coldly)
                        I can’t right now.

                                 MARY
                        What do you mean? Luke and my dad-

                                 NORA
                        I said I can’t deal with your shit
                        right now, Mary! Some of us have 
                        our own problems to worry about!

           Nora slams the door in Mary’s face. Mary’s stunned.

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - SAME DAY

           Jade listens in horror to Mr. Shine’s rant on her voicemail.

                                 MR. SHINE (V.O.)
                        You have humiliated my daughter. If
                        I ever find you in our home again 
                        I’ll call the police.

           The message ends. Suddenly her cell rings, it’s Luke.

                                 JADE
                        Luke! Your dad left me a message -

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. LUKE’S CAR.

                                 LUKE
                        Listen, it’s gonna be fine, but I 
                        can’t be here anymore - August is 
                        too far away. I’m done with my 
                        family’s bullshit - I’m leaving for 
                        California next week.
                                 JADE 
                        Next week?

                                 LUKE
                        And I think you should come. You 
                        can model in L.A too. And it’s only 
                        six hours from Stanford.

                                 JADE
                        But - a week is so soon. Mary and I 
                        have been planning on moving to 
                        Manhattan. She’d be so upset. 

                                 LUKE
                        You can’t make all your decisions
                        based on Mary’s emotions. We’ve 
                        been doing that forever.
                             (beat)
                        Do you want to be with me or not?

           Silence. This is killing Jade but she knows the answer.

           EXT. JADE’S HOUSE. - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary hurries down the sidewalk to Jade’s house. She’s an 
           absolute wreck. She rings the doorbell, Candy answers.

                                 MARY
                        Is Jade here?

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           EXT. SIDE OF ROAD.

           Nora and Luke stand silently.

                                 NORA
                        I’ve wasted so much regret on you.

                                 LUKE 
                        You’re killing me.

           Nora walks back to the car. Luke follows, getting mad.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        This is bullshit. You were the one
                        who came on to me, every time, 
                        “Luke, it’s okay, nothing changes.”

                                 NORA 
                        Stop it-
                                 LUKE
                        I was supposed to know you were
                        lying?

                                 NORA
                        You’re not allowed to be mean right
                        now! You’re not the one who’s hurt! 

           Silence. Nora gets back in the car, Luke does too.

                                 NORA (CONT’D) 
                        Drive me home.

                                 LUKE
                        No, I’m sorry, I want to talk about
                        this.

                                 NORA
                        I want to go home.

           Beat. Luke starts car again. He turns to her, about to speak-

                                 NORA (CONT’D) 
                        Just drive.

           They drive silently for a moment.

                                 LUKE
                        So we’re just gonna drive the rest
                        of the way in silence?

           Nora says nothing. So they drive, tense, furious silence.

           EXT. NYC.

           Jade has arrived in NY. Gets cab.

           EXT. NYC.

           Jade gets out of cab at Narcotics Anonymous Meeting.

           INT. NARCOTIC’S ANONYMOUS MEETING.

           The scene where we first met Jade. She is pissed and strung 
           the fuck out emotionally. She’s ready to rant.

                                 JADE
                        Hi. I’m an addict and my name’s
                        Jade.

           The group responds “Hi Jade.”
                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        I’m eight months clean, about ten
                        hours sober and I have some stuff I 
                        want to talk about.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM.

           Jade stares in the mirror, her modeling pictures frame her 
           face. Suddenly Mary bursts in.

                                 JADE 
                        Mary-

                                 MARY
                        You can never talk to Luke again.

                                 JADE 
                        Calm down -

                                 MARY
                        My parents won’t talk to me - I’m
                        so humiliated.

           Mary sits, puts her head in her hands, crying. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know Alex was going to put
                        those anywhere public.

                                 JADE
                        I know. He’s a fucking creep.

                                 MARY
                        Luke didn’t have to tell our dad.

                                 JADE
                        He was just worried about you.

                                 MARY
                        Are you on my side or his?

                                 JADE
                        I’m on both of your sides.

                                 MARY 
                        That’s impossible.
                             (beat)
                        Let’s move to the city now. 
                        School’s over. Why are we still 
                        here?
           Jade struggles, not knowing how to answer this.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Please. This place is gonna kill 
                        me.

                                 JADE 
                        I can’t.

                                 MARY 
                        What do you mean? Why not?

           Silence.

                                 JADE
                        I told Luke I’d go to California.

           Beat. This hits Mary like a dagger.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        There’s more work out there for me -
                        more commercial stuff- I’m not as 
                        editorial as the New York girls -

                                 MARY
                        You promised you wouldn’t choose
                        him over me.

                                 JADE 
                        I’m not.

                                 MARY
                        What do you call this?

                                 JADE
                        I’ll still be here all the time.
                             (beat)
                        He’s my boyfriend. 

           Mary starts to leave-

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Mary. This doesn’t have
                        to be a big thing. 

           Mary turns on her.

                                 MARY
                        I really need you right now, Jade. 
                        I’m not doing well. Please?

           Jade is silent, she can’t change her mind.
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Fine then.

           Mary leaves Jade alone.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. RENTAL CAR. - EVENING

           Luke drives, Nora sleeps as they drive into Rye. Nora wakes, 
           realizing they’re home. As they’re stopped at a light she 
           reaches behind her, grabbing her bag, gets out of the car.

                                 LUKE 
                        What are you doing?

                                 NORA
                        I can walk the rest of the way.

                                 LUKE
                        Come on, Nora. At least let me
                        drive you home.

                                 NORA
                        I am home. I still live here.

           Nora walks off as Luke watches from the car.

           INT. NARCOTIC’S ANONYMOUS MEETING. - SAME DAY

           Jade has come to a pause in her story, everyone watches her.

                                 JADE
                        Mary didn’t say bye to anyone when
                        she left. I tried to figure out 
                        where she went, but, I thought I 
                        had time to make things right with 
                        her.

           Montage music begins, “I Don’t Blame You” by Cat Power.

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. RYE TRAIN STATION.

           Mary stands waiting for a train on the platform.

                                 JADE (V.O.)
                        I didn’t know she’d disappear.

           The train pulls in, hiding Mary from view.
           INT. TRAIN.

           With the lyrics “The last time I saw you,” - Mary sits, close 
           on her determined, angry face as the train leaves.

           INT. STREETS OF RYE.

           Nora, stoic, passes a group of peers who whisper maliciously.

           INT. AIRPLANE.

           Jade and Luke sit on a plane to California. She takes a pill. 
           They look at each other, both trying to appear hopeful.

                                 MAN IN N.A MEETING (V.O.) 
                        Things didn’t work out in 
                        California?

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. NARCOTIC’S ANONYMOUS MEETING. 

           Jade is lost in the memory, numb.

                                 JADE
                        No.

           MUSIC MONTAGE continues into...

           Nora walks through Rye with her suitcase, devastated. 

           Luke drives.

           Nora approaches her house, Charlie bursts outside as David 
           watches from the doorway. Nora showers Charlie in kisses.

           Outside the Narcotics Anonymous meeting, the group leaves, 
           Jade among them. She stands alone as they pass by her, giving 
           her strange looks. She could care less.

           More images of the three getting back into Rye and Manhattan, 
           their pathetic post road trip week passing.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. MARY AND LUKE’S SUFFOLK STREET APT, NYC. - A WEEK LATER.

           Luke and his realtor walk through the mostly empty apartment
                                 REALTOR
                        This place will sell in no time.

           Luke walks into other room. His phone rings, he answers.

                                 LUKE 
                        Hello?

                                 HEATHER (V.O.)
                        Baby, are you almost back? I just
                        got my you-know-what bleached.

           Luke again sees the “Mary is King” written on the wall.

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - SAME DAY

           Jade lays spread eagle on the floor, face down, watching 
           America’s Next Top Model. In the open doorway Candy pauses.

                                 JADE
                        Don’t look at me.

           Later - alone, Jade digs through a box of old stuff, rifling 
           through modeling photos. She comes to some photos she took 
           herself, then her old camera. She fumbles with it.

           INT. RYE COUNTRY DAY SCHOOL. - SAME DAY

           Nora hurries down the hallway.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE. - MOMENTS LATER

           TEACHER and PRINCIPAL sit across from Nora and Charlie.

                                 TEACHER
                        The little girl was very upset.

                                 NORA
                        What did Charlie say, exactly?

                                 TEACHER
                        That he was going to eat her liver
                        with fava beans.

                                 NORA
                        Oh- well that’s not- that’s only
                        cause he watched Silence of the 
                        Lambs. He was just quoting. It’s 
                        not like those are his words, he’s 
                        not crazy.
                                 PRINCIPLE 
                        (slow, numb, horror)
                        Why was he watching Silence of the 
                        Lambs?

                                 NORA
                        Okay, first of all, don’t ever make
                        that facial expression at me. Ever 
                        again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mommy-

                                 NORA 
                        You. Do not start. First grade is 
                        not that stressful, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes it is! And she picked on me!

                                 NORA 
                        That’s not an excuse!

                                 CHARLIE
                        But she was really mean to me! She
                        made fun of my ABC’s and my hair, 
                        and then she scratched me.

           Charlie reveals a small scratch mark on his arm. Nora is 
           aghast. She turns angrily to the Teacher and Principal.

                                 NORA
                        Where is this little cunt?

           EXT. RYE PARK. - SAME DAY

           Jade photographs an unknowing group of 13 year old girls a 
           few yards from her. She stops to look through the shots.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Were you taking pictures of us?

           Jade looks up to see one of the girls, AMY, 13, pretty.

                                 JADE
                        Uh, no, I was just -

                                 AMY 
                        Can I see?

           She takes the camera, begins looking, Jade is awkward.
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I look good. So are you like a
                        professional photographer?

                                 JADE
                        I was just messing around.

                                 AMY
                        I wanna model. I need to get photos
                        taken so I can send them to agents, 
                        but my mom doesn’t want me to.

                                 JADE 
                        Bummer.

                                 AMY
                        Maybe you can take my photos?

           Jade rolls her eyes, about to say no -

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        What do you charge? Like 300? 

           Jade stops, looks up at Amy, suddenly interested.

           EXT. NORA’S HOUSE - EVENING

           That evening. Nora sits glumly. David sits down next to her.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re going through a little
                        meltdown, huh?

           Nora nods, a slight roll of the eyes. Across the street two 
           teen girls walk by, gossiping. Beat.

                                 NORA
                        How do you know how much you owe
                        someone?

                                 DAVID 
                        What do you mean?

                                 NORA 
                        I don’t know.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve always felt like; friendships 
                        end. Part of growing up is that 
                        certain people grow apart. And when 
                        things end, they usually end badly, 
                        otherwise...
                                 DAVID 
                        They wouldn’t end.

                                 NORA
                        Right. I know its simple. But, how
                        do you know the difference between 
                        something that was supposed to be 
                        temporary and something that was 
                        supposed to last?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t think that’s something you
                        know, I think it’s something you 
                        decide.

           Nora is silent. 

           INT. NORA’S LIVING ROOM. - THAT EVENING

           Nora watches a home video of her 10th birthday. Onscreen she 
           blows out her candles while Mary, Luke and Jade watch.

           As Nora watches, Young Jade kisses Young Nora on the cheek.

           Nora groans with guilt at the cuteness displayed onscreen.

           EXT. SHINE HOUSE. - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Nora stands at the door, rings the bell. After a moment Mrs. 
           Shine answers, surprised to see Nora.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Shine stares out the window, Nora eyes taxidermy dogs.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        I’ve always thought you were a good
                        girl, Nora. But you three took all 
                        I had left of Mary without asking 
                        me. Like I’m the enemy. I hope you 
                        didn’t come to defend that.

                                 NORA 
                        No. I didn’t.

                                 MRS. SHINE 
                        Then what?

                                 NORA
                        I came here to defend Jade.
           Mrs. Shine turns to Nora, surprised and upset.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        I know you blame her for a lot of
                        things. But Jade was a good friend 
                        to Mary. It’s only sort of occurred 
                        to me lately how good a friend she 
                        actually is. And nobody understood 
                        your daughter better than Jade did. 
                        That’s why Mary told her things she 
                        didn’t tell the rest of us.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 NORA
                        I’ve realized I’m lacking in the
                        loyalty department. And I want to 
                        fix that.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        I feel robbed. Do you know what 
                        that kind of missing is like? I 
                        feel like I’ve been robbed of a
                        part of me that’s bigger than all 
                        the other parts of me.

                                 NORA
                        You’re allowed to feel robbed. And
                        there’s nobody you have to forgive 
                        for that.

                                 MRS. SHINE
                        Jade might have understood Mary, 
                        but she didn’t love her more than I 
                        did. And it wasn’t for any of you 
                        to decide where Mary ended up.

                                 NORA
                        I know. It was for Mary to decide.
                        But, all we can do is what we think 
                        she would have wanted.

           EXT. SHINE HOUSE. - FEW MINUTES LATER

           Nora heads back to her car.

                                 MRS. SHINE (O.C.)
                        Nora!

           Nora turns, sees Mrs. Shine heading towards her with the urn. 
           She arrives to Nora, there’s a beat.
                                 MRS. SHINE (CONT’D) 
                        I wish I could do all of it again.

           Nora’s silent. Mrs. Shine hands her the urn. Nora’s 
           speechless.

                                 MRS. SHINE (CONT’D)
                        You turned out nicely, Nora.

           Mrs. Shine goes inside, leaving Nora alone. 

           INT. NORA’S HOUSE. - LATER THAT EVENING

           Nora sits at her laptop, open to her email. A blank email is 
           waiting to be composed, addressed to Jade and Luke’s email 
           addresses. Nora debates what to say. She types, “Dear Jade 
           and Luke, I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry for all the” -

           Nora erases this. Starts over. Types, “Jade and Luke, I know 
           things got really messed up, and I know I’m as much to blame 
           as anyone -” Nora stops, erases this also. Long beat. 

           Finally Nora types, “I got the ashes. If you want, meet me at 
           the last spot on Wednesday at 4 pm. Nora.” 

           Nora sends the email. 

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - SAME DAY

           Jade sits on her laptop, uploading photos she took of Amy. 

           Her email beeps, she opens it, seeing the email from Nora.

           EXT. NYC. - SAME DAY.

           Luke walks down the sidewalk smoking a cigarette. His phone 
           buzzes, he looks at it. 

           INT. NORA’S HOUSE. - FEW DAYS LATER.

           Nora hurries down the hall towards Charlie’s room.

                                 NORA
                        Charlie, I’m headed out for a bit.

           Nora opens the door to Charlie’s bedroom, Charlie jumps up 
           from behind the bed, holding a blowup doll. Awkward beat.

                                 NORA (CONT’D) 
                        I’ll be back in a little.
           Charlie nods. Nora closes the door, shakes her head.

           INT. GEORGE’S NYC APARTMENT.

           Jade looks through her developed photos of Amy with her dad 
           George, and Mark.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re good at this, Jade. 

                                 MARK
                        Let’s just hope cocaine and xanax 
                        don’t find you again.

           Mark pats Jade condescendingly on the head and leaves.

                                 JADE 
                        What time is it?

                                 GEORGE 
                        Noon. Why?

                                 JADE
                        Nora’s spreading the rest of the
                        ashes today. 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t think I’m ready to see her. 
                        I’m just not sure what she did is 
                        forgivable.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sometimes instead of asking whether
                        something is forgivable, it’s 
                        better to ask whether the person 
                        who did it is worth forgiving.

           Jade is silent.

           EXT. RYE PARK. - SAME DAY

           Nora sits on a bench with the urn. She looks at her watch.

                                 LUKE (O.C.)
                        Hey.

           Nora looks up to see Luke. They’re silent for a moment.

                                 NORA 
                        Happy birthday.
                             (beat)
                        Did Jade come?
           Luke shakes his head. Nora nods, looking at the ground. He 
           sits, a weighted silence between them. A crash is heard- turn 
           to see Jade in her car, she’s crashed slightly into a tree.

                                 JADE
                        God damnit, why is this tree here?!

           Nora can’t help but smile. Jade gets out of car, walks over.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not ready to talk about things.
                        But I want to do this. For Mary.

                                 NORA 
                        Okay.

           They walk through the park silently. Finally their childhood 
           playground comes into view. They stare at the jungle gym. As 
           they arrive at it Nora suddenly trips, the ashes fly all over 
           the sand. After a moment she begins laughing, soon they’re 
           all laughing; there’s no need to spread the ashes now.

           A few minutes later they sit silently on the swings, passing 
           a joint. No need for conversation. Finally Jade stands.

                                 LUKE 
                        You’re going?

                                 JADE
                        Yeah. I think this was something 
                        good, though.

           Beat. Jade starts to walk off. Nora follows her.

                                 NORA 
                        Jade, wait.

           Jade stops as Nora catches up to her.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to be okay, right?

           Jade nods, then heads to her car. Nora watches Jade pull out 
           with a loud screech. She turns back to Luke.

                                 NORA (CONT’D)
                        I should get home to Charlie.

           He nods, wants to say something but doesn’t know what.

                                 LUKE 
                        Nora...
                                 NORA
                        I know. It’s okay.

           Beat. Nora heads to her car, Luke watches her walk away.

           INT. LUKE AND MARY’S NYC APARTMENT. - THAT EVENING

           Luke sits, his voicemail playing. His realtor speaks.

                                 REALTOR (V.O.)
                        They’re looking to move in as soon
                        as possible. So let me know, and 
                        we’ll get started on the paperwork.

           INT. JADE’S BEDROOM. - NEXT DAY.

           Jade applies a cooling cream down her pants, wincing. There’s 
           a rap on the window, she turns to see Luke. He waves.

           EXT. JADE’S HOUSE. - MOMENTS LATER

           Luke and Jade sit on the sidewalk.

                                 LUKE
                        So, back to photography?

                                 JADE
                        Maybe. Gonna at least take some 
                        classes, see how it goes.

                                 LUKE
                        Do you have any money saved up?

                                 JADE
                        Not really. It kinda sucks.

                                 LUKE
                        So what are you going to do?

                                 JADE
                        Guess I’ll just have to let things 
                        suck for a while.

           Beat.

                                 LUKE
                        There’s not anything between you 
                        and me anymore, is there?
                                 JADE
                        That’s a stupid question. There’s
                        an entire childhood between us.

                                 LUKE
                        The last thing Mary ever said to me
                        was that she didn’t respect me.

                                 JADE
                        Well, Mary had a lot of mood 
                        swings.

           Beat. 

                                 LUKE
                        What do you think about me and
                        Nora? Together.

                                 JADE
                        What, you’re in love with Nora now?

                                 LUKE
                        No, I - I don’t know. Maybe I 
                        should be.

                                 JADE 
                        You’re being serious?

           Luke shrugs. Jade pauses.

                                 JADE (CONT’D)
                        Nora would be the best thing that
                        ever happened to you. But you’d be 
                        the worst fucking thing that ever 
                        happened to her.

                                 LUKE
                        Thank you. Thanks. That’s kind.

                                 JADE
                        You can’t be with her just cause 
                        you like the way she sees you.
                             (beat, she softens)
                        I’m sure you’ll be of use to some 
                        girl someday, but you have a lot of 
                        emotional stuntedness to get over 
                        first. Don’t waste Nora’s time.

           INT. LUKE AND MARY’S NYC APARTMENT. - LATER THAT DAY

           Luke holds a photo of him and Nora, age ten. He makes a 
           decision, gets out his phone. Dials.
                                 LUKE
                        Don’t accept the offer. I’ve
                        decided not to sell.

           EXT. NORA’S HOUSE. - SAME DAY

           Luke waits at door, holds flowers and a wrapped gift. Charlie 
           opens the door, wears a veiled widow’s hat.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey. Is Nora - is your mom here?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, but she’ll be back soon. Do you
                        want to help me have a funeral?

           EXT. NORA’S KITCHEN. - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie buries a mouse in a huge flower pot. Luke watches.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He was a good mouse. But the vacuum
                        was stronger.

           Charlie places his hands on the dirt, closes his eyes.

                                 LUKE 
                        What are you doing?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m trying to feel it. So he won’t
                        have to.

           Something suddenly resonates with Luke - 

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           Mary staring out the back of the Shine family car as 
           ambulance lights flash across her face from the scene of the 
           beaten teenager.

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           Luke fights his emotions, Charlie touches his shoulder 
           comfortingly.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I know.

           They’re silent. Luke peers at the fridge, pictures of Nora 
           and Charlie, Charlie’s drawings. It’s a total parent’s 
           fridge. After a moment Luke stands.
                                 LUKE
                             (fighting to stay 
                              composed)
                        I gotta take off, buddy.
                             (motions to wrapped gift)
                        Give your mom this present from me, 
                        though, okay? And tell her that I -
                             (beat)
                        Tell her I said bye.

           Luke leaves, Charlie takes the flower pot outside.

           EXT. NORA’S HOUSE. - MOMENTS LATER

           Luke hurries down the sidewalk, the emotion he’s been 
           repressing all along finally hits him, he begins to cry. The 
           crying soon turns to surprised laughter at his own reaction.

           INT. NORA’S LIVING ROOM. - AN HOUR LATER

           Charlie and David watch TV. Nora enters in jogging clothes.

                                 NORA
                        Hey. What are you guys watching?

                                 DAVID
                        A completely irrational show about
                        a sponge that lives in the sea.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Your friend Luke came by, he left
                        something in the kitchen for you.

           INT. NORA’S KITCHEN. - MOMENTS LATER

           Nora enters, sees flowers, card and wrapped gift. She unwraps 
           the present, it’s a small box. She opens it, a house key. 
           Confused, she picks up the card; her eyes widen as she reads.

           INT. LUKE AND MARY’S SUFFOLK STREET APARTMENT. - DAY

           Couple days later. Realtor shows Nora around.

                                 REALTOR
                        The neighborhood has some great
                        private schools. Are you looking 
                        for anything in particular?

                                 NORA 
                        Not catholic.
                                 REALTOR
                        You must mean a lot to Luke. Is he
                        a close friend?

           Nora laughs. 

           INT. SUFFOLK STREET APARTMENT - ONE WEEK LATER.

           The space is now filled with boxes and random furniture. Nora 
           rushes around, making coffee, doing hair, etc.

                                 NORA
                        Charlie? You’re gonna be late!

           In the bathroom Charlie stares at himself in his new uniform.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        You look incredible.

           INT. LUKE’S LOS ANGELES HOME. - SAME DAY

           Everything is beautiful, pristine. The phone rings, as it 
           goes to voicemail we see Luke, lying in sweats on the floor.

                                 HEATHER (V.O.) 
                        Luke, the Young Literaries of
                        Hollywood party is tonight, and I 
                        can’t get in without you since I’m 
                        your plus one, so call me back.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY PARK. - SAME DAY

           Jade takes pictures, Mark strolling next to her. Up ahead 
           George walks his dog.

                                 MARK
                        So did you ever meet Kate Moss?

                                 JADE
                        I’ve done lines of coke off of Kate
                        Moss. 

           Mark gasps.

           INT. LUKE’S LA HOME. - SAME DAY

           Luke stares in his fridge, empty except one rotten apple.

           Minutes later he’s at his laptop, open to the site for House 
           of the Hope Children’s Home in Mexico.
           EXT. NYC.

           Nora drags Charlie, in new uniform, down the sidewalk.

                                 NORA
                        You gotta haul ass, Charlie!

           EXT. LUKE’S LA HOME.

           Luke exits. Gets in his car. He pulls out of the driveway.

           INT. LUKE’S CAR.

           Luke drives out of LA, into the desert.

           EXT. NYC PARK.

           Jade snaps more photos, stops to look at her work.

           INT. LUKE’S CAR.

           Middle of the desert. His phone rings, he answers on speaker.

                                 LUKE
                        Yo.

                                 HEATHER (V.O.) 
                        Luke, where are you??

                                 LUKE
                        I think I’m driving to Mexico.

                                 HEATHER (V.O.)
                        Mexico? What the fuck are you gonna
                        do in Mexico?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not really sure. 

           She begins ranting, Luke hangs up. He laughs.

           EXT. NYC SCHOOL.

           Nora ties Charlie’s shoe. Kids rush around them.

                                 NORA
                        Okay buddy, time to go.

           She hugs him and begins to stand, he grabs her.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Wait. What if they don’t like me?

           Beat. Nora lowers herself to Charlie’s eye level.

                                 NORA
                        Then obviously we will kill them.

           They grin. He hurries towards the school. At the steps he 
           turns back to Nora, does a victorious crotch grab. She shakes 
           her head. He runs inside. She watches the kids entering 
           school. Music begins.

           MONTAGE.

           Jade in the park, taking photos.

           Luke driving, a new weightlessness to him. He lights a joint.

           Nora watches the school kids going inside, with a smile, she 
           walks off. 

           We are left with the school, the kids swarming around, 
           starting their day, music builds and we cut to black. 
           Credits.
