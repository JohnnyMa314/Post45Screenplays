           EXT. NAMPA, IDAHO - DAY

           Depression-Era farmland.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I grew up in Nampa, Idaho. 

           A flatland of dusty, rocky homesteads.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Population: shit out of luck.

           EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE, NAMPA - DAY

           FARMERS walk their SONS to school. The boys wear overalls and 
           work boots like miniature versions of their farming fathers.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Where sons become fathers. And 
                        fathers become corpses.

           INT. CLASSROOM, SCHOOLHOUSE, NAMPA - DAY

           YOUNG ED WILSON (10), tall for his age but quite thin, stares 
           out the window. Silently mouthing along as the students all 
           stand and face the American Flag, reciting the Pledge of 
           Allegiance.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Nampa’s some kind of ugly-sounding 
                        Shoshone word. In keeping with the 
                        unholy ignorance of this place, no 
                        one knows what it means exactly. 
                        They got it down to one of two 
                        things: ‘moccasin’ or ‘footprint’.

           EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY

           Young Ed approaches a group of OLDER BOYS reading a SPY COMIC 
           during lunch break.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Now I don’t speak a lick of Indian 
                        but I know this: Nampa’s gotta mean 
                        ‘footprint’.

           The boys close ranks to prevent Young Ed from joining in. He 
           doesn’t give up until one of them shoves him away.

                                 OLDER BOY
                        Beat it, Wilson!
           He sets off running.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Grow up in that shit hole and I 
                        guarantee you’ll spend your life 
                        getting walked all over.

           EXT. WILSON HOMESTEAD, NAMPA - DAY

           Young Ed slips through a split-rail fence and into a patchy 
           pasture of two dozen grazing brown-and-white HOTLANDER COWS.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        You don’t gotta take my word for 
                        it, just ask the fuckin’ Shoshone.

           In the adjacent field, ED’S FATHER (30’s) makes a hash of 
           tilling soil: he struggles to control two oxen as they carve 
           ugly, uneven rows in the land.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Or my Pa, with seven acres and 
                        twenty-seven head of cattle to his 
                        name. 

           Two PASSING FARMERS stop to LAUGH at Ed’s Father’s 
           ineptitude. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Meager even by Nampa standards.

           Nearby, ED’S MOTHER (30’s) bends over a well, hand-pumping 
           water into a bucket. The Farmers “cuckold” Ed’s Father with 
           their leering. 

           Ed’s Mother stands up, pulls back loose strands of hair from 
           her eyes and smiles at the Farmers.

           Young Ed sees everything his Father doesn’t. Embarrassed, he 
           turns his attention to the cows and expertly MILKS a swollen 
           udder into his lunch pail with a SPLAT.

           EXT. WILSON HOME - DAY

           A cockeyed two-story clapboard woodpile.

           Young Ed drops his books on the front porch. Carries the pail 
           around back.

           INT./EXT. SHED

           The kid slows down. Gets unexpectedly gentle. 
                                 YOUNG ED
                        Heya Fern.

           Fern, a month-old CALF, stands tethered to a rusted hopper.

                                 YOUNG ED (CONT’D)
                        Got you something.

           Fern has already figured this out and strains at the rope as 
           Young Ed kneels beside her. She hungrily laps up the milk.

                                 YOUNG ED (CONT’D)
                        Easy there, girl.

           Young Ed takes hold of the rope.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Every last living thing is a 
                        prisoner here. 

           EXT. TIRE STORE, WARDING, NORTH DAKOTA - DAY

           Brutal winter. Ragged shop. No business.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Pa moved us out once. Took his 
                        savings and bought a tire repair 
                        shop in bumfuck North Dakota. Sight 
                        unseen. Wasn’t ten months before we 
                        were back in Nampa, poorer than 
                        ever.

           INT. CLASSROOM, SCHOOLHOUSE, NAMPA - DAY

           Another pledge of allegiance.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Every day in Nampa was as boring as 
                        the one before.

           EXT. SCHOOLHOUSE, NAMPA - DAY

           Young Ed makes another dash from the school.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        And when it wasn’t...

           INT. SHED, WILSON HOMESTEAD - DAY

           Young Ed stops in his tracks. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...it was worse.
           Fern is gone.

           EXT. WILSON HOUSE - DAY

           MARY WILSON (30’s) world-weary but big-boned and strong, 
           beats out a rug on a line. A TODDLER at her feet.

           Young Ed runs up.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Ma!

                                 MARY WILSON
                        Blasted dust. Gets in everything.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Where’s Fern?

                                 TODDLER
                        Fen! Fen!

                                 MARY WILSON
                        Told you not to give that calf a 
                        name. Your pa took her to market.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        But she’s mine.

                                 MARY WILSON
                        To look after.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        She’s mine!

                                 MARY WILSON
                              (exasperated)
                        For heaven’s sake, Edwin Wilson. 
                        You’re old enough to know better.

           Young Ed storms into the house. SLAMMING the front door. Then 
           SLAMMING his bedroom door.

                                 MARY WILSON (CONT’D)
                              (to self/beating again)
                        Told him not to name her.

           INT. YOUNG ED’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Young Ed lies on top of his tidy bed. Staring at the ceiling.

           His Father, a gentle and kindly man not cut out for farming, 
           stops in the doorway. He stands just 5’ 6”, almost a half-
           foot shorter than his wife.
                                 FATHER
                        Wash up for dinner, buddy boy.

           No answer.

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Buddy?

           His Father puts a hand on his shoulder, but Young Ed rolls 
           away from his touch and towards the wall.

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s hard. But this is a 
                        farm. Animals come and go. It’s the 
                        nature of the place.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        How much you get for her?

                                 FATHER
                        A silver dollar.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        You was gypped.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Way I see it, we’re all either 
                        moccasins or footprints.

           INT. YOUNG ED’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           He checks the weather outside his window (cloudy) and smiles.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Pa made his choice.

           INT. PARENTS’ BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Young Ed sneaks over to his Father’s dresser and grabs a 
           Silver Dollar.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        And I made mine.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - EARLY MORNING

           Young Ed waits. 

           Spots a FARMER walking a CALF toward him.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        You headed to auction in Breeland?
                                 FARMER
                        What’s it to ya?

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Nothing. Only with the rain coming 
                        you probably got planting to see to 
                        is all.

           The Farmer gives the clouds a once-over.

                                 FARMER
                        It’s gonna clear.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Woulda said the same...
                              (”yawning”)
                        ‘Cept we was over at the Sheriff’s 
                        early this morning. My family and 
                        me. Been on the shortwave to my 
                        uncle in Eugene. Aunt Lizbeth
                        delivered last night and my ma, 
                        well she wanted all the details.

                                 FARMER
                        I best be moving--

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Could barely hear him for the 
                        storm.

                                 FARMER
                        Storm?

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Powerful rain. Messed with the 
                        radio something awful.

           Farmer checks the skies once more. Torn.

                                 YOUNG ED (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take that calf off your hands. 
                        Can’t be worth more’n a dollar.

                                 FARMER
                        I’ll get two over in Breeland.

                                 YOUNG ED
                        Won’t help your soy crop any to be 
                        in Breeland.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. NAMPA GENERAL STORE - LATER THAT DAY

           A BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON.

           Young Ed sits on the front steps in a deep state of 
           contentment. He sips a bottle of Grape Nehi from a straw and 
           reads that elusive WWII SPY COMIC.

           His Parents pull up in the family Ford pick-up, wearing their 
           Sunday Best. Mother irate. Dad sullen.

           Young Ed furiously sucks down the rest of the soda as he 
           approaches the car.

           INT. FAMILY PICKUP, WILSON HOMESTEAD - MINUTES LATER

           The car stops in front of the house. Ed’s Father looks a bit 
           sickly.

                                 MOTHER
                              (to Young Ed)
                        And on a Sunday. Shame on you.

           Young Ed runs inside. 

                                 MOTHER (CONT’D)
                              (to Ed’s Father)
                        Do what needs be done.

           INT. YOUNG ED’S BEDROOM - DAY

           His Father ENTERS, looking under-sized in his shapeless 
           brown, church-going suit.

           Young Ed moves to his bedside and assumes the spanking 
           position. Grits his teeth in preparation.

           His Father reluctantly slips off his belt and wraps it twice 
           around his hand. Prepares to let his son have it.

                                 FATHER
                        I think you learned your lesson.

           Father backs off. Leaving Young Ed to a mix of relief and 
           dismay.

           Father turns to Young Ed’s desk...

                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Just give me what’s left over.

           ...stunned to see the SILVER DOLLAR plus eighty-five cents in 
           change. Father picks up the silver dollar.
                                 YOUNG ED
                        I told you, you was gypped.

           Father flushes with embarrassment and rage. 

                                 FATHER
                        You mean to show me up, do you?

           He raises the belt and LASHES the boy repeatedly.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I learned a lot from my old man, 
                        like the value of a dollar.

           HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Father, weary and ashamed, heads across hall to

           PARENTS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He takes off his suit coat and carefully hangs it in the 
           closet.

           PAN AROUND ROOM/TIME LAPSE:

           Weather outside the windows changes to winter.

           RETURN AND HOLD ON: OPEN CLOSET

           TEEN ED (17) squeezes into his Father’s brown suit. It’s too 
           damn small.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        And he was the only one...

           INT. METHODIST CHURCH, NAMPA - LATER

           Well-attended FUNERAL. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...who could get me to see the 
                        inside of a church.

           Teen Ed, in suit, sits next to his Mother and siblings in 
           front pew.

                                 ED’S MOTHER
                        Your father never had a lot of 
                        money, Edwin. But he was rich in 
                        friends.

                                 TEEN ED
                        Sure. Everybody loves a sucker.
           Teen Ed slides from the pew and walks out, back turned on his 
           Father’s COFFIN.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        But more than anything, he showed 
                        me that Nampa is a prison. And 
                        being poor, well, that’s a life 
                        sentence. Money’s the only way out. 
                        The only way to be really free.

           INT. TEEN ED’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Teen Ed packs a duffel bag with clothes. Brown suit wadded up 
           on a chair.

           Ed’s Mother ENTERS, fresh from the cemetery. The smell of 
           grief still on her.

                                 ED’S MOTHER
                        You’d leave us high and dry, then?

                                 TEEN ED
                        The day you stop wearing black, 
                        suitors are gonna crowd the porch. 
                        All you gotta do is pick one with 
                        the grubbiest hands and the least 
                        imagination.

                                 ED’S MOTHER
                        You think so little of this way of 
                        life.

                                 TEEN ED
                        I don’t think of it at all. Got my 
                        mind on other things.

                                 ED’S MOTHER
                        You’re a dreamer, like your pa.

                                 TEEN ED
                              (stuffing in a final shirt)
                        I’m nothing like him.

           She follows him out of the room and hounds him down

           STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

                                 ED’S MOTHER
                        You think you’re better than this? 
                        What makes you so special? You’re 
                        lousy at school; you got no skills; 
                        got no friends. Who’s gonna take a 
                        chance on a know-nothing like you? 
                        Answer me! Nobody, that’s who!
           FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Ed’s not listening. He’s half-way across the front lawn 
           before the screen door SLAMS behind him.

           INT. RECREATION HALL, SAN DIEGO - NIGHT

           A crowd of drunk MERCHANT MARINERS. 

           RINGSIDE

           EDWIN WILSON (20’s), having grown up to be big and imposing, 
           shadowboxes with taped hands while eyeing his even bigger and 
           more imposing FIGHT OPPONENT.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I joined the Merchant Marine 
                        straight away.

           WILSON’S BUDDIES argue with a much larger number of 
           OPPONENT’s BUDDIES over a pile of wagered CASH.

                                 WILSON’S BUDDY
                              (worried/off Opponent)
                        We should be getting bigger odds.

           RING - MINUTES LATER

           Wilson takes a pounding. Only stubbornness keeps him on his 
           feet. He absorbs three shots for every one he delivers.

           But for some reason, Wilson’s punches land with more power.

           His Opponent staggers before Wilson steps into a terminal 
           roundhouse right to the bridge of his Opponent’s nose.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BAR, SAN DIEGO - LATER THAT NIGHT

           GAMBLING WINNINGS on the bar.

           Wilson’s Buddies yank the BOXING GLOVES off Wilson’s hands. 
           Out spills a bunch of LOOSE QUARTERS to explain those 
           powerful punches.

                                 WILSON
                              (off quarters/corny)
                        Now that’s change I can believe in!

           A CHEER goes up. Alcohol flows. 
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The Merchants was a soft landing 
                        from Nampa, but a dead-end in the 
                        long run.

           A toast is raised to the battered, beaming Wilson.

           INT./EXT. APARTMENT, SAN DIEGO - DAY

           Wilson stumbles home from the night of carousing. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I needed a fresh start, only I 
                        didn’t know what.

           He picks up a LETTER lying just inside his door: Government 
           Issue.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The draft took care of that. 

           EXT. OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL, QUANTICO, VA - DAY

           Wilson runs through an OBSTACLE COURSE with twenty FELLOW 
           OFFICER CANDIDATES.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Now I believe in serving my country 
                        but the infantry is for saps and 
                        suicides. 

           Wilson stops at the top of a rope wall to help an unathletic 
           BRANIAC up and over. Impressed, another fit Candidate does 
           the same for other slow guys.

           INT. CLASSROOM, OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL, QUANTICO, VA - DAY

           Wilson and his Fellow Candidates take a multiple-choice exam.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I got myself into Marine Corps 
                        Officer Candidate School pronto. 

           Wilson orchestrates a method of CHEATING: 

           The Braniac sits in the front row. He answers “A” for the 
           first question, then slides his exam paper to top left corner 
           of desk. 

           Wilson sits in the next row, sees the position of the 
           Braniac’s exam, mark “A” and slides his exams over to top 
           left as well. 
           In this way, the answer ripples to the back row, where the 
           more athletic but dimmer candidates sit.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Moccasin country.

           EXT. ARMY BASE, INCHEON, SOUTH KOREA - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           A sleepy operation.

           SUPER: TWO YEARS AFTER THE KOREAN WAR

           INT. LAUNDRY FACILITY, ARMY BASE - DAY

           A bored and exasperated Wilson, sporting Lieutenant’s bars on 
           his crisp uniform, oversees the laundry operation. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Eventually I got my chance to see 
                        action on the Korean Peninsula.

           INT. BAR, INCHEON - DAY

           Wilson, bleary-eyed and shit-faced, staggers over to a sexy 
           Korean in revealing clothing. Puts an arm around her.

                                 WILSON
                        Hey sugar.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I served my country proudly and 
                        with distinction...

           Her BOYFRIEND returns from the john. Pissed.

                                 BOYFRIEND
                        Take your hands off my girl.

                                 WILSON
                        Relax. No harm done. I thought she 
                        was a whore. My mistake.

           The Boyfriend grabs a wooden stool and smashes it across 
           Wilson’s leg.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...until I fucked up my knee taking 
                        a hill from the Chinese.

           INT. NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MD - DAY

           Wilson in bed with KNEE elevated and immobilized. Glum. A 
           prisoner once more.
           His mood lightens when a sexy but humorless nurse’s aide from 
           New Jersey, BARBARA (late 20s), passes by. Her nose pressed 
           into the pages of a real estate licensing exam prep book.

                                 WILSON
                        Morning, beautiful.

           She flips him the finger without looking up.

           INT. NATIONAL NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER, BETHESDA, MD - DAY

           Barbara does some filing. A clutch of FLOWERS thrust in front 
           of her face.

           A smiling Wilson holds the bouquet.

                                 BARBARA
                        These look a lot like the ones Lt. 
                        Grimes got from his mom yesterday.

                                 WILSON
                              (unfazed)
                        There’s only one florist ‘round 
                        here. Guess he lacks imagination.

           She drops them in the trash.

                                 BARBARA
                        Why would I go out with you? I’m 
                        already dating a doctor.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m going into business.

                                 BARBARA
                        So?

                                 WILSON
                        So a doctor makes the same money, 
                        year in, year out. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Good money.

                                 WILSON
                        “Decent” money, I’ll give you that. 
                              (grinning)
                        But a businessman, well, even the 
                        sky not the limit.

           She’s not about to fish out those flowers from the trash, but 
           he’s got her attention.
           INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, AIRPLANE - DAY

           Wilson, in civilian clothes, enviously passes an empty seat 
           in First Class next to a bland BUREAUCRAT.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        They kicked me out with 10% 
                        disability.

           ECONOMY CLASS

           Wilson, still in obvious pain, limps to his cramped seat.

           He gets up again, pulls down his suitcase and carries it into 
           bathroom.

           MINUTES LATER

           Wilson EXITS bathroom in full dress uniform. He grits his 
           teeth and masks his limp as he returns to his seat.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Hello Lieutenant. Didn’t notice you 
                        board. You on active duty?

                                 WILSON
                        War goes on for some of us, I’m 
                        afraid.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Tell you what, come with me.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I had to improvise to get by...

           FIRST CLASS - SECONDS LATER

           The Bureaucrat watches Wilson return, now in uniform and 
           without the limp. Stewardess shows him to empty seat.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        It’s the least we can do for our 
                        men in uniform.

                                 WILSON
                        Thank you, darlin’. I’ll go easier 
                        on my battalion for the kindness.

           The Stewardess departs. Wilson sits. Rubs his throbbing leg.

                                 BUREAUCRAT
                        Lieutenants don’t run battalions. 
                        And they don’t travel in dress 
                        blues.
                                 WILSON
                        Does that mean we got a problem?

                                 BUREAUCRAT
                        You really a Marine?

                                 WILSON
                        I was.
                              (wincing/bending knee)
                        ‘Til I left my cartilage in some 
                        Chink’s groin.

           The Bureaucrat smiles, hands Wilson a card with nothing but a 
           type-set PHONE NUMBER in Washington D.C.

                                 BUREAUCRAT/CIA RECRUITER
                        Give us a call.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Until my resourcefulness... 

           EXT. BUILDING 23, MALL, WASHINGTON DC - ESTABLISHING

           A temporary Quonset hut in the shadow of the Washington 
           Monument.

                                 WILSON  (V.O.)
                        ...was recognized by one of your 
                        field recruiters...

           INT. BUILDING 23 - DAY

           Wilson sits strapped to a KEELER POLYGRAPH MACHINE. A blood 
           pressure gage wrapped around one arm and a belt around his 
           waist.

                                 WILSON
                        ...which is how I ended up here.

           A POLYGRAPHER monitors his responses.

           The graph paper gathering on the floor is one long steady 
           line of “truth-telling”. Wilson’s beating the lie detector as 
           necessary and he knows it.

           The Polygrapher returns to a clipboard of questions.

                                 POLYGRAPHER
                        We need to know if prospective 
                        agents can be blackmailed by 
                        foreign interests. For example, do 
                        you take illegal drugs?
                                 WILSON
                        No.

                                 POLYGRAPHER
                        Have you ever paid for sex?

                                 WILSON
                        No.

                                 POLYGRAPHER
                        Have you been known to gamble?

                                 WILSON
                        Never.

                                 POLYGRAPHER
                        Why the CIA?

                                 WILSON
                        How's that?

                                 POLYGRAPHER
                        Why do you want to join the CIA?

                                 WILSON
                        It’s all about freedom. I’m reading 
                        how the Chinese are moving millions 
                        of educated folks out of the cities 
                        and back working the farms. 
                        Russians, too. Well, I’m not going 
                        back to no farm, and I'll kill any 
                        Commie who aims to try. 

           Wilson sits back, self-satisfied... only to see the polygraph 
           has gone haywire. The Polygrapher stares at him impassively.

           Wilson's face goes red in anger and embarrassment.

           EXT. BUILDING 23 - DAY

           Wilson stomps out in a rage. Paces around. Then his eye is 
           caught by a passing shiny object and his demeanor calms:

           A Lincoln Town Car.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        A Lincoln Town Car with gold 
                        moondust metallic paint, 6-way
                        power twin comfort lounge seats and 
                        suicide doors. Even I knew that car 
                        belonged to Ted Shackley.

           A flash of BLONDE HAIR can be seen through the open window.
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The Blonde Ghost. Assistant Deputy 
                        Director of CIA Operations, pivot 
                        man for the Agency’s top 
                        clandestine ops, but he drives 
                        around in the most conspicuous 
                        automobile built by man. I admire 
                        the fuck out of that guy.

                                 CIA RECRUITER (O.S.)
                        Relax. Everybody fails.

           His CIA Recruiter from the plane.

                                 CIA RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        "Have you ever had a homosexual 
                        experience?", "When did you stop 
                        beating your wife?" Everyone lies 
                        about something.

                                 WILSON
                        Then what's the goddamn point?

                                 CIA RECRUITER
                        To show you we can trip up anybody.

           Over Wilson’s shoulder the Polygrapher steps out of Building 

                                 CIA RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        Give it another shot.

           Wilson catches one last glimpse of the Town Car as it 
           disappears into traffic.

           INT. BUILDING 23 - MOMENTS LATER

           Wilson once again hooked up to the machine.

                                 POLYGRAPHER
                        Why the CIA?

           Wilson collects himself. Takes in the trappings of spycraft 
           around him: Polygrapher’s holstered pistol hanging over a 
           chair, “Top Secret” documents, and the polygraph. 

           Then plunges in: 

                                 WILSON
                        The spy game's all about leverage, 
                        isn't it? Using information, 
                        withholding information, knowing 
                        people's strengths and weaknesses. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILSON (CONT'D)
                        And being unafraid and unapologetic 
                        about taking advantage of the other 
                        guy. Not everyone's got the right 
                        stuff to be the hammer. To be the 
                        shoe. Well, you don't have to worry 
                        about me, as far as that's 
                        concerned. Not only will I not 
                        apologize, I will fucking brag 
                        about it. 

           Wilson can’t help but peek at the needle: it runs flat and 
           smooth across the paper.

           SFX: UNMISTAKABLE POP OF A CHAMPAGNE CORK

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT, WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           Waiter pours a glass of bubbly for Wilson, who sits alone. He 
           takes a celebratory sip. 

           We see this as a bit sadder than he does.

                                 DONE-UP WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Hi handsome.

           An attractive, though overly DONE-UP WOMAN takes a seat. 
           Wilson pours her a glass.

                                 WILSON
                        What’s your name? The agency didn’t 
                        say.

                                 DONE-UP WOMAN
                        Jennifer.

                                 WILSON
                        And the terms again?

           If we thought "agency" meant the CIA we are quickly corrected 
           as she leans forward for a little privacy:

                                 DONE-UP WOMAN
                        Thirty to screw.

                                 WILSON
                        How ‘bout twenty-five?

                                 DONE-UP WOMAN
                        How ‘bout thirty?

                                 WILSON
                        Discount for champagne?

           She shakes her head.
                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        My philosophy: a deal can always be 
                        made.
                              (”eureka”)
                        Fifty we go two rounds.

           She seals the deal with her glass against his. CLINK.

                                 DONE-UP WOMAN
                        What’re we celebrating anyway?

                                 WILSON
                        You’re looking at Florsheim’s
                        regional salesman of the month.

           INT. HOTEL BAR, ADD LOCATION - DAY

           Wilson ENTERS carrying a briefcase-sized DROP BAG. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Some spooks fly risky missions over 
                        the Soviet Union taking recon 
                        photos. Other spooks analyze those 
                        photos to comprehend the Communist 
                        threat.

           His new contact, KARL, an Old School hold-over from the OSS
           days, sits at a table. Otherwise the bar area is empty.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        And then there’s guys like me, who 
                        do nothing but carry the photos 
                        from the first guys to the second 
                        guys.

           Karl waves Wilson over. Wilson sits, puts the bag on the 
           table as a Waiter arrives.

                                 KARL
                        What’ll you have?

                                 WILSON
                        Scotch and soda.

                                 KARL
                              (to Waiter)
                        Make it two.

           Waiter departs. Wilson extends his hand in greeting.

                                 WILSON
                        Ed Wilson.
                                 KARL
                        Fuck you doing?

                                 WILSON
                        Confirming you’re my new contact.

                                 KARL
                        I wave you over. You give me a 
                        package. We order drinks. Who the 
                        fuck else could I be?

                                 WILSON
                        The Company handbook says--

                                 KARL
                        First thing that damn book oughta
                        say is that not everything’s in 
                        that damn book.

           Karl hands Wilson a BUSINESS CARD.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be flying in and out of 
                        Lisbon a few times per month, so 
                        you need a cover.

                                 WILSON
                              (reading card)
                        Applied Dynamics. What do we sell?

                                 KARL
                        I don’t know. Radios.

                                 WILSON
                        Okay. To who?

                                 KARL
                        To people who want radios, I’m 
                        thinking.

                                 WILSON
                        Wholesalers? Retailers? End users?

                                 KARL
                        What is all this?

                                 WILSON
                        Verisimilitude. 

                                 KARL
                        Vera who?

           Drinks arrive.
                                 WILSON
                        The handbook says to ‘strive for 
                        verisimilitude at all times.’

                                 KARL
                        Again with the fucking handbook.

                                 WILSON
                        Who do I report to at Applied 
                        Dynamics?

                                 KARL
                        Jesus, kid. No one’s gonna go 
                        asking the name of your boss. 
                        You’re picking up a bag and coming 
                        home again. That’s all.

                                 WILSON
                        But what if they do?

                                 KARL
                              (weary)
                        Make one up.

                                 WILSON
                        Suppose they check? Maybe I should 
                        be the boss.

                                 KARL
                        I really don’t give a shit.

                                 WILSON
                        I’ll get cards made that say 
                        ‘President’...

           Karl downs his drink, grabs the drop bag and rises.

                                 KARL
                              (past caring)
                        Fantastic.

                                 WILSON
                              (fixated on card)
                        ...improve this logo, too.

           INT. LIBRARY, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Wilson, a fish out of water, sits at a desk pouring over self-
           help books on marketing, product development and 
           entrepreneurship.
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I don’t get why suckers pay a small 
                        fortune for college when you can go 
                        to any library and learn what you 
                        need for free.

           INT. EMPTY OFFICE, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Wilson interviews Texas-born BOBBI BARNES (twangy, in push-up 
           bra).

           She quickly adjusts her decolletage as Wilson looks over her 
           resume. When he looks up, he looks right at her breasts, then 
           to her eyes.

                                 WILSON
                        So, Roberta Barnes...

                                 BOBBI
                              (flirty/Texas twang)
                        Y’all just call me Bobbi.

                                 WILSON
                        You dropped out of school?

                                 BOBBI
                        To have my boy, Stevie.

                                 WILSON
                        That sounds like an apology.

                                 BOBBI
                        I figure you got applicants with 
                        college degrees.

                                 WILSON
                              (off breasts)
                        And you’re hoping those ladies are 
                        gonna make up the difference?

                                 BOBBI
                              (flat)
                        Times are hard. I need a job.

                                 WILSON
                        Whatever it takes?

                                 BOBBI
                        Yeah. Whatever it takes.

           She gets up, adjusts her skirt and moves towards him.
                                 BOBBI (CONT’D)
                        And by the way you’ve been checking 
                        me out, I’d say it took.

           She slips his arms around her waist, his eyes at breast-
           level. 

                                 WILSON
                        You’re a good judge of character.

           He gently removes her to arm’s length away.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t give a shit about 
                        degrees. Anyone with time and money 
                        can do that. I need someone who’s 
                        had to fight for everything they 
                        ever wanted. Done stuff they’re not 
                        too proud of, if they were ever 
                        gonna get from A to B. Stuff like 
                        throwing yourself at a guy like me.

                                 BOBBI
                        I’ve never gotten anywhere. I only 
                        know that A sucks. So gimme B.

                                 WILSON
                        You start Monday morning.

           Bobbi smiles, not believing her good fortune.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        But stop apologizing for who you 
                        are.

                                 BOBBI
                              (exiting)
                        You’re wrong about one thing: you 
                        ain’t so bad.

           INT. OFFICES OF APPLIED DYNAMICS - DAY

           Karl ENTERS through door adorned with fancy new logo. He’s 
           stunned to find a couple of EMPLOYEES busily answering 
           phones, putting together print materials, etc.

           Wilson goes over sales figures at a big desk in the corner.

           Karl moves in that direction but is stopped by Bobbi.

                                 BOBBI
                        May I help you?
                                 KARL
                        Uh, I need to speak with Ed.

                                 BOBBI
                        Do you have an appointment with Mr. 
                        Wilson?

                                 KARL
                        Appointment? No, I don’t--

           Wilson spots Karl.

                                 WILSON
                        It’s alright, Bobbi. This is Whitey 
                        Malone, my insurance agent.

           Karl sits down across the desk from Wilson.

                                 KARL
                        Where the hell are we?

                                 WILSON
                        Applied Dynamics.

                                 KARL
                        There is no Applied Dynamics.

           Wilson hands over the bag of U2 film stock.

                                 WILSON
                        Just back from Lisbon. Can’t sell 
                        the Portuguese anything military. 
                        Did you know they were neutral in 
                        WWII? Pussies. But I got a 
                        commitment from the Italians for 
                        two thousand short-waves.

                                 KARL
                        But there are no radios!

           Wilson puts a SHORT-WAVE SET in front of Karl.

                                 WILSON
                        Army surplus. Got ‘em for a song.

                                 KARL
                        How’d you pay for all this?

                                 WILSON
                        Been selling my agency-issued plane 
                        tickets and flying with a London 
                        bucket shop. Business loan covers 
                        the rest.
           Karl takes the drop bag. Speechless.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Verisimilitude.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, FIXER-UPPER, ARLINGTON, VA - NIGHT

           Ed puts a brisk coat of bright paint on a tired wall. 
           Barbara’s old Century 21 gold jacket serves as a drop cloth.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I knew if I was patient, 
                        opportunity would come calling.

           Karl ENTERS the empty room through the open front door.

                                 KARL
                        Knock, knock.

           Wilson steps down from a ladder. Wipes his hands with a rag.  
           BARBARA, the former nurse, ENTERS from the kitchen.

                                 WILSON
                        Little late to talk insurance, 
                        wouldn’t you say, Whitey?

                                 KARL
                        Relax, Ed. No way your wife’s that 
                        dumb.

                                 BARBARA
                        Please excuse the mess.

           Awkward pause. Barbara’s embarrassed by her husband’s lack of 
           manners. Introduces herself.

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                              (shaking hands)
                        Barbara Wilson. 

                                 KARL
                        Karl, ma’am. Quite the operation 
                        you got going.

                                 WILSON
                        We strip ‘em and flip ‘em.

                                 BARBARA
                        Can’t expect my husband to provide 
                        on a G-5 salary alone.

                                 KARL
                        Plus radio sales.
           Barbara flashes Wilson a look: “Radio sales?” Wilson plays 
           the innocent with a shrug of his shoulders and a wink for 
           Karl.

                                 KARL (CONT’D)
                              (to Wilson)
                        Come with me.

           EXT. FIXER-UPPER - NIGHT

           Wilson walks down the front path. Gets a look at what waits 
           at the curb and stops short:

           THE GOLD LINCOLN TOWN CAR.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Ted Shackley. To see me.

           Karl hangs back as Wilson gathers himself and approaches...

           INT./EXT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR - NIGHT

           Wilson checks himself in the tinted window before blonde-
           haired TED SHACKLEY (50’s), Assistant Deputy Director of CIA 
           Operations powers it down. 

           Big and garrulous, like a Texas Oil Tycoon without the 
           accent. Like Wilson himself... and, okay, like Wilson wished
           his own father had been.

           Wilson gets a look at the interior. Awed, nearly cowed, by 
           the surroundings and the great Shackley.

                                 WILSON
                              (off car)
                        Roomier than my house.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I understand you served in the 
                        Merchant Marine and the Marine 
                        Corps.

                                 WILSON
                        Got the VD to prove it.

                                 SHACKLEY
                              (dead serious)
                        My dick burns too.
                              (explaining)
                        Cold War's hit the Middle East. 

                                 WILSON
                              (smile quickly fading)
                        Yes, sir.
                                 SHACKLEY
                        To cover our actions in the Gulf I 
                        need shipping and cargo support of 
                        a non-traditional nature.

                                 WILSON
                        I know I can do it. Absolutely. 

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I don’t take your word for it. I 
                        take mine.

                                 WILSON
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Karl will set you up with a 
                        proprietary. Sanctioned this time.

                                 WILSON
                        Yes, sir. Only... 

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Why you?

                                 WILSON
                        Yeah.

           Window powers back up. And the Town Car coasts away. Karl 
           steps forward to answer:

                                 KARL
                        Back in April, our tactical group 
                        was looking to supply the King of 
                        Jordan with radio surveillance 
                        equipment. Foster good relations, 
                        that sort of thing. Only another 
                        outfit beat us to it. Took his best 
                        men three solid months paper-
                        chasing to discover it wasn’t the 
                        Russians after all.

                                 WILSON
                              (watching car disappear)
                        I cleared seventy grand on that 
                        one.

           EXT. CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VA - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           The ‘60s architecture that looks antiquated today, feels 
           sharp and new.

           Wilson walks in amongst the morning commuting bureaucrats, 
           feeling like a conquering king.
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        “Proprietary.” A business that 
                        looks and acts legit but its real 
                        job is to commit questionable acts 
                        on the Agency’s behalf while giving 
                        the Agency what it wants more than 
                        anything: plausible deniability.

           INT. SECURITY AREA, CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Wilson is checked by Security Staff.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        “Proprietary”. Ever hear anything 
                        so beautiful? It even sounds like 
                        money. Funny how one word can 
                        change your life forever.

           ACCOUNTING, CIA HEADQUARTERS

           Wilson meets with a PENCIL PUSHER. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Called my first prop “Marine 
                        International.” Nice and vague. 

           Hands him a single slip of paper on Marine International 
           letterhead:

           Expense reimbursement for ship retrofit: $500,000.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Investment capital?

                                 PENCIL PUSHER
                        I gotta have more detail, Ed.

           Wilson takes the “expense report” and adds two lines above 
           the price tag: Labor - $250,000. Parts - $250,000.

           The Pencil Pusher takes a second look...

                                 PENCIL PUSHER (CONT’D)
                        I can work with that.

           ...then starts writing out a check.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The Agency provided all I need. And 
                        then some.
           INT. “LADY OF SPAIN” TRAWLER, HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA - DAY

           WELDERS crawl all over the TRAWLER. Sparks shower down on 
           MOVERS loading it with technical equipment.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        First job was outfitting a trawler 
                        to measure magnetic fields off the 
                        coast of Africa. Our latest 
                        missiles won’t fly straight without 
                        precise readings and we had to show 
                        Moscow we could blast Brezhnev into 
                        camel shit from the Canary Islands.

           Wilson throws himself into the chaos. Bobbi, wielding a 
           clipboard, keeps up as well as anyone could.

                                 WILSON
                        Title transfer arrive from Liberia? 

                                 BOBBI
                        Came in yesterday.

                                 WILSON
                        You go through that Taiwan 
                        purchaser for the sonar fittings?

                                 BOBBI
                        Like you said.

                                 WILSON
                        Let’s check the magnetometers...

           EXT. 1 MILE OFF THE AFRICAN COAST, MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY

           “Lady of Spain” approached by Egyptian Coast Guard.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Only problem: Any vessel on slow 
                        haul’s gonna stick out like Ann-
                        Margret’s chest.

           INT. “LADY OF SPAIN” - MINUTES LATER

           Wilson shows the Egyptians around the ship.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        So for cover, I charted off-shore 
                        oil deposits.

           CHART ROOM

           Egyptians look over sonar and charting equipment actively 
           used in oil exploration. Curiosity satisfied.
           After the Egyptians leave, a FALSE WALL is removed to reveal 
           the MAGNETOMETERS and data collection equipment.

           INT. OIL COMPANY HEADQUARTERS, DALLAS, TX - DAY

           Wilson cuts a deal with OIL EXECUTIVES. Hands over the oil 
           deposit charts for cash.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Pentagon got the data they wanted 
                        and I was able to sell exclusive 
                        rights to the oil deposit data... 

           INT. ANOTHER OIL COMPANY, RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA - DAY

           Wilson cuts a second deal with ARAB OIL EXECUTIVES. Hands 
           over the charts for more cash.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Then do it again. Everybody won.

           INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VA - DAY

           Wilson slides a briefcase across the table to the Pencil 
           Pusher. Pencil Pusher asks what he’s looking at and Wilson 
           can be seen explaining. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Only the Agency didn't want her 
                        piece of the action.

           Pencil Pusher uses his pencil to push the envelope back 
           towards Wilson.

                                 PENCIL PUSHER
                        We don’t want to know.

           Wilson picks up the cash: “Suit yourself.”

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        See, props aren’t expected to make 
                        a profit... but I don’t know how 
                        not to. Which means more money for 
                        me.

           INT. BANK, NORTHERN VIRGINIA - DAY

           Wilson hands over the oil CASH to a Banker.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The kicker: in the interest of 
                        national security, I couldn’t 
                        declare the income. Least that’s 
                        how I saw it.
           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS, UPPERVILLE, VIRGINIA - DAY

           A “For Sale” sign stickered over with “Sold” on the lawn.

           Wilson and Barbara stand back-to-back. Barbara stares at the 
           beautiful, huge house... disappointed. 

                                 BARBARA
                        I guess it’ll do.

           Wilson looks out on his farm...proud as a rooster.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        So I starting buying freedom by the 
                        acre.

           Wilson gets distracted by the sight of an empty hillside 
           field.

                                 WILSON
                        Where are my twenty-seven fucking
                        cows?

           DOUG SCHLACHTER, caretaker, runs up obsequiously.

                                 SCHLACHTER
                        Having the darndest time finding 
                        those Hotlanders, Mr. Wilson.

                                 WILSON
                        Gotta be Hotlanders, Doug. I want 
                        ‘em on that hillside there.
                              (immensely pleased)
                        Doing fuck all.

           EXT. EDGE OF LAKE TANGANYIKA, CONGO - DAY

           Shackley drags impatiently on a cigarette.

           He’s surrounded by a team of well-armed CUBAN DISSIDENTS and 
           Karl, who tracks the distant airplane BUZZ through 
           binoculars.

                                 KARL
                              (to Shackley)
                        C-17’s.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        More bullshit.

           Shackley grinds his cigarette into the mud and puts on his 
           game face as two C-17 cargo planes come clattering in for a 
           landing on a makeshift airfield.
                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t stop Moscow from supplying 
                        Congolese rebels without Swift 
                        Boats! 

           When Wilson pops out of the first plane

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        And you can’t get a Swift Boat in 
                        the belly of a C-17.

                                 WILSON
                        Actually, you can...

           With a flair for the dramatic, the backs of the cargo planes 
           drop open to reveal racks of Swift Boats CUT INTO THIRDS.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        ...if you cut ‘em in three.

           Shackley breaks out in a shit-eating grin.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Son of a bitch.

           LATER - NIGHT

           The Cubans busy themselves welding the boats back together as 
           Wilson and Shackley walk along the lake.

           SPARKS light the area, catching the eyes of wild beasts 
           watching from the nearby bush. A magical, surreal moment.

                                 SHACKLEY
                              (impressed)
                        Slice ‘em up and stitch ‘em back 
                        together.

           Shackley wraps Ed in a fatherly bear hug.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        You fucking genius. Screw Brezhnev. 
                        Only we get to pick who runs this 
                        shitty backwater country.

           Wilson soaks in the moment.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Shackley and I made a good team. I 
                        knew things no one could teach, and 
                        he did things no one could know.
           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - DAY

           Informal party under way. Hired Hands turning steaks on a 
           huge outdoor grill. Beltway Insiders mingling. Drinking. 
           Throwing horseshoes. Playing tennis.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I was on a first-name basis with 
                        leaders of the foreign affairs and 
                        appropriations committees. Generals 
                        and Admirals, too. But the guys I 
                        really worked on were the anonymous  
                        career personnel: logistics and 
                        requisitions. The ones who made the 
                        military machinery run.

           Barbara shows SHACKLEY’S WIFE and DAUGHTER some gentle horses 
           in the background.

           Wilson and Shackley walk along a rail fence. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        They made me the agency’s go-to 
                        military supplier to the whole 
                        Middle East. Well, not all of it.

                                 WILSON
                        These guys really want to play 
                        ball, Ted.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        For the hundredth time, the embargo 
                        puts Libya off limits.

                                 WILSON
                        Qaddafi’s the brass ring, you 
                        always say so. “The enemy of our 
                        enemy.”

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Right now, I need you in Iran. The 
                        Shah’s losing control and Carter’s 
                        too fucking blind to see it.

                                 WILSON
                        What if--

           But Shackley has walked off towards his daughter on the 
           horse.

                                 SHACKLEY
                              (to Daughter)
                        How’s my princess...?
           EXT. TEHRAN, IRAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           The sophisticated Europe-style capital.

           INT. SAVAK INTERROGATION CENTER, OUTSIDE TEHRAN - DAY

           Grim-looking SAVAK AGENTS escort Wilson down a hallway 
           peppered by the SCREAMS and MOANS of tortured prisoners.

           INTERROGATION CELL

           An IRANIAN STUDENT lies naked and tied to a bed in the 
           sweltering room. His INTERROGATORS beat on him mercilessly... 
           but he tells them nothing.

           HOTEL - TEHRAN

           A shaken Wilson on the phone. 

                                 WILSON
                              (into phone)
                        They’re roughing up these students 
                        pretty good.

                                 SHACKLEY (O.S.)
                        Welcome to the big league. The Shah 
                        plays for keeps. So do the 
                        Russians. And so must we.

                                 WILSON
                        You saying you approve?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           SHACKLEY’S OFFICE, CIA HEADQUARTERS

           Shackley on speaker phone. Karl listens in.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I’m saying, SAVAK’s been torturing 
                        Iranians for decades. And they’re 
                        gonna keep right on doing it, with 
                        or without our help. So we damn 
                        well better get in on the intel.

                                 WILSON
                              (on the fence)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        You think the KGB gives a shit
                        about some student’s human rights? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHACKLEY (CONT'D)
                        They would gladly skin the poor son-
                        of-a-bitch and a million more if it 
                        meant putting Iran in their win 
                        column. That’s the bigger picture.

                                 WILSON
                        I don’t even know what I’m selling 
                        here.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Whatever it takes. If it’s ice to 
                        Eskimos, kid, I know you can do it.

           Shackley hangs up.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        He made it my patriotic duty to 
                        make money... And I’m very 
                        patriotic.

           SAVAK INTERROGATION CENTER - WEEKS LATER

           Wilson sells REFRIGERATION UNITS to the SAVAK Agents for a 
           suitcase full of CASH.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I sold the Iranian secret police a 
                        dozen refrigeration units.

           INTERROGATION CELL

           An IRANIAN STUDENT shivers, naked and tied to a bed in the 
           chilled room. A brand new COOLING SYSTEM is the source of his 
           misery.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The unrelenting cold helps with the 
                        process.

           INTERROGATION ROOM

           Wilson observes as SAVAK AGENTS interrogate the brave but 
           rattled Student.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                              (a la Shackley)
                        I mean it’s not like SAVAK hasn’t 
                        been torturing guys for decades.

           A MALE SECRETARY writes a TRANSCRIPT. Even takes a PHOTO of a 
           “proud” Wilson shaking hands with SAVAK Agents in front of 
           the beaten Student. 
           INT. SHACKLEY’S OFFICE, CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Shackley and Karl look over the TRANSCRIPT and its

                              (off Transcript)
                        The Shah’s losing control over 
                        there.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Anything useful, I’d report back to 
                        Ted. Yeah, we had it all on a 
                        string... until that peanut farmer 
                        took the White House.

           INT./EXT. CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VA - DAY

           Ramrod straight ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER sworn in by 
           PRESIDENT CARTER as new CIA Director.

           Shackley among the CIA veterans looking on.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        To clean up what he called the 
                        Agency’s ‘frat house culture’, 
                        Carter appointed an outsider as 
                        Director of Central Intelligence: 
                        Admiral Stansfield Turner.

           PRESS CONFERENCE - MINUTES LATER

           Turner addresses the assembled MEDIA.

                                 TURNER
                        As Intelligence Chief, my 
                        priorities will be to avoid biased 
                        intelligence estimates, rebuild the 
                        reputation of the intelligence 
                        community following disclosures of 
                        questionable activities and to 
                        insure that intelligence work is 
                        conducted lawfully.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Turner didn’t understand how the 
                        Agency operated. But he was about 
                        to get a crash course... 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Turner slowly turns ten shades of sick as CIA COUNSEL works 
           his way through a TOP SECRET BINDER, explaining Agency 
           activities. 
           Shackley and other SENIOR STAFF listen with greater 
           dispassion.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)

                                 COUNSEL
                        Hypnosis--

                                 TURNER
                              (disgusted)
                        Enough. I get the picture.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        We've got a saying around here: 
                        ‘sometimes it’s best to just shut 
                        your eyes and take what's coming.’

           Turner focuses in on Shackley.

                                 TURNER
                        The Navy’s got its share of 
                        sayings, too. Like, “we look with 
                        pride and confidence to both our 
                        tradition and our future." Around 
                        here, the future’s the only thing 
                        worth mentioning.
           TURNER’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           A still-horrified Turner ENTERS, followed by his AIDE.

                                 TURNER
                        Patton started every new assignment 
                        by firing someone. Sets the 
                        necessary tone.

                                 AIDE
                        No lack of candidates 'round here, 
                        sir.

                                 TURNER
                        Then let's not limit ourselves, 
                        shall we?

           Turner starts idly looking through the contents of his inbox, 
           including a REPORT from Shackley, including the SAVAK 
           transcript.

           INT. HALLWAY, CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Shackley and Wilson.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        You let me do the talking.

                                 WILSON
                        You bet.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        When you do speak, let him know 
                        there’s plenty more solid intel
                        coming. I’m looking to expand our 
                        proprietary initiatives, and this 
                        could be the opening we need.

           They ENTER

           CONFERENCE ROOM, CIA HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Turner waits with the SAVAK report open in front of him.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Good morning, sir--

                                 TURNER
                              (furious)
                        What the hell is this?
                                 SHACKLEY
                              (recovering)
                        Ed’s report on the Iranian student 
                        movement.

                                 TURNER
                              (to Wilson/horrified)
                        You tortured Iranian citizens? 

                                 WILSON
                        I watched. They tortured.

                                 TURNER
                        Do you have any idea what kind of 
                        shit storm this kicks up if word 
                        gets out?

                                 SHACKLEY
                        What you should be focusing on is 
                        the intel. It’s clear there’s more 
                        resentment and better organized 
                        resistance to the Shah than he lets 
                        on. We lose control of his oil, the 
                        Russians are there to take our 
                        place.

                                 TURNER
                        I’m not interested in wasting 
                        resources spying on allies like the 
                        Shah. What I am interested in, is 
                        keeping this Agency funded and out 
                        of Congressional investigations. 

           Turner tosses the report back to Shackley.

                                 TURNER (CONT’D)
                        Neither of which is helped by 
                        reckless stunts like this.

           As Turner heads for the door, Wilson GRABS HIM by the arm.

                                 WILSON
                        I sat through some unsavory 
                        interrogations to get this 
                        information. Now what you need to 
                        do is make the effort mean 
                        something.

                                 TURNER
                              (off Wilson’s hand)
                        In the Navy, you’d be court-
                        martialed for that.

           Wilson releases him. 
           A seething Turner EXITS, SLAMMING the door behind him. 

                                 SHACKLEY
                        He’s a damn fool. And so are you. I 
                        told you to let me handle him.

           WAITING AREA, TURNER’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Turner returns to work lost in thought. Nearly runs into a 
           CIA COLLEAGUE giving a tour of the building to his two Sons.

                                 CIA COLLEAGUE
                        You’re in luck, kids. Here’s my 
                        boss, the Director.

           An awkward beat until Turner’s Secretary intervenes with a 
           throat-clearing nod towards a bowl of COMMEMORATE CIA COINS 
           on her desk.

           Turner hands one coin to each boy.

                                 TURNER
                        Here you go. Compliments of the 
                        CIA.

                                 BOYS
                        Wow! Thanks.

           After another awkward beat, Turner walks away, into

           AIDE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           STACKS of Personnel files open around Turner’s Aide.

                                 TURNER
                        Shackley’s untouchable. Too many 
                        friends on the Hill. But his errand 
                        boy, Ed Wilson, he make the list?

                                 AIDE
                              (rings a bell)
                        Top 40 with a bullet, sir.

           The Aide scans to the back of a 15-page alphabetical LIST to 
           confirm. Finds Wilson’s name.

                                 TURNER
                        I should damn well hope so.

           INT. COPY ROOM, CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VA - DAY

           The THUMP-THUMP of a mimeograph drum as it spins around. 
           Turner’s Secretary watches the copies pile up. 
           Two ARMED GUARDS stand at the doorway protecting her.

           There are so many copies, one slips from the stack and 
           flutters to the ground. The opening words of a letter can be 
           see: “CIA EMPLOYEE -- A new era...”

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        “CIA Employee -- A new era is 
                        dawning at the agency brought about 
                        by technological improvements in 
                        the methods of collecting and 
                        analyzing information.

           HUMINT FLOOR

           The Secretary wheels a mail cart piled with 900 COPIES OF THE 
           LETTER. As she passes among the rows of desks, she consults a 
           LIST OF 900 NAMES and drops letters on the appropriate desks. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Given the need for cost savings, I 
                        have a responsibility to reduce the 
                        numbers counted among our human 
                        intelligence agents.

           One of the letters lands on WILSON’S DESK.

           SHACKLEY’S OFFICE

           Shackley sees the brewing commotion outside his office.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        It has been decided that your 
                        services are no longer needed.

           HUMINT FLOOR

           Shackley catches Wilson’s eye, getting the gist of the 
           situation as the ADDO’s face gets redder and redder.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Sincerely...

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Wilson finishes reading his letter:

                                 WILSON
                        ...Admiral Stansfield Turner. 
                        Director of Central Intelligence.”

           Wilson stares into a mirror. Depressed.
                                 BOBBI (O.S.)
                        Baby, what’re you gonna do?

           Wilson shifts his gaze to see Bobbi lying naked in bed. A 
           smile breaks through his gloom.

                                 WILSON
                        Shit, Bobbi. You’re the first girl 
                        I don’t pay to sleep with.
                              (correcting her)
                        ‘What’re we gonna do?’

                                 BOBBI
                        You’re such a liar. Remember 
                        Barbara, your wife...?

                                 WILSON
                        I pay for that every day. This is 
                        about you and me. 

           She fishes in her purse on the bedside table and pulls out 
           her PASSPORT.

                                 BOBBI
                        See this? 
                              (flipping through it)
                        I never even had a passport before 
                        I met you. Now look at all the 
                        places I’ve been. 

           He moves to the bed.

                                 WILSON
                        It doesn’t matter I’m not working 
                        for the government any more?

                                 BOBBI
                        Baby, I never knew you were working 
                        for the government. So what’s the 
                        difference?

           She kisses him hard.

                                 BOBBI (CONT’D)
                        Never apologize, remember?

           And he slides on top of her.

           INT./EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - DAY

           Barbara and Shackley’s Wife lean against a rail fence, 
           watching Shackley’s Daughter ride her horse. But no Shackley.

           Wilson watches from a second-floor window. Disappointed.
           When Barbara turns to look up at the window, Wilson has gone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, MOUNT AIRY FARM - DAY

           Barbara holds expensive-looking animal-print swatches up 
           against the furniture.

                                 WILSON
                        You re-decorated six months ago.

                                 BARBARA
                        And it shows. Nobody’s doing 
                        English country any more.

                                 WILSON
                        At least wipe your ass with my 
                        cash. Get some use from it.

                                 BARBARA
                        You’re disgusting. You want to play 
                        with Senators and Congressmen then 
                        we have to look like we belong.
                              (off his unkempt look)
                        At least one of us anyway. Look at 
                        you. You’re like a teenage girl who 
                        just got dumped.

                                 WILSON
                        Fuck you, too, Barbara.

           Wilson, visibly ruffled, walks out of the room.

                                 BARBARA
                        Sorry, baby, I guess Teddy didn’t 
                        ask you to the prom.

           INT./EXT. KITCHEN, MOUNT AIRY FARM - NIGHT

           Wilson, in ratty robe and slippers, fixes himself a stiff 
           drink. 

                                 WILSON
                              (on phone)
                        Yeah, four million guaranteed...
                        Lumber out of Jakarta. Rubber, too.

           Wilson fiddles with reception on a small black-and-white TV 
           set sitting on the counter.

           National news. Headline says: “HALLOWEEN MASSACRE.”

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                              (bored/hanging up)
                        Sounds real good.
                                 NATIONAL NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...nine-hundred agents got their 
                        pink slips in what critics are 
                        calling a CIA mea culpa for crimes 
                        past, present and future.

           Wilson makes a face when the network cuts to Turner 
           addressing the media:

                                 TURNER
                        The reduction in Human Intelligence 
                        agents is regrettable but--

           Wilson checks the wall clock: 8:00. SNAP. Wilson shuts off 
           the set.

           He grabs BINOCULARS off the counter and peers out the window 
           into the night: 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - CONTINUOUS

           Across the street, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN steps out of her house 
           to walk her dog.

                                 WILSON
                              (to self)
                        Right on time.

           In the near ground through the binoculars, Wilson sees 
           Shackley’s gold Lincoln come to a stop a hundred yards down 
           the drive way.

           Wilson lowers the binoculars. Brightens. Then instinctively 
           checks his reflection in the pane, and smooths down his hair.

           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - NIGHT

           Wilson walks down the driveway towards the idling Lincoln, in 
           his robe and carrying his drink.

           A suicide door opens. Wilson steps in from the cold.

           INT. SHACKLEY’S LINCOLN - NIGHT

           Wilson sits next to Shackley, who stares into the void. 
           Wilson knows well enough to shut up until Shackley’s finally 
           ready to speak.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I tried explaining to Turner how
                        things work. What does he do? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHACKLEY (CONT'D)
                        That shit stain shows me one of the 
                        new keyhole satellite photos like 
                        it’s some centerfold he just ass-
                        fucked and says: “This is now the 
                        Agency’s primary asset. It will 
                        never be blackmailed. Never disobey 
                        an order. Never break the law or 
                        embarrass this Agency and this 
                        nation in any way.”

                                 WILSON
                        Self-righteous prick.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        He has no fucking clue what it
                        takes to do my job. Satellites and
                        radar don’t cut it without boots on 
                        the ground. Only people can tell 
                        the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ of a thing.
                        Without them, we’re flying blind 
                        out there. I’m down to four agents 
                        in all of Iran; none speak Farsi
                        for chrissakes. Situation’s even 
                        worse in Iraq, Afghanistan.
                        Russians have got the playing field 
                        all to themselves. 

           Shackley looks him square in the eye, asks the question he 
           came to ask:

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Ed, do you believe in what we 
                        started?

                                 WILSON
                        I’d build a church in its name.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I’ve made a decision. I swore to 
                        protect this nation, and I won’t 
                        sit by while Stanislav Turner 
                        surrenders the Cold War to Moscow.
                        Covert Ops must and will continue 
                        at previous levels or God help us 
                        all.

                                 WILSON
                        It’s about fucking time.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        This means operating off the books.
                                 WILSON
                        All the better. I don’t want any
                        second-guessing.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Then it’s settled. Let history be 
                        our judge, not Stansfield fucking
                        Turner. From now on, you are my 
                        eyes and ears in Libya.

           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - MINUTES LATER

           Wilson walks back towards the house as the Lincoln’s tail 
           lights disappear down the drive.

           Barbara stands in the open doorway, watching. She has to step 
           aside as he pushes on past.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m not just going to the dance, 
                        I’m the fucking prom king.

           EXT. TRIPOLI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, TRIPOLI, LIBYA - DAY

           A Beechcraft Jet touches down.

           INT. BEECHCRAFT - DAY

           Wilson with his fish-out-of-water farmhand, Doug Schlachter.

                                 WILSON
                        You’re my bodyguard. Stay close, 
                        don’t say a thing and act like 
                        you’re packing.

           Wilson gives him the once-over. Schlachter isn’t entirely 
           convincing, so Wilson hands him a pair of aviator dark 
           sunglasses. 

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Wear these.

           EXT. TARMAC, TRIPOLI AIRPORT, TRIPOLI, LIBYA - DAY

           Wilson steps off the plane. Schlachter at his heels.

           Two ELITE GUARDS frisk them thoroughly before Wilson is 
           greeted by several LIBYAN OFFICIALS.

                                 LIBYAN OFFICIAL
                        Welcome to Libya.
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I don’t have to tell you, you know 
                        what it’s like to be abandoned by 
                        your country. 

           EXT. AIRPORT ROAD, TRIPOLI - DAY

           Limousine heads into the city. Looming images of Qaddafi
           flutter on propaganda-laden posters along the road.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Years of devoted service, learning 
                        a special set of skills, 
                        disciplining yourself to think a 
                        certain way, being told you’re the 
                        shit’s tits.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

           Wilson and Schlachter ride in the back. A world of camels, 
           goats and more goats just beyond the power windows.

           The Elite Guards ride with them. Armed and grim-faced.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Only to have the rug pulled out. 
                        Some paper pusher with folded arms 
                        saying: “ You’re no longer needed. 
                        So forget what we taught you...

           EXT. TRIPOLI HILTON - DAY

           Wilson steps out of the limo. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...and go get a job flipping 
                        burgers.”

           INT. ELEVATOR, TRIPOLI HILTON - DAY

           Wilson and Schlachter ride with their Libyan Escorts.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Well, with all due respect, sir, a-
                        hole, sir, God and the US 
                        government built me this way. 
                        Anything else is just a lie.

           INT. PENTHOUSE HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Wilson and Schlachter ENTER. More Guards. More guns. 

           There’s no misreading the raised stakes and more dangerous 
           game Wilson has begun. 
           Wilson has a moment of doubt: “Was this a good idea?” He even 
           judges the distance to the door, but then:

           In walks MAJOR ABDULLAH HIJAZZI, stone-faced chief of Libya’s 
           military and intelligence operations. And Wilson has no 
           choice but to plunge right in.

                                 WILSON
                              (shaking hands)
                        Major Hijazzi.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        Mr. Ed.

           Wilson moves to correct the TV talking horse reference but 
           thinks better of it.

           MINUTES LATER

           Now seated.

                                 WILSON
                        As I explained to your consultant 
                        in London, under no circumstances 
                        can I sell you any weapons intended 
                        for military purposes. To do so 
                        would violate my country’s arms 
                        embargo and subject me to federal 
                        prosecution.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        We want plastic explosives.

                                 WILSON
                        Not a problem.

           Wilson looks to Schlachter, who takes this as the sign to 
           hand a contract to him. Wilson hands it to Hijazzi.

                                    WILSON (CONT’D)
                        This contract covers, for lack of a 
                        better term, the Covert Activities 
                        previously discussed.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        The plastique.

                                 WILSON
                        Plus detonators, guns, what-have-
                        you. The less said about this 
                        document the better. 

           Wilson looks to Schlachter again. He hands another document 
           to Wilson, who again hands it to Hijazzi.
                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        This contract is for public 
                        consumption. El-Kanumi Oil Company 
                        is hiring Inter-Technologies 
                        Incorporated to oversee minefield 
                        clearing operations; these will 
                        parallel covert activities wherever 
                        and whenever possible. A team of 
                        Explosive and Ordnance Experts will 
                        function in both their “Cover 
                        Activity” and covert assignment 
                        with the same professional skill 
                        and expertise required by both.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        I am impressed.

                                 WILSON
                        These same experts will 
                        simultaneously train selected 
                        students in sabotage operations, 
                        employing the latest techniques of 
                        clandestine explosive ordnance.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        I can see why the CIA hired you... 
                        and fired you.

                                 WILSON
                        Yeah, well sometimes when the Lord 
                        closes a door he opens a goddamn
                        bank vault.
                              (catching himself)
                        Allah, too, I bet.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        Allah does not offer financial 
                        reward. But it is His will that 
                        Qaddaffi open his vault... after 
                        you deliver the C-4. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        C-4. Only a nuclear reaction 
                        carries more explosive impact. 

           EXT. BROWER AND ASSOCIATES, SANTA BARBARA, CA - DAY

           Elegant Spanish style home converted to offices. A new 
           MERCEDES COUPE in a parking space reserved for JEROME BROWER.

           A dusty rental car in the Visitor space next to it.
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        It’s manufactured under strict 
                        control. Buying direct means 
                        answering a shitload of questions. 

           INT. BROWER AND ASSOCIATES, SANTA BARBARA, CA - DAY

           Wilson meets JEROME BROWER (40’s). The handshake feels funny 
           to Wilson....

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        So I went to the largest wholesaler 
                        on the West Coast, Jerry Brower.

           ...that’s because Brower’s missing two-and-a-half fingers on 
           his right hand.

                                 BROWER
                              (off missing fingers)
                        Occupational hazard.

           MINUTES LATER

           Brower and Wilson huddle together in discussion.

                                 BROWER
                        Putting C-4 on a plane is illegal. 
                        Sending C-4 on a plane to Libya is 
                        treason. Why should I get involved 
                        in this operation of yours?

                                 WILSON
                        I’m not an expert in explosives or 
                        anything else. But I know people 
                        and what they want.

                                 BROWER
                        Seeing as you came all this way, 
                        I’ll bite: What do I want?

                                 WILSON
                        You already got money. But what you 
                        want...is more money.

           From Brower’s look, we know this is true.

           EXT. HOUSTON AIRPORT - NIGHT

           MATT SMITH, Brower’s chemical engineer, loads 50 pounds worth 
           of C-4 plastic explosives into a 5-gallon metal drum. The C-4
           is covered with another 10 pounds of gray sludge. A lid is 
           tamped down and a label affixed to the front: “DRILLING MUD.” 
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I figured, if Qaddafi wants plastic 
                        explosives, there’s no point moving 
                        it in dribs and drabs. Forty 
                        pounds...

           Pull back to reveal: 855 MORE DRUMS just like it crowding the 
           area. Even Smith can’t believe it.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...or forty thousand, it’s the same 
                        flavor of illegal.

           EXT. TARMAC, HOUSTON AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Drums are loaded onto a DC-8 cargo plane.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        So why take a dozen chances when 
                        you can only take one?

           INT. DC-8 CARGO PLANE, MIAMI - NIGHT

           As the plane re-fuels, Wilson joins Brower and Smith inside.

                                 WILSON
                        Jesus, what’s that stink?

                                 BROWER
                        This plane’s been doing meat runs 
                        from South America. You get used to 
                        it.

                                 WILSON
                              (to self)
                        Always with the fucking cows.

           Smith looks more than a little shell-shocked sitting amongst 
           the packed C-4.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                              (to Brower/off Smith)
                        He alright?

                                 BROWER
                              (louder, for Smith)
                        Matt’s wife just had twins is all. 
                        Isn’t that right, Doug?

                                 SMITH
                              (weakly)
                        Yes, sir.

           shoes, nearby.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I told Major Hijazzi we’d stolen it 
                        from a US army base. Even charged 
                        him for the drilling mud... at C-4
                        prices.

                        For detonators, I called in some 
                        favors at the Agency.

                        Sure I can get you samples. Give me

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        And now it’s down to finding the 
                        right personnel to train our hosts 
                        in the proper handling of these 
                        materials...

           INT. BAR, WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           Wilson holds court. A dozen, fairly drunk EX-GREEN BERETS 
           hang on his every word.

                                 WILSON
                        ...I don’t mind saying, this is my 
                        favorite moment, right here. When I 
                        get the chance to change good men’s 
                        fortunes. Pick a man up and get him 
                        back to doing what he does best. 
                        Civilian life hasn’t been good to 
                        y’all, am I right?

           The Berets shake their heads in agreement, all but a SOBER 
           BERET named MULCAHY. He sips his Diet Coke and listens 
           carefully.

           Wives and Girlfriends look a bit nervous. Bobbi Barnes offers 
           them re-assuring smiles.

                                 SLOW BERET
                        I don’t know how to say this, 
                        exactly but...
                                 WILSON
                        It’s okay soldier. We’re all 
                        friends here.

                                 SLOW BERET
                        I mean we are talking CIA, right?

           Gung-Ho Beret slaps Slow Beret on the back of his head.

                                 GUNG-HO BERET
                        Shut the fuck up, Whitey. We’re in 
                        a goddamn bar.

                                 WILSON
                        No. It’s the right question to be 
                        asking yourselves.
                              (to the Women)
                        You mind excusing us for a moment?

                                 BOBBI
                        C’mon gals. Let’s put some music on 
                        the jukebox.

           Bobbi and the other women move to the other side of the bar.

                                 WILSON
                        There are very specific parameters 
                        around what I can say and what I 
                        can’t say. But this is the real 
                        deal, gentlemen. I shit you not.

                                 SOBER BERET/MULCAHY
                        I got an uncle retired from 
                        Langley. I’m gonna have to talk it 
                        over with him before I make up my 
                        mind.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m not gonna tell you what to do. 
                        But in my experience nothing will 
                        cut you out of this thing faster 
                        than going around asking questions. 
                        Speaks to character and 
                        professionalism.

                              (to Mulcahy)
                        Don’t fuck it up for the rest of 
                        us, Mulcahy.

           Wilson raises his beer bottle. 
                                 WILSON

                        oppressed! 

           The Ex-Green Berets raise theirs. Mulcahy’s a hair slower 
           than the rest with his soda.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        That’s you. That’s me. That’s 
                        anywhere the Reds wanna be.

           They all drink lustily.

                        Morning, ladies!

           The Berets become a jumble of confusion. Some covering their 
           hung-over heads with pillows. Others, assuming themselves in 
           mid-battle, flail about for gear they can’t find.

           Wilson ENTERS.

                                 WILSON
                        Wake up. We’ve got a job to do!

           A CAMEL passes the open doorway. The Berets seem to have no 
           idea how they got here.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        First things first. Doug, here’s, 
                        gonna come by with a marker. You 
                        give him the name of the sweetest 
                        girl you know. He’s gonna put that 
                        name on your right hand and you 
                        will make love to that girl 
                        whenever the urge takes you. But 
                        under no circumstances will you

                        No disrespect, sir, but I’m not 
                        sure you can hold me to something I 
                        don’t much recall signing.

                                 WILSON
                        That’s because there are no 
                        contracts. We’re all men of honor. 
                        Meaning, if I break my word, I’m 
                        confident you boys’ll track me down 
                        and kill me. And vice versa.

           sized piece of C-4.
           MOMENTS LATER

           Using a long wand, Smith flips open a hardback book resting 
           on a table in the open air. The book EXPLODES with impressive

           From a much greater distance, the power to the shed is 
           switched on. The EXPLOSION blows the shed to ribbons.

           turned and ghostly pale despite the intense desert sun.

           Mulcahy bends over and pukes his guts out.

                        The Russians won’t sell us the 
                        newest avionics.

                                 WILSON
                        The MiG-29’s a lot like our F/A-15
                        Hornet. I got guys who can upgrade 
                        you.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        And we want a larger payload 
                        capability. Like the Hornet.

                                 WILSON
                        Sure.

                                 HIJAZZI
                        And the payload itself.

                                 WILSON
                        I can get you some Mavericks. But I  
                        can’t risk shipping missiles in-
                        country. Mountain’s gonna have to 
                        come to Muhammed on this one... At 
                        least just over the border anyway.

                        Karl?

           MINUTES LATER

           Shackley and Wilson watch their TEAM go to work on the jets. 
           Adding avionics. Fitting the undercarriages to handle the 
           Mavericks.

           The Libyan Pilots and accompanying Military keep an eye out.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        We’ve never been this close to the 
                        MiG Fulcrum before. The Russians 
                        brag about it’s strengths... but 
                        soon we’ll understand it’s 
                        weaknesses. 

           Then we see what the Libyans don’t: Shackley’s Team taking 
           surreptitious spy-camera photos of the planes, 
           instrumentation, etc.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Outstanding work. You’re the eye in 
                        the sky, the ear on the ground and 
                        the hand in the Devil’s pocket. 
                        You’re the fucking reason we’re

                        Yeah, you were happy, the Libyans 
                        were happy and I was getting by.

                              (tearing up check)
                        I understand.

                        perhaps?

                                 WILSON
                        I’ll be stopping in Zurich on my

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Then Orlando Letelier made the 
                        news...

           An EXPLOSION rips through the car’s undercarriage. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I’d never heard of the one-time 
                        Chilean Ambassador but apparently 
                        he said some nasty things about the

                        So any idiot would figure it was 
                        spicks who did the job but somehow

           Two Pulitzer’s sit on a shelf behind him, like peregrine 
           falcons.

                        Let me speak to Larry Barcella.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BARCELLA’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - SAME TIME

           Assistant US Attorney, LARRY BARCELLA (30’s), pathologically 
           dedicated prosecutor in the Letelier case talks to co-lead
           and fellow US Attorney, CAROL BRUCE (30’s).

           Barcella has a wicked cold. Squeezes NASAL SPRAY into one 
           nostril: empty. Pulls ANOTHER SPRAY from a drawer.

                                 BRUCE
                        You should see a doctor.

                                 BARCELLA
                        It’s sweet that you care, Carol.

                                 BRUCE
                        You can drop dead. I just don’t 
                        want to catch it. I’ve got a date 
                        Saturday.

                                 BARCELLA’S SECRETARY (O.S.)
                              (reverent/via intercom)
                        Bob Woodward on line one.

           Barcella pantomimes jerking off.
                                 BARCELLA
                              (into intercom)
                        Put him through.

                                 WOODWARD
                        Assistant US Attorney Larry 
                        Barcella? This is Bob Woodward.

           There’s an arrogance to Woodward, who still rides high from 
           his Watergate fame.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Woodward? The detective from 
                        Anacostia?

           This cracks up Bruce, who EXITS LAUGHING.

                                 WOODWARD
                        From the Washington Post.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Sure, okay.

                                 WOODWARD
                        I’m writing a column on the lead 
                        suspect in the Letelier bombing, Ed 
                        Wilson. Was hoping you might 
                        comment.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Sure, no problem, Bob, only it’s 
                        not DOJ policy to discuss suspects, 
                        plus I’ve never heard of this 
                        fucking guy. 

                                 WOODWARD
                        You ought to, seeing as ATF and the 
                        FBI are both looking into reports 
                        that Wilson tapped his CIA 
                        connections to purchase a half-
                        million detonators and Class 4 
                        explosives.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Off the record, Bob, we figure 
                        Cubans for Letelier.

                                 WOODWARD
                        And I’ve got a source that has 
                        Wilson meeting with CIA-trained 
                        Cuban assassins... 

           Pull back to reveal KEVIN MULCAHY, drunk and blotchy, sitting 
           in Woodward’s office.
                                 WOODWARD (CONT’D)
                        ...two days before the Letellier
                        hit.

                                 BARCELLA
                        You suppose if you were looking to 
                        rig a car bomb, you’d buy an extra 
                        four-hundred and ninety nine 
                        thousand detonators, you know, in 
                        case?

                                 WOODWARD
                        You planning to interview Wilson?

                                 BARCELLA
                        If I do, your story suddenly gets 
                        juicy federal bona fides.

                                 WOODWARD
                        I’m running it either way.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (cornered)
                        Which means I look like a chump, if 
                        I don’t.

                                 WOODWARD
                        I’ll assume that’s off the record, 
                        too.

           INT. WAITING AREA, BARCELLA’S OFFICE, JUSTICE DEPT. - DAY

           Wilson sits. Fidgets. He’s not one for magazines.

                        On paper, I’d already committed 
                        more than a hundred felonies and 
                        the first time I show up on the 
                        Fed’s radar it’s for something I 
                        didn’t do. Go figure.

           A framed message on the wall catches his eye: “The first 
           thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” -- William

           Amen.

           INT. BARCELLA’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - DAY

           Wilson meets with Barcella and Bruce.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Ed, I’m Larry Barcella. This is 
                        Carol Bruce. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARCELLA (CONT'D)
                        We want to ask a few questions in 
                        connection with the Letelier
                        Assassina--

                                 WILSON
                        You know, I’ve always wondered, 
                        what kind of person goes into law? 
                        I mean, it’s all about limitations. 
                        “You can’t do this.” “Don’t even 
                        think about trying that.” It’s 
                        practically un-American when you 
                        think about it. This country’s 
                        about freedom.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Freedom is a privilege, not a 
                        right. Some people abuse it. That’s 
                        when we step in.

                                 WILSON
                              (ignoring him)
                        Then, if you gotta be a lawyer, why 
                        work for the government? You gotta 
                        be GS-16, 17 tops. So your take-
                        home’s thirty-five, thirty-six. I 
                        thought lawyers were supposed to be 
                        smart, right?

                                 BARCELLA
                        How about we ask the questions and 
                        you answer them?

           Wilson throws up his hands.

                                 WILSON
                        Guess it’ll have to remain a 
                        mystery. Fire away.

                                 BARCELLA
                        We have it on good authority that 
                        former Ambassador Letelier was 
                        killed by two Cubans working for 
                        the Chilean government.

                                 BRUCE
                        We also know from the FBI that you 
                        met some Cubans, two miles from the 
                        crime scene.

           Barcella shows Wilson some surveillance photos to corroborate 
           this information.
                                 WILSON
                        And Langley’s only ten. We all know 
                        you can’t throw a rock without 
                        hitting a CIA-trained Cuban around 
                        here.

           Barcella shows Wilson a handful of thin DETONATOR PENCILS 
           like the ones Wilson sourced from Weisenberger.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (off detonators)
                        Gotta be Steve Carlton to hit one 
                        of these.

                                 WILSON
                              (genuinely disappointed)
                        You’ll never catch these guys. 
                        You’re nowhere smart enough.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Answer the damn question.

                                 WILSON
                        You didn’t ask one. Look, you 
                        really want to play this out?

                                 BARCELLA
                        Did you not purchase a half-million 
                        of these detonators?

                                 WILSON
                        I’ve got a large contract for mine-
                        clearing.

                                 BARCELLA
                        In Libya.

                                 WILSON
                        Yeah. “In Libya.” Which has what 
                        exactly to do with today’s episode 
                        of Perry Mason?

                                 BARCELLA
                        You tell me.

           Wilson takes one of the timing pencil and twists it to break 
           open the internal acid cap. Bruce is on her feet. Nervous.

                                 BARCELLA (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?
                                 WILSON
                        Relax. From what I understand, 
                        there’s two kinds of detonators: 
                        timers and remotes. Forensics tell 
                        you what kind they put under that 
                        Chevelle?

                                 BARCELLA
                        Remote, once they knew Letelier was 
                        in the car.

           The detonator makes a POP as it goes off. Bruce jumps. Even 
           Barcella flinches, which gives Wilson a smirk of 
           satisfaction.

                                 WILSON
                        Guess I bought the other kind.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Fifteen years CIA, oh but you’re 
                        just guessing.

                                 WILSON
                        I’d love to talk about the agency, 
                        only that’s way over your security 
                        clearance, Larry. But trust me, I 
                        wouldn’t know a detonator from a 
                        coffee pot.

                                 BARCELLA
                        With all you don’t know, I can see 
                        why Turner fired you.

                                 WILSON
                        Okay, there’s something I do know 
                        about the trigger man, but this 
                        stays between us. 
                              (conspiratorial)
                        His name starts with an X, Y or 
                        Z... 

           Barcella leans in ever so slightly.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause you’re up to the W’s and you 
                        ain’t found shit.

           LATER

           Wilson EXITS.

                                 BARCELLA
                        I state the obvious when I say I 
                        fucking hate that guy.
                                 BRUCE
                        He’s an asshole, but he’s not our 
                        asshole. Let it go.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (unconvincing)
                        Sure, sure.

           EXT. “THE BOMB FACTORY,” OUTSIDE BENGHAZI - DAY

           Schlachter talks with Wilson but their conversation is 
           interrupted as nearby

           Matt Smith reacts to the sight of some Trainees putting 
           explosives raw materials in a truck.

                                 SMITH
                        That’s Quadrex, not C-4! It’s not 
                        stable. It doesn’t need a detonator 
                        to--

           No one around him understands. Smith starts running toward 
           the truck.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        No detonator! No detonator!

           A Trainee drops a Quadrex-filled box heavily into the bed of 
           the truck. A massive EXPLOSION rips through the vehicle. 
           Killing three Libyan Trainees instantly.

           Wilson is as stunned as anybody. But he shakes it off and 
           goes into damage control mode.

                                 WILSON
                              (to Schlachter)
                        Put safety training in the next 
                        contract. And charge extra.

           Doug Smith walks by. Shell-shocked again. Wilson follows.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Matt, you’ve been doing a helluva
                        job. I tell Brower that every damn 
                        day.

                                 SMITH
                              (pale)
                        Thank you, sir.
                                 WILSON
                        From where you sit, I imagine this 
                        operation doesn’t square much with 
                        your idea of standard government 
                        practices.

           Smith hesitates.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Go right ahead now...

                                 SMITH
                        No, sir. It doesn’t.

                                 WILSON
                        I get that. I’ve spent my whole 
                        career in clandestine services and 
                        seen some pretty fucked-up things 
                        first-hand: Laos, Watergate, Bay of 
                        Pigs...

                                 SMITH
                              (wide-eyed)
                        Bay of Pigs?

           Wilson cuts him off with a steadying look: “I’m giving you a 
           peak under the tent, don’t prove yourself unworthy.”

                                 WILSON
                        The nature of the work is like 
                        this: the more crucial an operation 
                        to national security, the fewer the 
                        people trusted with the 
                        information.
                              (off surroundings)
                        That tells you just how fucking
                        important this mission is.

                                 SMITH
                              (gaining confidence)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 WILSON
                        And if somewhere down the road this 
                        thing goes ass-over-tits, and the 
                        people who couldn’t be trusted 
                        start poking around looking for 
                        answers to questions a mile above 
                        their security clearance...

           Wilson pulls one of Turner’s CIA COMMEMORATIVE COINS from his 
           pocket. 
                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        ...well you show them this. This 
                        comes from the CIA Director 
                        himself. God willing it won’t come 
                        to it, but you lay this down and 
                        watch just how fast they change the 
                        subject.

           Wilson hands the coin to Smith with all due gravity.

                                 SMITH
                              (smiling now)
                        You bet, sir.

           INT. TURNER’S OFFICE, CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VA

           Turner unfolds the Washington Post. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Thanks to the Woodward article, 
                        word got out I’d been using CIA 
                        contacts to help supply the 
                        Libyans. 

           He zeroes in on the Bob Woodward column.

           COVERT OPS FLOOR

           Seething, Turner marches through the halls. The way Agents 
           stare and get out of the way, it’s clear this is a rare 
           occurrence.

           WEISENBERGER’S OFFICE

           THWACK. The Post lands on Weisenberger’s desk. The detonator 
           supplier looks up to see Turner staring down at him. Furious.

                                 TURNER
                        Clean out your desk. You’re 
                        through.

           INT. “THE BUBBLE” AUDITORIUM, NEAR CIA HEADQUARTERS

           The Agency’s 500-seat briefing auditorium.

           Turner addresses the troops. A huge photo of Wilson behind 
           him. Shackley among those in attendance.

                                 TURNER
                        Edwin Wilson is toxic...

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        So Turner comes after me like I’m 
                        cancer?
           EXT. ARMY BASE, OUTSIDE TRIPOLI - DAY

           Wilson shows a group of RUSSIAN ENGINEERS how to assemble and 
           attach a US Army night scope on a T-80 RUSSIAN TANK. One of 
           the Engineers admires Wilson’s clothes. Shares a drink from 
           Wilson’s private stash.

           Wilson takes a PHOTO of the Engineer, smiling in front of the 
           tank. KA-FLASH.

           EXT. STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND - NIGHT

           Wilson walks along.

                                 TURNER (O.S.)
                        ...He is shit on your shoe. 

           EXT. STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND - NIGHT

           Wilson looks to be sure he isn’t being followed.

                                 TURNER (O.S.)
                        Any interaction, social or 
                        professional, will trigger your 
                        immediate dismissal.

           Wilson ENTERS

           INT. ELEPHANT & CASTLE PUB, LONDON - CONTINUOUS

           Wilson stands inside the doorway... 

                                 TURNER (O.S.)
                        And a traitor to this country.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Calls me a godammn traitor...?

           ...until he spots SHACKLEY sitting in a booth towards the 
           back.

           BOOTH - MINUTES LATER

           Wilson shows Shackley PHOTO of the Russian Engineer in front 
           of the T-80 Tank.

                                 WILSON
                        ...What he should be doing is 
                        pinning the intelligence star on my 
                        chest. 
                              (off photo)
                        Name’s Ilya Gregorich. Has an eye 
                        for the finer things; think he 
                        might be turned.
                                 SHACKLEY
                              (pocketing photo)
                        Nice work. I’ll see what the boys 
                        can find on him.
                              (pivoting)
                        Turner’s grandstanding. Don’t worry 
                        about him.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m not worried about nobody.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. COURTROOM, FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Barcella takes a break from closing arguments to take a hit 
           from the nasal spray.

           Two chairs face the jurors. A PHOTOGRAPH sits on each:

                                 BARCELLA
                        Nothing you do will bring back 
                        Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffet
                        to fill these seats.

           Barcella takes the photos away.

                                 BARCELLA (CONT’D)
                        But you can help bring back the two 
                        men being tried in absentia today 
                        for their murder: 

           Barcella props two new PHOTOGRAPHS on the chairs:

                                 BARCELLA (CONT’D)
                        Jose Suarez and Virgil Romero. What 
                        you can do, what you must do, is 
                        bring these killers to justice. 
                        Give me a guilty verdict; give me 
                        the power to hunt them down 
                        anywhere in the world these cowards 
                        hide. And I swear to you, I will 
                        not rest until they sit in answer 
                        for their crimes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN, MOUNT AIRY FARMS - NIGHT

           Wilson and a sour-faced Barbara host a lavish CHRISTMAS 
           PARTY. Barbara is none-too-pleased to play the role of 
           glorified caterer to SENATORS and MILITARY PERSONNEL. 

           Wilson moves on. Hands a high ball to a TEXAS SENATOR.
                                 TEXAS SENATOR
                        President’s got us holed up  
                        debating his budget plan while he 
                        kicks back at Camp David. 

                                 WILSON
                        Mount Airy isn’t Camp David... it’s 
                        three times bigger. 

           LAUGHTER all around.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        I hope you find it comfortable, 
                        Senator.

                                 TEXAS SENATOR
                        I surely do, Ed. But I wish I could 
                        do a bit of hunting. April feels 
                        like a long way off about now. 

                                 WILSON
                        My property. My rules.
                              (to the room)
                        And I say it’s hunting season!

           A CHEER goes up from the drunken weekend warriors in 
           attendance. Barbara rolls her eyes.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - NIGHT

           A much more frugal CHRISTMAS PARTY in full swing for all 
           except...

           BARCELLA’S OFFICE

           Barcella who lacks the party mood. He goes through stacks of 
           red-tagged CLOSE-OUT FILES.

           A DRUNK COLLEAGUE props himself up in the doorway.

                                 DRUNK COLLEAGUE
                        We swiped ‘em from the circuit 
                        court.

           Barcella looks over at TWO EMPTY CHAIRS tied with Christmas 
           ribbon in the corner.

                                 DRUNK COLLEAGUE (CONT’D)
                        It’s the thought that counts, 
                        right? 

                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        On your way, Larson.
           Bruce shoves the Colleague/Larson away. Now it’s her turn to 
           linger in the doorway.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        One holiday party for all federal 
                        law enforcement? What it saves in 
                        money it pays for in body odor.

           Barcella doesn’t listen. Still stares at the chairs.

                                 BARCELLA
                        They drum it into our heads: get 
                        the verdict. Well we got it. 
                        “Congrats, now move on to the next 
                        one.” Only the murderers are still 
                        out there. So where’s the justice?

                                 BRUCE
                        I don’t know but you won’t find it 
                        in the close-out files. Those cases 
                        are headed to the shredder for a 
                        reason: they’re unwinnable.

                                 BARCELLA
                        I want a case with a face to it. A 
                        face I can hate.

           He keeps reading. She lingers on the threshold, debating... 
           then moves in to help.

                                 BRUCE
                        Move over, Grinch.

           As she grabs a file, he notices the ENGAGEMENT RING on her 
           finger.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (off ring)
                        When did that happen?

                                 BRUCE
                        I have no idea.

           INT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - SAME TIME

           Senator and others grab booze and put on their coats.

                                 BARBARA
                        We haven’t seen you in six months. 
                        You should be spending time with 
                        your boys.
                                 WILSON
                        Well get ‘em down here.
                              (shouting at stairs)
                        Erik! Wyatt! Get on down here!

           WYATT (8) and ERIK (6) dutifully come down the stairs.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        You wanna go hunting with your dad?

           Wilson is miffed to see the boys look to Barbara for 
           guidance.

                                 WYATT
                        Guns are dangerous. We’re not 
                        supposed to play with them.

                                 WILSON
                        Guns are safe when you know how. 
                        Your old man’s gonna show you.

                                 KARL
                        Mama said we could make cookies.

                                 WILSON
                        Suit yourselves.
                              (heading for door/to 
                              Barbara)
                        You’re turning them against me.

                                 BARBARA
                              (to closing door)
                        You’re doing that all by yourself.

           INT. BARCELLA’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Barcella opens another “dead-end” file: “EDWIN P. WILSON.” 
           Bingo. He shows it to Bruce.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Remember our friend Ed Wilson? 
                        Investigated for supplying 
                        explosives to Libya. And for 
                        conspiracy to commit murder in the 
                        Letelier case.

                                 BRUCE
                        Letelier? We know that’s the wrong 
                        tree. And the weapons charges...
                              (reading)
                        “Insufficient evidence to proceed.” 
                        Both FBI and ATF came to the same 
                        conclusion.
                                 BARCELLA
                        But they both know he did it. 
                        Agents?

                                 BRUCE
                              (checking file)
                        Pederson... and Hart. But--

                                 BARCELLA
                        You know Bill Hart?
                              (off her nod)
                        Find him. I’ll get Pederson.

           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - SAME TIME

           Schlachter drives one of four surplus Army Jeeps retrofitted 
           with airport FLOODLIGHTS mounted on the hoods. Wilson, Texas 
           Senator and Others bounce around in the back, drunk as 
           skunks, toting SEMI-AUTOMATIC M-16 RIFLES.

           Everybody’s whooping it up as they scan the open fields and 
           brush for foxes and deer.

           Schlachter coasts to a stop. The floodlight catches a 6-point
           STAG nibbling a snow-tipped juniper bush.

                                 WILSON
                        Easy now...

           INT. CHRISTMAS PARTY

           Barcella tracks down no-nonsense ATF AGENT DICK PEDERSON.

           Bruce comes back with jokey FBI AGENT BILL HART.

                                 HART
                              (off Pederson)
                        Hide your drinks everybody. 
                        Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is in 
                        the house.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (waving file)
                        Ed Wilson.

                                 HART
                              (disappointed/to Bruce)
                        I thought we were headed to the 
                        copier room to make out.
                                 PEDERSON
                        The son-of-a-bitch is guilty. But 
                        we can’t prove he shipped those 
                        explosives; not without grand jury 
                        subpoenas.

                                 BARCELLA
                        What about the conspiracy charge?

                                 BRUCE
                        He didn’t do Letelier--

           Barcella cuts her off with his hand. Waits on Hart.

                                 HART
                        Conspiracy-to-murder is a non-
                        starter because, as we all know too 
                        well, it isn’t illegal in the 
                        District.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Not exactly.
                              (Hail Mary)
                        DC was carved out in 1801. The 
                        enacting legislation stated that 
                        any Maryland criminal statutes not 
                        in conflict with DC criminal code 
                        remained on the capital’s books. 
                        That includes conspiracy to 
                        murder... in theory.

                                 HART
                        In theory, Pederson could get laid 
                        tonight.

                                 PEDERSON
                              (to Barcella)
                        I’ve had a few drinks so let me see 
                        if I’ve got this straight: You want 
                        to establish a two-hundred year old 
                        precedent to go after a guy for a 
                        crime he didn’t do, so you can 
                        uncover evidence for ones he did?

                                 BARCELLA
                        That’s right.

                                 PEDERSON
                        Will it play?

                                 BARCELLA
                        Don’t look at me.
                              (RE: Bruce)
                        She’s got the bullshit detector.
           All eyes on Bruce.

                                 BRUCE
                              (coming on board)
                        Everybody wants Wilson. It’ll play.

                                 BARCELLA
                        He wasn’t our asshole but he is 
                        now.

           The Senator aims and squeezes the trigger. TACK-TACK-TACK-
           TACK-TACK. Bullets fly. The stag takes off. First leaping one 
           direction and then another, as a hundred rounds tear through 
           the night air.

                                 WILSON
                        More ammo. More foxes. Whatever you 
                        need, Senator. That’s what I’m here 
                        for.

           Senator, Wilson and Company LAUGH drunkenly amidst the spent 
           bullet casings.

           A bulletin board crammed with note cards and multi-colored

                        I invented this game. Hiding CIA 
                        ops from foreign governments or the 
                        other way around -- same

                                 BARCELLA

                        No jury in the world could follow

                        Barcella really wants another swing 
                        at me? He doesn’t have the first 
                        idea. I got it all under control.

           They stop by a RECEPTION TABLE, where they announce 
           themselves and get reunion info. Then move on to

           Pederson looks down his list. Finds Walker’s name and hands 
           him a SUBPOENA out from a stack of them.

                                 HART
                        Congratulations, Jimmy boy. You’ve 
                        been summoned to appear before a 
                        federal grand jury. Have a good 
                        night.

           Jim walks away. He fishes a BUSINESS CARD for Wilson’s 
           lawyer, John Keats, out of his wallet.

                        When Justice caught up with my 
                        men...

           INT. JOHN KEATS’ OFFICE, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Slow Beret and a bunch of other Berets, who put in time for 
           Wilson in Libya, sit with Wilson’s lawyer, JOHN KEATS.

           The Berets read and rehearse prepared answers.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...my lawyer, Keats, told them 
                        exactly what to say...

           INT. FEDERAL COURT, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Barcella peppers subpoenaed witnesses before Judge Calhoun.
                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        ...which was not a goddamn thing.

           Barcella takes on Slow Beret.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Did you train the Libyans in 
                        terrorist methods?

                                 SLOW BERET
                        No sir. I was hired and paid by a 
                        Swiss company in fulfillment of a 
                        contract to find and dismantle 
                        mines encountered during oil 
                        drilling operations.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        They were protecting themselves.

           LATER

           Barcella takes on Loyal Beret.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Did you work with explosives?

                                 LOYAL BERET
                        I was hired and paid by a Swiss 
                        company in fulfillment of a 
                        contract to find and dismantle 
                        mines encountered during oil 
                        drilling operations.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        They were protecting me.

           LATER

           Barcella takes on Scared Beret.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Did Ed Wilson ever mention 
                        smuggling weapons into Libya.

                                 SCARED BERET
                        No sir. I was hired and paid by a 
                        Swiss company in fulfillment...

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        But mostly, and this makes me 
                        proudest of all, they understood 
                        who the real enemy was.
                                 BARCELLA
                        Your honor, these men have 
                        obviously been coached in their 
                        responses.

                                 JUDGE CALHOUN
                        I’m pretty sure I read somewhere 
                        they have a right to an attorney, 
                        Mr. Barcella.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        The grand jury is supposed to be 
                        secret. But I know everything about 
                        mine. The witnesses tell their 
                        lawyers. Their lawyers tell Keats. 
                        And Keats tells me.

           Barcella sits down next to Bruce. Licked.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Forget the witnesses. We need the C-

                                 BRUCE
                        There are only a handful of 
                        possible suppliers.

           INT. CAROL BRUCE’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - DAY

           Bruce goes through a list of major plastic explosives 
           suppliers. She crosses off the sixth name.

           Dials the next:

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                              (through phone)
                        Jerome Brower and Associates.

                                 BRUCE
                              (on phone)
                        My name’s Abigail Jones. I’m Ed 
                        Wilson’s new secretary and I’m 
                        introducing myself to his 
                        suppliers. 

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Oh, Ed! You tell him he’s wicked 
                        for keeping me out so late last 
                        time he was in town.

           Bruce draws a STAR next to Brower’s name on list.
                                 BRUCE
                        Oh he’s wicked alright.

           INT. BARCELLA’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - DAY

           Barcella, Pederson, Hart and Bruce.

                                 BARCELLA
                        No surprise, Brower’s lawyered up. 
                        He’s not talking.

                                 BRUCE
                        The way we’d do this sort of thing 
                        at the SEC was to get the little 
                        guy to roll over on the big guy.

                                 HART
                        The FBI doesn’t waste time going 
                        after the little guy...
                              (off Pederson)
                        ...We’ve got ATF to do that.

           INT. WILSON’S COMPOUND, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           Wilson sends a message to Barbara on the TELEX: My final 
           offer: two million in cash. Take it or leave it.

           As he walks away, the TELETYPE machine CLACKETY-CLACKS to 
           life. Punching out a brief text message: Wonder Woman misses 
           Papa Bear.

           INT. GENEVA AIRPORT - DAY

           Wilson gets off a plane and is nearly knocked over when Bobbi 
           throws herself into his arms.

                                 BOBBI
                        Oh I’ve missed you!

                                 WILSON
                        Libya isn’t much place for a 
                        liberated woman. How you settling 
                        in?

                                 BOBBI
                        It’s okay I guess. Everything’s 
                        real clean here. Beats Dallas by 
                        miles only it’s just... I don’t 
                        know, all shades of boring, you 
                        know?

                                 WILSON
                        Why don’t I take you shopping?
                                 BOBBI
                        Oh baby, I want a real adventure. 
                        Let’s take a trip. Just you and me. 

                                 WILSON
                        Sure thing.

           He turns her by the shoulders to face the Departures Board.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead and pick.

                                 BOBBI
                        Now? You mean it?

                                 WILSON
                        Anywhere you wanna go. We got the 
                        money. We got the time. That’s what 
                        this is all about ain’t it? That’s 
                        freedom.

           Bobbi steps forward. Gets herself a better look at the 
           options in front of her.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        How about Malta?

                                 BOBBI
                        Is it warm? I’ve got no clothes.

           She’s like a kid in a candy store. Wilson breaks out in a big 
           grin just watching her.

                                 WILSON
                        That’s just how I like you, baby.

           EXT. RENTED VILLA, MALTA - DAY

           Sunrise to sunset view of the Mediterranean. Wilson reclines 
           pool-side, scowling at headline in Herald Tribune: RUSSIA 
           INVADES AFGHANISTAN.

           Bobbi’s arms wrap around him from behind MEOWING like a 
           contented kitten. His mood changes as he takes in her newly-
           bought bikini and sarong. 

                                 WILSON
                              (RE: villa)
                        What do you think?

                                 BOBBI
                        Mmmmmmm. I could live here.
                                 WILSON
                        Too bad it’s not for sale...
                              (waiting until she pouts)
                        ...‘cause I just bought it.

                                 BOBBI
                              (teasing/not mad)
                        “Anywhere you want to go”, huh?

           She slips on top of him.

           EXT. AIRSTREAM, TRAILER PARK, LAKELAND, FLORIDA - DAY

           Matt Smith drinks a beer. Pederson and Hart toss paperwork on 
           a metal camping table.

           Faint BABY CRIES from inside the trailer.

                                 PEDERSON
                        We know all about it, Doug. We got 
                        the flight records that put you and 
                        Brower in Houston; we got two 
                        Lufthansa cargo workers who ID’d
                        you loading the C-4 into barrels.

                                 HART
                        You’re looking at ten years.

           Smith swallows hard, puts down his beer and reaches into his 
           pocket. Like he’s reaching for a holstered gun.

                                 SMITH
                        I was hoping it wouldn’t come to 
                        this.

                                 HART
                        Easy, Matt.

           But Smith pulls out the CIA Commemorative Coin. Slaps it down 
           on the camping table. He sits back like the cat who ate the 
           canary, assuming this explains it all.

           Hart examines the coin. Smiles. Hands it to Peterson. He 
           smiles. 

           Smith’s not getting the reaction he expected:

                                 SMITH
                        That’s from the Director himself.

                                 HART
                              (amused/”gotcha”)
                        Matty, Matt, Matt, you dumb piece 
                        of shit.

                                 HART (CONT'D)
                        You couldn’t be any more fucked if 
                        this thing was made of chocolate.

                                 PEDERSON
                              (pulling out note pad)
                        Let’s start with Brower...

           Smith pulls hard from the beer bottle. Busted.

           INT. BEDROOM, WILSON’S VILLA, MALTA - NIGHT

           Wilson and Bobbi rock the headboard big time. 

                                 WILSON
                        Oh Jesus...

                                 BOBBI
                        Give it to me, Papa Bear.

                                 WILSON
                        Oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...

                                 BOBBI
                        You’re so big... Yeah, like 
                        that....

                                 WILSON
                              (pure pleasure)
                        Fuck yeahhhhh....
                              (searing pain)
                        ...ahhhhhhh!

           He hops off the bed and makes for the bathroom.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Fucking VD.

           Bobbi relaxes on the bed.

                                 BOBBI
                        Mmmmmm. I wish it could be like 
                        this all the time.

           RUNNING WATER from the bathroom.

                                 WILSON (O.S.)
                        What’s that, baby?

                                 BOBBI
                        Why we gotta be apart?

                                 WILSON (O.S.)
                        I gotta be in the desert looking 
                        out for my interests. 
           Wilson returns with a towel around his waist. Sits beside 
           her.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        You know that.

                                 BOBBI
                        I mean why can’t we get married--

           And Wilson’s off the bed again. Blood pounding.

                                 WILSON
                        I told you. My bitch wife won’t 
                        listen to reason. 

                                 BOBBI
                        I never heard of two people hating 
                        each other and not being able to 
                        get a divorce.

                                 WILSON
                        She wants half my money. In cash.

                                 BOBBI
                        So give it to her.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m not selling the farm! Not for 
                        her.

                                 BOBBI
                        Do it for me.

                                 WILSON
                        Not for you either!

           Bobbi puts on a robe and leaves the bedroom. 

           FOYER

           Ed chases her.

                                 WILSON
                        Don’t be that way, baby...

           A KNOCK at the front door. 

           INT./EXT. WILSON’S VILLA

           Three MALTESE POLICEMAN crowd the entry.

                                 MALTESE POLICEMAN #1
                        Edwin Wilson, yes?
                                 WILSON
                        Christ, my wife send you to hand me 
                        more fucking divorce papers?
                              (over shoulder/to Bobbi)
                        Must’ve found me from the paperwork 
                        on this place.

           They put him in handcuffs as Bobbi comes up behind.

                                 MALTESE POLICEMAN #1
                              (confused)
                        Orders of the United States 
                        Embassy. 

                                 WILSON
                        What’re you talking about?

                                 MALTESE POLICEMAN #1
                        You are to be sent home to answer 
                        charges of weapons smuggling.

           They start hauling him away.

                                 BOBBI
                        What’s going on?! Ed?!

                                 WILSON
                        Cash, baby. Get me cash.

           INT. HOLDING CELL, MALTESE POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

           Wilson held alone. Several days of stubble indicate he’s been 
           here awhile.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        This Barcella guy was starting to 
                        get on my nerves. But I still had 
                        moves to play.

           He’s pacing the room. Going stir crazy from the containment.

           INTERROGATION ROOM

           Wilson brought in. Wilson’s Lawyer, Keats, sits with a 
           BRIEFCASE.

           The PRECINCT CAPTAIN ENTERS.

           Keats rises. Puts the briefcase on the table.

                                 KEATS
                        I have no knowledge of the contents 
                        of this case. Good-bye gentlemen.
           Keats EXITS.

                                 WILSON
                        It’s not for me. It’s for you.

           The Captain just looks at him...

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        You’ll want what’s inside. But read 
                        this first.

           Wilson pulls a folded LETTER out of his wallet and hands it 
           to the Captain.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        That is a letter of introduction 
                        from Major Mohammed Hijazzi from 
                        Libyan Intelligence. Very important 
                        man. Very dangerous.

                                 CAPTAIN
                              (reading aloud)
                        “Treat Mister Ed with extreme 
                        courtesy...”

                                 WILSON
                        They are a crazy bunch, the 
                        Libyans. And only two hundred miles 
                        from Malta.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        I think I understand.

                                 WILSON
                              (nodding to briefcase)
                        And that case...

           The Captain opens the case stuffed with US DOLLARS.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Here’s a token of my appreciation 
                        for that understanding.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        I am obligated to send you to 
                        London and to inform your embassy 
                        once this has occurred. 
                              (fingering cash)
                        But diplomatic communications are 
                        often delayed.
                                 WILSON
                              (off cash)
                        Just leave me enough for a ticket 
                        on the next plane out of here, 
                        would ya?

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL, HEATHROW AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Digital clock reads 02:40. A sleepy time at the airport. A 
           handful of Passengers work their way through a half-dozen 
           control stations.

           Wilson scans the options and heads for the weariest Control 
           Officer.

           CONTROL OFFICE - SAME TIME

           An INTERPOL order to detain Wilson lies unnoticed on a 
           facsimile machine.

           PASSPORT CONTROL

           KA-WHUMP. Stamping of his passport.

                                 CONTROL OFFICER
                        Welcome to the UK.

           EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER

           A CAB pulls up to the curb next to Wilson. Window rolls down: 
           Ted Shackley.

           INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

           Wilson and Shackley sit in the back.

                                 WILSON
                        I just spent five days in jail. 
                        Maybe we should come clean.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        The truth is not your friend here.

                                 WILSON
                        Well I’m fucked either way. I tell 
                        DOJ I’m still with the CIA, the 
                        Libyans will cut my head off. Keep 
                        on denying it and I could get the 
                        chair.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Turner really screwed the pooch in 
                        Afghanistan because we didn’t have 
                        an Ed Wilson on the ground.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT'D)
                        Our analysts misread the SatPhotos, 
                        figured Brezhnev was only 
                        posturing. First the Iranian 
                        Revolution, now this. With the 
                        election coming, won’t be much 
                        longer before everyone appreciates 
                        the right way to fight this war. 
                        When Reagan wins, I’ll get Turner’s 
                        job, kill this investigation and 
                        you’ll be holding court at the Old 
                        Ebbitt.

                                 WILSON
                        And if Carter wins?

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Turner’s fuckups in Iran and 
                        Afghanistan mean that’s not going 
                        to happen.

           Wilson starts to get out of the cab. Heads back inside the 
           airport.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hole up in Tripoli, where Barcella 
                        can’t touch you. Let ‘em think you 
                        sold us out. Puts you farther up 
                        Qadaffi’s ass, where we need you.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, WILSON COMPOUND, TRIPOLI - DAY

           Wilson makes it “home.” Exhausted. Fixes himself a whiskey 
           from a dwindling supply.

           He rouses to the CLACKING of the Telex coming to life in 

           OFFICE

           He moves to the machine and reads what has been printed 
           already: Consider this my official response to your proposed 
           settlement offer: 

           After a beat, the rest comes out as he watches: “Go fuck
           yourself.” Sincerely, Barbara Wilson.

           Wilson tosses around a bunch of furniture in his anger.

           LATER - NIGHT

           Wilson’s awoken rudely by the RINGING of the phone. He picks 
           it up, groggy and still angry.
                                 WILSON
                        Fuck you too, Barbara!

                        Did you pick Libya because the 
                        money was good...? 

                                 WILSON

                                 BARCELLA
                        ...Or because it was beyond 
                        extradition?

                                 WILSON

                                 BARCELLA
                        Maybe federal prosecutors aren’t as 
                        dumb as you think.

                        Smarter than my wife anyway.
                              (pivoting)
                        Look, this thing is one big 
                        misunderstanding. 

                                 BARCELLA
                        Okay. Drop by my office and we’ll 
                        sort it out.

                                 WILSON
                        I’ll do that...when the time’s 
                        right.

                                 BARCELLA
                        That doesn’t work for me. See, 
                        later I’m gonna go home, kiss my 
                        kids, enjoy a home-cooked meal -- 
                        you know, the sweet, simple stuff 
                        you take for granted until you’re 
                        holed up in, say, Libya -- but I’m 
                        not going to get any sleep tonight. 
                        I’m going to stay up worrying about

                        The longer you’re at large, the 
                        more sleep I’m gonna lose. And the 
                        more sleep I lose, the more sleep 
                        you’re gonna lose.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m not the terrible guy you think 
                        I am, Larry. There’s a lot you 
                        don’t know about me, a lot of stuff 
                        you can benefit from.

                        I benefit when you’re behind bars.

                        My philosophy’s there’s always a 
                        deal to be made. So how ‘bout we--

                                 BARCELLA
                        Good-night, Ed. Give my love to the

           The line goes DEAD.

           INT. OFFICE, WILSON’S COMPOUND, TRIPOLI - DAY

           Stack of files on Barcella litter the table and floor. Wilson 
           reads up on the Letelier investigation. 

           Bobbi walks around like a caged animal. Picks up a fashion 
           magazine she brought with her...

                        I hate this place. There’s nothing 
                        to do here. It’s worse than 
                        Switzerland.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Afraid I had another rough one last 
                        night. How ‘bout you?

                                 WILSON
                        Not great but I appreciate the 
                        concern.

                                 BARCELLA
                        You don’t have to answer the phone, 
                        you know. Oh, wait, of course you 
                        do. You’re the guy always looking 
                        to make a deal.

                                 WILSON
                              (counter-punching)
                        You ever catch those Cubans, Larry? 
                        The ones who blew up Letelier.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Why do you care?

                                 WILSON
                        Just trying to size up how good you 
                        are at your job.

                                 BARCELLA
                        You know I haven’t. Not yet.

           Barcella can’t stop himself, he turns to stare at the two 
           EMPTY CHAIRS in the corner. Reminders of unfinished business.

                                 WILSON
                        They keep you up, too? Why don’t 
                        you call them instead of me?

                                 BARCELLA
                        You got their number?

           Wilson’s whole mood changes: “Eureka.”

                                 WILSON
                        I’ll get back to you.

           And it’s Wilson’s turn to hang up.

           INT. BEDROOM, BARCELLA’S HOUSE, BETHESDA, MD - NIGHT

           The sound of the phone RINGING rips through the night. Waking 
           Barcella and his Wife.
                                 BARCELLA
                        Hello?

                                 WILSON (O.S.)
                              (through phone)
                        Aw, geez, did I wake you?

                                 BARCELLA
                        Yeah, you fucking did.

                                 WILSON (O.S.)
                              (through phone)
                        Listen, Larry, you wanna do this 
                        dance forever or you wanna meet?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROME, ITALY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           INT. TAXI, ROME - NIGHT

           Barcella, Bruce, Hart and Pederson crowd inside. Bruce 
           struggles to work her seat belt because she’s FOUR MONTHS 
           PREGNANT.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (off her belly)
                        When did that happen?

                                 BRUCE
                        Beats the hell out of me.

           INT./EXT. JOLLY HOTEL, ROME - NIGHT

           They get their luggage from the taxi.

                                 PEDERSON
                        It’s Rome, Larry. How ‘bout we take 
                        advantage of that fact?

                                 HART
                        The pleasures of this place are 
                        only wasted on you, Pederson.

           RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS

                                 BARCELLA
                        If Wilson can tell me where Suarez 
                        and Romero are hiding, I want to 
                        know right away. Six months ago, we 
                        got word they were in Salinas, 
                        Chile. By the time we moved on 
                        them, they were gone.
                              (to Receptionist)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARCELLA (CONT'D)
                        Can you tell me which room Ed 
                        Wilson is staying in?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry, Signore Wilson left a 
                        message: his flight has been 
                        delayed. He will meet you tomorrow.

           Barcella fumes.

           INT./EXT. ROOFTOP BAR, CAVALIERI HOTEL, ROME - NIGHT

           John Keats, Ed Wilson and Bobbi Barnes have a drink. Wilson 
           loves the return to lavish Western surroundings. He makes no 
           effort to hide from Bobbi his ogling of an attractive HOOKER 
           at the bar.

                                 WILSON
                              (toast/off Hooker?)
                        To freedom.

                                 KEATS
                        Don’t get your hopes too high. This 
                        could be a trap.

                                 WILSON
                        I got immunity. In writing. Three 
                        days to settle our differences.

                                 KEATS
                        They could arrest you and worry 
                        about the legal niceties later.

                                 WILSON
                        Let’s find out...

           Wilson signals the Hooker to join their table as Bobbi 
           stifles her disgust.

           The Hooker is over in a flash, sizing up their motley 
           threesome:

                                 HOOKER
                        Five hundred... each.

                                 WILSON
                        You got the wrong idea.

           Bobbi’s look says “I doubt it, sister” as Wilson slips the 
           Hooker some cash.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        If there are any cops in here, 
                        you’d know.
           The Hooker takes the money. Looks around to verify what she 
           already knows.

                                 HOOKER
                        Off duty only. 

           She heads back to the bar. Wilson gives Keats a two-handed 
           shrug: “There, you see?”

                                 KEATS
                        This is your last, best chance to 
                        wrap up this mess. 

                                 WILSON
                        Relax. I got a line on his Cubans. 
                        How good, I can’t say. But by the 
                        time we find out, Ted will be 
                        calling the shots at Langley.

                                 KEATS
                        I know Barcella. He’ll stick by a 
                        plea bargain. But he’s a bulldog. 
                        Blue collar Wop gone Ivy League. If 
                        you fuck with him, he’ll make you 
                        pay for every Dartmouth douchebag
                        who called him the self-righteous 
                        prick that he is.

                                 WILSON
                        You want me to plead?

                                 KEATS
                        To the C-4. Nothing else. You 
                        don’t, and they’ll get you on arms 
                        dealing, terrorist training, 
                        assassination attempts. You’ll 
                        never get out.

                                 WILSON
                        What would I be looking at?

                                 KEATS
                        Five years. Like Brower. 

                                 BOBBI
                        And he only served four months.

                                 KEATS
                        You’d do two years. Tops.

                                 BOBBI
                        Whaddya think, baby?

           Wilson looks out over the wide-open Roman skyline.
                                 WILSON
                        I spent my first eighteen years in 
                        jail. I’m never going back.

           INT. LOBBY, JOLLY HOTEL - MORNING

           Barcella comes out of the elevator. He spots Wilson eating 
           breakfast in the adjacent restaurant.

           RESTAURANT

           Wilson pushes away a fancy omelette with disgust before 
           spotting Barcella.

                                 WILSON
                        Larry! Real good to see you again.

           They shake hands. Wilson’s huge hand swallows up Barcella’s.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Have a seat. You want this? Too 
                        fancy for me.

           Wilson intercepts a passing Waiter...

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                              (to Waiter)
                        Hey, get me a hamburger, would ya?

           ...but the Waiter ignores him.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Food’s just something to keep the 
                        old motor going, know what I mean?

                                 BARCELLA
                        Lost my sense of smell during the 
                        Letelier trial. Too much nasal 
                        spray. So I don’t waste time on 
                        food these days either.

                                 WILSON
                        See, Larry, I knew we had things in 
                        common. I never asked, is it okay I 
                        call you, Larry?

                                 BARCELLA
                        Sure. And I’ll call you Papa Bear. 
                        Let’s get started.

           HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Wilson sits next to Barcella. Pederson, Bruce, Hart and Keats 
           round out the table.
                                 BARCELLA
                        The Letelier fugitives. Where do I 
                        find them?

                                 WILSON
                        Sure, sure, but you’re not gonna
                        care once you hear what else I got 
                        to tell you: Qaddafi’s been looking 
                        to take out Reagan for calling him 
                        a terrorist and what-not; soon as I 
                        got wind, I personally talked him 
                        off that ledge.

                                 BARCELLA
                              (controlled irritation)
                        That’s not anything that can be 
                        verified, Ed.

                                 WILSON
                        How about Arafat? He trusts me. I 
                        can arrange a sit-down between the 
                        PLO and the Israelis. Move the 
                        peace process forward. That’s gotta 
                        be worth something.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Not to me. I don’t make foreign 
                        policy.

           Barcella pours a glass of water to calm himself.

                                 BARCELLA (CONT’D)
                        The fugitives, Suarez and Romero. 
                        Where can I find them?

                                 WILSON
                        I asked around the Cuban emigre 
                        community. I’ve got very good 
                        connections in that world since the 
                        Bay of Pigs.

                                 BARCELLA
                        You weren’t at the--
                              (biting tongue)
                        Go on.

                                 WILSON
                        They’re keeping themselves out of 
                        sight in a town called Salinas, 
                        Chile--

           The words are barely out of Wilson’s mouth before Barcella 
           lunges across the table and grabs him by the throat.
                                 BARCELLA
                        You sack of shit!

                                 WILSON
                        What’s going on?! Get this guy off 
                        me.

           Pederson and Keats step in to pull Barcella away. Hart sits 
           back and enjoys the show.

                                 BARCELLA
                        You belong in every single fucking
                        circle of Hell!

                                 WILSON
                        What’re you talking about?! I’m 
                        trying to help here.

                                 BARCELLA
                        You drag me to Rome... feed me 
                        outdated bullshit! I’m gonna nail 
                        you!

                                 WILSON
                        You bust me, then what? Your kid 
                        can’t live in it. Your wife can’t 
                        fuck it. What the hell’s the point? 
                        You don’t make sense!

                                 BARCELLA
                        Get him out of my sight.

                                 KEATS
                        Let’s go, Ed.

           Keats starts pushing Wilson out of the room.

                                 WILSON
                              (genuinely surprised)
                        Wait! What’s going on?

           Wilson’s been pushed out of sight by now.

                                 WILSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is this? We had a 
                        deal, Larry! Larry?!

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Wilson sits glumly. In the seat in front of him, a Passenger 
           reads the day’s Corriere della Serra. Over the man’s 
           shoulder, Wilson spots a small article with a photo of Ted 
           Shackley.
           Wilson grabs the guy’s paper.

                                 WILSON
                        Scuzie.

           Wilson shoves the paper in front of another Italian, seated 
           next to him.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        You speak English.

                                 PASSENGER
                        A little.

                                 WILSON
                              (pointing to article)
                        What’s that say, right there?

                                 PASSENGER
                              (reading/broken English)
                        The Central Intelligence Agency of 
                        the United States reported the 
                        retirement of former Assistant 
                        Deputy Director Theodore Shackley. 
                        The announcement was made by 
                        Director Stansfield Turner...

           Wilson leans back in his seat. Defeated.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. WILSON’S VILLA, TRIPOLI - DAY

           Wilson, drunk and stir-crazy, carries a sloshing glass of 
           FLASH (fermented potato-based alcohol) mixed with grapefruit 
           juice. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Who does Barcella think he is? 
                        There was a deal to be made. Good 
                        for him, me and the country. Only 
                        he wants the big headlines for 
                        bringing down the “Merchant of 
                        Death”. Can you believe it? That’s 
                        what they call me now. 

           BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dough Schlachter mixes a fresh batch of flash in a tub.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, I’m a rat stuck in a 
                        hole.
           Wilson wanders out into

           COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Berets, fighting boredom, take turns shooting at stray cats 
           with a NAIL GUN.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        We run out of nails, they’ll think 
                        about going home and the good work 
                        we’re doing here ends. I tell you, 
                        the guy that should be put on trial 
                        is that asshole Barcella. 

           INT. BARCELLA’S HOUSE, BETHESDA - NIGHT

           Barcella can’t sleep. His Wife lightly SNORES beside him 
           until he nudges her onto her side.

           He picks up the phone, presumably to call Wilson. Hangs up 
           again. Stares up at the ceiling.

           BEGIN WILSON’S DREAM:

           EXT. MOUNT AIRY FARMS - DAY

           A beautiful day across the rolling hills. We fly high and 
           fast over open fields, grazing cows and running horses. 

           SFX: SMASHING GLASS.

           END WILSON’S DREAM.

           INT. OFFICE, WILSON’S COMPOUND, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           Wilson wakes with a start. Still a bit drunk. Grabs a GUN.

           SFX: SCUFFLING.

                                 WILSON
                        Who’s there?

           Shackley, the Blonde Ghost, steps into the light.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Careful where you point that thing.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Shackley and Wilson huddle on the couch, each with a glass of 
           flash. 

           As Shackley tips his glass, an anxious Wilson gets a glint 
           off his boss’ retirement present: a gold ROLEX WATCH.
                                 WILSON
                        What the hell happened? I gotta 
                        read in the papers you were shit-
                        canned?

                                 SHACKLEY
                        It’s not a problem.

                                 WILSON
                        The fuck it isn’t. You don’t work 
                        for the agency, that means I don’t 
                        work for the agency. I got no 
                        cover.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        You need to relax.

                                 WILSON
                        I gotta be honest, here, Ted. I’m 
                        starting to lose my shit. 
                              (pouring another drink)
                        They’re hunting me like a dog.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Can’t be easy, cut off like this. 
                        Messes with your head.

                                 WILSON
                        I’ve done everything you ever 
                        asked, so just tell me what it is 
                        you want from me?

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I want you to be the hero I could 
                        never be. 

           Wilson’s never heard Shackley talk this. Really gets his 
           attention.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do what you do. I tried 
                        field work back in the OSS days. 
                        Got stuck in East Berlin once when 
                        a connect didn’t show. Hid in a 
                        root cellar and held my dick ‘til 
                        the Brits could pull me out. But 
                        you’re different. I believe in you. 
                        And right now, I’m mission control 
                        and you’re the astronaut headed for 
                        the dark side of the moon before he 
                        can come home again. That means no 
                        more communication until this 
                        indictment goes away.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        Barcella’s got me tapped, tailed 
                        and titty twisted. I can’t make a 
                        move he doesn’t know about. You and 
                        me, we gotta go radio silent.

           Wilson goes pale.

                                 SHACKLEY (CONT’D)
                        I will fix this. Reagan’s in good 
                        position to get elected but his one 
                        concern is the hostages. They get 
                        released between now and election 
                        day, Carter might still pull this 
                        thing out. I got a connect inside 
                        Iran who can stop that from 
                        happening. New administration owing 
                        favors means a whole new ball game 
                        for us.

                                 WILSON
                        I gotta know you won’t forget me, 
                        Ted.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I got you into this, and by God 
                        I’ll get you out.
                              (raising glass)
                        To the dark side of the moon. 

                                 WILSON
                        And back home again.

           Wilson doesn’t bother clinking. He just downs his glass.

           LATER

           Wilson still drinks. Chewing over the Barcella files. Pushes 
           them aside.

           SFX: More SCUFFLING.

           He grabs the PISTOL. Moves to:

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           SFX: SCUFFLING in the dark.

                                 WILSON
                        Who’s there...? 
                              (hopeful)
                        Ted...?
           LIBYAN POLICE crash in on Wilson from the shadows. Wilson 
           fires a SHOT into the wall before they grab him, throw a sack 
           over his head and haul him away.

           INT. HOLDING CELL, UNKNOWN LOCATION, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           Police drag Wilson in. Hands tied behind his back. He’s 
           thrust down into a chair in front of a Libyan INTERROGATOR.

           Interrogator brings a PISTOL to Wilson’s temple.

                        Do you still work for the CIA? 

                                 WILSON
                        Of course not.

                                 WILSON
                        That’s a lie. I have enemies in the 
                        Justice Department. The prosecutor 
                        is pissed off he can’t get me 
                        inside a courtroom. He must’ve

                        execute me and save him the

           Interrogator EXITS. Door LOCKS behind him.

           INT. HOLDING CELL, UNKNOWN LOCATION, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           Wilson comes to. He registers a plate of food in front of 
           him. He’s starving. But with his hands still shackled to the 
           chair, all he can do is bury his face in the food and eat 
           like a dog.

           INT. HOLDING CELL, UNKNOWN LOCATION, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           Wilson, thirsty and weak.

                                 WILSON
                        How about some water! It’s been two 
                        days!

           No response.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Maybe it was the dehydration but I 
                        was beginning to believe I was out 
                        of moves. I needed help.

           INT. HOLDING CELL, UNKNOWN LOCATION, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           A frightened Wilson, still restrained to the chair, hears 
           someone approaching. He strains to turn his head around, so 
           he can see the door.

                        water? About time...

           The door opens and a SACK is thrown over his head. Wilson 
           struggles but he’s too weak to fight them off.

           Blacked-out windows. Wilson surrounded by Police. Hands still 
           tied behind him.

           Van pulls to a stop. Door slides open.

           The Police want him to EXIT, but he resists. 

                                 WILSON
                        Let me speak to the Colonel!

           It takes three of them to push him out.

           WILSON’S POV

           Blinding darkness. He can’t see a thing.

                                 WILSON
                        I’ve got money!

           Then the sack is removed to reveal:

           Blinding sunlight. He still can’t see.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Mother fucker!

           The van can be heard pulling away. Wilson’s eyes adjust and 
           he can finally see:

           EXT. COURTYARD, WILSON’S VILLA - CONTINUOUS

           He’s “safe” inside. ARMY GUARDS now stand outside the gates. 
           He walks towards them. They shove him back inside.

                                 ARMY SERGEANT
                        No one in or out without 
                        authorization.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        They’ve got my nuts in a vice, 
                        alright.

           And the compounds gates swing shut with a CLANG.

           INT./EXT. WILSON’S VILLA, TRIPOLI - CONTINUOUS

           Wilson ENTERS, goes straight to the sink and starts drinking 
           from the faucet.
           A BLUE UNIFORM lands on the counter next to the sink.

                                 HIJAZZI (O.S.)
                        You promised to use American 
                        suppliers. 

           Major Hijazzi scowls -- the source of his anger is obvious:

           A Libyan Army Private stands at attention, wearing a hideous 
           blue uniform, with an equally hideous cap with poorly sewn 
           flaps meant to protect from the desert sun. The effect is 
           more retarded lumberjack than intimidating foot soldier.

                                 HIJAZZI (CONT’D)
                        These are North Korean! The only 
                        reason you’re still breathing is 
                        because I convinced them you have 
                        value. Now fix this.

                                 WILSON
                        I thought you were dead.

           Major Hijazzi simply shrugs as if to say: “These things 
           happen in Libya.”

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I gotta get out of here...

           INT. OFFICE, WILSON’S COMPOUND, TRIPOLI - NIGHT

           Wilson wakes with a start as the phone RINGS.

                                 WILSON
                              (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BOBBI BARNES’ OFFICE, GENEVA - DAY

           Bobbi on phone.

                                 BOBBI
                        Ed, I’ve got a call for you from a 
                        guy named Ernie Keiser.

                                 WILSON
                        Who?

                                 BOBBI
                        Ernie Keiser.

                                 WILSON
                        Never heard of him.
                                 BOBBI
                        He says he can help.

                                 WILSON
                        Okay, put him on.

           Bobbi picks up a second phone, already off its hook:

                                 BOBBI
                              (through phone)
                        Mr. Keiser, you’re on with Mr. 
                        Wilson.

           She takes the phone and makes a ‘69’ with the first phone, 
           allowing the two lines to talk. She presses her ear to the 
           phones, eavesdropping.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. PHONE BOOTH, GRAND CENTRAL STATION, NEW YORK - DAY

           ERNIE KEISER (40’s), impeccably dressed, sits calmly inside.

                                 KEISER
                        Ed, Ernie Keiser here. From that 
                        Africa thing.

           Keiser speaks with a strong German accent. His w’s sound like 
           v’s. Creepy Peter Lorre with Fred Astaire’s smooth moves.

                                 WILSON
                        If you say so.

                                 KEISER
                        Yes, I know it’s been quite some 
                        time. I hear you are in a bind, 
                        yes?

                                 WILSON
                        It’s a damn misunderstanding.

                                 KEISER
                        Of course it is. That’s why your 
                        friends want to help.

                                 WILSON
                        Who are these friends?

                                 KEISER
                        Under the circumstances, they would 
                        rather not have me say.

                                 WILSON
                        And that’s supposed to reassure me?
                                 KEISER
                        They are in positions of 
                        considerable influence within the 
                        new administration. It is not their 
                        reputation that concerns them, but 
                        that of the new President. 

           Wilson mulls this over.

                                 WILSON
                        Let me get back to you.

                                 KEISER
                        As you wish.

           Bobbi hangs up with Keiser. Gets back on the phone with 
           Wilson.

                                 BOBBI
                        Whatcha think?

                                 WILSON
                        Sounds like Ted.

                                 BOBBI
                        Why didn’t Keiser just say so?

                                 WILSON
                        I bet he doesn’t even know who’s he 
                        working for. That way there’s no 
                        blow back on Ted if the Feds get 
                        wind of it.

                                 BOBBI
                        So whaddya wanna do?

           HOLD on Wilson as he weighs his options...

           INT. OFFICE, WILSON’S COMPOUND, TRIPOLI - DAY

           Christmas Time. A miniature Date Palm strung with bulbs 
           stands in the corner. More bulbs adorn a picture of Ronald 
           Reagan.

           Wilson, in good spirits and cradling the phone, takes aim 
           with the nail gun. KA-KLUNK.... Another of many nails riddles 
           a photo of Jimmy Carter hanging from the wall.

                                 BOBBI (O.S.)
                              (through phone)
                        I just want us to be like normal 
                        people for a change, you know?
                                 WILSON
                        Sure, baby, we’re getting there.

                                 BOBBI (O.S.)
                              (through phone)
                        My folks keep asking about you. 
                        They don’t understand. Maybe if you 
                        met them...

                                 WILSON
                        Shit, Bobbi, I’ve got bigger 
                        problems here than breaking bread 
                        with your parents... Bobbi?... 
                        Bobbi? Shit.

                                 BOBBI (O.S.)
                        It’s Ernie on the other line.

                                 WILSON
                        Great, put him through.

           INT. LOBBY, CHRYSLER BUILDING, NY - DAY

           Keiser in another phone booth.

                                 WILSON
                        You speak to the NSC?

                                 KEISER
                        I spoke to the new National 
                        Security Advisor, himself, Dick 
                        Allen. Your skills are being 
                        wasted, Ed. Dick understands this. 
                        Reagan understands this.

                                 WILSON
                        What did Allen say, specifically?

                                 KEISER
                        I wrote it all down. He said “we 
                        need more men like Ed Wilson 
                        working on national security. He 
                        flips a coin a hundred times, it 
                        comes up heads every time. Our role 
                        isn’t to question his methods. Our 
                        role is to thank him because he 
                        gets the job done.”

                                 WILSON
                        About fucking time. You tell Allen 
                        I’ve got solid intel that Qaddafi’s
                        looking to take out Anwar Sadat.
                                 KEISER
                        Okay, sure, but Dick says he needs 
                        you in Central America straight 
                        away. How’s the Dominican Republic 
                        sound?

                                 WILSON
                        Central America?

                                 KEISER
                        He wants you to orchestrate the 
                        same commercial camouflage you did 
                        to such great effect in the Middle 
                        East.

                                 WILSON
                        “Commercial camouflage.” I like 
                        that. Yeah. And Allen can get this 
                        misunderstanding cleared up?

                                 KEISER
                        This is the White House we are 
                        talking about.

                                 WILSON
                        Good. Real good. 
                              (quoting Shackley)
                        “New administration means a whole 
                        ball game.” We just can’t let 
                        Barcella get wind of this. He’ll 
                        fuck it up for sure.

                                 KEISER
                        This is way above his pay grade, 
                        Ed. Don’t worry.

                                 WILSON
                              (shifting gears)
                        Say, Ernie, you swing by Mount Airy 
                        like I told you? 

                                 KEISER
                        It’s beautiful. Like Bavaria.

                                 WILSON
                        God I miss it. Do me a favor, would 
                        ya? Tell those fucking cows I’m 
                        coming home.

           INT. TRIPOLI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Wilson takes great pains to see if he’s being followed, or if 
           the ever-present Libyan ARMY PATROLS are watching him.
           He pulls out the Passport and shows it to the agent without a 
           problem.

           INT. BUSINESS CLASS, SWISS AIR - DAY

           Wilson settles into his seat with great relief. Flags a 
           FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

                                 WILSON
                        Scotch.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I’m sorry but we’ll be taking off 
                        momentarily.

                                 WILSON
                        Okay, sweetheart, then you got time 
                        to bring me two.

           INT. INTERNATIONAL ZONE, ZURICH AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Bobbi waits for Wilson’s plane.

           Nearby Keiser reads a newspaper. Waiting also.

           Keeping an eye on both of them is a man dressed like a 
           HOLIDAY-GOER.

           LATER

           Wilson arrives from Tripoli looking worn out and tipsy. But a 
           wan smile rearranges his features when he sees Bobbi.

           She reaches him, but keeps looking around anxiously.

                                 WILSON
                              (reassuring)
                        It’s like international waters. No 
                        one can touch me as long as I’m in 
                        the terminal.

           Relieved, she kisses him and throws herself into his arms.

                                 BOBBI
                        I missed you, Papa Bear.

           AIRPORT BAR - LATER

           Wilson’s already on his second drink spots Keiser heading in 
           their direction.

                                 WILSON
                              (off Keiser)
                        Gotta be him.
                                 BOBBI
                        He sounds like Peter Lorre selling 
                        snake oil. Are you sure he works 
                        for the President?

           Keiser reaches them as the Holiday-Goer bellies up to the bar 
           nearby.

                                 KEISER
                        You must be Miss Barnes.

           Keiser kisses her hand in old European style and Bobbi 
           suppresses a gag reflex.

                                 WILSON
                        Say, Ernie, that immunity letter 
                        you read over the phone, you bring 
                        it?

                                 KEISER
                        Oh I destroyed that. You know how 
                        it is, Ed, can’t have that falling 
                        into the wrong hands.

           Bobbi urges Wilson to press on with a squeeze of his hand.

                                 WILSON
                        Well even so, I’d feel a helluva
                        lot better heading to the Dominican 
                        Republic with real protection.

                                 KEISER
                        I totally understand. Tell you 
                        what, I’ll get Dick’s office to 
                        prepare a new letter of 
                        understanding. How’s that sound? 
                        They can send it to me overnight by 
                        diplomatic pouch and you’ll have it 
                        before we get on the plane tomorrow 
                        morning.

           TRAVELER REST AREA - NIGHT

           Where overnight and stranded travelers take showers and catch 
           a little sleep.

                                 WILSON
                        We’d like your finest room for the 
                        night.

           FAMILY ROOM

           Some toys on the floor. Wilson and Bobbi tuck in to the 
           bottom BUNK BED meant for kids.
                                 BOBBI
                              (teasing)
                        This your idea of a five-star 
                        hotel?

                                 WILSON
                        Can’t take a chance leaving the 
                        international zone.

                                 BOBBI
                        As long as we’re together.

                                 WILSON
                        We’ll always find a way, baby.

           INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NEXT MORNING

           The Holiday-Goer looks around. Concerned. Checks his watch. 
           Finally, Keiser ENTERS from an area with rest rooms and 
           airport administrative offices.

           Keiser zips up his fly. The Holiday-Goer relaxes.

           LATER THAT MORNING

           Keiser hands a LETTER on NSA stationary to Wilson. Bobbi 
           reads along over Wilson’s shoulder.

                                 KEISER
                        You can see, Dick’s eager to get 
                        this Latin American thing off the 
                        ground.

           The Holiday-Goer, now dressed as a Priest, walks by. His eyes 
           on the letter.

                                 WILSON
                        “Immunity from prosecution in 
                        exchange for his cooperation...” 
                        Looks real good, Ernie.

           Ernie takes back the letter. Catching Wilson by surprise.

                                 KEISER
                        Better I hold on to that. In case 
                        there’s any trouble.

                                 WILSON
                        Yeah. Makes sense.

           Bobbi makes a face that shows she doesn’t agree.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see that smile now, baby.
           She does her best. 

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        That’s my girl.

                                 KEISER
                        We must go, Ed. They’re calling our 
                        flight.

           Then she’s tugging on Wilson’s hand.

                                 BOBBI
                        Come here. I want to show you 
                        something.

           SECONDS LATER

           They stand in front of the Departures Board.

                                 BOBBI
                        Remember? We could go anywhere in 
                        the world. You called that freedom.
                              (desperate)
                        So let’s go. Right now. Before 
                        anyone knows we’re gone. Some place 
                        warm. How ‘bout it? 

                                 WILSON
                        That sounds real nice.
                              (walking away)
                        But it’s winter everywhere, babe.

           INT. PAN AM AIRLINES - DAY

           Wilson drinks heavily again. Keiser seated beside him.

                                 WILSON
                        Can’t wait to see the look on 
                        Barcella’s face when he gets the 
                        news. But this ain’t over between 
                        us.

           As Wilson continues ranting, he starts enumerating a LIST OF 
           ASSETS on a cocktail napkin.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        What I’m gonna do is buy a law 
                        firm. And I’m gonna pay ol’ Larry 
                        twice his shitty salary to join on. 
                        And when he’s put his heart and 
                        soul into it, after a couple of 
                        years, I’ll let him know he’s been 
                        doing my grunt work the whole time. 
                        Then I’ll shitcan his ass. 
           He finishes the list and stuffs it in his pocket.

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL, SANTO DOMINGO AIRPORT - DAY

           Wilson stands unsteadily with Keiser; his world slowing down. 

           INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL, ZURICH - SAME TIME

           The Holiday-Goer passes through the door he witnessed Keiser 
           exiting that morning. Leads to

           HALLWAY

           Rest rooms on one side of the hall. The administrative 
           offices on the other.

           The Holiday-Goer pokes his head inside the Men’s Room. Then 
           starts looking through thick glass windows into the basic 
           offices empty for the weekend. Desks are tidy.

           One gets his particular attention. 

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL, SANTO DOMINGO AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           Wilson focuses on details in the room: Banana Republic 
           soldiers with guns, happy family on vacation...

           Keiser steps forward. 

                                 KEISER
                        Let me go first.

           INT. HALLWAY, INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL, ZURICH - SAME TIME

           Holiday-Goer ENTERS

           AIRPORT OFFICE

           Drawn to the one secretary’s desk where the dusk cover has 
           been uncharacteristically removed from the typewriter.

           The Holiday-Goer sits at the chair. Looks down into the 
           garbage can and pulls out: SHREDDED PAPER.

           He lays the dozen strips on the desk and starts to re-
           assemble them.

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL, SANTO DOMINGO AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           Keiser clears the station, looks back at Wilson with an 
           encouraging smile.

           Wilson steps forward. The Control Agent SPEAKS but neither we 
           nor Wilson seem to understand. “Is he angry or just Latino?”
           INT. AIRPORT OFFICE, ZURICH - SAME TIME

           When he’s done we can see: NSA LETTERHEAD and the start of a 
           typed letter that reads like the one Keiser showed Wilson. 
           Only it breaks off with a couple of typos in the second 
           paragraph.

           The Holiday-Goer gets on the phone immediately:

                                 HOLIDAY-GOER
                              (into phone)
                        We’ve got a problem.

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL, SANTO DOMINGO AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           KA-CHUNK. The passport stamp. The sound of freedom. 

           A weight drops from Wilson’s shoulders as he pockets the 
           passport.

           But Wilson isn’t three feet inside the country before 
           DOMINICAN AUTHORITIES surround him with guns drawn:

                                 DOMINICAN OFFICER
                        Raise your hands! Now!

           Pederson and Hart appear out of nowhere. 

                                 PEDERSON
                        Edwin Wilson, you’re under arrest 
                        for violation of federal statutes 
                        prohibiting the transport and sale 
                        of regulated materials. 

                                 WILSON
                        Ernie?! Where’s Ernie? There’s been 
                        a mistake.

           Wilson twists his head around so look towards baggage claim. 

           Keiser is gone. 

           Instead, Wilson locks eyes with BARCELLA as Hart slaps on the 
           cuffs.

           INT. COURTROOM, FEDERAL COURTHOUSE, HOUSTON, TX - DAY

           Wilson listens to proceedings. 

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Judge set bail at twenty million. 
                        Some kind of record from what I 
                        understand.
           Keats in conversation with the JUDGE. Barcella and Bruce at 
           the prosecution table.

                                 KEATS
                        We shouldn’t even be here as my 
                        client was arrested illegally. 

           Keats looks through his brief.

                                 KEATS (CONT’D)
                        The prosecution employed a con-man 
                        by the name of Ernest Keiser who 
                        forged a letter from the White 
                        House granting Ed Wilson immunity 
                        to travel to the Dominican 
                        Republic. That’s entrapment.

                                 WILSON
                              (rising from chair)
                        Which circle of Hell is that, 
                        Larry? I wanna know where to look 
                        for you.

           Judge CRACKS down his gavel.

                                 JUDGE
                              (to Wilson)
                        Quiet!

                                 BARCELLA
                        I have never seen such a letter, 
                        Your Honor. And I regret that Mr. 
                        Keiser can not be located at the 
                        present time to answer to the 
                        accusation.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        Keiser fled the country. Hope that 
                        motherfucker picks Libya.

                                 JUDGE
                        Anything else, Mr Keats?

                                 KEATS
                        Yes, your honor. My client would 
                        like to make a statement.

           Wilson rises.

                                 WILSON
                        I am innocent of these charges 
                        because I acted on behalf of the US 
                        government when doing them. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILSON (CONT'D)
                        Specifically, I was working for the 
                        CIA.

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS, FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Barcella, Keats, Wilson, Bruce and the Judge.

                                 BARCELLA
                        This is a joke, Your Honor. I asked 
                        the accused about his relationship 
                        with the CIA on several occasions. 
                        In each instance, he denied any 
                        association.

                                 WILSON
                        I didn’t answer to you, Larry. 
                        Still don’t.

                                 BRUCE
                        It’s graymail, Your Honor.

                                 BARCELLA
                        He threatens to put CIA agents 
                        under oath, knowing we’d rather 
                        settle than risk embarrassing the 
                        country.

                                 KEATS
                        My client bases his defense on the 
                        fact that he continued working for 
                        the CIA. How do you expect him to 
                        do so without actually talking to 
                        people from the CIA?

                                 BARCELLA
                        By submitting a list of specific 
                        witnesses, their relevance to the 
                        case and the specific manner in 
                        which their testimony is to be 
                        used.

                                 KEATS
                        It’s unconstitutional!

                                 BARCELLA
                        No, it’s the law. While your client 
                        was a fugitive, I helped pass 
                        something called the Classified 
                        Information Procedures Act.

                                 JUDGE
                        The self-congratulatory nature of

                        How about it, Mr. Wilson? Are you 
                        prepared to offer specific names of 
                        any CIA official to whom you 
                        reported, formally or informally 
                        since your break from the agency?

           Wilson remains silent.

                        debris from Laos to Chile and a 
                        dozen places in between. He should
                        be in jail.

                                 WILSON
                        Not for this. Not for doing the 
                        right thing.

                                 KEATS
                        That’s a lovely sentiment, only he 
                        doesn’t seem all that concerned 
                        that it’s you who should pay.

                        There is a delicate matter you can 
                        help me with.

                        Of course there is.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        One of a supra-legal nature.

                                 CASEY
                        This is a one-shot deal, 
                        understand. Anything you want...

           Shackley reaches into his briefcase. Fishing for a FOLDER.

                        ...So long as it’s not about Ed 
                        Wilson.

           Shackley hesitates. Then pulls out a DIFFERENT FOLDER. Puts 
           it in front of Casey.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        I want agency cover to continue 
                        supplying the Contras.
                                 CASEY
                        I can’t get you funding. Boland
                        Amendment makes that impossible.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        Leave that to me. As the hostage 
                        release proves, we’ve still got 
                        friends in Iran.

           Casey mulls it over... then shakes Shackley’s hand.

                                 CASEY
                        There’s still the matter of your 
                        boy, Wilson. He subpoenas our 
                        agents and they testify at his 
                        trial, then it’s more questions 
                        needing answers, another round of 
                        Congressional oversight, and four 
                        more years of choir boy behavior on 
                        our part.

                                 SHACKLEY
                        It’s under control.

                                 CASEY
                        You suppose he’s still loyal to the 
                        agency?

                                 SHACKLEY

                        Need another word for ‘prejudice’ 
                        that doesn’t take a ‘j’.

           His Cellmate looks up momentarily from his girlie magazine... 
           but only for a second.

           Wilson gives up on the letter. Removes it from the 
           typewriter. Hesitates. Then puts in a fresh piece of paper.

           Begins typing: “Dear Bobbi,”.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, MARION PENITENTIARY - DAY

           Wilson is brought in. Sitting and waiting for him is a young 
           lawyer named DAVID ADLER (30’s).

                                 WILSON
                        Who might you be?

                                 ADLER
                        Your lawyer, David Adler.

           Adler moves to shake Wilson’s hand. But Wilson doesn’t bite.

                                 WILSON
                        I decide who my lawyer’s going to 
                        be.

                                 ADLER
                        I’m not sure you’ve got the luxury 
                        of choice. You’ve got no money to 
                        pay me.

                                 WILSON
                        Just because you can afford to take 
                        my case doesn’t mean you’re any 
                        good.
                                 ADLER
                        Who says I can afford it? What 
                        qualifies me is the fact that after 
                        five years of letters to the court, 
                        I’m the first lawyer who’s bothered 
                        to show.  That, and I have the 
                        necessary security clearance to 
                        review the documents you’re 
                        requesting.

           Wilson “gets it” and suddenly rises to leave.

                                 WILSON
                        You’re CIA.

                                 ADLER
                              (correcting him)
                        Ex-CIA.

           Wilson hesitates.

                                 WILSON
                        I know how that goes.

                                 ADLER
                        Our circumstances are hardly 
                        comparable but suffice it to say my 
                        experience has shown me your 
                        defense does not lack for 
                        plausibility.

                                 WILSON
                        Jesus, lawyers. The fuck does that 
                        mean?

                                 ADLER
                        It means I believe you.

           Wilson sits again.

                                 ADLER (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to. But I do.

           Adler dumps the contents of his briefcase onto the table: 
           dozens of Wilson’s LETTERS TO THE COURT.

                                 ADLER (CONT’D)
                        These helped.

                                 WILSON
                        You read them?
                                 ADLER
                        Twice. Before anyone else will, 
                        they need to be reworked to conform 
                        with something called the Freedom 
                        of Information Act. So let’s get to 
                        work.

                                 WILSON
                        Not yet.

           Wilson extends his hand. Adler takes it.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Okay, now you’re my lawyer.

           INT. CIA DOCUMENT STORAGE FACILITY, LANGLEY, VA - DAY

           Adler escorted by a HOSTILE CIA ATTENDANT into a 

           WALK-IN VAULT

           The same kind that the Libyans used to pull cash out of to 
           pay Wilson... Only this one is full of DOCUMENT BOXES. In 
           fact, there are 300,000 documents.

           Adler walks over to a single, uncomfortable metal chair and 
           folding table.

                                 HOSTILE ATTENDANT
                        Have a nice day.

           The Attendant walks away, leaving Adler to take in the 
           enormity of the task before him.

           INT. WILSON’S CELL, MARION PENTITENTIARY - DAY

           Wilson making cigarettes with his rolling machine.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        You’ve got a phone call.

           PHONE BANK

           Wilson picks up the phone.

                                 WILSON
                        Yeah?

                                 BOBBI (O.S.)
                        Ed? Is that you?
                                 WILSON
                        Only if that’s you, Bobbi.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. HOME, DALLAS, TX - DAY

           Bobbi, fifteen years older than we last saw her, sits in a 
           small, clean kitchen. Awkward silence.

                                 BOBBI
                        I got your letter.

                                 WILSON
                        Six months ago.

                                 BOBBI
                        I’ll hang up right now, if you’re 
                        gonna be that way.

                                 WILSON
                        Okay, okay.

                                 BOBBI
                        I only wanted to know if you were 
                        alright.

                                 WILSON
                        I’m great.

                                 BOBBI
                        Yeah. Why the hell wouldn’t you be, 
                        right?

                                 WILSON
                        I’ve had a lot of time to think in 
                        here.

                                 BOBBI
                              (teasing)
                        That was never your strong suit.

                                 WILSON
                        I should’ve married you.

                                 BOBBI
                        We don’t need to go over it--

                                 WILSON
                        Listen, I don’t know if I’ll get 
                        another chance, so I just wanted to 
                        tell you--
                                 BOBBI
                        No. Don’t you do it. Don’t you 
                        fucking apologize to me.

                                 WILSON
                        I put you through the ringer.

                                 BOBBI
                        You listen to me. All the lies you 
                        told. All the bullshit. I didn’t 
                        know who you were half the time, 
                        but I always knew what you were. 
                        You never hid that. That makes you 
                        an honest man in my book. So 
                        whatever I got, I had coming, 
                        understand?

                                 WILSON
                        Damn, I miss you, baby. It don’t 
                        even matter that you testified.

                                 BOBBI
                        Listen, I’ve gotta go. I gotta be 
                        somewhere.

                                 WILSON
                        Someplace warm?

                                 BOBBI
                        Take care of yourself, Ed.

           INT. WALK-IN VAULT, CIA DOCUMENT STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

           Adler takes a break. Stretches his aching back. 

           Pulls another stack of papers from another box from another 
           pile. 

           Adler scans over a memo, curiosity rising. So bleary-eyed, he 
           starts again from the beginning. And then we recognize it: 
           that needle-in-a-haystack “eureka” moment.

           INT. FEDERAL COURT, HOUSTON - DAY

           Wilson at the defense table. Barcella sits in the witness 
           box.

           Adler hands Barcella the copy of a memorandum.

                                 ADLER
                        Would you read this memo from the 
                        CIA’s legal counsel, please?
                                 BARCELLA
                        “Agency personnel maintained a 
                        continuing personal/professional 
                        relationship with Edwin Wilson 
                        after his resignation; in some 
                        cases these relationships continued 
                        until Wilson fled the country... We 
                        have uncovered seventeen incidents 
                        that would help support a Wilson 
                        defense that he conducted some or 
                        part of his post-resignation 
                        activities for the CIA. This list 
                        is not exhaustive and we do not 
                        expect that any other list that we 
                        or anyone else might compile will 
                        ever be definitive.”

                                 ADLER
                        Did you receive a copy of this memo   
                        during the defendant’s original 
                        trial?

                                 BARCELLA
                        A copy was sent to the Justice 
                        Department.

                                 ADLER
                        Please answer the question.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Yes. I read it.

                                 ADLER
                        This is exculpatory evidence. 

                                 BARCELLA
                        That’s debatable.

                                 ADLER
                        “Debatable?” Ed Wilson’s entire 
                        defense rested on the fact that he 
                        was following instructions from the 
                        CIA. That he’d been providing 
                        intelligence to the CIA the entire 
                        time he worked in Libya. This memo 
                        confirms that fact and you 
                        knowingly suppressed it.

                                 BARCELLA
                        We had a thorough discussion of the 
                        memo.

                                 ADLER
                        And?
                                 BARCELLA
                        We concluded that Wilson knew the 
                        affidavit was false. He had the 
                        opportunity to dispute it and 
                        failed to do so. It wasn’t our 
                        responsibility to make his case for 
                        him.

           Adler can barely process the logic.

                                 ADLER
                        Because the defendant kept quiet, 
                        you kept quiet? 

                                 BARCELLA
                        Yes.

                                 ADLER
                        But if he had stood up and declared 
                        aloud what he knew in his heart to 
                        be true, that the affidavit was a 
                        lie, then you would have felt 
                        compelled to produce the 
                        exculpatory evidence?

                                 BARCELLA
                              (not convinced)
                        That’s about it, yes.

                                 ADLER
                        In the course of American justice, 
                        one would have to work hard to 
                        conceive of a more fundamentally 
                        unfair process than the fabrication 
                        of false data by the government, 
                        under oath by a government 
                        official, presented knowingly by 
                        the prosecutor in the courtroom 
                        with the express approval of his 
                        superiors in Washington.

                                 BARCELLA
                        That’s not a question.

                                 ADLER
                        No. No it’s not.

                                 HUGHES
                        Twenty years ago, the government 
                        tried a former Central Intelligence 
                        officer for exporting explosives to 
                        Libya. His defense was simple: He 
                        said he was still working for the 
                        Company. 

           INT. WILSON’S CELL, MARION PENTITENTIARY - DAY

           Wilson packs his meager belongings.

                                 HUGHES (V.O.)
                        The government refused to disclose 
                        records of his continued 
                        association with the agency and 
                        convinced the judge to admit an 
                        affidavit from a principal CIA 
                        official to the effect that there 
                        were, with one minor exception, 
                        none -- zero.

           CELL BLOCK

           Guards escort Wilson out. He stops outside one cell and makes 
           a final transaction: selling his rolling machine for cash to 
           another Prisoner.

                                 HUGHES (V.O.)
                        There were, in fact, over 80 
                        contacts, including actions 
                        parallel to those in the charges. 
                        The government discussed among 
                        dozens of its officials and lawyers 
                        whether to correct the testimony. 

           EXT. MARION FEDERAL PENITENTIARY - DAY

           Wilson walks out the gates. Savors his freedom.

                                 HUGHES (V.O.)
                        No correction was made -- not after 
                        trial, not before sentencing, not 
                        on appeal and not in this review. 
                        Confronted with its own internal 
                        memoranda, the government now says 
                        that, well, it might have misstated 
                        the truth, but that it was Wilson’s 
                        fault, it did not really matter, 
                        and it did not know what it was 
                        doing. 

           Adler pulls up in a rental car.
                                 HUGHES (V.O.)
                        Because the government knowingly 
                        used false evidence against him and 
                        suppressed favorable evidence, his 
                        conviction will be vacated.

           Wilson gets in and Adler drives off. Wilson watches the 
           prison get smaller in the side mirror.

           INT. ADLER’S CAR - DAY

           Adler throws it into park outside a BUS STATION. Turns to 
           Wilson with the question he’s earned the right to ask:

                                 ADLER
                        You did twenty years for him. Why? 
                        Why didn’t you just give them 
                        Shackley when you had the chance? 

                                 WILSON
                        You have a decent childhood, Adler? 
                        Sunday dinners with the family, 
                        little league trophies. That sort 
                        of thing?

                                 ADLER
                        Something like that.

                                 WILSON
                        Ivy League. Pricey law school.
                              (off Adler’s silent 
                              acknowledgment)
                        Must be a helluva thing, everybody 
                        saying what hot shit you are.

           Adler waits but that’s all he’s going to get as Wilson gets 
           out of the car.

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        See ya.

                                 WILSON (V.O.)
                        I promised not to contact you until 
                        the charges were dropped...

           EXT. GRAVEYARD

           Wilson at Shackley’s grave.

                                 WILSON
                              (to grave)
                        ...And I kept my word.

           He places the WATCH on the marker.
                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                              (off watch/bemused)
                        Cost me double to buy it back. 
                        Worst deal I ever made.

           INT. LAW OFFICES OF LAWRENCE BARCELLA - DAY

           Barcella shakes hands with Clients after a meeting. Hanging 
           on the wall is his old sign: “The first thing we do, let’s 
           kill all the lawyers.” -- William Shakespeare. Only 
           Shakespeare’s name has been crossed out and replaced with “Ed 
           Wilson”.

           INT. BEDROOM, BARCELLA’S HOUSE, BETHESDA - NIGHT

           Barcella awakes to the RINGING phone. 

                                 BARCELLA
                              (into phone)
                        Yeah?

                                 WILSON (O.S.)
                              (through phone)
                        Oh, geez, I forgot about the time 
                        difference.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. WILSON’S APARTMENT, SEATTLE, WA - NIGHT

           Wilson on phone.

                                 WILSON
                        I woke you.

                                 BARCELLA
                        No shit.

                                 WILSON
                        Guess that means you finally got 
                        those Letelier guys.

                                 BARCELLA
                        One of them.

                                 WILSON
                        Don’t sound so glum, Larry.

                                 BARCELLA
                        If you called for an apology, you 
                        wasted your time.

                                 WILSON
                        You don’t know what wasted time is.
                                 BARCELLA
                        You played a reckless game. I’m not 
                        gonna cry for you.

                                 WILSON
                        You know, I couldn’t figure you 
                        out. Like you were playing by some 
                        other set of rules. Turns out we 
                        aren’t so different, you and me. 
                        You were gonna do whatever it took 
                        to get what you wanted. Even break 
                        the law. I get it. I’d have done 
                        the same. 

                                 BARCELLA
                        So, what, this is you forgiving me?

                                 WILSON
                        No, I’m gonna sue your ass, but I 
                        wanted you to know -- we’re kindred 
                        spirits, Larry. Only difference is 
                        I’ve always been up front about how 
                        I play the game. What you see is 
                        what you get.

           Barcella can’t help but LAUGH at the irony.

                                 BARCELLA
                        Yeah, you’re a regular open book, 
                        Ed.

                                 WILSON
                        See you in court.

           EXT. HILLS, OUTSIDE SEATTLE, WA - DAY

           At first blush, we might be back at Mount Airy Farms. But 
           this land is wilder. Greener. Untamed.

           Wilson looks over the open land on an overcast morning. 
           There’s a sense he could just stand and stare like this all 
           day long. Until:

                                 REALTOR (O.S.)
                        Well...?

           Behind Wilson, a REALTOR stands beside a sedan with self-
           promotional advertising on the doors. 

                                 REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        Little slice of heaven, don’t you 
                        think? Got a willing seller, too. 
                        Been on the market six months just 
                        waiting for you to come along.
           Wilson continues looking out, giving the Realtor more time to 
           size up his worn-out shoes and K-Mart wardrobe.

                                 REALTOR (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got some smaller parcels 
                        closer to the highway in case you--

                                 WILSON
                        I’ll take it. 

           Wilson finally turns from the scenery to lock the Realtor in 
           one of his force-of-nature smiles: 

                                 WILSON (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me about those creative 
                        financing options I’ve been hearing 
                        about.

           FADE OUT.

                                                       TEXT OVER BLACK:

           In 2006, Wilson filed suit against Barcella and 11 other 
           prosecutors for withholding exonerating evidence. Federal 
           immunity laws prevented the suit from proceeding.

           In 1984, Ernie Keiser was indicted for land fraud. Keiser 
           fled to Berlin while under house arrest after bribing his FBI 
           handler. An FBI request for extradition was denied when they 
           were informed that Keiser was a West German spy not subject 
           to US law.

           Ted Shackley died in 2002. Edwin Wilson does not appear 
           anywhere in his autobiography.

           Lawrence Barcella went on to distinguish himself as the 
           government’s most successful terrorism prosecutor, including 
           convictions in the Achille Lauro hijacking and Beirut Embassy 
           bombing. He died in 2010 at age 65.

           Edwin Wilson spent 21 years in prison before his release in 
           2004. In a 2010 interview, he said: “If the CIA still wants 
           me, I’m here and ready to help.” He died in 2012.

           To date, none of the C-4 explosives Wilson provided to Libya 
           has ever been used in terrorist activities.

           THE END.
