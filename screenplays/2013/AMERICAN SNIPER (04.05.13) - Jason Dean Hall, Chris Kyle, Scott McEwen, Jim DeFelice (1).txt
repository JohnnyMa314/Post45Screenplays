                           All gave some. Some gave all. 
           OVER BLACK

           The groan of tank treads drowns out THE CALL TO PRAYER as 
           a MARINE BATTALION advances over the top of us. 

           EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY

           The sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street. 
           The MARINE BATTALION creeps toward us like a cautious 
           Goliath. FOOT SOLDIERS walk alongside Humvees and tanks.

                        Charlie Bravo-3, we got eyes on you from 
                        the east. Clear to proceed, over.

           EXT. ROOFTOP, “OVERWATCH” - SAME 

           Sun glints off a slab of corrugated steel. Beneath it--

           CHRIS KYLE lays prone, dick in the dirt, eye to the glass 
           of a .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle. He’s a Texas boy with a 
           shitty grin, blondish goatee and vital blue eyes. Both 
           those eyes are open as he tracks the scene below, 
           sweating his ass off in the shade of steel. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        --fucking hot box. 

           GOAT (24, Arkansas Marine) lies beside him. Wind kicks up 
           dirt-devils in the street.

                                 GOAT
                        Dirt over here tastes like dog shit.

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        That ain’t dog-shit. 

           CHRIS SCOPE POV

           Tracking across a maze of bombed-out buildings, mosques, 
           and fortresses. SFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ grows louder as 
           his concentration deepens. Cross-hairs land on--

           A MAN ON CELL PHONE watches the convoy from a rooftop.

                                (keys mike)
                        I got a military-aged male, on a cell 
                        phone, watching the convoy. Over.
                                 COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)
                        If he’s reporting troop movement you have 
                        a green-light. Your call. Over.

           CROSS-HAIRS ON MAN ON CELL, studying the convoy, talking. 
           SFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, expels his breath and-- 

           MAN ON CELL hangs up and steps away. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        He stepped off. 

           A WOMAN and KID exit the same structure, street level. 
           They’re headed up the sidewalk but cut into the street.

                                 CHRIS KYLE (CONT’D)
                                (keys mike)
                        I got a woman and a kid, moving toward 
                        the convoy. 

           (ECU) She walks stiff, cradling something to her. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like she’s carrying something. 

           CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical yellow 
           object from under her robes. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE (CONT’D)
                        She just pulled a grenade. A Russian 
                        grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.

                        You said a woman and kid?

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Are you seeing this? Can you confirm? 
                        Over.

           THE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE (OC)
                        Fuck--

           MOTHER motions him to hurry. He’s running toward Marines. 
           IN THE STREET

           YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boot scuffing dirt. 

           ON THE ROOF

           Chris is unblinking. He exhales through clenched teeth, 
           breathe it down, breathe it down, he struggles to get 
           calm, fighting to gain control, fighting for his mind--

           THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-- he pauses upon exhale and 
           the entire landscape seems to pulse with color and focus. 

           He stokes the trigger. The shot seems to surprise him--

           THE BULLET 

           Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round 
           hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of--

           A WHITE-TAIL BUCK

           It staggers, draws and topples to the ground. We are--

           EXT. HILLS, WEST TEXAS - PRE-DAWN

           A field shrouded in morning fog. CHRIS KYLE(8) jumps up 
           from behind a deer blind, running toward the fallen buck.  

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Get back here--

           Chris stops, turns back. WAYNE KYLE, his father, is 
           sturdy and earnest with mutton chops and Texas calm. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Don’t ever leave your gun in the dirt.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Looks at me. Helluva shot, son. You’re 
                        gonna make a fine hunter someday. 

           Chris nods, grabs the .30-06, running again, bounding to-- 

           THE BUCK

           Glassy brown eyes look up at Chris. It’s still alive. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Can it see me?
                                 WAYNE 
                        It’s a deer, son.

           Chris processes that, watching-- (ECU) a flea crawl 
           around the animal’s inner-ear. 

                                 WAYNE KYLE
                                (hands him hunting knife)
                        You shot it, you answer for it.  

           Chris straddles the deer. It tries to gouge him. He looks 
           frightened but he drags the blade across its neck.

           INT. BARN - DAWN

           In the misty light of morning, the deer strung to a 
           chain. CHRIS and WAYNE hoist it off the ground. 

           INT. CHURCH

           A Protestant church. CHRIS, in his Sunday best, shuffles 
           the pages of a LITTLE BLUE BIBLE. 

                                 PASTOR
                        --you have given us the pledge that our 
                        bodies shall rise so what is to be feared 
                        in death, oh Lord? And what glory shall 
                        be ours in resurrection-- 

           JEFF(6), his reedy little brother, watches Chris slip the 
           Bible in his pocket. Jeff laughs and gets smacked by--

           DEBBIE, their mother. She wears big oval glasses and runs 
           a boys home with that firm, steady hand.  

                                                              BACK TO:

           INT. BARN - DAY

           WAYNE points the knife at the carcass and guides Chris’ 
           blade into the deer. This is a rite of passage.

                                 WAYNE KYLE (PRE-LAP)
                        There are three types of people in this 
                        world. Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. 

           A BLANK WALL behind them will soon display the antlers.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           A framed Texas flag. Christ on a cross. Art on walls of--
           INT. DINING ROOM 

           A modest ranch-house. WAYNE lectures his boys over 
           venison. Jeff bites back tears. Chris clenches a fork. 

                                 WAYNE KYLE
                        Some people live in denial. They choose 
                        to believe there is no evil out there. 
                        They have no capacity for violence and if 
                        faced with it they don’t know how to 
                        defend themselves. They are sheep. 
                                (looks to Chris)
                        Then there are other people who use 
                        violence as a means to prey on the weak-- 

           EXT. SCHOOLYARD

           FROM THE BACK, we watch a BULLY pummel a KID ON THE 
           GROUND. His fists coming down repeatedly as--

                                 WAYNE KYLE (VO)
                        They feed on the helpless. These are the 
                        wolves.

           Kid on the ground is JEFF, his nose bloody. PUSH TOWARD 
           the fight--(ECU) blood flecks on Bully’s fist. 

                                 WAYNE KYLE (VO) (CONT’D)
                        Then there are those who are blessed with 
                        the gift of aggression and an 
                        overpowering need to protect the flock. 

           A FIST CONNECTS with TALL KID’S temple. He goes down. 
           Chris stands over the bully, beating the tar out of him. 

                                 WAYNE KYLE (VO) (CONT’D)
                        These men are a rare breed and they live 
                        to confront the wolf-- 

           EXT. FIELD 

           CHRIS stands with his arms extended, wind blowing dirt 
           off his opens palms. It plumes out across the land.

                                 WAYNE KYLE (VO)
                        They’re the sheepdog.

           INT. DINING ROOM

           WAYNE removes his belt and lays it on the table.  
                                 WAYNE KYLE
                        Now we’re not raising any sheep and I 
                        will whoop your ass if you turn into a 
                        wolf. But we take care of our own around 
                        here and if someone picks a fight, or 
                        bullies your little brother, you got my 
                        permission to finish it-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        The guy was picking on Jeff. 

                                 WAYNE KYLE
                        That true?

           Jeff nods, eye swollen.  

                                 WAYNE KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Look me in the eye. I asked a question--

                                 JEFF
                        Yes...sir... He was...

                                 WAYNE KYLE
                                (turns to Chris)
                        And did you finish it?

           Chris shows the knuckles of his right hand, swollen, 
           likely broken. He nods-- yes, sir. 

           EXT. BARN

           A GROWN MAN exits the barn into the bright light of day. 
           Behind him, the horns of a hundred bucks cover the wall. 
           The barn door closes leaving us in brindled darkness. 

                                 “AMERICAN SNIPER”

           EXT. RODEO

           A hand grips the tie on a bronc. CHRIS sits bareback atop 
           the horse, it’s nostrils steaming, eyes shock wide-- 
           (ECU) a hair-line crack along its right front hoof.

           BUZZER SOUNDS. GATE OPENS. The bronco leaps out. 

           The crowd blurs. The Bronc and Chris united in struggle. 
           He leans right, the bronc circling right, staying off 
           that bad hoof. Chris makes the buzzer but-- 

           He gets tossed trying to dismount. The bronco stomps his 
           hand. He scrambles out as RODEO CLOWNS distract it. 
           FIND JEFF(19) ringside. Tight lips and severe eyes, he’s 
           cringing at the dismount and laughing at Chris. 

                                 JEFF  (PRE-LAP)
                        It’s to damn big too wear. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A honkey-tonk bar. CHRIS and JEFF are drunk and 
           disorderly. A BELT-BUCKLE prize glimmers on the bar.  

                                 JEFF
                        What the hell are you gonna do with it?

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m gonna get laid with it.   

                                 JEFF
                        I hate to break it to you but buckle-
                        bunnies don’t put-out for runner-up.   

           Chris checks his SWOLLEN HAND, pulls a wad of cash. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (to Bartender)
                        I want to buy a drink for every girl at 
                        the bar. Except the ugly ones. 

           Jeff scoots one seat further down the bar.

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                                (rings cowbell, announces)
                        This rodeo-star wants to buy all you 
                        girls a drink. Especially the heifers. 

                                 JEFF
                        You’re gonna get your ass kicked.

                                 CHRIS
                        In Oklahoma? I don’t think so.  

           TWO GORGEOUS GIRLS down the bar raise their glasses as 
           their shit-kicking BOYFRIENDS APPROACH Chris.   

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A drab room. Chris is sprawled across the bed. He belches 
           and the DAMAGED BUCKLE-BUNNY beside him laughs and rolls 
           up on his hand. 

                                 CHRIS 
                        Aw, shit-- My hand. 
           He sits up, dumps Aspirin in his mouth, washes it back 
           with a beer and tosses the empty in the corner. 

                                 BUCKLE BUNNY
                        You were gonna tell me why you like 
                        rodeo.

                                 CHRIS
                        Never said I liked it. 

                                 BUCKLE BUNNY
                        Then why you do it?

                                 CHRIS
                        - I guess I’m just good at hanging on 
                        when most people let go.

           He sinks his hand in a bucket of ice. She feels ignored. 

                                 BUCKLE BUNNY
                        I’ve met a lot of wounded cowboys, but 
                        never a fragile one... 

                                 CHRIS
                                (shitty grin)
                        Did you ever have a bad night and end up 
                        fuckin one of those rodeo clowns?

                                 BUCKLE BUNNY
                        You’re an asshole.
                                (up, grabbing her things)

                                 CHRIS
                        C’mon. I’m just playing-- 

                                 BUCKLE BUNNY
                        You’re a loser. You’re no cowboy and 
                        you’re a shitty fuckin lay. 

           EXT. HOTEL ROOM/PARKING LOT 

           JEFF is huddled on the wall. BUCKLE BUNNY storms out.

                                 JEFF
                                (laughing)
                        That good, huh?

           He ducks into the room--
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

           THE TV plays across Chris’ drunken face. Jeff lays on the 
           other bed, boots on, dozing off. A couple rodeo bums. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I can’t shovel shit the rest of my life.  

                                 JEFF
                        A job is a job. At least we’re outside. 

                                 CHRIS
                        But if that’s all there is... 
                                (scratching)
                        Man, I’m starting to itch. That girl--

                                 JEFF
                        She was a prize, bro. A real prize. 

           Chris tries to stand and doesn’t make it. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        You’re drunk. Go to sleep. 

           Chris is sitting on the edge of the bed, bleary-eyed when 
           NEWS FOOTAGE of the WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING (1993) 
           plays on TV. An explosion has demolished the garage. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (OS)
                        --group of radical militants called Al-
                        Qaeda are taking credit for a bombing 
                        that left six dead and hundreds injured--

           American flags at half mast. His chest rises and falls--  

                                 CHRIS
                        Look at this Jeff--

           But his brother is fast asleep. Chris looks back as the 
           faces of INNOCENT VICTIMS play across the screen. 

                                 CHRIS (OC) (CONT'D)
                        Look’t what they did... 

           EXT. MINI-MALL - MONTHS LATER

           Chris tucks his shirt, brushes his teeth with a finger, 
           looks at Recruiting Offices for every branch of military. 

           He approaches the Marine office, finds a “Back in 5” sign 
           on the door. It upsets him, they should be here. 
           He looks into the Army office. A FAT RECRUITER is about 
           to get up when A DOOR JINGLES behind Chris. 

           INT. NAVY RECRUITING OFFICE

           Posters of destroyers on walls. The NAVY RECRUITER is 
           lean and shrewd.

                                 CHRIS
                        I seen what they did to our towers and... 

                                 NAVY RECRUITER
                        And you’re from Texas. You’re a patriot 
                        and it pissed you off. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Yes, sir. But I can’t see myself as a 
                        sailor. That’s why I’s thinking Marines--

                                 NAVY RECRUITER
                        Marines are great if you wanna get your 
                        ass shot off. But if you wanna fight...

           He slides him a brochure-- “NAVY SEALS” emerge from the 
           water, armed and bound for glory.

                                 NAVY RECRUITER (CONT’D)
                        Meet the warrior elite. Navy Seals make 
                        Marines look like a goddamn tooth-fairy. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Seals--

                        Sea, Air and Land. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I ain’t much of a swimmer-- 

                                 NAVY RECRUITER
                        They’ll fix that. But you gotta 
                        understand, this isn’t for the faint of 
                        heart. Most men aren’t made for this.  

                                 CHRIS
                                (challenged)
                        I’m not “most men”, sir. 

                                 NAVY RECRUITER
                        Alright, I can get you in but there’s no 
                        signing bonus and if you wash out, you’ll 
                        end up on the deck of a ship. 
           Chris looks from the poster of the Battleship brochure to 
           the Seals-- and believes he is that man. 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           AN EYE CHART. Incredibly small letters. In sharp focus:

                        C....L....A....D....B....

           INT. NAVY HOSPITAL, DALLAS FT. WORTH

           THE DOCTOR pulls the tong away from Chris’ face. 

                                 NAVY DOCTOR 
                        20/10. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What’s that mean?

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Means you can spot a bug on a blade of 
                        grass from about fifty yards. You could 
                        be Navy Pilot if you wanted--

                                 CHRIS
                        I don’t like flying much. 

           A NURSE enters with X-RAYS. DOCTOR takes a look--

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        You got a pin in your hand?

                                 CHRIS
                        I got stomped by a bronc-- 

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Recruiter didn’t mention that. No branch 
                        will take you with a bad hand. 

           The doctor exits. Chris slams his bad fist into the 
           aluminum towel dispenser. Seems to work just fine.

           EXT. TRAINING PEN, RANCH, WYOMING - DUSK

           A bronco bucks around A SOLITARY FIGURE in the center of 
           the ring. REVEAL CHRIS, his patience profound. The bronc 
           drawn to his stillness-- (ECU) bronco licks its lips.  

                                 CHRIS
                        I ain’t bribing you. You’re a horse, you 
                        need this--
           The horse approaches, ready for the rope when--

                                 RANCHER (OS)
                        What the hell you doing? 

           The horse bucks off. RANCHER stands outside the pen.

                                 RANCHER (CONT’D)
                        You’re supposed to be shoveling his shit 
                        not making friends. 
                                (walking off)
                        Get outta there, you got a phone call.

           The horse gallops around Chris in the waning light.  

           INT. RANCH HOUSE

           Chris is pulling off his gloves, ON THE PHONE:

                                 CHRIS
                        But the doctor said they wouldn’t take-- 
                                (listens)
                        Yes, sir. Yes, I do. I’ll be there...

           He hangs up. That shitty grin. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you got some shoveling to do.   

           He slaps his gloves down and walks out.

                                                               CUT TO:

           Shades of black. Sky over water. And whooping percussion--

           INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER - “HELOCASTING”- NIGHT 

           CHRIS looks scared, packed standing amongst A DOZEN MEN 
           in T’s and nylon shorts, all soaked to the bone. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Go, go, go!

           He’s shoving boys out. Chris appears before him--

                                 INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        --you deaf? Go!

           He shoves Chris out. We are falling, falling, fall--

           INT. OCEAN - NIGHT
           The water meets us sooner than expected. It swallows us. 
           Bubbles rush past, an army of feet kicking in darkness. 
           Chris swims for the surface, takes a foot in the face--

           ON THE SURFACE

           Chris is choking. Taking in water. Going under. Rotors 
           whip the sea into frenzy. A spotlight hits. TWO SEALS 
           plunge into the water, securing Chris in a life ring. 

           The helicopter plucks him from the ocean and arcs out 
           into the darkness with Chris dangling by a string. 

                                                            LONG FADE:

           EXT. USS MOUNT WHITNEY - DAY

           The massive command ship of the sixth fleet eases by. 
           CHRIS stands on deck, in sailor’s whites, crestfallen. 

           INT. PUBLIC POOL (UNDERWATER) - SAN DIEGO - DAY

           CHRIS swims in aqua blue beneath the CHAOTIC KICKING FEET 
           OF DOZENS OF CHILDREN. He forces himself to stay under, 
           to stay calm until his face is bursting, his air expired--

           INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS, USS MOUNT WHITNEY - NIGHT

           CHRIS stands breathless and desperate in front of CAPTAIN 
           KENYON, a careful man.  

                                 CAPTAIN KENYON
                        You had your chance and you washed out. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I couldn’t swim but I been working on it--

                                 CAPTAIN KENYON
                        You can’t swim but you want to be a Seal? 
                        Doesn’t sound like you thought this 
                        through. Why is it so important to you? 

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s hard to explain--

                                 CAPTAIN KENYON
                        You have five seconds. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, I-- 
                                (shifts)

                        My dad used to say there’s three types of 
                        people in this world. Sheep, wolves and--

           INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

           Black night. Again, Chris and A DOZEN MEN crammed in the 
           back of a helicopter, soaked to the bone.

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Go, go, go!

           Chris emerges from the darkness first. Before the drill 
           instructor can shove him-- HE JUMPS, FALLS, SPLASHES.

           EXT. OCEAN

           Chris surfaces quickly, swimming from bodies and rotor-
           wash. A face appears before him, a kid struggling.  

           RYAN JOB(23) is a frumpy Oregon kid with a round face and 
           goofy smile. He looks like he should be taking orders at 
           a drive-thru window, not jumping out of helicopters.  

                                 CHRIS
                        --you alright?

                                 RYAN JOB
                        --cold as balls, man.

           The helicopter is fifty yards off, dropping bodies--

                                 RYAN JOB (CONT’D)
                        Which way do we go?

           Chris answers by swimming--

           EXT. MIDDLE OF OCEAN / “TACTICAL SWIM” - DAWN

           Chris and Ryan tread water in the pale dawn. Teeth 
           chattering, bodies jack-knifing, no land in sight. 

                                 CHRIS
                        ...the sea part of this Seal shit...is 
                        for the birds....

                                 RYAN JOB
                        --watch us spend a year in the water then 
                        have to go off...and fight in a desert.  

           Rotor blades sound. A red and white heli approaches. 

                                 RYAN JOB (CONT’D)
                        The Coast Guard? We’re screwed--
           EXT. NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE CENTER / “THE GRINDER” - DAY 

           CHRIS, RYAN and 50 OTHER CANDIDATES lay on their backs 
           doing flutter-kicks on a patch of blacktop surrounded by 
           beige buildings. INSTRUCTORS wield hoses; younger and 
           much more matter-of-fact than you’d expect. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
                                (sprays Chris in the face)
                        You dumb-fucks had half the Navy looking 
                        for you. Don’t turn away from the water. 
                        Look up and take it. I know you-- you 
                        washed out once already. How old are you?

                                 CHRIS
                        30, sir.

                        You could’ve fathered half these boys.  

           Other instructors hose candidates across the grinder.  

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t like the water do you, old man. 
                        What kind of asshole joins the Navy but 
                        hates the water. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I love the water, sir. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE  
                        My ass you do. You lost your shit and 
                        tried to swim to Catalina!

                                 CHRIS
                        They say Catalina is beautiful, sir. 

           Ryan chokes a giggle. Rolle wheels around on him--

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
                        Are you laughing? Is that you, giggling 
                        like a fucking schoolgirl? What is your 
                        fat ass doing here? You’re not a Seal, 
                        you’re a fucking Walrus. A big giggling 
                        Walrus. “Biggles” that’s your new name. 

           “BIGGLES” (from here out) struggles with flutter-kicks. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE (CONT’D)
                        Hey everyone, meet Biggles.

           ROLLE points to A BRASS BELL mounted on the back of a 
           truck that goes everywhere they go. 
                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE (CONT’D)
                        That’s your ticket home, Biggles. All you 
                        gotta do is ring it and you’ll be on your 
                        way. 

           BIGGLES is groaning, exhausted, legs giving out. 

                                 CHRIS (OC)
                        Two hundred. 

           ROLLE whirls around on Chris, hose in face.

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
                        Did I ask you to count?

                                 CHRIS
                        No, sir. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE
                        Was that your ass talkin then? 

           BIGGLES is choking a giggle when THE BELL RINGS. A 
           CANDIDATE staggers off. Everyone watches.

                                 INSTRUCTOR ROLLE (CONT’D)
                        See that? That’s a quitter. That guy 
                        quits on you in battle. Shit gets hairy, 
                        he can’t step up. You get shot, he can’t 
                        pull you out. We’ll weed out the quitters 
                        and see if I can’t find a warrior or two. 

           He walks off. Chris and Biggles share a look, a vow.  

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           FORTY CANDIDATES lay on the docks, soaked, chanting:  

                                 CANDIDATES CHANT
                        A yellow bird, with a yellow bill,
                        Was sitting on my window sill.
                        I lured him in with a piece of bread,
                        Then I smashed his fucking head. 

           Silence follows. INSTRUCTORS stroll among CANDIDATES, 
           their bodies shaking, pushed to the brink of hypothermia. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR GRANT 
                        If anyone can sport wood in 30 seconds 
                        their team can sit out the next 
                        evolution... Any takers?  

           There’s movement further down. BIGGLES has a hand down 
           his shorts, frantically trying to produce.
                                 INSTRUCTOR GRANT (CONT’D)
                        We got a gamer. Biggles! Cheer him on, 
                        ladies! You know what he likes--

           His BOAT CREW CHEERS, talking dirty to him. The least 
           likely to make it, becomes their heart and soul.

           EXT. BEACH - “SNAKE PIT” - NIGHT

           A bonfire atop a sand dune. CANDIDATES crouch in a pit 
           they dug, hugging oars, shivering. CHRIS stands at 
           attention, trying to make INSTRUCTORS laugh so he can 
           earn a place by the fire next to BIGGLES and TITTIES. 

                                 CHRIS
                        --the condom broke on us and we were only 
                        16 and she was crying, begging me to do 
                        something. So I’d heard if you pour Coca 
                        Cola up there you won’t get pregnant-- 
                                (guys start laughing)
                        So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke 
                        and drove back into the woods. She took 
                        her panties off and did a handstand 
                        against a tree but when I start pouring 
                        it in, she screams “ouch, it stings” but 
                        then I stop and she screams “no, don’t 
                        stop” and it’s fizzing out--

           INSTRUCTORS in stitches. Fire flickering off Chris’ face--

                                 SGT MENLO (PRE-LAP)
                        Everyone wants to be a Seal on a bright 
                        sunny day...

           EXT. “MUD FLATS” - DAY

           Today is not that day. Fog shrouds CANDIDATES COVERED IN 
           MUD, seated on the beach, hugging belly-to-back--

                                 INSTRUCTOR MENLO 
                        You’re really from Connecticut, Dauber? I 
                        never met a hick from Hartford before.

           “DAUBER” is big and rangy with yellow hair like the guy 
           from Coach. Fierce and intelligent. A Connecticut cowboy. 

                                 DAUBER
                        Country is countrywide, sir. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR MENLO
                        I don’t think he likes Italians, Tony. 
           “TONY” is a judicious bulldog with olive skin and 
           moustache. Only part-Italian, he needs no nickname 
           because say his name like he’s mafia. 

                                 TONY
                        That’s alright, sir, I’m half Mexican. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR MENLO
                        Fucking meatball burrito. You’d eat that 
                        though, wouldn’t you Biggles? 

           “BIGGLES” is starting to look fit as they chip away 
           everything that isn’t a Navy Seal.  

                                 BIGGLES
                        I’d eat asshole sandwich right now, sir.

                                 INSTRUCTOR MENLO
                        I don’t doubt it. How bout you, Titties? 
                        Can you still make them dance for me?  

           “TITTIES” is a muscle-monkey Nor Cal goofball who flexes 
           his hulking pecks and makes them dance. A 6’6” beast. 

                                 TITTIES
                        Bomb-buh-buh-bomb-buh-bomb-bomb.

                                 INSTRUCTOR MENLO
                        What about you old man? How you feeling?

           “CHRIS” sits up front, covered in mud. His eyes burn 
           steely blue, full of resolve. He’s found himself here. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Dangerous, sir. Feeling dangerous. 

           The boat-team behind him send up a spirited “HOOYAH” and-- 

           EXT. BEACH - SUNSET

           32 CANDIDATES SWARM each other, howling and dog-piling at 
           the completion of hell-week. But victory is short-lived

           INT. DIVE POOL - “TOWER DIVE”

           Chris splashes in. He’s wearing mask and weight belt, 
           descending a 30m dive tower. INSTRUCTOR ROLLE shadows 
           him. 

           The deeper they go, the darker it gets. Chris is trying 
           to clear his ears but looks distressed. Rolle watches as--
           BLOOD BURSTS from Chris’ ears and nose. It plumes in 
           front of him as his eyes roll back-- 

                                                             TO BLACK:

           HEADLIGHTS CUT through black. The OLD 97’s “Born to be in 
           Battle” blasts as we swerve across the roadway. We are--

           INT. PASSENGER VAN - NIGHT

           A MASS OF HUMANITY is tossed about. Biggles rises up from 
           the wrestling bodies and blows a fart. Dauber throws him 
           in a headlock, choking him unconscious. Up front--

           CHRIS rides shotgun, COTTON IN EARS, in a foul mood. 

                                 CHRIS (PRE-LAP)
                        You’ll be shipping out and I’ll be 
                        picking cotton from my fuckin ears.

           INT. MULONEY’S BAR - NIGHT

           A crowd watches the boys toss darts at a bulls-eye drawn 
           on Titties naked back. At the bar, BIGGLES and CHRIS-- 

                                 BIGGLES 
                        Getting rolled back isn’t the end of the 
                        world. You just gotta pass your swim-- 

                                 CHRIS
                                (yells to be heard)
                        I’m old and I washed out once already-- 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Stop fucking yelling--

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s a big fuckin deal. I feel like I’m 
                        gonna miss it.

                                 BIGGLES
                        Miss what?

           He can’t articulate it, but fate has its hooks in him. 

                                 BIGGLES (CONT’D)
                        You need to get off your pity-pot man, 
                        we’re about to get pinned.

           Chris processes that, watches Biggles sip from a straw. 
                                 CHRIS
                        Don’t ever say that again. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        What?

                                 CHRIS
                        Pitty pot. And we don’t drink out of 
                        straws. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        It’s Long Island Ice tea. I need a straw. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You need a new drink. 

           He waves for beers. Biggles considers this rule. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        What about at a drive-thru? You don’t 
                        drink out of a straw when you’re driving?

                                 CHRIS
                        Ever watch yourself sip from a straw? 

                                 BIGGLES
                        How about a movie theatre? You’re in the 
                        dark--

                                 CHRIS
                        Would you suck dick if I turned the 
                        lights off?

           The straw comes out. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Sgt. Rolle is going to let me try and pre-
                        qual’ for sniper school. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        You want to be sniper?

                                 CHRIS
                        What’s cooler than being a sniper?

                                 BIGGLES
                        Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way 
                        cooler. Can you shoot? 

           Before Chris can answer, a dirty blonde steps to the bar. 
           Sensible and sexy and out of place here. This is TAYA. 

           Their eyes meet. He smiles. The cotton looks ridiculous. 
                                 TAYA
                        What happened to your ears?

                                 CHRIS
                        They popped.  

                                 TAYA
                        Just like that? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Pretty much. 

                                 TAYA
                        Are you military? 

                                 CHRIS
                                (deaf)
                        Huh?

                                 TAYA
                        What do you do that your ears popped? 

                                 CHRIS
                        I polish dolphins. They need to be 
                        polished when they’re in captivity. If 
                        you don’t their skin can disintegrate.  

                                 TAYA
                        You’re full of shit. You’re military. 

           She’s urbane and sassy, a fast talker with a messy past.

                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        What branch?

           He passes her a SHOT OF TEQUILA.

                                 CHRIS
                        One shot, one answer. 

                                 TAYA
                                (throws it back)
                        What branch? 

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m finishing BUD/S. 

                                 TAYA
                        So, you’re a Seal. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Is that a question? 
                                 TAYA
                        I know all about you guys. My little 
                        sister was engaged to a Seal. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What do you mean you know all about us?

                                 TAYA
                        Is that a question?
                                (pushes a shot his way)
                        You’re bunch of arrogant, self-centered 
                        glory seekers who think you can lie and 
                        do whatever the hell you want. 

                                 CHRIS
                        How can you say we’re self-centered? 
                        I’d lay down my life for my country. 

                                 TAYA
                                (taken aback)
                        Why?

                                 CHRIS
                        Because it’s the greatest country on 
                        earth and that’s worth protecting. 

           He’s simple, talks slow, and means what he says. 

                                 TAYA
                        You’re either unbelievably idealistic or 
                        just plain naive.

                                 CHRIS
                                (beat)
                        This guy probably hurt your sister.  

                                 TAYA
                        He broke her heart. 

                                 CHRIS
                        And you’d do anything to protect her. 

                                 TAYA
                        Those were both questions. 

           She pushes him a shot. 

                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        Yes, I’d do anything to protect her. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Then you know how I feel. 
                                 TAYA
                        It’s a lil’ egotistical of you to think 
                        you can protect us all.  

                                 CHRIS
                                (tosses back shot)
                        Our instructor warned us that our biggest 
                        enemies are liquor, women and ego.

                                 TAYA
                        It sounds like you’re under attack. 

           EXT. MULRONEY’S BAR, PARKING LOT - LATER

           Mist rolls in. Chris holds Taya’s hair as she pukes. She 
           takes a deep breath, wipes her mouth--

                                 TAYA
                        I’m not going home with you, so don’t 
                        even think about it.  

           She smiles, then turns to puke again--

                        --pulling the trigger will become an 
                        unconscious effort. You will be aware of

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE

           A ZOLOFT BROCHURE shows smiling faces. TAYA wears a suit-
           skirt and tries to mimic the esprit of the brochure. She 
           leaves a pile of samples with the RECEPTIONIST and exits.

           sampling her own products when-- HER PHONE RINGS.

           PAN ACROSS a “target shoot” game to a bench overlooking

                        Whoever it is shouldn’t have picked a

                        gonna work out like it’s meant to be.

                        I’m sorry honey. I’m so sorry. 
                                 TAYA
                        Forget it.

           TAYA, beyond tears, marches out to face her guests. 

                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry everyone. I don’t know what 
                        happened but I won’t to make you wait--

           TIRES SCREECH in the near-distance and she looks up--

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY

           Biggles and Dauber drag Chris up the gang-way. 

           INT. YACHT - DAY

           The entire wedding part watches as CHRIS steps into the 
           aisle. He’s swaying with the boat, worried and green. 

                                 TAYA
                        This is not what I signed up for.

                                 CHRIS
                        Baby, wait. Please--

                                (sees how beat-up he is)
                        What happened to you?

                                 CHRIS
                        I had the worst night of my life but--
                        it was all worth it.

                                 TAYA
                        Oh good. I’m glad-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        --to get here. To be with you. 

           WAYNE, DEBBIE and JEFF are watching from the front row.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I love you. I want you to be my wife, to 
                        have and hold until we’re old and grey.  
                                (she isn’t falling for it; he 
                                drops to a knee)
                        There are only a few things I know. I 
                        know there’s a God. I know he’s got a 
                        plan. And I know I was put on this earth 
                        to love you. Marry me and I’ll protect 
                        you and worship you until the day I die. 
                                 TAYA
                        Did you bring a ring? 

           Biggles tosses a ring-box. Chris grabs it out of the air. 
           He puts the ring on her finger and smiles a sleepy smile. 

                                 TITTIES (OC)
                        If you don’t kiss her, I will. 

           Chris leans in and dips her for a kiss. As he does, we 
           see a STORM BREWING at the distant edge of the ocean. 

           INT. BAR, YATCH - LATER

           The day greying with weather, SEALS cling to the bar. 
           “LT. BUDSACK” approaches; erudite and lantern-jawed. 

                                 DAUBER
                        What’s up, Lt.? Hearing anything?

                                 LT. BUDSACK
                                (with import)
                        It’s on, boys. Word just came down. 

           They hoist their drinks, barking approval, “HOOYAH!” 

           ON DANCE FLOOR

           CHRIS dances TAYA in slow circles when the Hooyah shocks 
           them. Biggles nods, we’re going. Taya slumps in his arms. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We knew this day was coming. There’s a 
                        plan, remember? Don’t be afraid. 

           He pulls her close, trying to hide his excitement, but--

                                 TAYA
                        Your heart is beating out of your chest. 

           CAKE CUTTING - EVENING

           The boat rocks on choppy waters. Taya dabs cake on Chris’ 
           nose and they kiss. THE BOOM of distant fireworks is 
           followed by AIR-RAID SIRENS as shock & awe hit Bagdad. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           CHYRON: “OPERATION PHANTOM FURY: 2nd BATTLE OF FALLUJAH”

                                 MARC LEE (PRE-LAP)
                        Welcome to Fallujah. The new wild west of 
                        the old middle east. 
           INT. M-113 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER, FALLUJAH - DAY

           SOLDIERS sit elbow to elbow. SIX NAVY SEAL SNIPERS and a 
           SQUAD OF MARINES to watch their backs. CHRIS tucks an 
           American flag and the little blue Bible into his webbing. 

           MARC LEE(26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and 
           handsome. He glows like a halo in a river full of shit. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Al-Qaeda in Iraq have a price on your 
                        heads and extremists from across the 
                        globe are flooding the borders to collect 
                        on it. We all saw what happened to those 
                        contractors here a few months back--

           FLASH TO:

           50 INSURGENTS hang the charred remains of AMERICAN 
           CONTRACTORS from a bridge. They chant, waving fists. 

           INT. M-113

           The M-113 hits a pothole and faces tighten expecting an 
           IED explosion that never comes. 

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        You snipers will be paired up and 
                        inserted into buildings along the main 
                        road to do “overwatch” for Marines going 
                        door to door. Your job is to protect 
                        those Marines at all costs. 

           The truck battles to a stop. 

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        The city was evacuated. Any military-aged 
                        male still here, is here to kill you. 
                        Lock and load, bring these boys in safe. 

           The Marine paired with Chris is a mouthy Arkansas boy, 
           “WINSTON”. The hatch falls open-- 

           EXT. HOSPITAL, NORTHERN BRIDGE, FALLUJAH

           A gunmetal sky. The staccato pop of GUNFIRE in the 
           distance. SNIPERS and SUPPORT cross an orchard. WINSTON 
           skitters tree to tree. CHRIS walks upright. 

                                 WINSTON 
                        Keep your head down, man. The Muj’ got 
                        snipers too. 
                                 CHRIS
                        A sniper won’t aim for your head. 

           A DOZEN MARINES are posted outside an apartment complex. 

                                 WINSTON
                        This AQI sniper’s been hitting headshots 
                        on gunners from 500 yards out--

           INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX

           An open atrium eight stories tall. CHRIS and WINSTON walk 
           past a giant pile of furniture and debris tossed down. 

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        -- they call him “Mustafa”. He was an 
                        Olympic gold medalist for Syria. 

                                 CHRIS
                        They got sniping in the Olympics now?

           They step on the elevator. The doors close.

           ELEVATOR (CLIMBING)

           Chris is focused and alert but Winston is wearing on him. 

                                 WINSTON
                        They also got this midget sniper they 
                        drop off in a suitcase. So be on the 
                        lookout for some fuckin luggage.

                                 CHRIS 
                        This is your floor. Good luck. 

           Doors open. He pushes Winston off. 

                                 WINSTON
                                (watching doors close)
                        No, I’m with you. I’m your protection.  

           INT. APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR

           Chris walks from APARTMENT TO APARTMENT, some vandalized, 
           others untouched, checking sight-lines out windows. 

                                 WINSTON
                                (trailing)
                        What’re we looking for? 

                                 CHRIS
                        You ever hunt?
                                 WINSTON
                        I ain’t that kind of red-neck. 

           He unzips and peels off into the bathroom.

                                 WINSTON (OS) (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, fuck--

           WINSTON FIRES TWO ROUNDS in the bathroom. Chris pulls a 
           Springfield .45 from his ankle as--

           A GOAT 

           Bounds out of the bathroom, runs out the apartment door 
           and leaps OVER THE RAILING, falling six floors. 

           RAILING

           CHRIS and WINSTON look down to the lobby, where Marines 
           stand around the DEAD GOAT. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (laughing)
                        You just got your first kill, “Goat”. 

           “GOAT” will be his name from here out.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to the roof. You stay here and 
                        be on the lookout for farm animals. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP/ SNIPER NEST - DAY 

           Under a corrugated piece of steel, a ritual unfolds--

           Chris packs a dip, lays out the Bible and flag, loads 
           bullets in a wrist-sheath and marshals his breath. Then--

           Time slows as he lowers his eye to meet the glass.

           MAN ON CELL hangs up and steps away. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        He stepped off. 

           A WOMAN and KID exit the same structure, street level. 
           They’re headed up the sidewalk but cut into the street.

                        I got a woman and a kid, moving toward 
                        the convoy. 

           (ECU) She walks stiff, cradling something to her.

                        Looks like she’s carrying something.

           yellow object from under her robes.

                        She just pulled a grenade. A Russian 
                        grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.

           MOTHER motions him to hurry. He’s running toward Marines. 

           IN THE STREET

           YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boot scuffing dirt. 

           ON THE ROOF

           Chris is unblinking. He exhales through clenched teeth, 
           breathe it down, breathe it down, he struggles to get 
           calm, fighting to gain control, fighting for his mind--

           THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-- he pauses upon exhale and 
           the entire landscape seems to pulse with color and focus. 

           He stokes the trigger. The shot seems to surprise him--

           THE BULLET 

           Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round 
           hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of--

           CLOSE ON CHRIS

           He winces, sickened by his first kill. He struggles to

                        --Fuck! Two men down. The roof-- he’s 
                        heading to the roof--

           CROSS-HAIRS track to the roof. It’s obscured by foliage. 

                                 CHRIS (OC)
                        Come on. I got no visual here.

           TRACK BACK TO STREET where Marines stand over their dead.

           CHRIS

           Eye to glass. Searching. Shadows growing long. The sun 
           bleeds down. He’s still eyeing that rooftop when--  

                                 MARC LEE (OC)
                        Smells like piss in here. 
                                (then)
                        Way to start your war. Some ballsy shots.  

                                 CHRIS
                                (conflicted)
                        Shooter statements are on the dresser. 

           Marc Lee picks up a stack of YELLOW PAPERS on the desk. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Six?
                                 CHRIS
                        Shoulda been eight. Two got dragged off. 

           Marc is silent, Chris rolls off the gun. Still shaken-- 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Did I do something wrong?

                                 MARC LEE
                        Wrong? Hell no. You got more kills than 
                        the rest of the snipers combined. 

           Chris rubs out the “shooters strawberries” on his elbows. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We lost a Marine. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        You can’t shoot what you can’t see. 

           Marc’s eyes land the piss-stained cement where Chris lay, 
           motherfucker didn’t take his eye off the glass all day.   

           EXT. CAMP FALLUJAH - ESTABLISHING SHOT - EVENING

           Across the river, the five-acre camp. Portable aluminum 
           trailers, shithouses and tent farms. A Humvee pulls past-- 

           INT. CHARLIE COMPANY BARRACKS, CAMP FALLUJAH - NIGHT

           Chris lets the air-conditioning blow down on him. Cots, 
           lockers and cruise-boxes line the room. Biggles reads a 
           PUNISHER comic book, doesn’t look up. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Heard you got your dick wet. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Where is everybody? 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Training those butthead soldiers. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Why ain’t you out there? 

                                 BIGGLES
                        I got the shits. Marc Lee said you were 
                        on fire out there. 
                                 CHRIS
                                (shedding gear)
                        You still read comic books?

                                 BIGGLES
                        The Punisher is not a comic book, 
                        dumbass. It’s a graphic novel. 
                                (tosses it aside)
                        Talk to me, man. I’m dying here. Did you 
                        pop your cherry or what?

           A heaviness falls over Chris--

                                 CHRIS
                        This kid didn’t even have hair on his 
                        balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- 
                        sends him running off to kill Marines. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (sees his hurt)
                        You saw his balls?

                                 CHRIS
                        It was evil, man. I saw some hate like 
                        I’ve never seen it before. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        A grenade could’ve taken out five or six 
                        Marines-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        I know...
                                (can’t reconcile it)
                        I know. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        What about the other kills?

                                 CHRIS
                        The other ones? 
                                (beat)
                        The other ones were fucking righteous. 
                        Like God was kissing on my bullets. 

           Biggles laughs, jealous--

                                 BIGGLES
                        You roll back and you’re the first in the 
                        fight. We shoulda all drown in that pool.

                                 CHRIS
                        Drown? I had an ear infection--
                                 BIGGLES
                        You had your fuckin period. 

           Chris pounces and has him in a choke when TONY, DAUBER, 
           TITTIES enter with “ASIAN”; a sleepy-eyed Japanese guy. 

                                 TONY
                        And what the fuck is this? 

                                 DAUBER
                        Don’t ask, don’t tell.

                                 TITTIES
                        Tex is playing just the tip.

           They surrounding the cot where Chris chokes Biggles. 

                                 TITTIES (CONT’D)
                        Heard you’ve been in the fight, buddy. 
                        You know what we’ve been doing? 

                                 DAUBER
                        Farting bubbles and burping glitter.

                                 CHRIS
                        Tell ‘em to back off, Biggles.

                                 BIGGLES
                        Jump his ass. 

           They pounce on Chris, holding him down Asian puts strips 
           of duct-tape up Chris’ legs and chest. 

                                 TITTIES
                        Did you meet Asian? We call him that 
                        cause he’s a capital “A” for Asian.

                                 DAUBER
                        Show him your little hands.  

                                 ASIAN
                        These hands were made for killing-- 
                                (shows very small hands)
                        And waxing.

           He rips the tape off Chris’ leg. OFF HIS SCREAM--

                                                               CUT TO:

           SNIPER “LEGEND” SEQUENCE

           CROSS-HAIRS land on INSURGENT WITH RIFLE; INSURGENT 
           PEEPING three times; INSURGENT BURYING IEDs. BAM-BAM-BAM.

                        --that you again Kyle? 

           CROSS-HAIRS are moving, no answer follows. 

           MARINE INTEL OFFICE

           Chris sits in front of TWO JAG OFFICERS going over 
           “SHOOTERS STATEMENTS”. He doesn’t like being questioned. 

                                 JAG OFFICER 
                        His wife said he was carrying a Koran. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Well, I don’t know what a Koran looks 
                        like but I can describe what he was 
                        holding-- it was made of pressed metal, 
                        shot 7.62s and looked just like an AK. 

           OVERWATCH

           Chris takes over for a SNIPER shooting from a window. 

                                 MARINE SNIPER
                        Haven’t seen shit all day--  

           Chris nods, settling-in when AN INSURGENT crosses the 
           street with a CAR BATTERY and an AK-47. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (keys mike)
                        I got an armed military-aged male with a 
                        car battery. Maybe he just needs a jump? 

                                 COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)
                                (over radio)
                        Negative. Bomb maker. Green-light. 

           Exhale, pause, pull. A SHOT RINGS OUT-- 

                                 MARINE SNIPER (OS)
                        --are you fucking serious? 

           MARINE INTEL OFFICE

                                 JAG OFFICER #1
                        Your scores at sniper school were sub-par 
                        then you get here and, suddenly--?

                                 JAG OFFICER #2
                        The greatest sniper in U.S. history had 
                        93 kills. You already have a third of 
                        that. How’re we supposed to explain that?
           Chris is wrestling that same question, and has no answer. 

           MESS HALL

           CHRIS and BIGGLES enter. A noticeable HUSH FALLS over the 
           room. Eyes on Chris, he tries to avoid reverential nods. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (hops on a chair)
                        Listen up ladies and genitals, “The 
                        Legend” here is having beef stew just 
                        like you and he’d like you to know that 
                        it’s better to be lucky than good. 

           Chris flings a cafeteria tray at his head. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DAWN

           In murky predawn light, CHRIS sits on a SATELLITE PHONE--

                                 TAYA (OS)
                        Have you killed anyone yet?

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s not how the call-home goes, babe.

                                 TAYA (OS)
                        Don’t be weird with me. 

                                                        INTER-CUT WITH:

           INT. CHRIS & TAYA’S HOUSE, SAN DIEGO - SAME 

           TAYA walks her baby bump to the TV, turns down volume. 

                                 TAYA
                        If you don’t tell me what’s going on, how 
                        are we going to feel like we’re living a 
                        life together. 

                                 CHRIS 
                        We are living this together, there are 
                        just things I just can’t talk about. 
                                (then)
                        How are you? Are you feeling okay?  

                                 TAYA
                        I’m alone and if you make feel more 
                        alone-- I’m going to be pissed. 

           Chris covers the phone as distant gunfire chatters. 
                                 CHRIS 
                                (peeps over wall)
                        I can’t stop thinking about that pink 
                        silky thing you wore on our honeymoon...

                                 TAYA
                        It’s called a nightgown. 

                                 CHRIS 
                        Yeah. That.

                                 TAYA
                        And three days is not a honeymoon. 

                                 CHRIS 
                        It was a good three days. I miss you bad. 

                                 TAYA
                                (curls up in chair)
                        You want me to talk dirty to you?

                                 CHRIS 
                        Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and 
                        the phone in the other--

                                 TAYA
                        You have to decide what’s more important.   

                                 CHRIS 
                        You’re horny preggers, aren’t you? 

                                 TAYA
                        I’m fat. I’m getting huge.

                                 CHRIS 
                        More to love. You could be 300 pounds, 
                        I’d still do you.

                                 TAYA
                                (likes this)
                        You’re so romantic. 

                                 CHRIS 
                        How’s my boy? 

                                 TAYA
                        Nobody said it’s a boy-- 

           Chris has CROSS-HAIRS on insurgents crossing the street.  

                                 CHRIS 
                        I can’t wait to see the way you are with 
                        him. You’re going to be the best mom. 
                                 TAYA
                        How do you know?  

                                 CHRIS

                        I just know. I can see it.

                        I hope you’re right. The doctor said 
                        everything looks good--

           Her words fade as TV NEWS shows the running graphic of 
           “American Death Toll in Iraq”. The number is 835.

                        I keep missing him--

                                 CHRIS
                        What happened?

                                 TAYA
                        I’m so selfish. I wasn’t even thinking--
                                (pacing)
                        Your little brother joined the Marines. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What? When?

                                 TAYA (OS)
                        He didn’t tell them till he was shipping

                                 CHRIS
                        Shipping out where?

                        Over there. Jeff is headed to Iraq. 

           The news ricochets around inside him like razor blades.

           FIVE MEN IN BAKLAVAS stand over a YOUNG AMERICAN HOSTAGE 
           in orange jumpsuit. The thick Jihadist leader draws a 
           machete to behead his hostage, when the VIDEO PAUSES.

                        This happened two miles from here. The 
                        man in the middle is al-Zarqawi. 

           We are--

           INT. OP’ BRIEF TENT - DAWN

           COLONEL GRONSKI is a cob-nosed egomaniac whose coffee cup 
           must get dick-rubbed on a weekly basis. He stands before 
           75 Marines. The screen flashes to PHOTO OF AL-ZARQAWI, a 
           Jordanian with bushy black beard. 

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                        Bin Laden called this asshole the prince 
                        of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. They are 5000 strong 
                        and will present some of the heaviest 
                        urban combat since Vietnam.

                        This terrorist and his Lieutenants are 
                        our highest priority. We need to pick up 
                        the pace to clear six structures an hour. 
                        We will loosen things up with an air and--

           Chris looks to Marc Lee, six an hour? 

           EXT. CAMP FALLUJAH - MORNING

           The sun hangs like a blood-clot in the sky. Chris and 
           Marc Lee are walking, talking low--

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m watching Marines rush in to get their 
                        ass shot off. They don’t clear corners, 
                        they march in like it’s a fire drill-- 

                                 MARC LEE
                        They’re Marines. They don’t get our 
                        training-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        So let me coach ‘em up. I could lead a 
                        Marine unit in the street--

                                 MARC LEE
                        A Seal sniper is too valuable--
                                 CHRIS
                        The muj aren’t presenting in the street  
                        like they were, but if I was down there--

                                 MARC LEE
                        House to house is the deadliest job in 
                        the sand-pit and you’re fighting for it?

                                 CHRIS
                        Can’t shoot bad guys if I can’t see them.

           His good ole boy levity does little to cloak his 
           desperate desire to protect these Marines. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Look, these Marines are calling you The 
                        Legend. The bigger that legend grows, the 
                        safer they feel. That kinda shit wins 
                        wars. Keep banging on the rifle.  

           He walks off leaving Chris biting at a shamal wind. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           AN F-16 RIPS OVERHEAD, dropping a 500lb bomb on the next 
           block, smoke and dust swell and billow out toward--

           INT. ROOFTOP

           CHRIS lays under a fluttering canopy, cursing at zero 
           visibility, afraid of what’s coming. GOAT camps nearby.

           CHRIS SCOPE POV

           KILO COMPANY MARINES JOG to a pink house with windows 
           boarded up. One of the Marines looks like Jeff Kyle.

                                 CHRIS
                                (keys mike)
                        --gate leads to a courtyard but I got 
                        limited visibility once you’re inside so 
                        proceed with some fucking caution. 

           “Jeff Marine” sets a charge, turns-- not Jeff. Door blows 
           off. Marines rush in. GUNFIRE POPS. 

           Marines rush back out, dragging their injured.  

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                                (stands, bounds for stairs)

                        You’ll get your ass shot off down there. 

           INT. STREET, SOLDIER’S DISTRICT - MINUTES LATER

           KILO COMPANY dump lead in the structure. “CPT. GILLESPIE” 
           (smart, sunburned) is shouting “cease fire” as-- 

                                 CHRIS
                                (storms up)
                        You wanna be a sniper? Let’s swap guns. 

                                 “JEFF” MARINE
                        Really?

                                 CHRIS
                        Hell yeah. What’s cooler than a sniper.
                                (trades guns, looks to Cpt.)
                        I’ll roll with you guys if that’s cool?

           They’re looking at him like he’s lost it but--

                                 CPT. GILLESPIE
                        Cool by me. 

           “THOMPSON” (big, wobbly voice) nods, lugging an M240G. 

                                 THOMPSON
                        You’re that guy? You got like 40 
                        confirmed kills.

           Chris realizes it’s his way to gain entry, plays it up.   

                                 CHRIS
                        It’s 52. But who’s counting.

                                 THOMPSON
                        That’s badass. 

           “SANCHEZ” (gang banger, Catholic) chimes in. 

                                 SANCHEZ
                        Theys some nigger in Bravo catching up. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Yeah, we’ll see...
                                (packs a dip)
                        So y’all wanna learn how to stay alive? 

           A river of need beneath his cowboy calm. 
           EXT. CAMP FALLUJAH, EVENING

           A sunset burns across an aluminum trailer. CHRIS and KILO 
           COMPANY roll from behind it, drilling, covering angles. 
           Chris barks at them, serious as a heart-attack. 

           MARC LEE, crossing camp, is stopped in his tracks--

                                 MARC LEE
                        Motherfucker...

           INT. HOUSE, DAY

           KILO COMPANY bang into a house. Chandeliers and hand-dyed 
           rugs. CHRIS gives hand signals. SANCHEZ whispers--

                                 SANCHEZ
                        - Whas’ that mean again?

                                 GILLESPIE
                        Cover and follow. 

           Chris turns the corner and-- A KID(13) stands there. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Down. Down! Get down--

           THE KID is rocking on his heels like he’s going to run. 
           He has dark eyes and a pronounced forehead.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I will fucking shoot you! Down! Down--

                                 FATHER OF KID (OS)
                        No, no, please-- 

           A TALL IRAQI with a beard runs in. Gillespie clocks him. 
           He drops like a rock. THE KID screams like he’s deaf. 

                                 FATHER OF KID (CONT’D)
                                (from the floor)
                        He can’t understand. Look at him-- 

                                 GILLESPIE
                        The kid does look a little retarded.

                                 CHRIS
                        Why are you still here? You were ordered 
                        to evacuate. 

                                 FATHER OF KID
                        This is our home. I won’t give it to 
                        them. Or to you. 
           SANCHEZ pushes THREE WOMEN in berkas into the room. 

                                 SANCHEZ 
                        I found these bitches in the back closet. 

                                 FATHER OF KID
                        I am Sheikh al-Obeidi. You are my guests 
                        but please tell your friends to come in. 
                        If you are in the street they will know 
                        we have spoken-- 

           A TEA KETTLE whistling, guns still trained-- 

                                 GOAT
                        He wants us all in here so he can blow 
                        our shit up. Check him for a vest.

                                 CHRIS
                        Who will know we’ve spoken? 

                                 FATHER OF KID
                        Your enemy is mine enemy. You understand? 

           Chris glances at the women, lowers his gun-- 

           LATER

           Chris and Gillespie sit on the floor with al-Obeidi. The 
           kid (“OMAR”) plays with his father’s hair.  

                                 SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI
                        They come to our homes and they make 
                        examples of those who talk--

                                 CHRIS
                        Who? I need a name.

           The Marine Interpreter aka “TERP”(Diesel jeans, hair gel) 
           repeats the question.

                                 SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI
                        The man who visits we call The Butcher. 
                        He is the despaired one, son of Shaytan-- 

           He continues in Arabic, Terp translates--

                                 TERP
                        - The pure flame of fire? -

                                 SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI
                        He is top soldier of Zarqawi.

                                (jumps)
                        We want al-Zarqawi. How do we find him?

                                 SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI
                        This I cannot help. But I help find The 
                        Butcher and he reports direct to Zarqawi.  

           OMAR CACKLES like crow, playing peeking games.

                                 CHRIS
                        The Butcher then. How do we find him? 

           RADIO CHATTER. An F-16 overhead. THOMPSON steps away--

                                 SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI
                        I will be your help. But my price for 
                        betrayal is 100,000 U.S. dollars.

           A BOMB LANDS nearby. Chris growing certain-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        How do we know it’s real?

                                 THOMPSON
                                (re-enters)
                        We got a Marine unit pinned down about 
                        two mikes out, in bad shape--

                        I’ll bring it to the money people but I 
                        need details. A name. Anything. 

                                 THOMPSON
                        They’re out of ammo. If we don’t go now--

                        “Amir Khalaf Fanus”. This is given name 
                        of The Butcher but to help you find him-- 

           The Sheikh sweeps a hand across his empty palm. Chris 
           holds his eyes a long moment, then turns--

           Fallen telephone lines snake across the rubble. CHRIS and

                                 GOAT
                        Too fucking many of em, man. We gotta 
                        wait for air-support.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Support is ten minutes out. 

                                 SANCHEZ
                        We don’t got the sauce for this--

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Hey. Look at me. Those are our boys in 
                        there. Those are our Marines.
                                (lighting fire to their 
                                trepidation)
                        We look out for our own.

                                 GOAT
                        You’re not a fucking Marine.

                                 GILLESPIE
                        Oorah, Chris. We’re with you.

                                 CHRIS
                        Thompson and Sanchez are on the roof with 
                        a steel curtain at 10 and 2. Cap’, you’re 
                        street-level mowing everything in- 
                        between. Tell Fox Company to toss smoke 
                        on our signal and get their dicks dirty. 
                                (grabs Goat’s uni)
                        You’re with me, leading ‘em out the back. 

           Chris drags Goat, cursing, down the alley. 

           UPRANGE/STREET

           GAS FUMES WAFT from the soaked shirt hanging off an 
           INSURGENTS rifle. His friend lights it on fire as-- 

           ROOF

           THOMPSON and SANCHEZ crawl across the rooftop. 

                                 THOMPSON
                                (into radio)
                        --on my signal you’re gonna toss smoke--
           HOUSE/MARINES

           BORTOLO collects smoke canisters from a LEG-SHOT SOLDIER. 

                                 SGT. BORTOLO
                        Give me your smoke, Mads.

                                 MADISON 
                        Where is Boone? Have you seen him?

           Bortolo’s expression says, “no”.

           ALLEY

           Chris and Goat are advancing past the mouth of an alley 
           when-- TWO INSURGENTS run out of a doorway ahead. All 
           four stand shocked. Chris fires first, killing one. 

           ALLEY INSURGENT #2 lights up a belt-fed Bushmaster. 
           Flames spit from it as Chris dives into--

           DOORWAY

           Chris reloads in shallow cover, calling out--

                                 CHRIS
                        Goat, on three. You ready? Goat?

           He leans out and sees GOAT RUNNING into the distance. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Motherfucker.

           INSURGENT #2’S GUNFIRE chips the doorway then CLICK-- his 
           guns jams. It’s the loudest sound in a gunfight. 

           Chris leans out, POP-POP, drops him.   

           ROOF 

           SANCHEZ looks over the balustrade on the rooftop. 

                                 THOMPSON
                                (keys mike)
                        Toss smoke, now--

           A SMOKE CANISTER flies into the street. Then three more-- 
           THEY HISS, SPITTING THICK SWIRLING GREY SMOKE.

           Sanchez jumps up firing the 240 into the smoke.  

           WINDOW BELOW
           Gillespie steps up to fire. AN INSURGENT runs from the 
           fog. His cheek blown off, squirting blood, running at us--

           INSURGENT flips over the windowsill and lands at his 
           feet. Gillespie screams, stomping on his head and FIRING  
           out the window as insurgents appear in the riotous haze. 

           ALLEY 

           Chris advances solo. INSURGENTS hear the gunfight in the 
           street and FOUR RUN toward it, THREE REMAIN. 

           Chris pulls the pin from a grenade, tosses it, takes aim-- 

           HOUSE

           Marines sit back-to-back, waiting to die. From the dark 
           doorway, “friendly”, he appears out of smoke--

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Y’all ready to get out of here?

           They’re in shock, watching Chris pull MADS off the floor. 

           ALLEY TWO

           KILO TEAM is shuttling MARINES up the street. CHRIS is 
           laying down suppressive fire from the rear. 

                                 THOMPSON (OS)
                                (over radio)
                        You’re up Chris, go--

           SUPPRESSIVE FIRE hisses past. Chris turns to run, sees-- 

           A MARINE BOOT sticking from a doorway down the alley. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Shit--
                                (slides down the alley, 
                                afraid to look)
                        Friendly, friendly--

                                 THOMPSON (OS)
                        Chris! We gotta get. Where are you--

           A YOUNG MARINE is slumped in the doorway, brown hair, gut-
           shot. Chris is terrified, lifts his head-- not Jeff. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (checks pulse, keys mike)
                        On the move with “WIA”. Light it up...

           UPRANGE
           SANCHEZ and GILLESPIE lob tracers downrange.

                                 SANCHEZ
                        --is it Goat? Is Goat down?

           DOWNRANGE

           Chris has Boone in a fireman’s, humping him uprange when 
           AN INSURGENT steps out 50m behind them and fires an RPG-- 

           It screams out, corkscrewing at them--

           CHRIS

           He dives, covering Boone as the RPG EXPLODES the wall 
           behind him. Chunks of concrete tumble down on his legs. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Aughh, fuck--

           He’s agonizing, racked with pain, when he hears--

                                 INJURED MARINE
                        ...it hurts...it hurts so bad--

                                 CHRIS
                                (animated by empathy)
                        I hear you. I know it hurts, I know--

           The Marine reaches. Chris takes his hand. 

                                 INJURED MARINE
                        --don’t tell her. You can’t tell her... 

                                 CHRIS
                        Don’t tell who? 

           The Marine is shaking, in the cold grips of death. 

                                 INJURED MARINE
                        Don’t tell my mom...I died in pain... You 
                        can’t tell her I died like this--

                                 CHRIS
                        You’re a hero. They’ll make it sound 
                        great... you hear me?

           Boone is staring at him, gone. Chris is still squeezing 
           his hand when gunfire spits up dirt, just inches away. 

           Chris ducks, trying to pull his legs from rubble when-- 

           An A-10 GUNSHIP booms overhead. BRRRRBB-BBRRRRBB-
           BBRRRRBBB!!-- 30MM CANNONS decimate the world behind him.
           INT. MESS HALL, CAMP FALLUJAH - EVENING

           Food is slopped on a plate. PAN UP TO GOAT, signaling for 
           another scoop when-- he’s ripped off his feet. 

                                 CHRIS (OC)
                        Fucking coward.

           CHRIS slams GOAT down on a table, strangling him. 
           SOLDIERS jump up around them, yelling and shouting, as-- 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        You fucking skip like that again, I will 
                        shoot you myself. You understand me-- 

           A hand tries to pull him off. Chris turns to swing--

                                 BIGGLES
                        You wanna piece--?

                                 GOAT
                                (breaks free)
                        Fuck you, man. I got pinned down. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        You ran. I watched you--
                                (held back)
                        Why are you here? If you’re not here to 
                        fight-- then why are you here!

           The question confounds Goat. Chris finally hobbles out. 
           The soldiers shift their gaze to the coward.

           INT. TEAM THREE BARRACKS

           Chris holds a plastic cup with Southern Comfort. Biggles, 
           and the rest of CADILLAC COMPANY are gathered around:

                                 CHRIS
                                (quoting)
                        --don’t tell her I died in pain. You 
                        can’t tell my mom I died like this.

           A heavy silence. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        That’s it? 

                                 ASIAN
                        That’s a shitty fucking story. 

                                 TONY
                        You can’t tell that story. 
                                 DAUBER
                        Yeah, make something up. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Like what?

                                 TITTIES
                        Tell my mama I’ll be watching over her--

                                 BIGGLES
                        That’s gay.  

                                 TITTIES
                        - And you’d fold your teeth back for it, 
                        wouldn’t you buddy. What do you got?

                                 BIGGLES
                                (beat)
                        Tell my wife... I humped her sister. 

           They’re laughing.

                                 DAUBER
                        If the guy had a wife he wouldn’t be 
                        talking about his mom-- 

                                 TITTIES
                        If moms humped we wouldn’t need wives. 

           They groan. LT. BUDSACK CHIMES IN from the back.  

                                 LT. BUDSACK
                        It’s gotta have God in it. 

                                 DAUBER
                        Budsack is right...a message from God. 

           They grow silent, waiting for inspiration.

                                 BIGGLES
                        I want to kill somebody. 

           It hangs there.  

                                 LT. BUDSACK (OC)
                        Attention on deck. 

           TEAM THREE stagger to their feet. COLONEL GRONSKI enters. 

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                        Petty Officer Kyle? I hear you’ve been 
                        banging around with my Marines. Sounds 
                        like we owe you a debt of gratitude. 
                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        You don’t owe me anything, sir. I’m just 
                        looking out for my brothers. 

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                        I hear they’re calling you The Legend-- 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        They can call me whatever they want as 
                        long as they’re not calling me home. 

           Gronski laughs but can’t get a read on him--

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                        I read the after-action report. That was 
                        some high-speed shit and I’d like to 
                        nominate you for the silver star but 
                        here’s my issue, I can’t nominate a Navy 
                        Seal for saving Marines. We tell our boys 
                        they’re the most deadly weapon in the US 
                        military arsenal then we need a frogman 
                        to pull us out of the shit? That’d hurt 
                        morale. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Permission to speak freely, sir?

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                        Of course. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        I could give a shit about your silver 
                        star. But if that Marine (Goat) runs on 
                        me again-- I will shoot him myself. 

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                                (steps in, low)
                        You think because you’re a Seal, you’re 
                        out of reach. You think I don’t own you? 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        I’m just here to do my job. 

                                 COL. GRONSKI
                        Well your job just got a whole lot 
                        harder. Mind your ROEs, killer.  

           He exits. Silence follows. Chris searches staring eyes--

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        He said I could speak freely? 
           But the air has been sucked from the room. 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           “DEATH TOLL STAT” on the whiteboard is “1236”. We are--

           EXT. DIA TRAILER, CAMP FALLUJAH - DAY

           CHRIS stares at the number in disbelief. On the wall 
           beside it, a CORNHUSKERS FOOTBALL poster. AGENT SHEAD 
           sits across from them, a square-faced, shifty DIA AGENT. 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        When you were having tea with Sheik al-
                        Obedie did he tell you he ran a network 
                        of highway bandits before AQI moved in?  

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        He didn’t mention that. 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        It’s AQI’s racket now. Al-Obedie isn’t 
                        happy about it. This could be blowback.  

                                 CHRIS
                        And “The Butcher”?

           He slides a white-board away to reveal a AQI hierarchy. 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        This is your guy here. 
                                (points to blurry photo)
                        He’s Zarqawi’s second or third.

                                 CHRIS
                        You already had his name? 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        We got a few names. If it checks out I’ll 
                        put something together-- 

                                 MARC LEE
                        He’s asking for 100,000. 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        Of course he is.  

                                 CHRIS
                        If we go back out, I’d like to rope in my 
                        guys from Team 3--
                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        The brass will want contractors on it. 
                        Let me vet the name. I’ll get back to 
                        you. 

           He dismisses them with a nod. The dude rubs wrong. 

           INT. SNIPER HIDE

           Clouds inch across sky. Chris on glass. Sweating dogs. A 
           fly lands on his cheek. He stays still. Nothing. He 
           abruptly pulls his AMERICAN FLAG out and drapes it over 
           the edge. Seconds later, MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS, 
           INSURGENTS firing on his position. He takes aim.

           INT. HUMVEE #2

           An object thumps beneath the tires. SECURITY CONTRACTORS 
           wear baseball caps, Oakley blades and grizzled beards.  

                                 CONTRACTOR/DRIVER
                        Road-kill. 

           The cultural animosity between military and mercenary is 
           evident on the faces of CHRIS and MARC LEE as--

           They sit across from THREE MORE CONTRACTORS and AGENT 
           SHEAD. A shrink-wrapped PALLET OF CASH between them. 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        --Fanus aka The Butcher, is Zarqawi’s 
                        enforcer. If someone talks to us, The 
                        Butcher pays them a visit.

           He acting like this is new information. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        That’s what the Sheikh said. 

                                 AGENT SHEAD
                        Then lets hope he’s got more to say. 

           A PHONE RINGS, breaking the tension. All are surprised 
           when Chris, the enlisted man, digs out a SAT PHONE. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        It’s like that now, huh?

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Must’ve forgot I had it. 
                                (shitty grin; answers)

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                                (fist bump)
                        It’s a boy!--

                                 MARC LEE
                        Hell yeah. Congrats--

           EXT. MEDICAL PLAZA, SAN DIEGO - DAY

           A crowded quad. TAYA, ON THE PHONE, stops in her tracks.

                                 TAYA
                        Chris!--

           EXT. STREET 

           Street level shops, dusty awnings, boarded up windows. 
           MARC LEE and CHRIS roll out. SAT PHONE falls in the dirt. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        I heard one shot. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Roger. Large caliber. Coming at that 
                        angle, gotta be 300 or more out--

           A SHOT thunks into a Leonardo DiCaprio billboard above.  

                                 MARC LEE
                        Get a bead? 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Negative--

           Nerves fraying. This sniper has them pinned down. 
           CONTRACTORS scramble AGENT SHEAD to Humvee #2. 

                                 CONTRACTOR/PASSENGER
                        Pull back---

           CONTRACTOR/GUNNER covers them from the gun turret when-- 
           A BULLET SMOKES through him, ejecting his vertebrae.
                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Minaret, 11 o’clock!

           Chris uses his rifle to reaches from behind the wall and 
           tilt the side-mirror on the Humvee to see--

           DOWNRANGE (IN REFLECTION)

           A MAN stands in the street over the Sheikh’s boy, Omar, 
           whose strange screams can be heard between gunfire.

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s the Sheikh's house. They’re on 
                        him. Fuck-- 

           Agent Shead and two bodies packed in Humvee #2. 

                                 CONTRACTOR
                        We’ll come back for you--

                                 MARC LEE
                        Fuck you. Tuck it.

           Marc follows Chris out the back of the alley--

                                 MARC LEE (CONT'D)
                        Always in the shit, aren’t you?  

                                 CHRIS
                        It follows me.

           WHIP-PAN TO SAT PHONE in the dirt--

           EXT. MEDICAL PLAZA, SAN DIEGO

           TAYA listens to a gunfight as the lunch crowd teems past. 

                                 TAYA
                                (sobbing, into phone)
                        Chris--

           CAMERA CIRCLES HER as her world comes unhinged.

                                                              BACK TO:

           THE BUTCHER
           Stands in the street over Omar. He’s a rawboned man with 
           eyebrows forming a grizzled line over bloodshot eyes and 
           he’s holding a HAND-DRILL.

           SNIPER POV / FROM MINARET  

           He’s aiming toward the doorway of a house where--

           SHEIKH AL-OBEIDI 

           Stands with his family, pleading. He tries to step into 
           the street and A SNIPER SHOT POCKS the dirt at his feet--

           THE BUTCHER

           He powers up the drill and OMAR SCREAMS and pitches as 
           The Butcher DRILLS A HOLE in the boy’s thigh. 

           INTERSECTING ALLEY

           Marc waves Sheikh (across street) to stay put. Chris 
           frantically works for a shot but--

                                 CHRIS
                        No angle. I got no shot--

           Panic on his face, seconds ticking down, Chris eyes 
           telephone wires upside the wall. He pulls himself up--

           ROOFTOP

           CHRIS rolls onto the roof and-- A DOG SNAPS, BARKING and 
           rabid, chained to a US sig M-60. 

           SNIPER POV / IN MINARET

           CROSS-HAIRS FIND the barking dog, then CHRIS’ BOOT. 

           THE BUTCHER

           Powers up the drill, THE BUZZING rings over his words--

                                 THE BUTCHER
                                (in Arabic)
                        You talk to them, you die like them.

           He steps on Omar, lowering the drill toward his jaw.

           CHRIS 

           Can hear the drill and Omar’s preemptive screams. He’ll 
           be exposed but-- he pops up to shoot The Butcher. 
           Before he can-- A SNIPER BULLET CLIPS his helmet. It 
           levels him. He falls flat back. Clouds strobe across his 
           shocked-eyes. He hears the sound of drill meeting bone.   

           THE SHEIKH

           Sees his son being murdered. He runs into the street. Ten 
           feet out, A SNIPER ROUND rips through his chest--

           SNIPER POV 

           CROSS-HAIRS drift back to the rooftop where Chris is-- 

           ROOFTOP / CHRIS POV (UPSIDE DOWN)

           Dog barking viciously. Saliva flying off its incisors. 
           His helmet wobbling there, ruptured like a plum.  

           CHRIS 

           Terror and rage reanimate him. He erupts to his feet. 
           Lunatic emotion, totally exposed, firing on the minaret-- 
           he empties clip then realizes he’s screaming. 

           He falls silent. Two bodies litter the street below. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           A MARINE BATTALION holds perimeter. A sheet draped over 
           Omar is marked by a dozen blood spots. Chris is buzzing 
           with remorse, staring at the body then the minaret.  

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        He had line-of-sight 500 meters out. This 
                        guy isn’t some fundo with a rifle. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Gronzski is all over Marc, bro. 

           In the distance, GRONZKI barks at MARC LEE then climbs in 
           a Bradley. MARC approaches them--

                                 CHRIS
                        Can we work up a squad to pursue him?  

                                 MARC LEE
                        He’s shutting us down. We’re confined to 
                        base pending an incident review.  

                                 CHRIS
                        What? No-- he can’t do that. I’m going 
                        home in three weeks.
                                 MARC LEE
                        It’s going be a long three weeks. 

           Wind blows the sheet off Omar. 

           EXT. WEIGHT LIFTING CAGE, CAMP FALLUJAH - SUNSET

           Chris stalks the cage, shirtless and sweating, burning 
           with animal rage as darkness falls on Fallujah. 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. MARCH AIRFORCE BASE, CALIFORNIA - NIGHT

           Halogen spotlights illuminate the tarmac. SOLDIERS emerge 
           from darkness, pushing toward their waiting families. 

           FIND TAYA standing tall in heels, 9 months pregnant. She 
           finally spots Chris limping toward her-- 

           She walks into his arms and STARTS SWINGING her fists. 

                                 TAYA
                        Two weeks. I thought you were dead for 
                        two fucking weeks--

           He pulls her close, holding her until her rage gives way 
           to tears. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

           They stand there long after everyone has gone.  

           INT. BEDROOM

           Taya lowers the lights and steps out of heels and dress. 
           At 9 MONTHS PREGNANT she’s not sure she’s sexy anymore.  
           Chris exits the shower, stops in the door, staring-- 

                                 TAYA
                        Say something. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever 
                        seen.  

                                 TAYA
                        I have an alien growing inside me.

           She loses her nerve, sits on the bed. 
                                 CHRIS
                        Well, it’s sexy as all hell.

           He kneels before her, running his hands across her belly.

                                 TAYA
                        There’s a strange man in my bedroom. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Our bedroom.

                                 TAYA
                        Your hands feel different. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (kissing her belly)
                        They’re mine. I swear. 

                                 TAYA
                        Why am I so nervous? 

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m nervous too.

                                 TAYA
                        You are?

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah... 
                                (climbs on top of her)
                        What if I pop something? What if a little 
                        alien hand reaches out and grabs me?

           She laughs and swats him. She touches his face, squishing 
           his cheeks and making faces with his face. 

                                 TAYA
                        Who are you?

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m your husband. 

                                 TAYA
                        I need you--
                                (pulling him closer)
                        I need you here. 

           He pretends he didn’t hear it. Her face opens in ecstasy. 

           INT. BREAKFAST TABLE, CHRIS’ HOUSE - MORNING

           CHRIS is showered, shaven and ill-at-ease. He studies his 
           hands, nicked, dry and alien on the macrame placemat. 
                                 TAYA (OC)
                                (far away)
                        --it might be nice to get out--

           His coffee steams before him, like smoke off the barrel.  

                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        --you listening to me? Chris?--

                                 CHRIS
                                (looks up)
                        Huh? Yeah.

                                 TAYA
                        I’m asking you what you want to do.

                                 CHRIS
                        Maybe we could just relax?

           She watches his leg pump. He clocks her watching and 
           quickly stills himself. 

           INT. OBGYN OFFICE, SAN DIEGO - DAY

           A room doused in sunshine. TAYA lays on the table. DOCTOR 
           HOFFSTADER works the wand over her belly. 

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        Should be any day now. How you feeling? 

                                 TAYA
                        Uncomfortable and impatient.

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        That’s to be expected.

           Chris pets his wife’s hair. He affects calm but he’s 
           sweaty and flush.  

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER (CONT’D)
                        How about you Mr. Kyle? How’re you 
                        feeling?

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Good. We’re feeling great. 

                                 TAYA
                        He just got home. 

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        I imagine you’re still decompressing.
                                 CHRIS
                        Not really. 

                                 TAYA
                        This is the first time he’s left the 
                        house. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (shoots a look)
                        I’m just happy to be home. 

           Hoffstader reaches for a b.p. cuff. 

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        Here, slip this on. 

           He awkwardly consents. The cuff tightens. 

                                 CHRIS
                        If you really wanna help, you should be 
                        looking at my knees.

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        Are you a smoker?

                                 CHRIS
                        No, ma’am. 

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        Do you drink?

                                 CHRIS
                                (charming)
                        Only when I’m trying to get drunk.  

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        170 over 110. 

                                 TAYA
                        Is that high? 

                                 DOCTOR HOFFSTADER
                        Not if you just had 14 cups of coffee. 
                        But for someone who is sitting down--

                                 CHRIS
                        I’ll look into it. Thanks doc. 

           He’s smiling but his tone quiets her. She overstepped. 

           INT. TRUCK, SOUTHBOUND FREEWAY - DAY

           CHRIS is weaving through rush-hour traffic. 
                                 CHRIS
                        You sabotaged me back there. 

                                 TAYA
                        You’re not talking about it. You act like 
                        it’s all okay but you’re clearly not--

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m fine. 

                                 TAYA
                        You’re not fine. Your blood pressure--

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m fine. I’m driving down the freeway 
                        and it’s sunny and 72 degrees. I’m fine. 
                                (can’t hold it)
                        But you know there are people dying over 
                        there and I look around here and it’s 
                        like it’s not even happening. It’s barely 
                        on the news, no one talks about it. No 
                        one cares. And if I stay here long I’ll 
                        probably forget about it too. We’re at 
                        war and I’m headed to the mall. 

                                 TAYA
                        I care. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m useless here, I can’t help anybody--

           She looks pained, ready to cry.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I don’t belong. I--

           She’s arching in the seat, MOANING as her water breaks. 

                                 TAYA
                        It’s happening-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        What? Shit. Oh shit--

           Chris swerves from the SOUTHBOUND FAST LANE across the 
           dirt median and onto the freeway, heading north--

                                 TAYA
                        What’re you doing!

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m going back-- 

           Dust kicks up. Horns blare. He’s speeding north now.
                                 TAYA
                                (laughing and crying in the

                        --oh my god, you’re crazy! You’re crazy 
                        Chris you know that?

           There’s a look between them like spilled sunlight. In a 
           magical moment, he reaches for her and--

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           Taya grips his hand. Her wailing screams fall silent and--

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM

           Taya stares blankly at Chris. For a moment he thinks he 
           lost her. He’s searching her eyes for life when--

           A SMALL CRY breaks the tension and A BABY BOY finds its 
           way into his hands covered in vernix and blood. 

                                 CHRIS
                        My boy...

           He holds him to the light. Relief pours over him. Taya is 
           glowing and he huddles close to her.  

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Look at our boy. Look what we made. I 
                        love you lil’ lady. We made it-- 

           He holds his family close. BEDOUIN MUSIC SWELLS--

                                                              FADE TO:

           A THERMAL IMAGE from a scope. MARINES emerge from tall 
           grass, one-by-one, rifles at rest, when A SHOT IS FIRED.  

           A MARINE FALLS. Others dive for cover. An Arabic sickle & 
           sword appear on a TV screen. We are--

           INT. DEN, CHRIS’S HOUSE, CORONADO, CA - NIGHT

           PAN ACROSS an Iraqi parcel on the coffee table. FIND 
           CHRIS staring at the TV, livid, lit by Christmas lights.

                                 TAYA (OC)
                        Do you not hear him crying?

           Chris lunges for the remote as another KILL SHOT PLAYS. 
                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        Oh god! What’re you watching? What is 
                        that--

                                 CHRIS
                        An AQI sniper is recording his kills. 
                        They sell the DVDs in the street. 

                                 TAYA
                        That’s sick.

                                 CHRIS
                        The gunfight you heard, it was him.
                                (nods to TV)
                        Mustafa. 

                                 TAYA
                        What happened that day?

           Chris shakes his head, unwilling to go there--

                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure my imagination is worse than 
                        anything you could--  

                                 CHRIS
                                (shoots her down)
                        No, it’s not. They’re fucking savages. 

                                 TAYA
                        Chris--

                                 CHRIS
                        There’s no other word for it. 

           His blood pressure pulses on his unyielding face. 

                                 TAYA
                                (hands him the baby)
                        Hold him while I make a bottle. And turn 
                        that off.  

           Chris holds his son. He’s settled by him. Those eyes, the 
           innocence; this was once him. But that BEDOUIN MUSIC 
           swells again and his eyes are drawn back to the TV. 

                                 “SECOND TOUR”

           EXT. AL TAQADDUM AIRBASE, IRAQ - DAY

           The tail of a C-17 draws down. YOUNG MARINES file off. 
           Then, CHRIS ambles out, squinting into the dirty sunset. 
                                 CPT. MARTINS
                                (sharp-nosed, fit)
                        Welcome home. Colonel Jones is waiting 
                        for you. How was the flight? 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Slower than Christmas. 

           Chris is following him toward a Blackhawk when he spots-- 

           A SQUAD OF MARINES 

           They wait on the tarmac. Weary, injured, heading home. 
           JEFF KYLE doesn’t see Chris until he has hands on him. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Grunt-- 

           Jeff is slow to react, almost like he can’t see past some 
           atrocity that’s been branded on the back of his eyeballs.   

                                 JEFF
                        Chris?

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        What are you doing here?

           Jeff falls into big brothers arms. It shocks Chris--

                                 CHRIS KYLE (CONT’D)
                        You alright? What happened?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m-- I’m okay. I just tired, man. I lost 
                        some friends and-- I’m tired of it. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        You get home. You’ll be alright-- 

           Chris adjusts Jeff’s collar, a tender gesture.

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah. Fuck this place. Fuck it.

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        I’m proud of you. Dad is too. Now go home 
                        and try and forget about this hellhole.

           Chris shakes some vinegar into him then turns away. His 
           eyes burn with rage at what they did to his brother.

                        I’ve studied insurgencies. Every one 
                        since the first century. These wars are 
                        won and lost in the minds of our enemy.

                        They were taken by an informant. 
                                 COL. JONES 
                        We plugged the rat-hole that is Fallujah 
                        and they fled to Ramadi. 

           As they cross the Euphrates the SLUMS OF RAMADI are laid 
           out before them like a blanket of chaos. 

                                 CPT. MARTINS (OC)
                        You will re-establish your presence on 
                        the gun while you prepare the Op. Lets 
                        put the fear of God in these savages.

           SFX: SNIPER SHOTS thunder over the landscape. Shot after 
           shot after shot. A killing storm. 

           INT. OP SEC TENT, SHARK BASE - NIGHT

           CHRIS stands in front of Team Three, armed with a 60-inch 
           monitor and a TuffBook. They’re chanting, “Power-point”. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You guys know how I hate this shit so 
                        shut your traps. Our target is number #3 
                        on the high value target-list. 
                                (clicks first slide)
                        We’ll be heading upriver, cover of 
                        darkness, two boats teams and--

           They’re cracking up. He turns to see his slide has been 
           hijacked with A PHOTO OF HIS BACHELOR PARTY; the “best 
           men” pose with a spray-painted groom. They look so young. 

           Chris turns back to his men and, for a moment, their 
           smiling faces appear immortal in the feeble light. 

           SCORE SWELLS: MOBY, “The Violent Bear it Away”. FLASH TO: 

           EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT

           SEAL TEAM THREE/CHARLIE COMPANY motor upriver in two 
           rafts, geared to the tits, black on black.  

                                 BIGGLES 
                                (whisper mic)
                        Don’t rock the boat, Legend can’t swim. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Radio silence. You fucking Walrus. 

           The sickle moon catches Biggle’s intrepid smile and--

                                                              BACK TO:
           INT. OP SEC TENT

           Brief finished, TEAM THREE file out past Chris giving 
           atta-boys and cracking jokes. Only one remains--

                                 MARC LEE
                        Is this thing bulletproof?

           He picks Chris’ LITTLE BLUE BIBLE off the table.  

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        I dunno. Why?

                                 MARC LEE
                        You never open it, so I just assumed...

           Chris smiles, appreciating the jibe. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        It’s God, country, family-- right?
                                (crosses his chest to show 
                                where they fit)

                                 MARC LEE
                        You got a God?

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Depends who’s shooting at me.  

                                 MARC LEE
                        If you find anything here, make it that. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Are you getting weird on me?

                                 MARC LEE
                        I guess I am. 

           FLASH TO the boat speeding upriver past rusted-out cars, 
           refuse and the rotting carcass of a mule.

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        We had an electric fence around our 
                        property in Oregon and us kids would see 
                        who could hang on the longest. War is 
                        like that, it puts lightning in your 
                        bones. But if you let go here you die.

           Chris looks uneasy, impatient--

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        You believe in what we’re doing here?
                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Evil lives here, Marc. We’ve seen it. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Evil lives everywhere. Here it just 
                        shoots back. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        You wanna invite al-Qaeda to come fight 
                        in San Diego then? Or Boston? What we’re 
                        protecting is bigger than this. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Don’t lose yourself to it, Chris. Don’t 
                        become the thing you’re hunting.  

                                 CHRIS
                        You wanna sit this one out?

                                 MARC LEE
                                (considered beat)
                        Hell no. Lets go kill this motherfucker.

           He exits. Chris stands alone. Lightening in his bones.

           EXT. UPRIVER - NIGHT

           SEAL TEAM 3 emerge from ink black water, guns up, fluid, 
           balletic, unlike anything we’ve seen up till now. 

           A nine-foot wall envelopes the two-story dye factory. 

           CHRIS POV (N/V)

           The green hue of night-vision, pushing to the wall. 
           BIGGLES and TITTIES lace their hands and boost Chris up-- 

           COURTYARD

           Boots land softly. Chris looks up and 20 INSURGENTS are 
           sleeping on prayer mats in the night air, AK’s at ready.  

           CHRIS POV (N/V)

           He’s tracking across them, waiting for movement. 

                                 MARC LEE (OS)
                                (over radio)
                        You alright in there?

           The massive entry door is 20 feet away. Chris holds his 
           gear from rattling and steps over the sleeping men.
           He’s moving agonizing slow when-- A MAN STARTS coughing 
           and sits up. Chris zeroes in on him as he stands--

           But the man walks inside and never looks back. 

           Chris dodges to the door, undoes the latch and the DOOR 
           CREAKS open. BIGGLES and DAUBER are just inside when--

                                 INSURGENT
                        Shinzi al wada!! Shinzi al--

           THE YELLING INSURGENT lifts his gun. BIGGLES TAGS HIM, 
           Chest then header, a fucking pro. TEAM 3 floods in and--

                                 MARC LEE
                        Stay on the ground. Hands on your head-- 

           Titties, Tony and Budsack stick. TEAM 3 PUSH INTO--

           INT. DYE FACTORY

           TEAM 3 bowl in, tentacles of fire reaching into darkness. 
           INSURGENTS shoot from behind machinery and textiles. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Moving. 

           Chris comes upon A FALLEN INSURGENT with jitters. One arm 
           bent behind him. Chris FLASHES A PHOTO of--

                                 CHRIS
                        This man. The Butcher. Is he here?

           Chris applies pressure to a wound. The MAN SCREAMS, NODS--

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        The back? Is he in back? 

                                 MARC LEE
                                (see something beneath him)
                        Grenade--

           Marc tackles Chris away as-- THE BLAST sends a thousand 
           shards of metal slicing outward. 

           A powdery silence follows. WHIP-PAN TO CHRIS, in agony. 
           Marc rips open his vest. Chris gasps for air. 

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        Hold still. 

           SHRAPNEL punctured the Bible and just-pierced his body 
           armor. Chris is stunned, the Bible saved his life.
           GUNFIRE CHATTERS out back. Short-bursts. 

                                 DAUBER (OS)
                        Squirters. Red side. Contact. 

           Chirps of “CLEAR” then-- A SINGLE SHOT behind a vat. 
           Biggles steps out, doused in moonlight.

                                 BIGGLES
                        If they’re worth shooting once...

           OUT BACK

           Wind rattles reeds along the river. ASIAN and DAUBER 
           guard a Suzuki Samurai with TWO DEAD INSURGENTS inside. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Tight Samurai.

                                 DAUBER
                        Butcher rides in style.

           Chris checks the driver, nope. He circles to the 
           passenger, unwraps a keffiyeh, shines a light on him.

                                 CHRIS
                        It ain’t him. 

                                 ASIAN
                        How can you tell? They all look alike. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        What do you want to do?

           Chris is staring at the two dead men. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone in the courtyard hears the INTERROGATION INSIDE: 

                                 CHRIS (OS)
                        --you’re going to tell me where he is, or 
                        I’m going to put a bullet in your head--

           TERP TRANSLATES(OS), jabbering away when-- 

                                 CHRIS KYLE (OS
                        You know what, fuck it--

           BAM! A single shot. INSURGENTS panic. 

                                 TITTIES
                        This shit just went southbound.
                                 CHRIS KYLE
                                (storms out, shadow looming)
                        Who’s next? 

                                 TONY
                        How bout Mr. Pizza face here. 

           Chris calmly drags MR. PIZZA FACE inside. 

           INSIDE

           MR. PIZZA FACE is on his knees next to THE BODY.  

                                 CHRIS
                        I want to know where the Butcher is--

           TERP REPEATS his question. PIZZA FACE begs for mercy. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Was he here? Where do I find him?  

           COURTYARD

           INSURGENTS are silent. Some mutter prayers. 

           INSIDE (SIDE-VIEW)

           Chris raises the gun to the back of MR. PIZZA FACES head.  

                                 CHRIS KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, moving on--

           BLAM! He fires. The body crumbles forward. But no blood. 
           He fell from shock. BIGGLES gags him, removes his jacket-- 

           They drag him out and pull in dead body of SAMURAI GUY #2 
           (two bodies on the floor match the two shots fired).  

           COURTYARD

           Chris barrels out, gun in hand. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Next.

                                 TITTIES
                        How ‘bout Poopy Pants?

           Chris looks past the man who shat himself to AN INSURGENT 
           staring at the ground with eyes like BLACK OPALS.

           INSIDE

           CHRIS drags BLACK OPALS to the face-down bodies. 
                                 CHRIS
                        Where is The Butcher? Where’d they go? 

           TERP is pleading (throughout). BLACK OPALS is sweating. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        He’s trying to help you! Where’s the fall-
                        back spot? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Where is it you fucking savage! 

           Chris throttles him, a vicious blow to the jaw. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        You wanna die! Huh? I can go all night. 
                        I’ll kill every last one of you-- 

           CHRIS holds his .45 to the back of the man’s head. 

           The look in his eyes has changed. This time it’s real. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Chris--

                                 CHRIS
                        I need another body. 

                                  BIGGLES
                        Smoke him. Smoke his ass--

                                 CHRIS
                        Where is he!

                                 MARC LEE
                        Don’t do it-- 

           They’re lost in the drama, is this really happening?

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        Chris! 

                                 CHRIS 
                                (stroking trigger)
                        Burn in hell--

                                 BLACK OPAL
                        Fahima Halal! Fahima Halal--

           Silence. They’re all buzzing. Chris looks to Terp.

                                 TERP
                        This is a restaurant in South Ramadi. 
                                 ASIAN
                        That’s 6 clicks from here. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Then we gotta move. Call it in, Squirrel.  

           “SQUIRREL”, the Comm-Guy, is a 135lb grappler from 
           Modesto. He turns away with the radio

                                 SQUIRREL
                        This is Charlie 3-2, requesting immediate 
                        follow-on-target pursuit--

           Black Opals watches them with eerie calm. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER/NIGHT

           TEAM 3 push deeper. MARC LEE leads them through shadows. 

           ON ROOFTOP ABOVE

           CHRIS lays on his rifle. BIGGLES watches his back. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        I popped wood when I shot that guy. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Seriously?

                                 BIGGLES
                        Rock hard boner. Is that weird or what?

                                 CHRIS
                        This shit’s all weird

           Biggles draws The Punisher skull in loose gravel. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Were you going to shoot that guy back 
                        there? I couldn’t really tell.

           Chris is silent. Lightening shocks the sky. Rain falls.  

                                 BIGGLES (CONT’D)
                        Next time a girl asks what turns me on-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        Next time’ll be the first time. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (turns to rain)
                        I’ll say, war baby. War gives me wood. 
           EXT. STREET/OUTSIDE FAHIMA HALAL - PRE-DAWN

           TEAM THREE trundle past ramshackle buildings largely 
           unbombed. ASIAN maps schematics, selects a building.

           INT. STAIRCASE/HALLWAY, BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Chris signals, this door. BIGGLES slips CAT-CLAW in...

           INT. CORNER APARTMENT, SIXTH FLOOR 

           A modest apartment. The family gathered; PROTECTIVE 
           FATHER hugs his BOY(4) and GIRL(9) as his WIFE frets.

                                 CHRIS
                        Tell them they can’t leave until we do. 

           He looks out windows to an embattled RESTAURANT BELOW. 

                                 TITTIES
                        They do a lot of business, this place?

                                 CHRIS 
                        Lets keep eyes on it and-- 
                                (cringes in pain)
                        Get pictures of anyone coming and going. 

                                 TONY
                        You alright, Chief? 

                                 CHRIS
                        My knees are killing. 

           INT. BACK BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sunlight plays on walls. Chris lies on the floor, head on 
           his ruck-sack. His eyes flutter closed and WE ARE--

           INT. CHRIS’ HOUSE, SAN DIEGO - “DREAM SEQUENCE”

           FROM ABOVE- we look down on TAYA laying in the middle of 
           the floor hugging COLTON to her chest. She’s talking to 
           him, solemn, then her EYES FLASH to us and something 
           liquid and dark begins to seep out beneath her. 

           Blood darkens the carpet, covers the floor and keeps 
           rising. The boy starts CRYING, trying to escape her. Her 
           eyes are locked on us as she holds him tight. 
           His crying becomes the BLEATING OF A SHEEP and-- it’s now 
           a sheep struggling in her arms. The blood keeps rising, 
           submerging her now-naked body. As it rises-- 

           The sheep breaks free and stands on her chest. There’s 
           surrender in Taya’s eyes as the fluid overtakes her ears, 
           nose and mouth. The sheep now stands alone on a lake of 
           blood in their living room. 

           INT. BACK BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CHRIS springs up, swinging at a figure in the dark. 

                                 DAUBER
                        Easy, buddy. Easy. I’m on your side. 
                                (offers a hand)
                        Get up. You’ll wanna see this.

           LIVING ROOM WINDOW / LOOKING BELOW

           This section of city has electricity. Lights are visible 
           around the plywood on the restaurant windows. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        16 military aged males have gone in. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        They serve more customers than McDonalds.

                                 MARC LEE
                        A van pulled up at 1900 and ushered an 
                        Iraqi cleric inside. And check this--

           ON DIGI-CAMERA, ZOOMS ON PHOTO of The Butcher entering-- 

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s him. He still inside? 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Unless there’s another way out--

                                 BIGGLES
                                (on a weird high)
                        Could’ve tunnelled out with a spoon. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Any idea what’s in there? 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Big Macs and crack. 

           Without warning CHRIS SMACKS BIGGLES. He goes down. 
           TITTIES and BUDSACK jump in: “Whoa” “Easy” “Stay calm”.
                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        You need to shut your fucking trap. 

                                 LT. BUDSACK
                        Back off Chris. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (held back)
                        Fuck you, man-- You think you’re 
                        different than us? 

                                 CHRIS
                        I outrank you, so yeah, I am-- 

                                 BIGGLE
                        Whatever. You’re not shit. You just got a 
                        fucking horse-shoe crammed up your ass. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (regretful)
                        Hash out tactics, we go at zero-dark. 

           He’s slipping away when FATHER SPEAKS, TERP TRANSLATES:

                                 TERP 
                        He invites you to join him for Eid al-
                        Adha supper. He says, on this day 
                        everyone has a seat at his table.   

                                 CHRIS
                        Thank him and tell him I’m sorry we’re in 
                        his home like this. We’ll be gone soon.  

           Chris nods gratitude and slips down the dark hallway.  

           DINING ROOM - LATER

           A braised head of a lamb eaten clean. The boys are 
           laughing, at ease. Chris watches THE FATHER school his 
           SON, envious of their bond and reminded of his own son. 

           As he watches-- (ECU) he spots “shooters strawberries” on 
           father’s elbows. 

           BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CHRIS is agitated, pacing the floor in a deliberate 
           manner until he HEARS A CREAK in the floorboards-- 

           DINING ROOM/HALLWAY

           TITTIES is shoveling more food in when hand stops him.  
           Chris signals, no more. THE FATHER’S eyes flick up as-- 
           CHRIS RIPS FATHER out of his chair, dragging him down the 
           hall. WIFE and KIDS screaming. Dauber holds them off-- 

           Chris dumps the father at a STASH HOLE. In the floor is 
           an arsenal of AKs, RPGs and IED components. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Tell him he’s gonna be shipped off for 
                        detention and his Iraqi court can decide 
                        what to do with him, or-- he can help us.

           The Father looks up, pale with defiance.

           EXT. FAHIM HALAL - NIGHT

           THE FATHER shuffles up the dusty street toward us--

                                 TITTIES (VO)
                        Approaching the door...

           IN ADJACENT ALLEY

           CHRIS, MARC LEE and TITTIES wait.

                                 TITTIES (CONT’D)
                        10 meters...

           BACK ALLEY

           TONY, BIGGLES and ASIAN... 

                                 TITTIES (VO) (CONT’D)
                        5 meters...

           SNIPERS NEST

           DAUBER watches with cross-hairs. 

                                 TITTIES (VO) (CONT’D)
                        He’s knocking...

           AT THE DOOR

           A sliding grate opens and-- 

                                 TITTIES (VO) (CONT’D)
                        They’re vetting him. 

           GUARD’S POV

           FATHER attempts to alert the Guard to the TWO MEN in 
           robes at the oil drum fire, but the Guard doesn’t see it--
                                 TITTIES (CONT’D)
                        Hold. Hold--

           CHRIS POV (N/V)

           As the door opens, the GUARD comes into view--

                                 TITTIES (OS) (CONT’D)
                        Now. 

           Chris fires and the GUARD’S HEAD explodes. FATHER dives 
           for Guard’s weapon but GUNFIRE FROM INSIDE shreds him. 

           TWO MEN in robes (ASIAN & SQUIRREL) rush the door tossing 
           grenades, pulling the father out as the GRENADES EXPLODE. 

           CHRIS, MARC LEE and TITTIES push inside--

           INT. FAHIM HALAL

           A smoky banquet hall. GUNFIRE lights from the far wall.  

                                 CHRIS
                        - They’re coming out the back. 

           IN THE ALLEY

           TONY and BIGGLES are posted in the alley, waiting. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (keys mike)
                        Negative. Nothing yet--

           KITCHEN 

           An IRAQI MAN is hung up by a chain, groaning. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Help him--

                                 MARC LEE (OC)
                        Down here--

           Stairs lead down into darkness. Chris follows him into--

           AN UNDERGROUND TUNNEL

           A naked bulb illuminates a tunnel stretching to darkness. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (keys mike)
                        They’re coming back up. Watch your six--
           The tunnel detonates. Dirt and debris explode at them. 

           BACK ALLEY

           BIGGLES and TONY are posted up. The RADIO STATIC--  

                                 BIGGLES
                        --I can’t hear you. Say again. Chris--

           HALF BLOCK DOWN

           TEN INSURGENTS pour out a building, circling back toward 
           Biggles and Tony.

           KITCHEN 

           CHRIS bowls in, panicked, covered in dirt. TITTIES 
           staggers from a freezer of frozen bodies. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Move. 

           SNIPER NEST

           DAUBER is scanning streets, sees approaching Insurgents-- 

                                 DAUBER
                        12 o’clock! 12 o’clock.

           He starts picking off shooters but more seep out.

           BACK ALLEY

           BIGGLES and TONY dive for cover as BULLETS RIP past. 
           CHRIS ducks out the backdoor, covering them--

                                 CHRIS
                        Pull back! Pull back! Loading--

                                 BIGGLES
                                (gunning, balls out)
                        Got you. 

           AN RPG screams down the smoke-filled alley between them 
           and EXPLODES BELOW THE SNIPER NEST as--

           THE BUTCHER 

           Exits the building, a lanky stride, firing a .50. He’s 
           shooting his way toward a getaway truck.

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s him. Eyes on target. Dauber?
           SNIPER NEST

           Dauber struggles from under debris. 

                                 DAUBER
                        Negative. No shot--

           CHRIS POV

           His focus becomes clear. Advancing. He DOWNS THREE 
           INSURGENTS as the Butcher jumps into a truck.

                                 CHRIS
                        Crossing.

           Chris dodges across shooters alley, running into the next 
           street (parallel with truck) hoping for a clean shot--

           NEXT INTERSECTION

           As Chris reaches it the flatbed speeds past a block to 
           the north. He’s running at a sprint but--

           At next intersection, he’s lost more ground. He doubles 
           over in defeat, grabbing his knees. TIME SLOWS AS--

           WINDOW ABOVE

           A SLIM SHADOW balances a gun on the window-sill, aiming 
           down at Chris. He pulls trigger-- “click”. It’s jammed.  

           CHRIS looks up, shocked it happened again. He backs away.  

           EXT. FAHIM HALAL

           HUMVEES hold back the crowd as a TRIBAL LEADER screams 
           chants and they hoist FATHER’S BODY in the air. THE BOY 
           stands by, staring daggers at CHRIS and CPT. MARTINS.  

                                 CHRIS
                        I offered detention. I gave him a choice--  

                                 CPT. MARTIN
                        Forget about it. Hell of an effort here--

           Chris can’t take his eyes off his accusers; off the boy. 

                                 PFC ALVAREZ
                        Sir, we got armed crowds moving this way--

                                 CPT. MARTIN
                        You and your boys keep after it, Chief. 
           As he walks away, Chris hustles Terp over to TRIBAL 
           LEADER and FATHERLESS BOY. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        Tell them he was stashing weapons for the 
                        same people who butchered your clerics 
                        and tribal leaders in there. 

           Tribal Leader listens, then responds violently-- 

                                 TERP 
                        He says this is their problem. Their 
                        territory. You must ask for their help.

                                 BIGGLES 
                                (atop Humvee)
                        We got uglies coming. Let’s go--

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        If we ask him for help he’ll be the one 
                        they’re carving up next. 

           TERP translates as 150 INSURGENTS round the corner. 

                                 TERP
                        He says this is the land of his father 
                        and he is not afraid. But your evil-- is 
                        greater than the thing you fight. He is 
                        calls you the white devil of Ramadi.  

           The words poison Chris; upset bleeds to rage and his 
           venomous expression makes it appear true; he’s the wolf. 

           EXT. HUMVEE (MOVING)

           The Humvee roars past. Biggles howls from the 60, ready 
           to dance. He’s drawn THE PUNISHER SKULL in gunners grease 
           on the shield and it glimmers in the moonlight.

                                                              FADE TO:

           TIGHT ON CHRIS, a ruinous look on his face. We are--

           INT. MATERNITY WARD, SAN DIEGO

           Chris peers through wire-reinforced glass into the 
           nursery where his NEWBORN DAUGHTER IS SCREAMING-- 

                                 TAYA (VO)
                        Are we winning this war?
                                 CHRIS (VO)
                        I don’t know...  

           TWO NURSES walk past his daughter without helping her. 
           Chris bangs on the glass trying to get their attention. 

           INT. JIFFY LUBE - DAY

           We hear the mechanistic buzz and whir of tools as we PAN 
           ACROSS GUMBALL MACHINES and TOY DISPENSERS on the wall. 
           COLTON(3) holds a toy, pissed it’s not the one he wanted.  

                                 COLTON 
                        No. No! That one. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You don’t get to choose, bubba. 

           He’s strikingly gentle with his son but-- 

                                 COLTON
                        That one! That one--

                                 CHRIS
                        You get what it gives you. That’s how 
                        this thing works. 

           COLTON melts to the floor in a tantrum. THE BUZZ OF 
           DRILLS sounds from in garage. Chris’ nerves fraying-- 

                                 CHRIS (CONT'D)
                        Don’t do this here. Come on, get up. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (OC)
                        Chris Kyle, your truck is ready. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (tryingly)
                        Get off the floor, buddy. Get up-- 

                                 MANS VOICE (OC)
                        Excuse me, sir. 

           A YOUNG MAN steps too close. Chris rears up, defensive.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Are you “Chief” Chris Kyle? 

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s me. Who’re you?
                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Sorry for the intrusion, sir, but you 
                        saved my life in Fallujah. I was with the 
                        1st Marines. We were trapped in that 
                        house. They called me “Mads”. 

           CUSTOMERS looking at Chris, he’s embarrassed--

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah? Right on. How you holding up? 

                                 MADS/YOUNG VETERAN
                        Great, sir. I’m grateful to be alive. It 
                        hasn’t been easy but--

           He lifts his pant-leg and shows an ARTIFICIAL LEG. 

                                 MADS
                        Better my legs than my eggs. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What do you mean?

                                 MADS
                        Lots of guys I know are back but they’re 
                        not back, y’know? It cost some of them a 
                        lot more than a leg. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m sorry to hear that. 

                                 MADS
                        You should come visit the VA. They’d love 
                        it. Everyone knows who The Legend is. 

           Chris nods but never will. Mads kneels to Colton. 

                                 MADS (CONT’D)
                        I bet you missed your daddy when he was 
                        gone-- but can I tell you something? Your 
                        dad is a hero. He saved my life and 
                        helped me get back to my little girl. 

           Colton looks at his dad with uncertain awe. Chris wells 
           with emotion. CUSTOMERS and EMPLOYEES stand captive-- 

                                 MADS (CONT’D)
                        So thanks for loaning your dad to us, 
                        lil’ man. I wouldn’t be here without him. 

           Mads stands and comes to attention. He salutes Chris.  

                                 MADS (CONT’D)
                        My family thanks you for your service. 
           Chris bites back emotion and returns the salute. 

           INT. NURSERY 

           A pink cocoon of a room. Taya sits in a rocker, breast-
           feeding their daughter, MCKENNA. She’s gentle, imploring--

                                 TAYA
                        I’m making memories by myself. I have no 
                        one to share them with. 

                                 CHRIS 
                        We’re going to have the rest of our lives 
                        for that.

                                 TAYA
                        Will we? When does that start?

           She pulls McKenna off her breast. Chris scoops her up, 
           lays her on the changing table and changes her diaper.

                                 CHRIS
                        We can wait. They can’t.

                                 TAYA
                                (beat)
                        I admire your strength, Chris. The 
                        discipline it must take to move between 
                        your two worlds. I see everything you 
                        have to give up-- on both sides. But if 
                        you think war isn’t changing you, you’re 
                        wrong. If you circle the flame long 
                        enough you will burn this all down.  

           Chris looks up but he seems to look right through her as-- 
           SCORE BUILDS, a steely guitar creeps over raw drums.  

                                 “THIRD TOUR”

           FIVE TEETH JUT from the skull of THE PUNISHER symbol. The 
           symbol is spray-painted on the roof of moving white Taxi.

           INT. TAXI, RAMADI - DAY

           Passenger seat removed, an M60 swings there suspended by 
           rope. Chris mans it, tattoo visible, skull bandanna and 
           sunglasses covering his grizzled face. The Punishers--

                                 BIGGLES 
                                (into radio)
                        --we have visual on the Butchers courier, 
                        pursuing him into the catacombs. Over. 
           BIGGLES DRIVES, trailing a brown van. The city goes from 
           light to dark as they enter “the catacombs”.  

                                 BIGGLES (CONT’D)
                        I bought the ring. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Here?

                                 BIGGLES
                        They’re cheaper here. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You want some savage’s ring? What if it’s 
                        a blood diamond? 

                                 BIGGLES
                        What the fuck do you care? You spilled 
                        more blood than anyone!

                                 CHRIS
                        Not for a rock. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Whatever, man. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You gonna tell her where it came from?

                                 BIGGLES
                        Hell no! I’ll tell her I got from Zales.

           They’re on a long leash; cocky and seemingly invincible. 

           TWO BLOCKS BACK - HUMVEE FOLLOWS

           MARC LEE drives. TONY shotgun. DAUBER in back. Uniforms 
           bastardized; Slayer blasting in broad daylight. 

                                 BIGGLES (OS) (CONT’D)
                        Still with us cookie?

                                 TONY
                                (into radio, checking GPS)
                        Wet and ready. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        20 years from now, we’ll have a reunion 
                        and you’ll be married to a dude. 
                                 TONY
                        As long as you cook and clean. 

           DAUBER sits in back, shaking his head-- 

           UNDERCOVER TAXI

           STREET SPOTTERS reach for their cell phones. Chris glares 
           at them, ominous in skull mask, flipping the bird.

                                 CHRIS
                        Butch has got his peepers out--

                                 BIGGLES
                        That motherfucker is Keyser Söze. You 
                        tell Lt. Martins where we were going out?

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah-- but I might’ve forgot to mention 
                        we were running it in daylight.

           ON A ROOFTOP

           A BAREFOOT TEENAGER races across gravel, aims a RIFLE 
           down at the taxi with The Punisher symbol--

           UNDERCOVER TAXI

           A ROUND pierces the roof and goes through the floorboard--

                                 BIGGLES
                        Damn. You think the skull gave us away? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Naw. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Twelve-o’clock--

           SIX INSURGENTS pop up on a rooftop, firing. Chris leans 
           into the .60 spitting lead up at them. 

           INT. APARTMENT - SAME

           A LANKY IRAQI with shoulder length hair sits at the 
           table. His phone chirps. He stands and grabs a duffle. 

           HIS WIFE watches him step out the door. On the wall is a 
           PHOTO of this man on a medal stand. This is “MUSTAFA”. 
           INT. UNDERCOVER CAR

           Biggles speeds after the van, taking fire from above. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Get me a shot, grandma. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        It’s not me. It’s a Camry--

           Biggles stomps the accelerator, whips around a corner--

           A SHORT STRAIGHTAWAY

           CHRIS FIRES, dumping 75 rounds into the van. It hisses to 
           a stop. A PASSENGER bounds out, diving into a building. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What the fuck?-- 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Rubber junk-man’s got your horseshoe. 

           They roll out in pursuit-- 

           EXT. DISTANT ROOFTOPS 

           MUSTAFA crosses rooftop-to-rooftop with fluency-- 

           INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT COMPLEX

           BLOOD DROPLETS lead to a door. Biggles kicks it in.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Biggles and Chris dance around each other like smoke. 

                                 BIGGLES 
                        Clear. 

           Chris looks out the open window, stairs climb the wall. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (keys mike)
                        We’re headed to the roof. Secure the van. 

           THE VAN

           DAUBER and TONY cover MARC LEE and TITTIES as they open 
           the back of the van. Inside, flats of RED CLAY TILES.
                                 TITTIES
                        Motherfucker is building a 7-11. 

           Marc rips off the top layer, finds: 200,000 ROUNDS AMMO.

                                 MARC LEE 
                        No ammo, no jihad. 

           ROOFTOP

           Drying sheets billow on crisscrossing wires. Chris tracks 
           blood-drops to the ledge. The next roof 15 feet off.

                                 BIGGLES
                        How the hell’d he make that?

                                 CHRIS
                        He didn’t-- 

           Two stories below, PASSENGER lays face down in his mess.  

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        So much for having my horseshoe. 

           Chris pulls his mask down. He has a full-grown beard and 
           the sturm und drang of war are writ loud on his face. 

           DISTANT BALUSTRADE 

           MUSTAFA lays prone. He says a prayer and takes two deep 
           breaths before putting his eye to the scope. 

           ON THE ROOF

           Chris is watching sheets fill with wind.  

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        She’ll take it to Zales and try to find 
                        out how much your spent.

                                 BIGGLES
                        She’s not like that. 

                                 CHRIS
                        They’re all like that. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (laughs)
                        It’s giant. Four karats, bro. It probably 
                        belonged to one of Saddam’s bitches--

           Chris is laughing when he sees a FLASH OF GLASS in the 
           distance. Before he can utter a warning-- 
           A GUNSHOT SOUNDS 

           The bullet flays the muzzle of Biggles M4. Shrapnel 
           enters his face. Biggles goes down in a red mist--  

                                 CHRIS
                        No!--

           The right side of his face is a pulpy cavity. His eye 
           socket obliterated. He appears mortally wounded. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                                (dives on him, keys mike)
                        Biggles is down! Man down. No--

           Chris pulls him close, unglued, chiseled with grief. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        No, buddy. No! Stay with me--

           He drags him one way, then the other. A SHOT pocks the 
           roof at their feet-- 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                                (keys mike)
                        Fuck! Cover! He’s picking us off--

                                 BIGGLES
                        I’m got it-- I got it-- I can walk--

           Biggles pulls himself up, tilting his head forward to not 
           choke on his own blood. With heroic effort, he’s walking--

           Chris is stunned speechless. He ducks an arm, helping-- 

           EXT. STREET 

           TWO MARINE UNITS provide cover as the Humvee speeds off. 

           INT. HUMMER

           MARC LEE drives. DAUBER applies gauze that holds Biggles 
           face on. CHRIS is ruined, on his knees, holding his hand. 

                                 BIGGLES
                                (gargling blood)
                        --I’m sorry--

                                 CHRIS
                        You got nothing to be sorry for. I 
                        shouldn’t have put us up there--
                                 BIGGLES
                        Am I gonna die?

           Chris looks to Dauber--

                                 DAUBER
                        Hell no. They’ll rub a little dirt in it, 
                        get you a sip of water, you’ll be fine.

           Dauber shakes his head, he’s not going to make it. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        --was always gonna be me--

                                 CHRIS
                        Coulda been any of us. Just hang on-- 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Not you. Not the Legend. You lucky fuck-- 

           His body goes into shock. Chris comes unwound. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Don’t die. Don’t do it. You hold on--

           INT. MEDICAL TENT

           LOW ANGLE - plywood floor littered with needles, gloves 
           and blood. A cart is rushed past. MEDICAL PERSONNEL 
           shouting, “we’re losing him”. The picture pulses, blurs--

           EXT. MEDICAL TENT

           THE PUNISHERS stand around the Humvee, sobbing. The sun 
           beats down on them. They’re as still as a photograph.  

                                 TONY
                        Did you see where it came from?

                                 CHRIS
                        1100 meters out. It was Mustafa. 

           A jeep pulls up. COLONEL JONES and CPT. MARTIN step out. 

                                 COL. JONES
                        Will he make it?

           Chris turns away, unable to summon words.  

                                 DAUBER
                        It doesn’t look good, sir.  
                                 TITTIES
                                (kicks the Humvee)
                        Fuck!

           The sun high. A biblical wind blows. 

                                 COL. JONES
                        A Shi’a cab driver we deal with is saying 
                        there’s a stronghold seven doors down.  

                                 CPT. MARTIN
                        We used him before, and the Marines there 
                        are still under heavy fire out there. 

                                 COL. JONES
                        I fully understand if you want to stand-
                        down and regroup. It’s up to you.  

                                 MARC LEE
                        Fuck that. We want payback.   

           It’s out of character. But they all agree. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We’re going back.  

                                 COL. JONES
                                (approves)
                        Rain hell.  

           EXT. STREET, RAMADI

           METALLICA, “Master of Puppets” blasts as-- an M1A2 ABRAMS 
           TANK speeds 45 mph down a street, bad as fuck. TWO 
           BRADLEY TRANSPORT vehicles follow. 

           A CAR pulls into the road ahead. INSURGENT PASSENGERS 
           stand from a sunroof, FIRING AN RPG. It explodes across 
           the tank but before they can pull away--

           The ABRAMS HITS the car at full-speed, vaulting over the 
           top of it, crushing it. 

           INT. BRADLEY TRANSPORT VEHICLE

           THE PUNISHERS. Ears pinned back. Metal blasting. Amp’d to 
           kill. FIND CHRIS consumed by mind-melting rage; he pulls 
           the BIBLE and AMERICAN FLAG out and sets them aside. 

                                 MARC LEE 
                        Two clicks out. Lock and load. 
           He glances at Chris, feeding off him. They all are.   

                                 CHRIS 
                        For Biggles. 

           IN THE STREET

           The tank skids to a stop. The turret spins to a castle-
           like structure and BA-BOOM! 

           THE PUNISHERS pour out of their Bradleys, rolling in both 
           directions, arcing toward the point of entry--  

           THE COURTYARD

           Punishers pour in. Zero resistance. FOUR INSURGENTS lay 
           dead, dispatched by the tank. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Courtyard is clear. Moving.

                                 CHRIS
                        Some stronghold. Move.

           DAUBER and TONY follow them up a crumbled staircase--

           LONG HALLWAY

           Ominously still. Sunlight spills through grated windows 
           facing the street. Chris and Marc move to the first door-- 

           FIRST ROOM 

           A sleeping mat. A TV plays an Al Jazeeri game show. Marc 
           pushes toward the bathroom, coming around the corner---

           BATHROOM

           The faucet runs on a straight-razor. 

                                 MARC LEE
                        Clear.

           FIRST ROOM

           MARC steps back in, golden dust motes float around him.

                                 MARC LEE (CONT’D)
                        Somebody left in a hurry. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (keys mike)
                        You sure we got the right--
           CANON-FIRE HITS the outer-hallway from across the street. 
           Brrrrrb-Brrrrb!! Rounds banging with seismic force. 

                                 DAUBER (OS)
                        Fuck--

           TIME SLOWS as Chris swings toward the door. Marc gets 
           there first, steps through it-- 

           LONG HALLWAY

           GUNFIRE RAINS through grated windows. The hall is 
           exploding, coming apart in dusty chunks of plaster. 

           DAUBER and TONY are pinned between windows. MARC LEE 
           steps to the nearest window to lay suppressive fire and--

           GUNFIRE STRAFES IN AT AN ANGLE, HITTING MARC LEE IN HIS 
           OPEN MOUTH. HE’S BLOWN BACKWARDS, HITTING THE WALL AND--

           MARC LEE is down. Blood pooling out. A forever stare. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Marc--

           CHRIS is staggered but training takes over-- and he steps 
           into the same window, BLASTING FIRE.

           DAUBER is trying to intubate Marc but the back of his 
           head is gone. He was dead before he hit the wall. 

           THE ABRAMS TURRET SPINS. THE CANON BOOMS. THE EARTH 
           TREMBLES AS THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET IS FLATTENED-- 

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           The trembling is the turbulence of an aircraft. We are-- 

           INT. C-17 GLOBEMASTER (IN FLIGHT) - NIGHT

           In the dim red light, FIND BIGGLES on a tented gurney, 
           stable but critical; his head caved in, covered in 
           bandage. CHRIS holds his gurney still, staring ahead-- 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (VO)
                        “Glory is something some men chase and 
                        others find themselves stumbling upon--”

           REVERSE TO A CASKET draped in stars and stripes. 
           EXT. FORT ROSECRANS NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY

           A pasture of tombstones overlook the Pacific. CHRIS, with 
           a chest-full of medals, stands with TAYA, COLTON(4) and 
           MCKENNA(2). TAYA watches MARC’S WIFE weep as-- 

           MARC LEE’S MOM reads his LAST LETTER HOME:

                                 MARC’S MOM/WOMAN’S VOICE
                        ”My question is when does glory fade away 
                        and become a wrongful crusade?” 

           CHRIS HEARS MARC’S VOICE:

                                 MARC LEE (VO)
                        “When does it become an unjustified means 
                        by which one is completely consumed.”

           COLTON reaches for his father’s hand. Chris starts, looks 
           at Colton, then Taya. He’s caught with his guard down-- 

           He looks lonely in his grief, like he may let them in-- 
           but he quickly returns his gaze to the flagged casket.  

           CLOSE ON CASKET

           NAVY SEALS bang their Tridents into the coffin. A hollow 
           thump, like fists trying to revive a heart. 

           INT. TAYA’S CAR (MOVING) - LATER

           San Diego traffic. THE KIDS chatter in back. CHRIS 
           drives, in a fugue-state when he spots-- 

           A VAN, four cars back, same make as the one in Ramadi.

                                 TAYA
                        Debbie said he wrote that letter two 
                        weeks ago. Did he say any of that to you?

           VAN pulls in the turning lane, pulling alongside them. 
           Chris grips the wheel and-- the van roars past

                                 TAYA (CONT'D)
                                (voice cracking)
                        Chris?-- I want to know what you thought 
                        of his letter?

                                 CHRIS
                                (slow, absent)
                        An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles 
                        had just been shot. We were operating off 
                        emotion and-- we walked into an ambush.  
           The kids have quieted. The air sucked from the car. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        But that’s not what killed him-- that 
                        letter did. That letter killed Marc Lee. 
                                (looks to her)
                        He let go and he paid the price for it. 

           Taya turns away, havoc in her eyes. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           TV lights the dark room. NEWS GRAPHIC: “Americans killed 
           in Iraq: 3932”. CHRIS and TAYA talk to the ceiling.  

                                 CHRIS
                        If something ever happened to me-- you’d 
                        meet someone else. You’d be alright. 

           His detachment is unearthly, Christ-like.

                                 TAYA
                        Do you want to die? Is that what it is? 

                                 CHRIS
                        No.

                                 TAYA
                                (cheeks shine with tears)
                        Then why do it? I want to understand. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I do it for you. To protect you. 

                                 TAYA
                        No, you don’t. No. We’re here--
                                (crying)
                        If you go back I’m going to leave you.   

           He reaches for her, holding her close. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I know. 

           INT. VETERAN’S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, SAN DIEGO - DAY

           A DUST MOTH flutters around the wall sconce. Wilted 
           flowers and “get-well” cards cover the windowsill. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (enters)
                        Hey, buddy--
           BIGGLES lays in bed. Half his head caved-in and badly 
           marred, one eyelid open on a milky-white eyeball. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Chris? Where are you?

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m right here just give me a minute--
                                (hobbles around the bed; 
                                waves a hand)
                        Just blind as a bat, huh?

                                 GOGGLES
                        Yeah... It fucking blows. They’re gonna 
                        fix my face though. 

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s good. Your face always needed 
                        fixing. 

           He sounds upbeat but his face betrays him. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I hear you proposed to Kelly? Did you 
                        tell her the diamond was from Zales?

                                 BIGGLES
                        Naw. I bought a new one. A small one. Her 
                        old man helped me out.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Nice.

                        She wouldn’t leave me, bro. I told her to 
                        go away-- but she wouldn’t leave me. 
                                (voice cracking)
                        She’s getting a raw fucking deal.

                                 CHRIS
                        No she’s not. She’s getting you. 
                                (eyes welling up, smiles)
                        All four inches. 

           Biggles laughs and tears roll from his vacant eye. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        I’m glad this happened to me and not you. 
                        No way you could’ve handled it. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m glad you can’t see. This place is a 
                        shithole. I’m coming back here for new 
                        titanium knees but now I’m worried-- 
                                 BIGGLES
                                (cutting him off)
                        You’re going back?

                                 CHRIS
                        The bad guys fled to Sadr City.  

                                 BIGGLES
                        Chris, you don’t have to--

                                 CHRIS
                        Yes I do. They’re going to pay for this.

           His mind made up. Biggles is stunned but understands. 

                                 BIGGLES
                        Hooyah, brother...

           EXT. HALLWAY, VETERANS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER 

           CHRIS passes room after room of wounded soldiers. His 
           eyes are fixed ahead, but emotion builds with each step--  

           INT. CHRIS’ HOUSE, SAN DIEGO - DUSK

           CHRIS kneels in front of his son, COLTON. His words are 
           packed with an emotion like he’ll never see him again.  

                                 CHRIS
                        --that’s who we are. We’re the sheepdog.
                                (taps his chin)
                        Look me in the eye. Always look a man in 
                        the eye.  

                                 TAYA (OC)
                        That’s enough, Chris--

           TAYA stands at the door, torn. The CAR PACKED outside.  

                                 CHRIS
                        You understand what I’m telling you? 

                                 COLTON
                        Can get a dog when we get back from 
                        Grandpas house?

           His innocence wounds Chris. He pulls the boy close. 

                                 TAYA
                        Let’s go Colton. 

           Colton drops a TOY SOLDIER in Chris’ hand and runs out.
                                 TAYA (CONT’D)
                        God, country, family-- isn’t that what 
                        you guys say? Let me know when that order 
                        changes. 

           Door closes behind her. Chris looks at the toy soldier. 

           INT. SURGERY - DAY

           A SPOTLIGHT SHINES on Chris’ knee, muscle peeled back, a 
           titanium cap is DRILLED IN PLACE. That buzzing sound-- 

                                                               CUT TO:

                        U.S. war planes dropped two 500-pound 
                        bombs on a house where al-Zarqawi was 
                        meeting with insurgent leadership.

                        While his killing is a triumph for 
                        coalition forces analysts warn that 
                        Zarqawi's death may not stem the tide of 
                        insurgency any more than Hussein's did-- 

           THE TV illuminates CHRIS sprawled across the bed. We are--

           INT. CHRIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Both knees sewn shut. Prescription bottle in one hand, 
           .45 in the other. Suddenly, the HOUSE ALARM goes off. 
           Chris bolts upright and is throttled by pain. 

                                 ALARM 
                        Intruder in the hall. Intruder in the 
                        hall--

           EXPLOSIONS BOOM on the news as Chris staggers out of bed, 
           leaning on the wall, gun leveled ahead--

           CHRIS POV

           A drugged haze. SHADOWS shift ahead. INTRUDER slips into--

           Chris bowls in, knocking dishes off counters, reacting--

                        Intruder in the living room. Intruder--

           SHADOWS DART through the living room. Chris pursues, 
           adrenaline pumping now, cornering into-- 

           HALLWAY

           Gaining control, pushing pain out, hunting--

                        Intruder in the hall. Intruder--

           He’s outside the bedroom, breathing it down, ready--

           COLTON’S BEDROOM

           Chris hits the lights as he corners in. Gun tracking to 
           his kid’s bed. But there’s no one there. He’s alone.  

                                 ALARM (CONT’D)
                        --in the bedroom. Intruder in the 
                        bedroom--

           He sinks to the floor, rocking back and forth, his face 
           twisted in agony. He’s the intruder...

           EXT. SOLANA BEACH

           A ghostly fog. Chris emerges from it, jogging with a 
           pained, lumbering gait-- pushing himself. 

           INT. BEDROOM, CHRIS’ HOUSE

           A duffle laid out. Bible and American Flag on top. He 
           considers them a beat, then opens the Bible at random-- 

           JOSHUA 6:21 - “And the Lord commanded him to destroy all 
           that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old 
           and ox and sheep and donkey with the blade of his sword.”

           His eyes darken with purpose. God has spoken. 
           INT. C-17 GLOBEMASTER -  DAY

           75 spirited Marines packed in. CHRIS hobbles up the isle 
           like Odysseus. His import draws the attention of soldiers 
           he passes. He settles into a seat. Across from him--

                                 MARINE LT.
                        You’re The Legend, right? I heard you 
                        killed 101 men last tour. The hajis call 
                        you The Devil of Ramadi. 

           Chris doesn’t respond. Nearby soldiers fall silent.

                                 MARINE CAPTAIN
                        How many kills you got now?

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                                (long beat)
                        You have to ask the Navy. I lost count. 

           His reserve silences the Marine. ENGINES ROAR as--

                                 “FOURTH TOUR”

           EXT. STREET, SADDR CITY - NIGHT

           Fires glow in bombed-out buildings like Jack-o’-lanterns. 
           An emaciated DOG stands by a flooded bomb-hole, barking 
           at the darkness. The water in front of him ripples with 
           vibration. Soon every dog in Sadr City is barking. 

           FOURTH FLOOR APARTMENT

           In shadow-- CHRIS KYLE, on the gun, face painted black; 
           he’s beyond wrath, and beyond reason. He is the shadow. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                                (keys mike)
                        Stryker 1-2 actual, in position. Over. 

           The RUMBLE of an unseen force makes the building quiver. 

           IN THE STREET

           Tanks rumble from the darkness, leading 18-wheelers 
           transporting cranes and 20-foot concrete T-blocks. 

           Without warning, ENEMY TRACERS arc across the sky, and 
           the entire city erupts in a firefight. 

           CHRIS SCOPE POV (N/V)
           IN GHOSTLY GREEN-- Insurgents move across the city 
           canvas. Chris drops body after body. Pause, pull, reload. 

           A MORTAR-SHELL EXPLODES across an 18-wheeler. The driver 
           leaps from his rig on fire. He gets peppered with 
           bullets, falls in a flooded-crater and continues to burn. 

           CROSS-HAIRS land on a nearby target. His features fill 
           frame. Glowing eyes staring at us when, LIGHT FLARES-- 

           SNIPER NEST

           THE SHATTERING BLAST of an RPG explodes across the space. 
           The room staged in fire. Chris scrambles to his feet--

           THWWWAP!-THWWWAP!

           GUNFIRE clips his helmet. A SECOND ROUND chunks into his 
           back-plate. He goes down, face-first.  

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           THE BLACK IS A BRUISE the size of a cantaloupe. We are-- 

           INT. MEDICS TENT

           The YOUNG MEDIC inspects the bruise on Chris’ back. 

                                 YOUNG MEDIC
                        I don’t know what to say other than you 
                        got real lucky.

                                 ASIAN (OC)
                        He’s not lucky, he’s The Legend. 

                                 CHRIS KYLE
                        What’s up Asian?

                                 ASIAN
                        Kicking sand and taking names, Chief. You 
                        know the drill.   

           Relieved to see someone he knows, Chris up and walks out. 

           EXT. FOB - DAY

           CHRIS and ASIAN walk past a boneyard of charred vehicles. 
           This base feels like a remote outpost.  
                                 ASIAN
                        We’ve been shot off our position three  
                        nights in a row. Fallujah was bad, Ramadi 
                        was worse but this shit is biblical. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Any other Punishers here?  

                                 ASIAN
                        Tony cycled out. Dauber was threatening 
                        but his wife knocked him up. 

           Chris laughs, nostalgic. 

                                 ASIAN (CONT’D)
                        Sucks about Biggles, huh? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah. I visited before I left. That 
                        fucker can’t see shit.

                        Dude...he’s gone. They were pulling 
                        another piece of frag out yesterday 
                        and... he died on the table.  

           Chris stares at him, ruined, waiting for him to take it 
           back. SFX: A PHONE RINGS thousands of miles away as--

           CHRIS SCOPE POV

           CROSS-HAIRS track along Jamila street, past cranes 
           assembling a T-wall that will stretch across the city.

           The phone stops ringing, VOICEMAIL picks up. 

                                 TAYA VOICEMAIL (VO)
                        - Hey, it’s is Taya, I can’t get to the 
                        phone, so please leave a message. 

           A car pulls into an intersection, ominous in inactivity.

                                 CHRIS MESSAGE (VO)
                        Hey, it’s me. Just calling to hear your 
                        voice. Everything is fine. I was just 
                        missing you guys. I been thinking about 
                        what you said. The order of things-- 

           The car drives on, disappearing down a side-street. CROSS-
           HAIRS linger at that spot, knowing the routine.
                                 CHRIS MESSAGE (VO)(CONT’D)
                        Anyway, tell the kids I love them--

           AN INSURGENT darts out, flips the sight-finder on an RPG.

                        I love you too. 

           SHOT RINGS OUT. Red mist. CROSS-HAIRS scan the sector, 
           they won’t leave an RPG. Finally, ANOTHER FIGURE runs out-

           A YOUNG KID 

           No older than Colton. He grabs the RPG, shoulders it, 
           takes aim. OUR CROSS-HAIRS zero on him, center-mass. SFX: 
           Chris’ heartbeat bangs like a 800lb hammer. Not again.

                                 CHRIS (OC)
                        Don’t do it--

           OUR CROSS-HAIRS tremor as Chris’ hands start to shake. 

                                 CHRIS (OC) (CONT’D)
                        --please God--

           Young Kid stands, suddenly, and turns toward us. He 
           discards the RPG in the street, and runs off.  

           CHRIS

           He rolls off the gun, gasping for air and biting back 
           ruinous tears as he watches his hands quiver. 

           After eight years of war he’s finally breaking down.  

           INT. OP TENT - DAY

           Wind whips the tent. A direct-action squad of 16 SPEC OPS 
           GUYS from different branches stand studying a map with-- 

                                 LT. MARTINS
                        Top brass believe this wall could put an  
                        end the war by forcing remaining AQI out 
                        of country. But we got some asshole who 
                        has picked off 4 contractors from an 
                        estimated 1500 meters out.

           CHRIS reacts, 1500 meters?

                                 CHRIS
                        You thinking it’s Mustafa?

                        He can be whoever you want him to be-- 
                        but to finish this wall I need him dead. 

           This intel burns across Chris face. Wind blows the tent 
           flap open--

                        Bring your goggles, Bambi. We need to 
                        shut this shooter down. 

           EXT. FORWARD OPERATING BASE

           A Stryker rumbles out, headed across the desert floor. 

           INT. STRYKER

           CHRIS sits up front, checking his weapon. An OLD MERCEDES 
           speeds across the desert toward them. A train of dust 
           plumes behind it. As the two vehicles pass-- (ECU) THE 
           MEN in the Mercedes wear keffiyehs over their faces. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What the--

           Chris whips around in his seat but he can’t look back. 

           EXT. GUARD POST - CONTINUOUS

           MARINE GATE GUARD studies the OLD MERCEDES speeding 
           toward him with mounting concern.

                                (into walkie)
                        This is east gate. I’ve got an unknown 
                        vehicle coming up fast. Black Mercedes--
           Guards roll out of their posts, guns up. Mercedes skids 
           to a sudden stop 30 meters out. Dust blooms from it. 

                                 GATE GUARD
                        Get out of the car! Now--

           INSIDE MERCEDES

           TWO IRAQI MEN eye the guards. THE DRIVER mutters 
           something to the passenger and pops the trunk-- 

           GUARD POST

           GUARDS lit with urgency, reacting as-- BOTH MEN STEP OUT 
           of the Mercedes, hands in air, circling toward the trunk.

                                 GATE GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Step away from the car!

                        --move for the trunk you will be shot. 

           THE TWO IRAQI MEN suddenly duck behind the open trunk. 
           After a painfully long moment, they reemerge with-- 

           A BODY BOUND in blood-smeared plastic. 

                                 GATE GUARD (OC)
                        Drop it! Right there! Drop him now--

           They drop the prisoner in the dirt. GUARDS CONTINUE 
           BARKING orders. THE DRIVER unwinds his scarf to reveal--

           THE TRIBAL LEADER who condemned Chris in Ramadi. 

                                 TRIBAL LEADER
                                (in Arabic)
                        Here is your Butcher of Ramadi. Take him. 
                        We will protect ourselves now.

           He expects a response. Guns stay on him. The wind howls. 

           CLOSE ON BUTCHER

           Bloody plastic suffocates his open mouth as he inhales. 

           EXT. SADR CITY - AERIAL SHOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Stryker speeds up a side-street into the belly of the 
           beast. One street over, PACKS OF INSURGENTS push the 
           opposite direction toward the construction site. 
           EXT. STREET, SADR CITY

           Stryker slows. Boots hit dirt, silently slipping into--

           EXT. BANANA FACTORY - DAY

           PUSH UPSIDE a five story building. Bombed-out walls 
           reveal conveyors and fruit lockers inside.  

           ROOFTOP

           RANGER SNIPER, concealed under a vent, watches INSURGENTS 
           in the street push toward the construction site.

                        The streets are crawling. Hold your fire. 

           Across the roof, ASIAN is on a .50 BMG looking at the 
           mile-wide SANDSTORM that’s pushing toward them. 

                                 ASIAN 
                        The sandman’s coming. 

           CHRIS

           3rd floor. In a fruit locker. His breath is racing, his 
           hands tremor and he hasn’t put his eye to glass yet. 

           He can’t expel the electricity coursing through him.  

           T-WALL (TWO BLOCKS DOWN)

           CRANE lowers a T-block. MARINE ENGINEERS guide it in.

           ENEMY CROSS-HAIRS ENTER FRAME

           MARINE ENGINEERS signal success and ANOTHER ENGINEER 
           starts to scurry up the neck of the crane to release the 
           chain. The cross-hairs track ahead of MOVING ENGINEER.

           BOOM! A shot echoes across the landscape and TOPPLES THE 
           ENGINEER from the crane. He lands dead in the street. 

           CHRIS

           THE BOOM echoes. Chris looks behind him. Suddenly alert--

                                 CHRIS
                        No--

                        It came from behind us. We went six deep 
                        the wrong way. He’s outside the wall.

                        uglies right below us--

           Chris puts his eye to glass, sweating bullets, aiming 
           back PAST THE CONSTRUCTION CREW toward Bagdad--  

           CHRIS SCOPE POV

           CROSS-HAIRS track across rooftops. Scope full-dope. 
           Everything wobbles, fumes and jitters. But, almost by 
           accident, he lands on an impossibly small shape-- 

           A person? A bag of trash? Or nothing at all. 

                                 ASIAN (OS)
                        If he’s shooting from the east we’d be 
                        500 meters further--

                        I got something. 1900 meters out.

                        Too far Chris. That’s an impossible shot.

                        You can’t even see 1900 meters out. Hold 
                        your fire man. You’ll expose us all.

                                 CHRIS 
                        It’s him.

           He’s blinded by vengeance, flying directly into the sun.

           Both eyes open, a prayer whispers across his lips.

           CLOSE ON LANKY SNIPER/CLOSE ON CHRIS

           SFX: Thump-thump....Thump-BAM!

           Chris fires first. The shot echoes across eternity. One, 
           two, three seconds later. A red-mist paints the wind.

           Lanky Sniper tumbles off his platform, and out of view.

           INSURGENTS point up at the building, yelling, rushing in--

           Silence washes over him, an awareness of what he’s done.

           INSURGENTS clear the second floor, bounding toward--  

           ROOFTOP

           They survey ammo and set-up firing stations. Chris is 
           shaken but his training is ingrained:

                        There are only two way on the roof, we

                                 CHRIS
                                (tears)
                        I’m ready to come home. I’m ready...

           She starts crying. The F-18 almost upon them.

                                 TAYA
                        What’s happening?

                                 CHRIS
                        I love you. I’m coming home. 

                                 TAYA
                        Chris--?

           The F-18 just seconds out. Chris looks up and sees--

           THE SANDSTORM 

           Has shifted and is pushing up the block. A four-story 
           tsunami of dirt is about to swallow them. 

           F-18 RAPTOR

           Flying into the mouth of the storm. Sensors screaming. 
           5, 4, 3, 2... He pulls up a second early. 

           ROOFTOP

           The HELLFIRE MISSILES scream over the Banana factory and  
           EXPLODE INTO the next building. They’re enveloped in fire 
           and dirt. The blast recedes but the storm engulfs them. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Go, go, lets move--

           Chris leads Asian, Ranger One and Marines across the 
           roof. They cling to each other to keep from being blown 
           off. INSURGENTS stumble past, invisible two feet away. 
           STREET BELOW

           They stagger blindly into HOWLING CHAOS, holding each 
           other, huddled behind Chris. GUNFIRE POPS behind them.

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                                (choking, into mike)
                        Stryker-3, what’s your location--

           AN INSURGENT stumbles into them. ASIAN wrestles his gun 
           away and beats him with it. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        Hold your position. 30 seconds out--
                                (pointing ahead)
                        Let’s go. Straight ahead. Go--

           They’re running for their lives. Unable to see two feet 
           ahead. Chris is struggling. His knees failing him. 

           They’re ahead of him. He can’t keep up.  

           INT. STRYKER

           THE GUNNER stares at REMOTE WEAPONS SYSTEMS SCREEN when 
           four figures emerge from the dust. He’s about to fire--

                                 RANGER ONE
                        BDUs. That’s them! Drop the ramp.

           The ramp drops. STORM HOWLING. RANGER-ONE dives in. 
           MARINE GUNNERS follow, then ASIAN. The rig pulls off.  

                                 ASIAN
                        Where’s Chris? He was just--

           IN THE STREET

           Chris falters forward. INSURGENTS pursuing. The Stryker 
           takes shape ahead but it’s pulling away. 

           IN THE STRYKER

           The M2 GUNNER doesn’t see him on his monitor. 

                                 ASIAN (CONT’D)
                        --stop the rig! Stop--

           IN THE STREET

           Bullets sing past. Chris is five feet off, sprinting. He 
           sheds his flack-jacket, Bible and flag. The rig just out 
           of reach, he drops his gun in the dirt and dives--
           His outstretched hand clutches the last rung of slat-
           armor and Chris Kyle is dragged off the battlefield. 

           THE SANDSTORM

           Sweeps us up into otherworldly beige. We catch glimpses 
           of the city below: the wall, the desert floor, the lanky 
           body of the lanky sniper sprawled across a rooftop. 

           Wind rips the Hefty bag from his torso and sand pocks the 
           DEAD FACE OF MUSTAFA before we’re swept off again.

                                                            LONG FADE:

           EXT. TARMAC, AIR BASE, CORONADO - DAY

           CHRIS, grizzled in jeans and t-shirt, hobbles toward the 
           area where men kiss their wives and hug their kids; heat 
           shimmers off tarmac and gives the appearance of a mirage.  

                                 PO2 KELLY
                        Chief Kyle. We’re here to take you home. 

           Chris looks up at prim PETTY OFFICER KELLY.

           INT. SEDAN - AFTERNOON

           The world blurs outside tinted windows. The rhythmic 
           sound of wheels on the road fills silence. 

                                 PO2 KELLY
                        Two silver stars. Must be quite an honor.
                                (no response)
                        The Navy would love to keep you. I’m sure 
                        we can find you a cushy desk job. 

           Chris eyes telephone wires looping along the roadside.

           EXT. FORD DEALERSHIP - EVENING

           PETTY OFFICERS stand with A CAR DEALER watching CHRIS 
           roar out in a big black FORD F350. 

                                 PO2 KELLY (OC)
                        Guess he’s not interested in a desk job.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A grubby room. Beer cans litter the corner. Chris sits on 
           the bed in boxers, in a stupor, on the phone: 
                                 CHRIS
                                (into phone)
                        I got hung up-- some logistical stuff.  
                        It’s uh-- I’ll get up there tomorrow. 

                                 TAYA (OS)
                        The kids were expecting you--

                                 CHRIS
                                (breaks down)
                        I miss you guys so much...

                                 TAYA (OS)
                        You’re an hour away. Are you drunk?

                                 CHRIS
                        --I don’t know. 

                                 TAYA (OS)
                        What does that mean?

                                 CHRIS
                                (drifting)
                        --maybe we could move back to Texas and 
                        start over--

                                 TAYA
                        Come home, Chris. Just come home. 

           He nods into silence. The room darkens. 

           INT. MOTEL - LATER

           Flashing neon burns through gauzy curtains. Chris is 
           asleep when-- A BUZZING SOUND wakes him. He sits up, feet 
           hit floor, the sound emanates from inside the wall. 

           He runs a hand along the wall, and tilts an ear. It 
           sounds like SOMEONE’S DRILLING into the wall. The sound 
           louder. The wall vibrating under the pressure, when--

           A DRILL BIT comes through the wall and pierces his hand. 
           He tries to pull away but a second drill-bit pierces his 
           other hand. He screams, strung up on the wall. Suddenly--

           The hallucination disappears. He’s holding himself to the 
           wall. He slowly sinks to the floor, sobbing. 

                                                              FADE TO:
           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           TWO CHILDREN on swings, rising and falling against the 
           sun. Rusty hinges creaking. The family dog, A PYRENEES 
           SHEEPDOG, bounds around them barking. 

                                 TAYA (OC)
                        I always believed you’d be a better 
                        father than you were a soldier. 

                                 CHRIS (OC)
                        I will be. 

           TAYA AND CHRIS, on the back-steps:  

                                 TAYA
                        I wanted them to know you. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Taya-- 

                                 TAYA
                        The ‘you’ before all this. 

           That rocks him. He head falls. When he looks up again-- 

           COLTON’S BIRTHDAY PARTY

           Has taken shape around him. Streamers and balloons 
           against a grey sky. 6 YEAR OLDS and PARENTS mill around. 

                                 TAYA (VO) (CONT’D)
                        You pushed us out to make room for all 
                        that darkness-- 

           COLTON AND TWO FRIENDS chase each other around the yard.

                                 TAYA (VO) (CONT’D)
                        --but you need to find a way to let the 
                        light back in. 

           THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON’S FRIEND. He 
           goes down hard and gets up crying, running from the dog. 

                                 TAYA (VO) (CONT’D)
                        You have to fight for us.

           The dog bounds after him, thinks it’s a game and jumps on 
           his back again. THE BOY FALLS, HIS CRYING is all we hear--

           THE BOY’S MOM runs over. His back clawed up and bleeding. 
           She fends off the dog, shielding her son when--
                                 BOY’S MOM
                        Get him off--

           Chris yanks the dog off by its collar. He drags it across 
           the yard in a discomforting show of violence. 

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Chris holds the dog down, eye to eye, scolding it when--
           the DOG SNAPS at him. Chris rips his .45 from his belt-
           clip, a foot on the dog’s neck, ready to shoot--

                                 TAYA (OC)
                        No! Chris. Don’t-- 

           He looks up, bent on animus--

                                 TAYA (OC) (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you? He’s just a puppy. 

           Chris, suddenly riddled with remorse, releases the dog. 
           He watches it hurry to Taya’s side. Her protector. 

                                                              FADE TO:

           HEADLIGHTS burn through the darkness. Swerving across the 
           road in a residential neighborhood. We are--

           INT. FORD F-350

           Chris is careening down a residential street. The road 
           swims before him. His hand loses the wheel and-- 

           The truck ramps over a curb, splinters a picket-fence and 
           CRASHES INTO the breakfast room of a home. Glass and 
           drywall rain down. The airbag throttles Chris-- WHOOMPH! 

           Chris tumbles out of the rig, nose bleeding, concussed. 
           He’s standing in a kitchen so he staggers to the fridge. 

           ANOTHER ANGLE - APPROACHING POV

           Chris sits at the dinner table, opens a beer bottle with 
           his teeth and takes a slug. 

                                 HOMEOWNER (OC)
                        - What the fuck are you doing?

           A SHOTGUN BARREL extends into frame. 
           INT. MINIVAN (PARKED) - NIGHT

           CHRIS sits shotgun. POLICE LIGHTS whirl across the 
           windshield as he stares at the house he drove into-- his 
           face pinches with emotion and he breaks down sobbing. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I could’ve killed them...

           PULL BACK to see Taya sitting behind the wheel. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I could’ve killed them all...

           She doesn’t understand but she sees him shedding his skin 
           so she reaches for him, and holds him. She protects him. 

                                                            LONG FADE:

           INT. VETERAN’S HOSPITAL

           Harsh light. Water-stained walls. CHRIS looks beaten and 
           afraid-- and dubious of this buttoned-down NAVY DOCTOR. 

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Are you taking anything for your anxiety? 

           Chris shakes his head. 

                                 NAVY DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        My guess would be you saw things, or 
                        maybe you did some things, you wish you 
                        hadn’t. Some soldiers can cope with that 
                        and some can’t. We--

                                 CHRIS
                                (low)
                        That’s not me.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        What’s not you?

                                 CHRIS
                        That. That’s not it. When I aim... 
                                (breath fills his lungs)
                        When I’m on you...the world falls away 
                        and my heart-rate drops. I’m more relaxed 
                        killing you than I am talking to you.  

           Navy Doctor remains silent. 
                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I laid to rest some evil men and I will 
                        stand before my creator and answer for 
                        every shot I took. That’s not what haunts 
                        me. It’s the guys I couldn’t save.
                                (flush with shame)
                        Those are the faces I see. That’s my 
                        regret-- that I couldn’t hold on longer, 
                        that I couldn’t do more.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        When we go to war there are always two 
                        wars we fight. The one over there, then 
                        one at home. And this one, we never win. 
                        You want to save some people, just walk 
                        down any hall in this hospital. We have 
                        plenty soldiers that need saving. 
                                (pulls prescription pad)
                        I’m going to recommend Zoloft and-- 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           CHRIS exits the office, wheels turning. He tosses the 
           PRESCRIPTION in the trash and heads down the hall to-- 

           EXT./INT. REC ROOM

           A window looks in on TEN YOUNG VETERANS sitting around a 
           TV. They stare blankly at it; wounded, on edge, in need. 

           Chris enters the room and takes a seat among them. 

           INSIDE 

           Chris watches TV with them, Jerry Springer.  

                                 CHRIS
                        Whose in charge of the remote up in here?

           A large, legless Marine looks up. He has a jelly-roll 
           face like Biggles once did. This is “WYNN”.

                                 WYNN
                        I am. You got a problem? 

                                 CHRIS
                        I got lots of problems, man. But Jerry 
                        Springer is right up there.

                                 WYNN
                        Then you haven’t been here long. 
           MORE VETS look over. 

                                 CHRIS
                        This all y’all do? Sit around and watch 
                        this garbage.

                                 WYNN
                        Pretty much. 

                                 CHRIS
                                (looks him over)
                        You a shooter?

                                 WYNN
                        I was. How’d you know? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Your shoulders. They’re fuckin lopsided. 
                        Nobody told you your shit is lopsided?

           Chris mimics how one shoulder is higher than the other, 
           poking fun. Wynn laughs and sun flares through window--

                                                             MATCH TO:

           A circle of light surrounds the EYE OF WYNN. We are--

           EXT. SHOOTING RANGE, UNIDENTIFIABLE LOCALE - DAY

           CHRIS kneels before WYNN who is armed with a 300 Win-Mag. 
           The gun rests on Chris shoulder. Wynn takes aim, FIRES--

                                 CHRIS 
                        - How’s it feel?  

                                 WYNN
                        Feels like The Legend is trying to fuck 
                        up my shot. Stay still, man. 

           ON CHRIS

           His eyes calm, like he’s finally found some peace. BAM! 

                                 WYNN (CONT’D)
                        Bulls-eye, bitches. 

           Chris laughs, stands, dusts himself off. Uprange, JEFF 
           KYLE is helping SEVERAL MORE GUYS from the hospital. 

                                 WYNN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you got a family? Why are you doing 
                        spending all this time with us?  
                                 CHRIS
                        I heard you had a nice shoe collection 
                        before the war and I was thinking, since 
                        you won’t be needing them, maybe-- 

                                 WYNN
                                (howls with laughter)
                        Dumbass. Really. Tell me why you do it.  

           Chris grows still, looking into the sun.

                                 CHRIS 
                                (nods)
                        We gotta take care of our own. 

           INT. POOL (UNDERWATER)

           CHRIS SWIMS through aqua blue water looking up at INJURED 
           VETERANS splashing around with A DOZEN PATRIOTIC SORORITY 
           GIRLS. Sunlight bounces across the surface of the water 
           and reflects down on him. A glorious vision. 

                                                              FADE TO:

           A MOVING TRUCK passes a road-sign: “WELCOME TO TEXAS” 

           EXT. KYLE HOME - MIDLOTHIAN, TEXAS - DAY

           A residential neighborhood. Flags wave from stoops. CHRIS 
           and COLTON carry boxes inside. “MAX THE SHEEPDOG” bounds 
           along with them and never leaves Chris’ side.  

                                 COLTON
                        And you’ll wake up here, then go to work, 
                        then come home again? Every night?

                                 CHRIS
                        Every night, bubba. And I’ll teach you to 
                        hunt and fish like my daddy taught me. 

           Taya stands in the window, watching the gentle way Chris 
           has with him; her boy finally has a father.  

                                 COLTON
                        Dad? Fish are kinda gross.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeah. I never liked fishing much. 

           Chris looks over the gentle sloping hills, finally home. 
           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A bright church. Chris wears that BELT BUCKLE he won long 
           ago. Taya sings from a hymn book. Chris stares at her.  

                                 TAYA
                                (hushed)
                        What’re you looking at?

                                 CHRIS
                        I’s just imagining what you’ll look like 
                        when we’re old and grey. 

                                 TAYA
                        Do I hold up alright?

                                 CHRIS
                                (whispers)
                        I’ll still do you. 

           That boyish playfulness is back. She takes his hand.  

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chris and Taya make love. He worships her with his touch.   

           EXT. FIELD - DAWN

           A tapestry of fading stars hang over a prairie as the 
           first rays of rising light paint the land golden. 

           A WHITE-TAIL steps out of the brush. It looks toward us--

           A SHOT RINGS OUT 

           REVERSE TO COLTON on the gun. He leaps from a deer-blind. 

                                 COLTON
                        I got it, dad. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You sure did. 

           Chris steps out, proud and apprehensive in equal measure.  

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been given a gift. But this one 
                        comes with a responsibility. When you 
                        pull the trigger-- make sure your heart 
                        is pure and you’re standing in the light.  
           Colton nods, tough and intent. Chris drapes an arm over 
           his young shoulders and the SCORE BUILDS.

           CHYRON: FEBRUARY 2, 2013

           INT. KYLE HOUSE - DAY

           The blinds are screwed open and dust motes drift across 
           horizontal blades of sepia light-- falling on Chris. He’s 
           twirls an antique six-gun around his finger and--

                                 CHRIS 
                        Get ‘em up, lil’ lady. Hands in the air. 

           TAYA is at the window gazing at their kids in the yard. 

                                 TAYA
                        Can I tell you something.

                                 CHRIS
                        Tell it to the judge. 

                                 TAYA
                        I’m proud of you and I don’t say it 
                        enough. But I feel blessed. You’re an 
                        incredible father and-- I just feel so 
                        lucky to have my husband back. 

                                 CHRIS
                        We could lock the doors. They can’t get 
                        out of the yard. 

                                 TAYA
                        I know how hard you fought to get here. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You’re worth fighting for. 

           She moves through the light. He kisses her, lifting her-- 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        I meant what I said about locking the 
                        doors. 

                                 TAYA
                        Aren’t you guys going to the range? 

                                 CHRIS
                        Not for four minutes. 

                                 TAYA
                        Is that all it takes. 
                                 CHRIS
                        It’ll take half that. Then I got two 
                        minutes leftover just to look at you. 

           The front door opens and a BURLY NEIGHBOR with a wide 
           smile enters. This is CHAD LITTLEFIELD. 

                                 CHAD LITTLEFIELD
                        Six-guns and sex standing up, just 
                        another day living next to The Legend. 

                                 TAYA
                        Hey, Chad. 

                                 CHAD LITTLEFIELD
                        Whas up, girl.

                                 CHRIS
                        You don’t knock? 

                                 CHAD LITTLEFIELD
                        Would you answer if I did?

                                 CHRIS
                        I’m a busy man. 

                                 CHAD LITTLEFIELD
                        I see that. 
                                (opens fridge)
                        Who’s this kid we’re taking out? 

                                 CHRIS
                                (eyes on Taya)
                        A former Marine. His mom works at our 
                        school. She thought it might help. 

           COLTON and McKENNA race in.  

                                 COLTON
                        Dad, you want to play Skylander? Please--

                                 CHRIS
                        When I get back, Bubba. But only if you 
                        let me win. 

                                 COLTON
                        No way.

                                 MCKENNA
                        Poke the bear-- 

           McKENNA pokes Chris and he BARKS like a dog.
                                 MCKENNA (CONT’D)
                        No. You’re supposed to roar. Like Grrr.

           She pokes him again and Chris emits a RUMBLING ROAR. She 
           giggles and hugs him so he’ll save her. 

                                 CHAD LITTLETON
                        Better get going...

           Chris kisses his daughter and tosses his son’s hair. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Look after our women, Bubba. 
                                (turns to Taya)
                        Love you, little lady. 

           Chris kisses Taya and lingers, smiling like a schoolboy; 
           his eyes worship her just like he promised. And, for a 
           moment, he appears immortal in the bladed light. 

           Then-- HIS IMAGE DISSOLVES in front of her, fading like a 
           memory into thin air. Chad is gone too. The house quiet--   

           Colton plays video games. McKenna colors. Max lays by the 
           door. Taya screws the blinds closed, bringing darkness. 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           The black F-350 roars down two-lane blacktop. It splits 
           the horizon and disappears over the distant ridge. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           CARD(1): “Chris Kyle retired in 2009 as the most lethal 
           sniper in United States military history.”

           SFX: A GUNSHOT SOUNDS and echoes across oblivion. 

           CARD(2): “On February 2, 2013, Chris was killed on a 
           shooting range by a Marine he was trying to help. He died 
           as he lived, trying to look after one of his own.”

           EXT. HIGHWAY

           A funeral procession appears from over the distant ridge. 
           Rain falls as the well-worn voice of Randy Travis sings 
           Amazing Grace. Police escorts lead a white hearse and 300 
           vehicles down a highway lined with people waving flags. 
                                 TAYA KYLE (VO)
                                (actual eulogy audio)
                        ....Chris, there isn’t enough time to 
                        tell you everything you mean to me and 
                        everything you taught me. I know you had 
                        no idea you were teaching me, but there 
                        is something only God and I have known 
                        for a long time-- God worked through you 
                        to make me into the woman I am supposed 
                        to be. I almost feel sorry for you, babe, 
                        cause God knew it would take the 
                        toughest, big-hearted man on earth to get 
                        a hard-headed and cynical, hard-loving 
                        woman like me to see what God needed me 
                        to see-- and he chose you for the job. He 
                        chose well. You taught me reckless love 
                        without abandon. You taught me how to 
                        turn a life full of fear into a life full 
                        of faith. You taught me that I could be 
                        more independent than I ever wanted to 
                        be. You taught me how to raise children 
                        with love and softness and proved it 
                        could be done with a high standard of 
                        respect and old fashioned values. You 
                        taught me that I could forgive more 
                        deeply than I ever thought I could. You 
                        taught me that I was able to hold my 
                        tongue in anger. By the way I’m sorry 
                        that took so long. You taught me that 
                        even as a Yankee I could learn to have a 
                        conversation with my slow-talking Texas 
                        man without interrupting. I swear, I 
                        never thought that was possible. 
                                (a feint “Taps” plays)
                        You taught me that I’m okay just the way 
                        I am and that, no matter what life lays 
                        in front of you, it is unwise to worry or 
                        over-think it because even in the worst 
                        of times life has a way of working out. 
                        You showed me that in life, even in 
                        death, some people are always with you. 
                        I love you Chris... 
                                (weeping, whispering)
                        I love you. I love you.  

           The last car passes. TAPS concludes. A MAN stands alone 
           in a muddy field saluting a fallen hero.   

                                 SEAL TEAM THREE (VO)
                                (loud, in unison)
                        Hooyah, Chris Kyle. 

                                                               THE END
