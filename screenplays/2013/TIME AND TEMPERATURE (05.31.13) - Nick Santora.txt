           EXT. VERY MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBAN CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

           CAMERA just a foot above street level, PUSHES IN SLOWLY down 
           this quiet, sleepy, humble bedroom community. 

           8-year-old family sedans. Toppled Big Wheels on front lawns. 
           A basketball rests under a garage-mounted hoop. A few street 
           lights dot the sidewalk, the only illumination besides the 
           moon. As the camera moves in on a SMALL CAPE resting at the 
           center-end of the street, CHYRONS stagger:

           FRESNO, CALIFORNIA 

           OCTOBER 3, 1989

           4:29 A.M.

           INT. SMALL CAPE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           A sleeping DALE JULIN (44) and wife PATTI (40). The night-
           stand CLOCK reads 4:29, like the Chyron below it, until... 
           the Chyron and the clock FLIP simultaneously to 4:30 A.M.

           ENH! ENH! ENH! The alarm clock blares. Dale doesn’t move. At 
           the 8th “ENH”, Patti, half asleep, reaches over Dale, hits 
           the alarm silent, collapses into her pillow.

                                 PATTI
                        Dale... you have to get up.

                                 DALE
                             (asleep)
                        Mmmmphf... I’m Aquaman.

                                 PATTI
                             (eyes still closed)
                        You’re sleeping -- get up.

           She slowly extends her legs, gradually pushing sleeping Dale 
           until he falls from the bed onto the floor - THUD.

           LOW ANGLE - across the width of the bed - a groggy DALE 
           raises his head INTO FRAME, half asleep, serious bed head...

                                 DALE
                        I’m awake.

           Dale is our hero... he just doesn’t know it yet.

           INT. SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale, palms against the wall, head down, lets water beat on 
           him. Hanging from the shower head, his “SHOWER BUDDY” 
           CLOCK/RADIO reads 4:38. 
           Roxette’s YOU’VE GOT THE LOOK plays. Remember, this is 1989 - 
           this is the crap they played. Dale’s motionless until the 
           brutally annoying chorus: “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah... Nah, 
           nah, nah, nah...” Nails on a blackboard. 

           Without lifting his head, Dale slams his palm into the radio 
           repeatedly until its casing hangs by a wire... but at least 
           the song stopped. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           TIGHT ON WALL CLOCK - 4:47. PAN DOWN to COFFEE MAKER. A hand 
           reaches into frame, lifts the mug to Dale’s face. He looks 
           straight ahead, almost to camera, takes a sip, bites a bagel. 
           This is his routine - every day.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale brushes his teeth, spits, looks at himself in the 
           mirror. He smiles. It’s a nice smile. Warm. Genuine.

                                 DALE
                        Good Morning Fresno.
                             (tries it again)
                        Good Morning Fresno.
                             (once more with feeling)
                        Good Morning Fresno. 

           Then, just like that, the smile is gone. OFF Dale, looking at 
           his reflection, contemplating himself, his station in life...

           INT. CHILD’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale leans in, takes the hand of sleeping 20 month old ROSIE 
           (her hand sticks thru the crib slates) and kisses it.

                                 DALE
                        Bye bye sweetheart.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ON a WRISTWATCH on Dale’s night stand - 5:01. Dale, now in a 
           suit, puts the watch on. He leans in, kisses Patti’s forehead.

                                 DALE
                             (really means it)
                        I love you.

           Patti snorts a snore-grunt. Dale doesn’t mind. He pulls down 
           her covers to REVEAL Patti’s PREGNANT BELLY. He kisses it.
                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                             (whispers to belly)
                        I love you too.

           His eyes and tone give it all away - Dale is a good man.

           EXT/INT. DALE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale gets in his ‘81 Nissan (with SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS bumper 
           sticker). The car sputters to life. Clock reads: 5:03. 

           He spins the radio dial. DON’T WORRY BE HAPPY by Bobby 
           McFarin. Then, NAUGHTY GIRLS NEED LOVE TOO by Samantha Fox. 
           He lands on SWEET CHILD OF MINE by Guns ‘N Roses.

           The car backs out of the driveway but then STOPS. Dale 
           fiddles with the radio again until NAUGHTY GIRLS NEED LOVE 
           TOO comes back on. Fuck it, he’s alone. So, as he drives...

                                 DALE
                        Then along came you. Now I know it’s 
                        true... Naughty girls need love too.

           SOURCE MUSIC becomes SOUND TRACK as Dale drives through...

           EXT. STREETS OF FRESNO - EARLY MORNING, STILL DARK

           CREDITS ROLL as Dale’s commute establishes FRESNO. He passes 
           CALIFORNIA DMV - FRESNO BRANCH OFFICE; FRESNO SAVINGS & LOAN 
           (their “TIME TO SAVE” clock reads 5:17 A.M.); etc.

           He rolls to a FOUR-WAY STOP SIGN INTERSECTION. Red light. No 
           other cars anywhere. Catty-corner to Dale is a patrol car. 
           COP drinks coffee, reads his paper. Dale watches him, 
           waiting, as he rolls through the sign...

                                 DALE
                        C’mon big fella, I’m rollin’ right 
                        through...

           Cop happens to look up, makes eye contact with Dale.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Gotcha.

           Dale hits the gas, speeds off, looks in his rear-view...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Come ‘n get me, copper. 

           But nothing happens. Amazingly, Dale’s disappointed.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Knew it... jerk.
           LOW LONG ANGLE on the ROAD as Dale’s car APPROACHES CAMERA. 
           The car passes OVER CAMERA, it’s momentum PULLS US TO BLACK. 

           SUPRA: TIME & TEMPERATURE. (OVER SUPRA we PRE-LAP...)

                                 DALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s 6:00 A.M., 52 degrees in the 
                        beautiful Central Valley and once 
                        again I have the pleasure of being the 
                        first to tell you...

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - MORNING

           TIGHT ON Dale. BRIGHT. SHINY. SMILEY. All TV-Host-ish. 

                                 DALE
                        ...Good Morning, Fresno. And thanks 
                        for tuning in to The Sunshine Show on 
                        KSEE. Now let’s K-See who we’ll be 
                        getting to know this morning.

           Dale stands, walks to a SIDE STAGE where CYNDI WEINSTOCK (11, 
           Girl Scout) stands in uniform. Behind her is a massive 6’ 
           high MAZE, made completely of GIRL SCOUT COOKIE BOXES.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. Look at this thing. What’s your 
                        name and how did you build this?

                                 CYNDI
                             (giggling)
                        Cyndi Weinstock. And I didn’t build it.

                                 DALE
                        But you sold this many boxes of 
                        cookies, didn’t you? In fact, it’s my 
                        understanding that you sold more 
                        cookies than any other girl scout in 
                        the Central Valley. 
                             (takes in the maze)
                        There must be, what, almost twenty 
                        boxes here?

           Cyndi laughs again - Dale is great with her.

                                 CYNDI
                        Three thousand four hundred nineteen 
                        boxes.

                                 DALE
                        What?! Nine thousand, three hundred 
                        fourteen boxes! That’s crazy!

           ROY (mid 30’s, stoner cameraman) snorts a laugh from behind 
           the camera. Cyndi laughs some more. 
                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Well, I don’t care how many you sold, 
                        Ms. Braggy-Pants. I’m the Central 
                        Valley Maze Master four years running. 
                        So I bet I can get through this maze 
                        in less than thirty seconds or KSEE 
                        will donate one hundred dollars to 
                        your troop. We got a deal? 

           They shake on it. Dale looks up to the control booth.  

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Producer Scott ... Maze Music please.

           In the CONTROL BOOTH PRODUCER SCOTT (50, bald) flips on 
           FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE and Dale races into the maze. 

           OVERHEAD SHOT: Dale fumbles his way through the maze. He is 
           intentionally “overly-lost”...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        No, it’s not this way... wait a 
                        minute, this looks familiar... Cyndi?! 
                        Should I turn left at the Thin 
                        Mints?... Cyndi, I’m scared!

                                 PRODUCER SCOTT (OVER SPEAKER)
                        Ten seconds, Dale.

                                 DALE
                        Don’t pressure me! 

           Dale looks around - “worried”...

                                 PRODUCER SCOTT (OVER SPEAKER) 
                        Five seconds.

           Dale races out of the maze, THROUGH THE FRONT WALL...

                                 DALE
                        Aaaaagh!

           ... and lands on the floor with a thud, surrounded/covered by 
           cookie boxes. He looks up to Cyndi, out of breath ... 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Cyndi... the check’s in the mail. 
                             (to Camera)
                        We’re going to take a quick break.
                        For The Sunshine Show, I’m Dale Julin,

           He points the mic up toward Cyndi who’s excited to say...

                                 CYNDI
                        ..and I’m Cyndi Weinstock...

                                 DALE
                        ...and she’s one smart cookie.
                                 PRODUCER SCOTT (OVER SPEAKER)
                        And we’re out. Great job Dale.

           Everyone’s happy with a segment well-done, but as Dale dusts 
           himself off, you see less enthusiasm from him.

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - MORNING - LATER

           Roy grabs two donuts from a SNACK TABLE while WAYNE MASON 
           (40’s, Affiliate Manager, former New Yorker, no tact, not 
           really an asshole but it’s hard to tell) addresses the troops 
           which include Dale and...

           - STEPHANIE BIEL (30’s, hot weather girl)

           - JAY TUCKER  (30’s, black, sports)

                        worse.

           Dale waves off Roy’s silent offer of a donut, anxious, to 
           hear the results. Wayne reads from a report...

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Stephanie - Weather came in with an 
                        82% approval rating with viewers...

           Stephanie smiles. Ad lib claps/congrats from the others as 
           Roy slyly sneaks a peek of her cleavage.

                        “healthy hair”, “healthy skin”, that 
                        kinda crap.

                        the chopper blades. You know that 
                        Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh. Makes them 
                        nervous. So let’s lose that.

                                 BURT
                        It’s what keeps me in the air.

                                 WAYNE
                             (not paying attention, 
                              flipping through report)
                        You’ll figure it out ... ok, let’s see 
                        what else...

           ON Dale, waiting, hopeful for some positive feedback...

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Guess that’s it. Good work team. Best 
                        morning show on TV. 

           And Wayne is gone. OFF Dale, dejected.

           INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wayne stands at his desk, eating while working. Dale enters.

                                 DALE
                        Wayne, got a sec?

           Wayne waves him in, doesn’t look up from his work. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        So, I, uh, I was wondering what the 
                        test audiences had to say about me.
           Wayne looks up, mouth full of greasy breakfast sandwich.

                                 WAYNE
                             (muffled)
                        About you? Well... ya know... slow and 
                        steady, nice and consistent.

           Wayne dives back into work. Awkward beat, then...

                                 DALE
                        So, I’ve been working on this story...

           Wayne freezes mid-bite, knows another “Dale pitch” is coming.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        African Americans drivers are pulled 
                        over by Fresno police at a rate three 
                        times higher than whites. I’ve pulled 
                        stats from the DOT that back this up 
                        and I’ve been doing my own experiment -
                        - going through stop signs when I know 
                        a cop is watching -- 

                                 WAYNE
                        --Stop. Just stop.

           Wayne puts his sandwich down. Sits, rubs his eyes.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        We’ve had this talk. Just this past 
                        Spring. You’re a show host - someone 
                        to transition viewers from segment to 
                        segment and tease the evening news 
                        stories. And sometimes you get to 
                        interview little leaguers or hundred 
                        year old firemen or some other happy 
                        horse shit. ‘Cause you’re a host. Not 
                        a reporter.

                                 DALE
                        I am a reporter.

                                 WAYNE
                        Reporters don’t run through cookie 
                        forts. Ya wanna know why I didn’t 
                        bring up your viewer responses in 
                        front of everyone? Because of all the 
                        hosts of all the morning shows of all 
                        the nations’ affiliates, you were the 
                        least memorable. 70% of the test 
                        audience didn’t remember you when we 
                        showed them your photograph an hour 
                        after watching the reel.

           Dale registers this information - it hurts. 
                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Wanna know why you still have a job 
                        here? Because I think that’s a good 
                        stat. It’s your job to present 
                        whatever fluff we’re doing that day in 
                        a way that the audience enjoys. They 
                        remember the show, Dale, they just 
                        don’t remember you. 
                             (Wayne’s softness disappears)
                        And who cares? Fat housewives with one 
                        eye on the TV and the other on the 
                        toaster, waitin’ for their kids’ Pop 
                        Tarts. Fuck ‘em if they can’t remember 
                        you. Probably can’t remember the last 
                        time they saw their feet. 

           And Wayne’s back to work. Beat, then Dale walks out. But he 
           stops at the door and turns back.

                                 DALE
                        They’d remember me if I were Anchor.

                                 WAYNE
                             (mouth full)
                        Excuse me? 

                                 DALE
                        The new anchor position - nights, 
                        weekends. Audience would see me all the 
                        time, not just a voice in the 
                        background when they’re getting ready 
                        for work. Think I should be considered. 

           Wayne considers this then, acquiesces...

                                 WAYNE
                        Wanna throw your hat in the ring? Fine 
                        by me.

           Dale smiles, nods, and exits enthused and energized.

           EXT. STUDIO PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale hurries out to his car, pep in his step. Roy’s in his 
           VAN, rolls down his window, some pot smoke filters out. 

                                 ROY
                        Hey bro - what he say about the Blacks 
                        Are Bad Drivers story?

                                 DALE
                        Doesn’t want it ... and you really 
                        missed the point of that piece.

                                 ROY
                        Yeah... probably... well, it’s 4:20 
                        somewhere, know what I mean...
                                 DALE
                        No it isn’t.

                                 ROY
                        Well, yeah... with time zones...

                                 DALE
                        Nope.

                                 ROY
                        And daylight’s savings...

                                 DALE
                        Still not 4:20.

                                 ROY
                        Alright man. See ya later.

           Roy hits his joint and rolls up the window as Dale hurries to 
           his car and peels off. OVER THE CAR DRIVING OFF...

                                 DALE (PRE-LAP)
                        Military convoys entered Tiananmen 
                        Square on the evening of June 3rd 
                        under strict orders to clear the 
                        Square by dawn. 

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - DINING/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dale sits at the table, in suit and tie. On the china hutch 
           behind him (full of San Fran Giants memorabilia) is taped a 
           makeshift construction paper CHINESE FLAG. A wooden spoon 
           taped to soup can for a mic. Patti watches from the living 
           room couch a few feet away.

                                 DALE
                        The People's Liberation Army used live 
                        fire to disperse the protesters. The 
                        exact number of civilian deaths is not 
                        known, though estimates range from 
                        several hundred to possibly thousands.
                             (breaks into BIG smile)
                        I’m Dale Julin and we’ll be back with 
                        Weather after this break.
                             (beat)
                        So, what do you think?

                                 PATTI
                        Fantastic... but maybe not so much 
                        smiling after the massacre talk.

                                 DALE
                        Right. Sunshine Show habit. Lemme try 
                        another.

           He slaps over the Chinese flag a PUT A TIGER IN YOUR TANK 
           magazine ad for EXXON. 
                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Ready? Ok... A new culprit is being 
                        targets in the Exxon Valdez disaster. The 
                        defense team for Valdez captain Joseph 
                        Hazelwood has presented evidence that the 
                        ship’s radar was not only broken but 
                        Exxon knew this for over a year and 
                        failed to make repairs because it was 
                        quote: “too expensive.” Ironic, 
                        considering the costs of the spill might 
                        reach four billion dollars. 
                             (beat)
                        Ok, that’s all I have for that one.

                                 PATTI
                             (clapping)
                        That was excellent. Of all the ones 
                        you’ve done this week, that was my 
                        favorite.

           Dale springs up from behind the table to reveal he’s in cargo 
           shorts to go with his jacket/tie. 

                                 DALE
                        I added that ironic cost bit on the fly. 

                                 PATTI
                        I liked it. Made you think.

           Dale sits next to his wife, looks her in the eyes.

                                 DALE
                        I really want this.

                                 PATTI
                        I know... I want it for you. I want it 
                        for all of us. 

           She puts Dale’s hand on her tummy. Then Dale remembers...

                                 DALE
                        Oh, hey, how’d the doctor go today?

                                 PATTI
                        Ten fingers, ten toes. Dr. Fine says 
                        she might be a big one.

           Dale smiles, kisses Patti’s hand.

                                 DALE
                        That’s great.

                                 PATTI
                        She also said my hypertension is up a 
                        bit -- still in the safe range -- but 
                        she doesn’t think I should work 
                        anymore. I told her I could try 
                        sitting behind the checkout desk--
                                 DALE
                        --No. If the doctor says you need to 
                        get off you feet, then you stop. The 
                        library will go on without you.

                                 PATTI
                        I know, but my salary.

                                 DALE
                        It’s just a few months before we knew 
                        it would stop anyway.

                                 PATTI
                        We need it. We’re floating bills as it is 
                        - insurance co-pays are eating us up; 
                        still a little late with the mortgage 
                        payments and our rates just jumped...

                                                          PATTI
                           DALE
           We have a five year lock-in.
                                              It’s been five years.

                                 DALE
                        Shit... Ok, we’ll be fine. I have a 
                        feeling this anchor job’s gonna change 
                        everything for us. 

                                 PATTI
                        Damn right. I mean, what do those 
                        other guys have that you don’t have?

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. STUDIO BACK HALLWAY - MORNING

           A hall full of LATINO MEN. Young, handsome, all have audition 
           sides, practicing “sign-offs” as Dale walks past, dumbstruck.

                                 LATINO ANCHOR #1
                        This is Rrrrrr-eynoldo Rrrrr-eyes for

                        ios.

           INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale storms in, pissed. And Wayne clearly knows why.

                                 DALE
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 WAYNE
                        Dale...
                                 DALE
                        Why’d you even waste my time? Do you 
                        know how hard I’ve been practicing?

                                 WAYNE
                        Just relax--

                                 DALE
                        --Relax?! It’s a god-damn Menudo 
                        audition out there! I don’t have a 
                        shot unless I suddenly become 10 years 
                        younger or 20 shades browner.

                                 WAYNE
                        Dale! ... Why don’t you say hello to 
                        Gary Gabrielle - he’s a frontrunner 
                        for the anchor position.

           Dale slowly turns to find GARY GABRIELLE (32, handsome, 
           Latin) on the corner couch. Dale pales - a beat, then...

                                 DALE
                        I’m not a racist.

           And Dale turns and walks out.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           TIGHT ON: Junk Drawer is opened. In the clutter a hand finds 
           a paddle game/toy with a red ball on a rubber band string. 

           EXT. DALE’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Dale furiously paddles. Whump-whump-whump-whump. He’s amazing 
           at it. He’s pissed/stressed and this is his meditation and 
           anger management. Patti exits onto the back stoop. No 
           response. Just an angry man and his paddle ball. OFF Dale 
           smacking the shit out of the ball.

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - MORNING

           Dale does his fluff-news morning show gig.

                                 DALE
                        It’s 53 degrees, 6:13 in the morning, 
                        and if you think Detroit puts out the 
                        most innovative American cars, think 
                        again. We’ll meet the head of the 
                        California Dairy Council’s Go-Kart 
                        Cotillion whose winning entry this 
                        year had wheels made of cheese. Wow, 
                        when you take a risk like that, you 
                        cheddar win because second place isn’t 
                        gouda ‘nuff.
           Dale forces out a pained, agonized laugh. He’s dying inside. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        But first, I’m pleased to introduce 
                        the newest member of our team, our new 
                        nights and weekend anchor, Gary 
                        Gabrielle, with a preview of what to 
                        expect at 10 o’clock.

           ANGLE ON Gary, super-handsome with a million dollar smile.

                                 GARY
                             (latino accent)
                        Thank you, Dale - so happy to be on-
                        board. Tonight I’ll be talking with 
                        former president Rrrrr-onald Rrrrr-
                        eagan from his home in Bel Air, 
                        California and what he has to say 
                        about the current president just might 
                        surprise you. 

           INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale walks back to his office, crosses with Gary.

                                 DALE
                        Hey, great job out there. 

           Dale, a good sport, shakes Gary’s hand. 

                                 GARY
                             (in perfect English)
                        Thanks. And I love what you do - all 
                        that funny stuff - it’s great.

                                 DALE
                        What... happened to your accent?

                                 GARY
                        Oh, that’s just for the camera my man. Real 
                        name’s Gary Rivers. I’m from New Hampshire. 

           Gary gives Dale a friendly smack on the shoulder, moves off. 
           Dale can’t believe it. He walks down a hall to find Patti at 
           the Kraft table grabbing a bagel for Rosie (in her arms).

                                 DALE
                        Patti?

                                 PATTI
                        Hey.
                             (she kisses Dale)
                        Got cream cheese on you. Sorry, can’t 
                        stop eating...
                                 DALE
                             (kisses Rosie)
                        Hey Rosie; are you visiting Daddy? 
                             (to Patti)
                        What’re you doing here? Everything ok?

                                 PATTI
                        Everything’s fine. I just know you’ve 
                        been down about work and the whole 
                        anchor thing... so I wanted to give 
                        you these. For tonight.

           She pulls out a pair of tickets. Dale can’t believe it.

                                 DALE
                        Those are World Series tickets!

                                 PATTI
                        Go Giants.

                                 DALE
                        Oh my God! Giants! World Series! I’m 
                        going?!... We don’t have money for these.

                                 PATTI
                        Cathy at work - her Uncle had tickets but 
                        he died of a heart attack last week.

                                 DALE
                        That’s fantastic.

                                 PATTI
                        I know. So go, turn your mind off for 
                        a night, have fun. And there are two 
                        so you can bring a friend.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sweet.

           They turn to find Roy with a mouthful of donut.

                                 ROY
                        I’ll drive.

           INT. ROY’S VAN - LATER

           Roy drives. Dale finds a HUGE 1989 cell phone in the console.

                                 ROY
                        Pretty sweet, right? Called a cellular 
                        phone. For calls from the studio when 
                        we’re On Location. 

                                 DALE
                        Cool. Can’t wait to try this out.
                                 ROY
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Yeah... Wayne said it’s only for the 
                        new guy. Mr. Rrrr-ivera.

           Dale puts the phone down - another blow. Then...

                                 DALE
                        You think he’s better than me?

                                 ROY
                        Better reporter? No way... He’s just 
                        better looking. Like really better 
                        looking. 

           Dale’s face falls. As Roy stares ahead, keeps driving...

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I dig the ladies, but if I 
                        didn’t, I’d be all over that spicy 
                        enchilada. Chocolatey eyes, caramel 
                        skin... I’m gonna get a candy bar at 
                        the game.

           Dale just stares out the window - fuck me. 

           EXT. CANDLESTICK PARK - NIGHT (30 MINUTES BEFORE GAME TIME)

           Packed stands. Roy and Dale squeeze through to their seats, 
           loaded with hot dogs, beer. Roy eats a candy bar as he talks 
           on the cell phone...

           CHYRON: OCTOBER 17, 1989 ... 5:03 PM

                                 ROY (INTO PHONE)
                        Seriously Mom - World Series... With 
                        Dale from work... no, that’s the 
                        Sports guy... I’m with Dale. Dale 
                        Julin...

           Dale can’t believe it - once again he “isn’t remembered.”

                                 ROY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        No, that’s our new anchor... I know, 
                        so good looking...
                             (as they both sit...)
                        Dale’s the host...
                             (Roy studies Dale’s face)
                        ...I guess, kind of like a ferret... 

           Dale absorbs the indignity.

                                 ROY (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, he gave me the ticket... 
                        ‘cause we’re best friends...
                                 DALE
                        I don’t know your last name.

                                 ROY (INTO PHONE)
                        Alright. Bye Mom.
                             (hangs up, looks around)
                        I still can’t believe we’re here. 
                        Patti is the coolest wife I know.

                                 DALE
                        Damn right.

           As Roy works a mustard packet over his hot dog...

                                 ROY
                             (kind of to himself)
                        And she’s really hot.

           Dale turns to Roy, let’s it go. As he melts into his seat...

                                 DALE
                        Aaaah. This is just what I needed. No 
                        work. No Wayne. No bills. Nothing but 
                        my Giants and an ice cold beer--

                                 ROY
                        --and your best friend, Roy.

                                 DALE
                        Just gonna take a night to enjoy 
                        myself and relax.

           But as he moves to sip his beer THE 1989 LOMA PRIETA 
           EARTHQUAKE HITS. Dale’s beer goes FLYING as Candlestick Park 
           rocks and rolls. Fans scream as...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        It’s an earthquake! It’s an 
                        earthquake!

           The lurching stadium topples Roy into the seats in front on him.

                                 ROY
                        Oh shit!

           A woman behind Dale topples toward him but Dale catches her.

                                 DALE
                        I got you - I got you...

           Her helps her up, then grabs onto a seat. The earth bucks, he can 
           barely stand, noise is deafening, all he can think of is...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                             (softly, to himself)
                        Patti.
           And then, 15 seconds after it started, it stops. People try 
           to compose themselves but Dale springs into action...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

           Roy, on his ass in the aisle nods that he’s okay.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Still have the phone?

           Roy looks around, finds the phone under a seat.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go!

           INT. BOWELS OF CANDLESTICK PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale and Roy race through the halls under the stadium. 
           Security, employees and fans scurry about. It’s frantic.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        You okay? 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH PATTI AT HOME.

                                 PATTI (INTO PHONE)
                        We barely felt it here. The news says 
                        the whole stadium was moving! 

                                 DALE
                        We’re fine. I promise. But I have to 
                        go, love you...

                                 PATTI
                        Roads are out all over the city! Where 
                        are you going to go?

                                 DALE
                        On the air.

           EXT. CANDLESTICK PARK - LOADING BAY AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale bursts through the back entrance, Roy on his heels. He 
           searches the loading dock area, then his eyes land on... the 
           KSEE “Live Sports Truck”. He bangs on its doors which open to 
           reveal PETE CUMMINGS (40’s, 300 lbs) - truck operator - and 
           his technician BEANY (20’s). A not-looking-so-good looking 
           Jay (the sports guy) sits in the back.

                                 PETE
                        What the hell are you guys doin’ here?

                                 DALE
                        Looking to help. You gonna go live?
                                 PETE
                        Hell no. We were only supposed to do 
                        post-game with Jay.

           Dale and Roy look at Jay - he’s 3 shades of gray.

                                 ROY
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 BEANSY
                        Downed half a flask in the past 10 
                        minutes - Chicago boy, first quake. 

           Dale leaps into the truck, starts taking off Jay’s tie.

                                 DALE
                        I’m gonna borrow this. 

                                 BURT
                        The ground... it’s like jello.

                                 DALE
                        That might be the San Tequila fault 
                        line you’re feelin’. 

           Roy follows Dale’s lead, grabs a camera from the truck.

                                 PETE
                        Hey, we don’t have clearance to go on. 
                        NBC’s been knocked off the air in this 
                        city. Communication with the home 
                        office is in and out... we can’t just 
                        do this...

                                 DALE
                        Pete, people are scared. Can’t get in 
                        touch with loved ones, don’t know 
                        where to go to for help... this is why 
                        we all got into this business, right? 

           Pete locks eyes with Dale, who is more than resolute. Then:

                                 PETE
                        Beansy, crank up the satellite! We’re 
                        goin’ live!

           JUMP CUTS as Beansy and Pete flip switches, press buttons and 
           do all the shit you gotta do to send TV out into space and 
           back into people’s homes from the back of a truck.  

                                 BEANSY
                        We’re live in 5, 4, 3...

           He fingers off 2 and 1 to Dale who stands with a mic, a 
           sports coat and Burt’s tie in the parking lot with people 
           still streaming outside of the stadium behind him.

           The camera’s light goes on; Dale is LIVE to most of California.
                                 DALE
                        This is Dale Julin reporting live from 
                        Candlestick Park moments after a 
                        massive earthquake shook the Bay area 
                        to its core. The scene here’s a bit 
                        chaotic but I’ll do my best to get you 
                        accurate and up to date information 
                        through the rest of the day and into 
                        the evening...

           BEGIN MONTAGE OF...

           ON Patti at home, watches Dale with pride - he’s GREAT.

                                 PATTI
                        There ya go babe, you’re doing it.

           BACK TO DALE - with cops who direct insane traffic.

                                 COP
                        Let’s go! Jamestown’s clear down to 
                        Bayshore - go South from there!  

                                 DALE
                        With communications down around the 
                        city, how are you getting such 
                        detailed information on road 
                        availability? 

           Cop points up - Roy angles the Camera up to a BLIMP.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Incredible. The Goodyear Blimp, which 
                        was here to cover a game, has become an 
                        integral part of Emergency Services...  

           ON Producer Scott, watches in The Sunshine Show Control Room. 

                                 PRODUCER SCOTT
                        Nice question Dale...

           BACK TO DALE - with firefighters as they load their truck.

                                 FIREFIGHTER
                        Fires are breaking out all over. 
                        People need to shut off their home’s 
                        main lines if they smell gas.

                                 DALE
                        Where are you heading now?

                                 FIREFIGHTER
                        Marina. To support the Phoenix. 

           The truck peels out. Dale turns to camera.
                                 DALE
                        To clarify, the Phoenix is a fire boat 
                        that pulls water from the Bay. 
                        Amazingly, the same exact boat was 
                        used during the Great Quake of 1906.

           ON Gary Gabrielle (in “talent lounge”), Stephanie, Burt, Dr. 
           Katharti and ND crew - all gathered around a TV, watching 
           Dale. They’re all impressed...

                                 GARY
                        How the hell did he know that?

           BACK ON DALE - still rocking the mic and kicking ass...

                                 DALE
                        Fatalities cannot be confirmed, and 
                        though just one death is a tragedy, 
                        the numbers are remarkably less than 
                        might be expected. This reporter has a 
                        theory. A Bay Area World Series 
                        between the Giants and A’s had 
                        effectively shut this city down by 3 
                        pm. People had left work early to 
                        watch the game. As a result, there 
                        were a fraction of the cars that 
                        normally would’ve been on the 
                        freeways, freeways that collapsed when 
                        the earthquake struck in the middle of 
                        rush hour. So in a strange twist, 
                        baseball may have saved thousands of 
                        lives today. 

           IN THE TRUCK - Pete and Beansy share a “did you just hear 
           that baseball/zen shit Dale spun” look. They whoop and high 
           five - they’re all doing something great and the know it. 

           BACK ON DALE - with GIANTS FAN DAD (injured arm, blood can be 
           seen through his shirt) and 6 year old daughter (scared). 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Triage station’s about a quarter mile 
                        away, volunteers are giving rides from 
                        the Northside Ticket Booth. 

                                 DAD
                        Okay, thanks a lot man...

           Dad moves to leave but...

                                 DALE
                        Hold on. That’s bleedin’ pretty bad. 
                        You should keep pressure on it.

           Dale removes Jay’s tie, wraps it around Dad’s forearm. Dad 
           grimaces. Dale notices the daughter’s fear at seeing this.
                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I know this is a little scary, but 
                        you and your Daddy are gonna be fine. 
                             (pulls M&Ms from pocket)
                        Here, something sweet, ok?

           The girl takes the candy... Dale rubs her head gently.

           ON Patti, wiping a tear from her face.

           ON Stephanie, moved. In the hall behind her, Wayne passes, 
           barking orders at a junior producer at his heels...

                                 WAYNE
                        Book the geologist for two segments 
                        but the FEMA rep goes on last... 
                             (as he spots the gang...)
                        Gary, I’ve got some USGS guy that 
                        you’re gonna interview so work on 
                        pronouncing all the big rock words - 
                        tectonic, seismograph, shit like that-- 

                                 GARY
                        Have you been watching this?

           Wayne sees Dale on the TV. His jaw tenses. He’s not happy.

           INT. KSEE LIVE TRUCK - DAY

           The phone in the truck rings. 

                                 PETE
                        Looks like we’ve got comm again.
                             (answers phone)
                        This is Pete.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH Wayne IN HIS OFFICE.

                                 WAYNE
                        What the hell is Dale Julin doing on 
                        my air?!

                                 PETE
                        Kicking ass?

                                 WAYNE
                        Where’s NBC ‘Frisco?

                                 PETE
                        They’re completely down. 

                                 WAYNE
                        Listen up, D-Cups - in times of crisis 
                        people want what’s familiar. Jay does 
                        sports in the morning, afternoon and 
                        evening! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WAYNE (CONT'D)
                        People see him three times a day; they 
                        listen to Dale while they gargle.

                                 PETE
                        Jay’s been drinking--

                                 WAYNE
                        Make the switch now!

           BACK ON DALE...

                                 DALE
                        I have received the names of make-
                        shift shelters being set up by the Red 
                        Cross around the city--

           The LIGHT goes off on Roy’s camera.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. We lost power.

           Pete climbs off the truck, followed by Jay.

                                 PETE
                        No we didn’t... Wayne wants Jay. Says 
                        people are more comfortable with him.

                                 ROY
                        Are you shittin’ me? Dale was killin’ it!

                                 DALE
                        Wait... what was I doing wrong?

                                 PETE
                        Nothin’ man. You were incredible.

                                 JAY
                        Sorry, Dale. Ain’t my call. 

           Dale nods, almost in a daze, hands Jay the mic. 

                                 ROY
                        This is crazy, right? We’re gonna cover 
                        an earthquake with a drunk guy!

           But Pete is busy getting Jay ready, fixing his collar, etc.

                                 PETE
                        We’ve been dark for 15 seconds. We 
                        gotta get back up.

                                 ROY
                             (as he readies camera)
                        God dammit.

                                 BEANSY
                        Live in 5, 4, 3...
                                 PETE
                        This ain’t right, Dale.

           Dale just stands there, heartbroken - can’t believe this is 
           happening. Beansy “fingers off” the last two seconds, then...

                                 JAY
                        Good afternoon. Jay Tucker here 
                        covering the World Series and the 
                        Earthquake that disrupted it. Now when 
                        the playoffs start up again, this has 
                        got to affect the pitching rotation...

           Dale just watches - stunned, crushed. Roy approaches...

                                 ROY
                        You were a ninja tonight. You’ll get 
                        to be a real reporter -- you just need 
                        a big break...

           Dale turns to Roy with an “are you fuckin’ kidding me?” look.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        One bigger than a 6.9 earthquake, 
                        apparently.

           OFF dejected Dale as the OPENING CHORDS of Sesame Street’s 
           SUNNY DAY begin...

           EXT. DALE’S BACKYARD - DAY

           And continues over Whump-whump-whump as frustrated Dale does 
           his paddle-ball routine. 

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - SAME TIME

           Sesame Street’s on TV. Rosie watches from her Exersaucer, 
           bouncing, digging the music. Patti cleans as Dale enters. He 
           throws the paddle into the drawer.                           

                                 PATTI
                        Quit. 

                                 DALE
                        Can’t get by on 30K a year, how can we 
                        get by on nothing?

                                 PATTI
                        They don’t know what they have in you, 
                        that’s their problem. You’ll get 
                        another job.

                                 DALE
                        Move? Again?
                                 PATTI
                        If we have to.

                                 DALE
                        Albany. Chatanooga. Columbus. 
                        Flagstaff. Not doing that to you any 
                        more... not doing it to our kids.

                                 PATTI
                        We can handle it. 

           Dale sits, looks up at her. He’s reached bottom...

                                 DALE
                        Thought that by this age we wouldn’t 
                        have to “handle” our lives any more. 
                        Always thought by now I’d... be 
                        something else. Someone else.

                        When I was twelve, my dad got word he 
                        was being assigned to Oklahoma. We’d 
                        been settled in California 8 years. He 
                        did the only thing he could do to keep 
                        us home - took a tour in Saigon; 
                        bombing missions at fifty. Said when 
                        he came home, he wanted to come home. 
                        This is our home now. If my dad can go 
                        to war to give his family some 
                        stability, least I can do is figure 
                        out how to make a living.

                        You have to stop trying to be your 
                        father. You’re not him - you’ll never 
                        be him. 

                                 DALE
                        Wow. Thank you.

                                 PATTI
                        You know what I mean - you’re great at 
                        just being you. 
                             (kisses him gently)
                        And you’ll see, in a few years, things 
                        will be totally different.

                        Can you tell me how to get, how to get 
                        to Grandma & Grampa’s street? A week 
                        with Maime and Pop Pop! Hooray!

                                 DALE
                             (less than enthusiastic)
                        Hooray. You know, some people go on an 
                        actual vacation during their vacation.

                                 PATTI
                        Yes, and those people have double our 
                        money and half our kids.

                                 DALE
                        That’s not true. No one with double 
                        our money can afford a vacation.

                        Any relation to Lt. Colonel Julin?

                                 DALE
                        He’s my father.

                                 GUARD
                        Tipped a few back with him at the E-
                        Club. Guy’s got a million stories.

                                 DALE
                        Yep... that’s my Dad.

           As the Guard hands back the ID and raises the gate...
                                 GUARD
                        Thought your name was Craig.

                        That’s my brother.

                                 GUARD
                        Didn’t know he had two sons.

           Dale takes this in a bit -- typical. They drive onto...

           EXT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER

           As they drive, Dale points things out to the kids...

                                 DALE
                        That’s where Daddy played handball, 
                        that’s where I went to school.
                             (as they stop at a light)
                        ...and up at this corner is the Church 
                        where I...

           Dale stops talking - A FUNERAL is ending, a casket is carried 
           out. TEDDY KOKINIUS (Dale’s age, pronounced CO-KIN-E-US) 
           follows the pallbearers. Dale realizes...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        I went to school with that guy. Teddy 
                        Kokinius. 

           When the casket is fully outside, we see it’s small.

                                 PATTI
                        Oh my God, it’s a child’s casket.

                                 ROSIE
                        What’s a casket?

                                 DALE 
                        Nothing. It’s nothing, baby.

           The light changes and Dale drives off.

           EXT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           On a porch glider, VELMA JULIN (70’s, sweet as pie) and DON 
           JULIN (70’s, career Air Force, Eastwood-esque gruff as hell, 
           teddy bear to his grandkids). Velma spots the minivan.

                                 VELMA
                        They’re here, Don! They’re here!

                                 DON
                        They’re late.
           Velma hurries to the driveway. The car doors are barely open 
           and she is all over her grandkids.

                                 VELMA
                        My girls, my girls... we are going to 
                        have so much fun together.

           Dale gets out of the car, kisses his mother.

                                 DALE
                        Hi, Mom. Happy Anniversary.

           She gives him a big hug/kiss. Then one to Patti.

                                 VELMA
                        My chickies are back in the coop! 
                        C’mon! I’ve got everything laid out to 
                        make cookies. It’s the kind of dough 
                        you can eat raw...

           Patti and the girls follow Velma inside. 

                                 DON 
                        Must’ve been a helluva lotta traffic. 

                                 DALE
                        Happy Anniversary, Dad.

           They shake hands. No hugs. No kisses. 

                                 DON
                        Yeah. Your mother’s excited by it... 

           He grabs the biggest suitcase from the van...

                                 DALE
                        That’s the heavy one...

                                 DON
                        That’s why I’m carryin’ it.

           Dale watches him walk off - all par for the course. 

           INT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Velma plates cookies as Patti chops veggies for the party. 
           Dale fills bowls with chips. A banner reads: 50 YEARS!

                                 VELMA
                        Well I’ve been doing aquacize at the 
                        Sports Complex and your father-in-law 
                        keeps himself busy with Alumni

                        He’s still doing that?

                                 VELMA
                        He loves it. Helps with reunions, 
                        outreach programs - let’s him flap his 
                        gums about the glory days. He’ll be 
                        doing it when he’s dead and buried.

                                 DALE
                        Speaking of which... I just saw Teddy 
                        Kokinius, from high school, at a 
                        child’s funeral... 

           Velma puts down her tray, waves off her son...

                                 VELMA
                        Please, I can barely talk about it... 
                        His little girl... cancer. Base 
                        started a fund for the family - raised 
                        over ten thousand dollars. You know 
                        what your Dad always says: Family 
                        takes care of it’s own...

                                 DALE/VELMA
                        And Air Force is family.

                                 VELMA
                        We felt weird having the party today 
                        but we didn’t really know Teddy and 
                        the RSVP’s had come in, some from out 
                        of town...

                             (as he pecks her cheek...)
                        After 50 years with Dad, you’ve more 
                        than earned a party. 

                                 VELMA
                        Stop it. I want a nice week.

           Dale puts his hands up, palms out, “I surrender”. While in...

                        prostate. I flew the shit outta that 
                        plane in the Tokyo Fire Raids. Can

           Anniversary party - dozen or so friends/family. Velma holds

                        hand; problem is, the rest of her’s 
                        attached to it and I don’t think you’re

           The room is affected by the sweetness of the moment. A few of 
           the women let out an “Awww”. Velma hugs Don, kisses him.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Alright, it’s not a swingers party... 
                        Let’s talk about something other than 
                        us. Craig, how’s the season going?

           CRAIG (35, handsome), Dale’s brother perks up.

                                 CRAIG
                        Gangbusters. Solid season so far.

                                 DON
                        He’s being modest. They’re in first 
                        place, QB’s All-County and they’re on 
                        their way to State. Game’ll be 
                        televised so y’all better watch.

           Patti sees how Don brags about Craig, comes to Dale’s aid...

                                 PATTI
                        Speaking of television, Dale’s morning 
                        show is going gangbusters too.
                             (talking out of her ass)
                        Number one... in the demo...

                                 DON
                        Demo?
           Dale looks at Patti wide-eyed, shakes his head, but it’s too late.

                                 PATTI
                        The... morning category demo... 
                        viewers 18... to 75... 

           She turns, pretends to eat a finger sandwich.

                                 CRAIG
                        I saw you, bro! Few months back - when 
                        they made you enroll in clown college!

           Dale pales - dear God, of all the stories to bring up...

                      CRAIG (CONT’D)
           Big red nose, giant wig--
                                                          DALE
                                              --don’t really remember that 
                                              one--

                      CRAIG (CONT’D)
                                                          DALE
           --Floppy shoes--
                                              --May’ve been a different 
                                              reporter--

           Don looks mortified. But not as mortified as Dale...

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                             (oblivious, laughing)
                        No, no. It was you. And the instructor 
                        hit you with a pie, remember?

           Everyone laughs, unaware (except Patti and Don) of Dale’s 
           discomfort.

                                 AIR FORCE BUDDY
                             (hysterical)
                        And after you got cleaned up... he hit 
                        you again - oh... my side hurts... 

                                 DON
                             (ok, let’s end this...)
                        --Ok, let’s let Velma open those 
                        presents. See what I get in return for 
                        feedin’ all of you tonight. 

           Don hands her a box and the topic has shifted. Dale and Don 
           share a quick look - Dale knows his dad was embarrassed. 

           INT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY NEXT MORNING

           Alone, Dale stands, stares at the TV, can’t believe what he’s 
           seeing. On The Sunshine Show a Host Puppet is in his place. 
           As Don enters and walks past frame behind Dale...

                                 DON
                        Aren’t you a little old for Sesame 
                        Street?
           Dale doesn’t respond - just stares at the TV.

                                 HOST PUPPET
                        Don’t go away - we’ll be right back 
                        with more Sunshine Show after these 
                        messages.

           Don leans back into RIGHT FRAME - a beat, then...

                                 DON
                        They replaced you with a puppet?

                                 DALE
                        It’s a gimmick. He’s just there while 
                        I’m on vacation... doing my job... 

                                 DON
                        Yeah, well, we’re outta milk and I 
                        promised Rosie pancakes. Goin’ to the 
                        BX..
                             (takes in his son, unsure)
                        Wanna come?

           Dale just turns and follows his Dad out the door.

           EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE THE BX - DAY

           Dale/Don exit Don’s truck. Dale notices construction taking 
           place between two existing buildings.

                                 DALE
                        What’s going up?

                                 DON
                        New communications center.

                                 DALE
                        Why squeeze it between those 
                        buildings? They have all that 
                        untouched acreage on the South 40.

                                 DON
                             (are you dizzy?)
                        That’s where the plane went down.

                                 DALE
                        Plane went down by the service road. 
                        They’ve had all those acres fenced off for 
                        decades; can’t they spare some of it?

                                 DON
                        You’re a city planner now? Thought you 
                        were a TV host.

                                 DALE
                        Reporter.
                                 DON
                        Right. Reporter. Like the puppet.

           Don walks off. Dale moves to follow but spots Teddy crossing 
           the lot to enter the E-Club. Dale watches, feels for the guy.  

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        You coming or not?

                                 DALE
                        You go ahead. I’ll meet up at home.

           And Dale moves off. Don watches him go; his son confuses him.

           INT. E-CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale enters. Dark. Dank. Like any bar in the early morning. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Sorry. Don’t open until noon.

           Dale sees Teddy alone in a back booth with a scotch.

                                 DALE
                        What about him?

                                 BARTENDER
                        He’s got a reason to drink at 7.

                                 DALE
                        C’mon. I went to school with him... 
                             (Bartender doesn’t blink)
                        I’m Lt. Col. Julin's son.

                                 BARTENDER
                        The football coach?

           Beat, then...

                                 DALE
                        Yes.

           Bartender motions “go ahead”. Dale approaches delicately...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Teddy?

           Teddy looks up, eyes raw from painful days. He says nothing.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        I... um... I’m Dale Julin. We went to 
                        school together - high school...

                                 TEDDY
                        Don’t remember you.
                                 DALE
                        Yeah. Well. I, um, I heard what 
                        happened -- just wanted to say I’m 
                        sorry. I have kids of my own and...

           Teddy finishes his scotch, put the glass down, no eye 
           contact, clearly marking the end of their talk. Awkward beat, 
           then Dale just walks to the Bartender, hands him money.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        For his next round.

                                 TEDDY
                             (from the back of the bar)
                        Buy two. 

           Dale peels off more bills for Bartender. He walks off, 
           heading toward camera/the exit when...

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Drink ‘em with me. 

           Dale stops walking. TIME CUT TO:

           INT. E-CLUB - LATER

           Table is covered with a few stacked glasses and a 1/4 full 
           bottle. They’ve had a few, but aren’t sloppy. Teddy talks to 
           Dale, but it’s almost as if he’s softly talking to himself.

                                 TEDDY
                        ...Been a mechanic for 20 years. I can 
                        fix anything. I understand if 
                        something’s broke, you fit a joint, 
                        you weld a gap - you fix it... But 
                        there was no fixing what Katie had. 
                        You don’t fix cancer. One day it’s not 
                        there... then it’s there... and then 
                        she’s not there. Her room’s there, her 
                        toys, clothes, Lego castle we were 
                        building together... but your girl’s 
                        gone. Half hoping if I keep her room 
                        just the way she left it... she’ll 
                        come back.  

           He looks down, sips his drink.  Dale watches...

                                 DALE
                        What exactly did she have?

                                 TEDDY
                             (hates the words)
                        Acinic cell carcinoma. Better chance 
                        of seeing Bigfoot riding the Loch Ness 
                        Monster than getting that... 
                                 DALE
                        It’s rare?

                                 TEDDY
                        Rarer than rocking horse shit. So 4 
                        years ago, when my niece got it...

                                 DALE
                        ...Your niece had it too?

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh yeah - welcome to Teddy Kokinius’ 
                        World of Shit. My niece Janey... 
                        beautiful girl - played the cello - 
                        lived 3 houses down from us on the 
                        base. When she got it, I just thought 
                        we were unlucky. Now, just think we’re 
                        cursed. 

           He shifts his weight, knocks a glass over, had a few too many. 

                                 DALE
                        Maybe you should rest. You look tired.

           Teddy nods, slowly gets up, walks off, softly mumbling...

                                 TEDDY
                        You go home too, Dale. Go home to your 
                        daughters.  

           OFF Dale - confused, concerned... intrigued. 

           INT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Don glues a model Bomber at the table. Velma and Patti play 
           gin. Dale’s on the phone with Dr. Katharti, takes notes. 
           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH DR. KATHARTI 

                                 DR. KATHARTI (INTO PHONE)
                        There could be genetic 
                        predispositions, environmental 
                        factors; very hard to say with 
                        certainty. But 2 cases like that - 
                        it’s an anomaly.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Ok. Thanks doc, really appreciate it. 

                                 DR. KATHARTI (INTO PHONE)
                        No problem... By the way, when are you 
                        returning?

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        I’ll be back next week.
                                 DR. KATHARTI(INTO PHONE)
                        Already? We were really enjoying the 
                        puppet. He’s quite funny and...
                             (click)
                        Hello? Dale?

           But Dale hung up when he heard “puppet”. BACK IN KITCHEN:

                                 DALE
                             (reading from his notes)
                        So acinic cell carcinoma makes up 3/10 
                        of 1% of all cancer in the United 
                        States, according to Dr. Katharti.

                                 DON
                             (snort incredulity)
                        The guy who tells you how to get rid 
                        of warts with Witch Hazel?

                                 PATTI
                             (to Dale, sotto)
                        At least he’s watching.

           OFF Dale, looking at his notes. He underlines 3/10 of 1%.

           EXT. DALE’S PARENTS’ DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

           Velma and Patti pack up the kids, blanket, picnic basket.

                                 VELMA
                        Did you pack Dale’s Fig Newtons?

                                 PATTI
                        He’s not coming.

                                 VELMA
                        But he loves the lake.

                                 PATTI
                        Said he had something to take care of.

           EXT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - FUEL FARM - LATER SAME DAY

           10,000 gallon bladders of JET FUEL dirt-bermed at the far end 
           of a runway field. AIRMAN MITCH KUGLER (21, Good ‘Ole 
           Southern boy, goofy) fills a vile with fuel. Dale’s with him.

                                 MITCH
                        Shit, jet fuel’s loaded with heptane, 
                        cyclohexane, iso-octane, benzene, 
                        pinch of cinnamon and a partridge in a 
                        pear tree - you name it, we got it...
                        Hell, why you wanna do a story on Bulk 
                        Fuel anyhow? Gotta be the most boring 
                        company in the Force.
                                 DALE
                        All anyone ever talks about are the 
                        pilots. But without you guys, they’d 
                        never get off the ground, right?

           Mitch takes Dale in - Dale is so completely unassuming and 
           clueless that he is beyond suspicion. Mitch snorts a laugh...

                                 MITCH
                        Now don’t you let your Daddy here ya 
                        talkin’ like that, Julin Junior.

           As Mitch drops a Thermometer into the vile, notes the 
           temperature, jots it down in a chart...

                                 DALE
                        What would happen if any of that stuff 
                        you mentioned got into the soil?

                                 MITCH
                             (dead serious)
                        Oh, we’d all die.
                             (breaks into laughter)
                        Shit man, that ain’t ever happened, 
                        ain’t ever gonna happen.  Under these 
                        bladders, we got 1 ton anti-corrosive 
                        storage tanks with leak detection 
                        systems so hot they know when I don’t 
                        shake good at the urinal.

                                 DALE
                        Never so much as a drop in the dirt? 

                                 MITCH
                        Nope. Test it every day.

           Dale takes this in - a dead-end. He shakes hands with Mitch.

                                 DALE
                        Alright, appreciate your time, Mitch.

                                 MITCH
                        Be good, Craig.

           Dale doesn’t even bother to correct him. He just walks off.

           INT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - SCHOOL CLASSROOM - LATER 

           MRS. PARSONS (78, kind face) erases the BLACKBOARD. 

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        It’s just wonderful that one of our 
                        own alumni would want to do a story on 
                        the military base education system. 
                             (turns, faces the class)
                        You say I had you for 4th Grade?
           REVEAL: Dale sits at a kid’s desk in an empty class.

                                 DALE
                        Yup. Right here. For a whole year.

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        I normally remember all of my 
                        students. Maybe my age is finally 
                        catching up to me. 

                                 DALE
                        It’s not your age.

           Mrs. Parsons, lively for a 78 year old, sits near Dale.

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        So where do we start?

                                 DALE
                        How ‘bout with you? How long have you 
                        been here now, Mrs. Parsons?

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        Over sixty years. Principal for the 
                        past twenty, but always teach one 
                        course a semester, just to stay in 
                        fighting shape.

                                 DALE
                        The students must mean a lot to you.

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        They mean the world.

                                 DALE
                        Must’ve been hard for you recently, 
                        when Katie Kokinius passed away.

           Mrs. Parsons’ twinkle fades a bit - she’s affected by this. 

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        A military base is prepared for death - 
                        it’s part of the job. Mothers and 
                        fathers know this when they sign on 
                        the line. But when it’s a child... 

           She fades off, her eyes moisten a bit. Dale treads lightly.

                                 DALE
                        Have you lost many students during 
                        your tenure?

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        Sadly... Katie was not the first.
                             (thinking back)
                        In the 60’s a young boy had a moped 
                        accident, I remember that.

                                 MRS. PARSONS (CONT'D)
                        There was a drowning once, a high 
                        school student had a brain tumor the 
                        year of my sabbatical, an honor roll 
                        student had bladder cancer, a leukemia 
                        case...

           Dale’s stopped taking notes, can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 DALE
                        Didn’t anyone ever find this unusual? 
                        All these cancer cases.

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        Not that I know of. They were spread out 
                        over a half-century - and it seems 
                        cancer’s everywhere nowadays. They say 
                        we’ll all get it if we live long enough.

                                 DALE
                        But these kids didn’t live long enough.

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                        No... they surely didn’t. 

           Dale can see how affected Parsons is - he switches gears.

                                 DALE
                        You’ve got to be thinking retirement 
                        soon, no? Spend time spoiling your 
                        grandkids.

                                 MRS. PARSONS
                             (reflects, bit painful)
                        Never had children of my own. We 
                        wanted them - but there were many 
                        miscarriages and our last try at it - 
                        well... the baby I gave birth to, poor 
                        dear was more flesh than child. 
                        Doctors don’t know why.

           Dale takes this information in as Mrs. Parsons smiles.

                                 MRS. PARSONS (CONT’D)
                        I guess God’s plan was for the school 
                        children to be my kids... 

           Dale leans in, puts his hand on Mrs. Parsons’...

                                 DALE
                        And aren’t they lucky for that.

           INT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - HOSPITAL - NEXT DAY

           YOUNG DOCTOR moves briskly down the hall, patients’ charts in 
           hand, marking them with a pen, Dale on his heels...
                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        And then after my residency, I 
                        enlisted in the Air Force. 

                                 DALE
                        And what caused you to do that?

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        My Dad served. I mean, what kind of 
                        man would I be if I didn’t, right?

                                 DALE
                        Right... so anyway, I really want my 
                        piece to focus on the great medical 
                        care our men and women in the Force 
                        receive. Can you tell me the kind of 
                        things you see here on the base --
                             (plays it real casual)
                        You know, from the mundane to the 
                        rare. Maybe things that pop up over 
                        the years you wouldn’t normally 
                        expect.

           A passing NURSE hands the doc a chart. As he reads it...

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        Only been here 6 months - ‘nother 6 
                        and I’m in Germany. We get rotated 
                        like tires so can’t really speak to 
                        any interesting history--
                             (perks up, re: chart)
                        But I got an Airman here who lost 3 
                        toes in a lawn mower. That’s kind of 
                        crazy, right? Wanna talk to him?

           OFF Dale - not really the kind of info he was looking for.

           EXT. BASE PARK - LATER

           Dale sits, eats a sandwich. Contemplative. A bird hops near 
           his feet. He feeds it sandwich crumbs, talks to it... 

                                 DALE
                        Even trade - food for information. Is 
                        something going on around here?

           Dale accidentally drops his note pad, scaring the bird which 
           flies off,  landing on a PLAQUE on a fence. Something clicks 
           with Dale. He approaches the plaque, reads it aloud.

                        Earth to Dale. Come in Dale...

           INT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Family dinner. Dale stares into space as Velma dishes food.

                                 VELMA
                        Dale, honey. I’m talking to you.

                        Do you want sweet potatoes?

           Dale nods. As Velma scoops some onto her son’s plate...

                        So where were you all day today?

                                 DALE
                        Walking the base. Thinking about doing 
                        a piece on the crash back in ‘50. Not 
                        enough people know about it.

                        Sure it was only a cluster bomb?

                                 DON
                        Only a cluster bomb? That’s 500 pounds 
                        of hold onto your ass.

                                 DALE
                        Just sayin’ -- we had deadlier weapons 
                        back then--

                                 DON
                        --Boy, I’ve dropped more cluster bombs 
                        than you’ve dropped turds. Trust me, 
                        they get the job done. Hell, the ‘50 
                        crash shattered windows 10 miles away. 
                        Ground damage so bad there were rumors 
                        of several bombs on board. Some say 
                        their weight’s what took her down.

           Don continues eating. Dale stands, wheels spinning...

                                 DALE
                        Thanks, mom. I’m full.

           ...and hurries into the living room where he fills his arms 
           with several of Don’s MILITARY BOOKS from the shelves. He 
           hurries past them, drops a book, spills other books 
           retrieving it, collects them up, hurries into the spare room.

           Don watches this, shakes his head, turns back to his food.

           INT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Patti exits the bathroom, sexy in sweats and a tank top.  
           Dale, in bed, pours through a 1/2 dozen military history 
           books, jotting down notes. 

                                 PATTI
                        Hey bookworm... I said “Hey Bookworm”.

                                 DALE
                             (nose in book)
                        Dad was right.

                                 PATTI
                        There’s something I’ve never heard you 
                        say before.
                                 DALE
                        And he was wrong.

                                 PATTI
                        Ah, back to normal.

                                 DALE
                             (as he shows her the book)
                        See. Right here. This section on 
                        military accidents - there’s only half 
                        a page on the ‘50 crash - it says 
                        windows shattered “ten miles from the 
                        impact site”. Like Dad said.

                                 PATTI
                        If your father knows anything, it’s 
                        the history of this base.

                                 DALE
                        But a conventional bomb - the kind my 
                        Dad says was on that plane - the U.S. 
                        had been testing them since the 30’s 
                        out in Nevada. Look, here...
                             (points to another book)
                        ...and the testing facility was “Two and 
                        a half miles down a dirt, desert road to 
                        allow scientists easy access to the 
                        munition range”. So the scientists set 
                        up their facilities less than 10 miles 
                        from where conventional bombs were being 
                        set off. They wouldn’t do that if the 
                        bombs would shatter their windows every 
                        time they conducted a test. So...

           He looks at Patti expectantly, waiting for her to catch on.

                                 PATTI
                        So what you maniac?

                                 DALE
                        So maybe the plane that went down here 
                        wasn’t carrying a “conventional” bomb. 

                                 PATTI
                        One - we’ve talked about air quotes. 
                        And Two - then what was the plane 
                        carrying?

           Dale looks are her knowingly, raises his eyebrows, whispers:

                                 DALE
                        Ask Japan.

                                 PATTI
                        An atomic bomb?
                                 DALE
                        It was a huge explosion. That’s not in 
                        dispute. And people have gotten sick 
                        on this base - 

                                 PATTI
                        From radiation fallout? 

                                 DALE
                        I’m throwing out the possibility.

                                 PATTI
                        How about this possibility? If an 
                        atomic bomb went off in the middle of 
                        California, someone would’ve noticed.

           A defeated beat, then...

                                 DALE
                        Presumably.

           Patti climbs onto the bed, on her knees she faces Dale, 
           presses her forehead to his, kisses him, lookin’ for love.

                                 PATTI
                        You’re super-cute when you get all 
                        Walter-Cronkitey, you know that?

           Dale kisses back, getting into it now - forget researching! 
           As they kiss, more passionately, both a little breathless...

                                 DALE
                        You wanna hear it?

                                 PATTI
                        Damn right I do.

                                 DALE
                             (Cronkite impersonation)
                        And that’s the way it is.

                                 PATTI
                        Take me Wally.

           They tumble into the pillows. As they kiss...

                                 DALE
                        We have to be quiet.

                                 PATTI
                        It’s okay. The beasts are asleep.

                                 DALE
                        Ok, but what about our daughters?

           Patti laughs. They rev up, she pulls on his shirt. But then:
                                 PATTI
                        What’s wrong?

                                 DALE
                        It’s just, even if there were multiple 
                        conventional bombs in the plane --

                           PATTI
           -- You gotta be kidding me...
                                                          DALE
                                              -- they’d all have to go off 
                                              at the exact same time to 
                                              create the force to damage 
                                              buildings that far away.

                                 PATTI
                        I’m not gettin’ any tonight, am I?

           But Dale’s already up, energized, gathering his books/notes.

                                 DALE
                             (thinking aloud)
                        And they don’t just rotate the doctors 
                        on the bases; patients and their 
                        records are constantly on the move 
                        too, so no sickness patterns were 
                        detected.

           Patti, dumbstruck, grabs the remote, turns on the TV.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                             (leans in, kisses her)
                        I’m sorry. But I might have something 
                        here. 

                                 PATTI
                             (skeptical)
                        Another story?

                                 DALE
                        Maybe. Not sure. Just wanna jot down a 
                        few things before I forget them. But I 
                        promise. When we get back home 
                        tomorrow, no more bombs... 
                             (trying to be sexy)
                        ...except the giant Love Bomb I’m 
                        gonna drop... and it’s gonna 
                        explode... all over you...
                             (off Patti’s eeew face)
                        Kind of knew it was creepy as I was 
                        saying it... Ok. 

           And he’s out the door with his books. 

           EXT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           The minivan, full of luggage and the Julin family, drives 
           off. Velma and Don watch them go. Velma waves.
           EXT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale pulls over, leaves the minivan running...

                                 PATTI
                        What are you doing?

                                 DALE
                        Just gotta run into the library for a 
                        second -- I’ll be right back --

           Dale hustles to the steps - slows as he sees Teddy walking 
           several yards away. Teddy’s broken, lost in pain. Dale takes 
           him in a beat, then sprints up the steps into...

           INT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Front Desk. Dale approaches the LIBRARIAN (50’s, female).

                                 DALE
                        Hi. I’m wondering if you can direct me 
                        to whatever information you might have 
                        on the 1950 crash here on the base.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Certainly. I can get that for you 
                        myself. I’ll be right back.

                                 DALE
                        Wow. Thanks.

           Librarian moves off. Dale’s eyes land on a statue of General 
           Travis in the middle of the library - he’s handsome, stoic, 
           brave. The plaque reads GENERAL ROBERT F. TRAVIS - 1904-1950.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)

                        Here you go.

           Dale turns to find Librarian handing him... a pamphlet.

                                 DALE
                        What’s this?

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Our data on the 1950 crash.

           Dale stares at the thin pamphlet, then reads it aloud...
                                 DALE
                        August 5, 1950. A B-29 carrying a 
                        weapon, but no capsule, experienced 
                        two runaway propellers and landing 
                        gear retraction difficulties on 
                        takeoff from Fairfield/Suisun AFB (Now 
                        Travis). The aircraft attempted an 
                        emergency landing and crashed and 
                        burned. The fire was fought for 12-15 
                        minutes before the weapon’s high 
                        explosive material detonated. 19 crew 
                        members and rescue personnel were 
                        killed in the crash and/or resulting 
                        detonations, including General Travis.
                             (to Librarian)
                        This is all you have?

                                 LIBRARIAN
                             (totally clueless)
                        You can keep it.

           INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - DAY

           TIGHT ON the pamphlet being held by an unimpressed Wayne. 

                                 WAYNE
                        It’s a pamphlet.

                                 DALE
                        Exactly! That crash was the defining 
                        moment in the base’s history. Travis 
                        was re-named after the general who 
                        died in the accident for God’s sake! 
                        But one little pamphlet is all the Air 
                        Force has ever issued on the subject? 
                        I’m telling you, Wayne, they’re 
                        covering something up.

                        And what would that be?

                                 DALE
                        I think... maybe... a nuclear bomb.

                                 WAYNE
                        Nuclear, you say?

                                 DALE
                        Well, atomic with nuclear components-- 
                        it’s semantics. Thing is, a nuclear 
                        bomb’s the kind of thing you notice...

                        But whatever it was it sure as hell 
                        was stronger than a conventional bomb.

                                 WAYNE
                        You know, Dale, this couldn’t have 
                        come at a better time. Just this 
                        morning, I was reading viewer mail, 
                        and they all said the same thing: 
                        Where are all the Korean War stories? 
                        We want to hear more about Korea. Why 
                        hasn’t there been more in the news 
                        lately about the Korean War?

           Dale stares back, doesn’t appreciate Wayne’s tone.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Can you tell I’m being sarcastic?

                                 DALE
                        I can tell you’re being a dick.

                                 WAYNE
                        Wanna know how Ed McMahon’s able to 
                        sit on Carson’s couch night after 
                        night without blowin’ his brains out? 
                        Because he’s accepted his lot in life. 
                        Learn from Ed. 
                             (hands back pamphlet)
                        Now there’s a ten year old Spelling 
                        Bee champ waiting for you and he isn’t 
                        Indian or Asian. Now that’s news. So 
                        get to work Brokaw.

           Beat, then Dale turns and walks out, dejected...

                                 DALE (PRELAP)
                        Good morning Fresno! It’s 6:18 and 64 
                        degrees... 

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale sits next to a ten year old, condescending NERD.

                                 DALE
                        ...and I’m sitting next to a young man 
                        who’s spelling prowess is phenomenal. 
                        P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-O-L. Phenomenal.

                                 NERD
                        You spelled it wrong.

                                 DALE
                        What was that?
                                 NERD
                        It’s A-L. You spelled it O-L. You 
                        spelled a level two word wrong.

                                 DALE
                             (with a smile)
                        Well, we’re not all spelling bee 
                        champs.

                                 NERD
                        My sister can spell Phenomenal and 
                        she’s six.

                                 DALE
                             (trying to take high road)
                        Good for her. It’s not an easy word.

                                 NERD
                        Yes it is.

                                 DALE
                             (losing composure)
                        No it isn’t.

                                 NERD
                        Is if you’re smart.

                                 DALE
                        How ‘bout you K-I-S-S my A-S-S-H-O...

           CONTROL ROOM - Producer Scott LUNGES for a panic button; an 
           “Experiencing Technical Difficulties” card appears on the 
           monitor. 

           STUDIO - Everyone, including Nerd, stares at Dale, who has 
           snapped. OFF Dale.

           INT. DALE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Dale packs his stuff into a box. Wayne enters.

                                 WAYNE
                        You’re not fired, stupid. 

                                 DALE
                        I told a ten year old boy to Kiss My 
                        Asshole on television. 

                                 WAYNE
                        15 second delay button. No one saw 
                        shit. At worst it looked like you 
                        asked him to kiss you. Now sit down.

           Dale does, surprised by this turn of events. Beat, then...

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why you’re an idiot?
                                 DALE
                        Not sure I agree with the premise of 
                        your question--

                                 WAYNE
                        --You’re an idiot because you make 
                        things hard on yourself. This is an 
                        easy gig. Give the time and 
                        temperature, read the prompter, keep 
                        your hair nice, go home. But you 
                        actually give a damn... and that’s 
                        more than I can say for most of the 
                        meat-puppets... So... the affiliate’s

                        To anchor?

                                 WAYNE
                        More of a correspondent. It’s a 
                        magazine show - recap of the weeks 
                        sexiest stories.

                                 DALE
                             (enthusiasm gone)
                        So it’s fluff. 

                                 WAYNE
                        It’s a shot.

                                 DALE
                        It’s a summary of days-old 
                        sensationalistic news for folks who 
                        forgot to pick up this week’s PEOPLE.

                                 WAYNE
                        It’s more money and more air time. Two 
                        things you need. Upstairs gave me a 
                        list with 15 Mexicans on it but I’m 
                        offering it to you, muchacho. Do it or 
                        don’t. But let me know by tomorrow. 

           Wayne exits. OFF Dale, considering the opportunity...

           INT. BALLET RECITAL - EVENING

           Dale and Patti (holding Mara Mae and Daisy) watch Rosie dance 
           with other 4 year olds. They’re all cute, but they all suck. 

                                 PATTI
                             (sotto)
                        Well, it’s more money.

                                 DALE
                             (sotto)
                        But it’s a step back, not forward.
           INT. MINIVAN - LATER

           Drive home. Kids asleep in backseat, so they still whisper...

                                 DALE
                        Mortgage doesn’t pay itself. We really

                                 PATTI
                        But it’s a step back, not forward.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - ROSIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They tuck in a passed-out Rosie. Dale and Patti whisper 
           across to each other, from opposite sides of the bed.

                                 PATTI
                        Bottom line -- what do you want?

           Beat. Dale looks up at her, they lock eyes...

                                 DALE
                        I wanna find out what happened on that 
                        base... I want to be a reporter. 

                                 PATTI
                             (smiles, “go for it”)
                        There’s your answer.

           EXT. SHITTY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Dale knocks on a door. Roy answers.

                                 DALE
                        Hey Roy. What are you doing?

           Roy exhales a cloud of marijuana smoke into Dale’s face.

                                 ROY
                        Hangin’ out with Buds McKenzie.

           REVEAL Roy holds a SPUDZ MCKENZIE (80’s Bud Lite spokesdog) 
           statue, fitted with a BONG TUBE sticking out of his head.

                                 DALE
                        Hate to interrupt your meeting, but 
                        wanted to see if you’d wanna help 
                        chase a story. Doesn’t have Wayne’s 
                        support so it’ll be on the QT; long 
                        hours, could lose our jobs and we’ll 
                        be going against the U.S. Government 
                        so we might piss off some powerful 
                        people... and I can’t pay you.

           Roy just stares back, doesn’t respond. Dale keeps pitching...
                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        But meals on me. Whatever you want. 
                        Sandwiches, burgers, burritos...

           Beat... Roy raises an eyebrow, stoner-intrigued.

                                 ROY
                        What kind of burritos?

                        So the way the Air Force seems to be 
                        covering up details of this crash, I 
                        kinda thought it best not to ask 
                        permission to do a piece on it. 

                                 ROY
                        How the hell we gettin’ on the base?

                                 DALE
                        Mom got us a drive-on. Told her I’m 
                        making a surprise video for my Dad’s 
                        75th birthday. About him, his time at 
                        Travis...

                                 ROY
                        What if your Dad sees you on the base?

                                 DALE
                        Thinks I’m doing a history segment for 
                        the show. 

                                 ROY
                        We’re doing history segments on the 
                        show now?

                                 DALE
                             (jesus)
                        No. That’s what I’m telling my Dad 
                        because he can’t know about this 
                        surprise birthday video.

                                 ROY
                             (confused)
                        Ok... but when will we have time for 
                        the stuff about the plane crash.

           At wit’s end, Dale just stares ahead.  CUT TO:

           A MAZE of files - 10’ high, 30’ long. MAYBELLE (late 60’s,

                        A birthday video is such a sweet

                                 DALE
                        Just need a shot of the file. 

           Roy fires up the camera. Dale holds up the file.

                        I have in my hand the preliminary file 
                        of Lieutenant Donald Julin dated 1961. 
                        Three decades ago a man who had served 
                        his country proudly during World War 
                        II embarked on another phase of his 
                        career here at Travis Air Force Base, 
                        where he not only became an integral 
                        part of the community, but also raised 
                        a family with his loving wife Velma.

                        The file might be thin Dad, but that’s 
                        because it’s only full of intake 
                        forms. But if it were full of 
                        memories... then you’d need one of 
                        those really... big files... with the 
                        rubberbands... that wrap around...

                                 ROY
                        And... cut.

                                 MAYBELLE
                        That was just lovely. 

                                 DALE
                        Thank you. We’d love to get some B-
                        Roll now if that’s alright. 
                        Establishing shots of the room - get 
                        the scope. Real boring stuff. Won’t 
                        even know we’re here.

                                 MAYBELLE
                        Guess that’s ok. But I’m closing shop 
                        in 30 minutes.   

                                 DALE
                        More than enough time, Maybelle.

           She walks off. As soon as she’s gone, Dale spins to Roy...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Turn the camera on.

           Dale races down the aisle, scanning the file cabinets. Roy’s 
           on his heels, readying the camera as he goes...

                                 ROY
                        What are we doing?

                                 DALE
                        Looking for the files from 1950.

                                 ROY
                        Why?

                                 DALE
                        ‘Cause I don’t even know who the hell 
                        was here when the crash happened. 
                        It’ll give me a place to start. Here!
                             (finds the right cabinet)
                        Once I open this drawer, we’re 
                        breaking the law. Are you cool with 
                        that?

                                 ROY
                        I have an ounce of weed in my 
                        underwear right now.
           Dale nods. Opens the drawer, full of personnel files. As Dale 
           pulls them out, opens them, Roy films.  

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        You’re turning the pages too fast. I 
                        need at least 20 seconds a page if 
                        you’re gonna have time to write down 
                        all this info on playback.

                                 DALE
                        No time. Just film and I’ll freeze the 
                        image in editing and print it. 

                                 ROY
                        Wayne catches you, you’re fired.

                                 DALE
                        Wayne won’t be there when I’m using it.

           BEGIN: RUNNER OF DALE BUSTING HIS ASS ON THIS PROJECT...

           Dale in Edit Bay - clock reads 3:15 A.M. He freezes film 
           images of the files, hits print; the printer spits out paper. 
           The name reads TUGGLE.

           Dale in the O-Club - he and Roy interview old timer TUGGLE.  

                                 TUGGLE (INTO ROY’S CAMERA)
                        Happy Birthday, Don, ya old fart!
                             (to Dale)
                        So how’s football season going?

                                 DALE
                        ...Gangbusters... but let’s focus on 
                        the video. So you were stationed at 
                        Travis before my Dad, correct?

                                 TUGGLE
                        Oh yeah. Since ‘48.

                                 DALE
                             (playing it coy)
                        Man, so you were here when the plane 
                        crashed. What was that like? 

           POV OF ROY’S CAMERA as Tuggle recalls the crash. We’ll see 
           that Dale is covertly putting together great footage.

                                 TUGGLE
                        Explosion knocked me outta bed. I ran 
                        down - whole base was on fire. Looked 
                        like the end of the world...

           OFF Dale, getting his story...

           Back in Edit Bay - A different night. Clock: 4:07 AM. Tired 
           Dale prints more images. Paper pours into the printer tray.
           In Front of Air & Space Museum on Base - Dale stands in front 
           of a B-29 display plane. Roy has camera ready. Dale looks 
           around, coast is clear...

                                 DALE
                        This is a B-29 warplane, identical to 
                        the one that crashed upon take off on 
                        August 5, 1950 --

           Air Force personnel exit the museum; Dale deftly shifts gears.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        And on your birthday Dad, I like to 
                        think you’re like this other Air Force 
                        relic beside me - weathered, but still 
                        standing and tough as ever...

           Dale pats the plane as the personnel pass. That was close.

           Dale’s dining room table - covered in papers, late at night, 
           Dale works away, reading/highlighting the records. Patti (in 
           PJ’s) hands him a coffee, kisses him good-night. TIGHT ON 
           Dale pulling more files from a box from the floor. When he 
           places them on the table it’s now MORNING - the kids eat 
           breakfast near him, Patti hands him another cup of coffee and 
           he keeps at it... no rest for the weary...

           Outside a Diner - Exhausted Dale in a CHEAP EATS segment. MID-
           CLOSE on Dale with a super-long hot dog in a bun in one hand. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Today we’ll visit The Hot Dog Hut, 
                        where you can get a weiner dog...

           PULL BACK to REVEAL: A dachshund in Dale’s his other hand.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        ...as big as a weiner dog.

                                 ROY 
                        Cut. You got a Samsonite set under 
                        your eyes, Chief. You look like a 
                        basset hound holding a dachsund. 

           As the MAKE-UP LADY fusses with the bags under Dale’s eyes...

                                 MAKE-UP LADY
                        Jesus, hun, you gettin’ your 8 hours?

           Dale would laugh at the question except he’s too damn tired.

           Dale’s House - Late night. Dale creeps in, looks at his 
           sleeping girls. Halloween costumes/candy on the floor. Missed 
           it all. Barely sees them anymore, misses the hell out of ‘em.

                        Please. I just need the PR officer on 
                        film a minute or two; he could talk 
                        about some of the history of the base 
                        and I could compare it to what my Dad 
                        was doing in the air force during that 
                        period. Time-line kind of thing.

                                 DALE
                        C’mon. I can’t tell the story of Lt. 
                        Colonel Julin without telling the 
                        story of the base.

                                 IN-TAKE OFFICER
                        Don Julin’s your father?
                             (considers this a beat...)
                        I’ll see what I can do. But I’d think 
                        about a golf shirt.

           And Dale is out of there - taking “almost yes” for an answer.

           Dale’s Parents House - Thanksgiving. Everyone at the table 
           but Dale. As Don cuts the turkey...

           In the van: Roy sleeps, Dale at the wheel - also asleep. 
           The van drifts from frame - Screech! - then jerks back into 
           frame. They both bolt awake, Roy bracing himself, terrified.

                                 DALE
                             (covering, groggy)
                        It’s cool... possum.

           Dale in Edit Bay - Clock: 5:13 AM. Dale’s a zombie. He prints 
           away. The printer OVERFLOWS. Roy enters, also exhausted.

                                 ROY
                        Time for work, bro.

           Dale stands, in a trance, collects his papers, walks out. 

           END OF RUNNER.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Patti cooks. Daisy flings food from her seat; Rosie colors at 
           the table. Mara Mae, on the floor, bangs a pot with a spoon.

                                 MARA MAE
                        Din-ner! Din-ner! Din-ner!

                        Rosie- on the paper, not on the table.

           Her sanity hanging by a thread, she snatches away Mara Mae’s 
           pot. Beat, then Mara Mae bangs the spoon on the floor...

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Dale, frazzled, on phone, finger in ear, trying to do an 
           interview over the noise. He flips through reams of papers...

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Dr. Lubert, you said in... Nuclear 
                        History: From Fat Boy to Armageddon... 
                        that higher than usual leukemia cases 
                        were found among troops at the Nevada 
                        "Smokey" Nuclear Test site in the ‘70s. 

           INTERCUT WITH DR. LUBERT, PROFESSOR, IN COLLEGE CAMPUS OFFICE

                                 DR. LUBERT (INTO PHONE)
                        Yes, but those were nuclear weapons 
                        that were detonated. With a very high 
                        radiation fallout.
                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        But what if that’s what we’re dealing 
                        with at Travis?

                                 DR. LUBERT (INTO PHONE)
                        So your theory is a nuclear weapon was 
                        detonated on U.S. soil by our own 
                        military? If that happened, I think 
                        I’d know about it.

           As Dale carefully adjusts an autographed baseball in his 
           dining hutch full of his prized S.F. Giants memorabilia.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        What about... like... a baby nuke?

                                 DR. LUBERT (INTO PHONE)
                        The idea of small amounts of nuclear 
                        material detonated in a briefcase or 
                        knapsack has been floated by doomsday 
                        prognosticators for a while now. They 
                        call it a dirty bomb -- 

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        -- so it’s possible --

                                 DR. LUBERT (INTO PHONE)
                        -- By a terrorist maybe. But you’re 
                        talking about the US Air Force in 
                        1950. We’d already won a war dropping 
                        the big one. Why pack a plane with a 
                        pea shooter when you’ve got Bazookas? 

           A SHATTER from the kitchen grabs Dale’s attention.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Dr. Lubert - I, uh, need to go. Can I 
                        call you again next week? Thanks.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Patti kneels, dust-pans broken glass from a fallen BLENDER. 
           Mara Mae stands near, cries. Dale hurries in, scoops her up.

                                 DALE
                        What happened?

                        The cord was hanging over the side, 
                        she pulled it...

                                 DALE
                        You ok, baby-girl?
                             (off her nod)
                        Ok, why don’t you and Rosie watch a 
                        show while Mommy and Daddy clean up?
           He puts her down away from the glass and they hurry off as 
           Dale gets on his knees and starts picking up big pieces.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        It could’ve landed on her, you know.

                                 PATTI
                        Are you fuckin’ kidding me?

                        Daisy can’t understand a fuckin’ word I’m 
                        saying. And if you were smart, you’d 
                        watch what you’re saying right now.  

                                 DALE
                        What does that mean?

                                 PATTI
                        It means I’ve been raising these kids 
                        on my own for months now--

                        slept at work Tuesday, six hours 
                        Wednesday, back at Travis Thursday and 
                        five hours today. 19 god damn hours 
                        you’ve been here all week. And it’s 
                        been like this for months--

           --I have to work--
                                                          PATTI

                        “Go be a reporter”. You said that. We 
                        agreed I should do this. 

                                 PATTI
                        We never agreed you’d abandon us in 
                        the process. You’re obsessed with 
                        breaking a story that might not even 
                        exist--

                                 DALE
                        You want me to give it up? I won’t do 
                        that. This is my last shot.  

                                 PATTI
                        To what? Make anchor at 45? Finally 
                        earn Daddy’s approval? 
                                 DALE
                        You’re a shrink now? I’m doing this 
                        for me - for this family. And you have 
                        no idea what it’s like growing up 
                        under a bar you knew you could never 
                        reach. I won’t apologize for wanting 
                        to finally be something. 

                                 PATTI
                        You already were. A husband and a 
                        father but you’re barely either of 
                        those things now... 
                             (hard for her to say...)
                        Last week Mara Mae asked me where you 
                        lived...

                                 DALE
                        What?

                                 PATTI
                        She wanted to go visit her Daddy.

           Dale falls into a chair - this hit him hard as hell. Patti 
           sits too... she’s calmer now, but still resolute...

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Christmas is in a few weeks - credit 
                        cards are maxed; you’re spending a 
                        fortune on gas, long distance calls - 
                        and we just got this in the mail.

           She hands him a letter from the bank. He scans it.

                                 DALE
                        Foreclosure?

                                 PATTI
                        Just a warning, but that train’s gonna 
                        pull into the station soon enough.

           A beat, Dale considers all of this, then...

                                 DALE
                        I’ll stop. If you want.

                                 PATTI
                        I want to support what you want. What 
                        you need - because I honestly believe 
                        you need what you’re doing right 
                        now... but I need some things too. A 
                        five minute shower without the kids 
                        banging on the door; some exercise 
                        once in a while; and god forbid a 
                        night out with my husband. Nothing 
                        fancy. I’d settle for Sizzler.

           Beat. Dale looks at the bank letter...
                                 DALE
                        We can’t afford Sizzler.

           Patti takes Dale in, then just gets up, exits. OFF Dale.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - LATE SAME NIGHT

           Patti does laundry. Kids sleep. Dale comes up from behind, 
           wraps his arms around her. Takes her hands, holds them up.

                                 DALE
                        Mi-Ling’s got her work cut out.

                                 PATTI
                             (a bit distant)
                        Who’s Mi-Ling?

                                 DALE
                        From the nail salon. Just part of next 
                        weekend’s Mommy Day. A mani-pedi at 
                        Mane Attraction, plus an appointment 
                        to get your hair-do did...

                                 PATTI
                             (turns toward him)
                        We can’t afford it.

                                 DALE
                        I know. But this family can’t afford 
                        to have an over-worked Mom. I’ll take 
                        the kids Saturday, you take care of 
                        yourself. 

                                 PATTI
                        Thank you so much.

                                 DALE
                        You still hate my face? ‘Cause I saw some 
                        serious face-hating in the kitchen.

           Patti sweetly curls in tight to Dale.

                                 PATTI
                        It’s passed.

                                 DALE
                        Wanna prove it?... you know... by 
                        doing naked stuff... to my body...

                                 PATTI
                        Kinda knew what you meant, but okay.

           And as they kiss, we PRELAP a gruff voice...

                                 VOICE (PRELAP)

           INT. SPORTS COLLECTIBLE/BASEBALL CARD SHOP - DAY

           Dale and MURRAY (Black, 60’s, proprietor) across the counter 
           from each other. Dale has a box full of his memorabilia.

                                 MURRAY
                        Some of this stuff is real good, Dale. 
                        And I can’t give you top dollar in 
                        this market.

                                 DALE
                        You’ve always been fair, Murray. Just 
                        gimme the best price you can.

           Murray nods, takes items from the box. Dale watches. PRELAP 
           the opening guitar riff of JINGLE BELL ROCK as we CUT TO:

                        If you’ve been following me this week 
                        as I matriculated at Santa School, 
                        you’d know that I aced everything from  
                        Mistletoe to Ho-Ho-Ho. And I’m ready 
                        to put it all to the test today.
                             (in regular voice)
                        This sucks. There are no kids at the 
                        mall on a school day. I told Wayne...

           ANGLE ON a heavy 6 YEAR OLD approaching with MOMMY.

                        Ho-ho-ho. What is your name?

           Wide-eyed and terrified, the kid says nothing. 

                                 MOMMY
                        This is Frank.

                        Don’t be shy Frank, come sit on 
                        Santa’s lap.
                             (struggles to lift the kid in 
                              his Santa Chair)
                        Oh... seems Frank enjoys his frank ‘n 
                        beans... So Frankie my boy, what would 
                        you like for Christmas this year?

                                 DALE
                        Oh, hey, come now, there’s no reason 
                        to be scared of Santa... Jesus Christ.

           Roy’s cell phone rings. He answers...

                                 ROY (INTO PHONE)
                        Go for Roy... oh, yeah, hold on...
                             (hands phone to Dale)
                        It’s the Air Force.

           Dale takes the phone, Frank on his lap, still hysterical. 

                     DALE (INTO PHONE)
                                                          MOMMY
           This is Dale Julin. 
                 (but Frank is screaming)
                                              Come now, Frank. Smile for 
                                              Mommy.
           I’m sorry, I can’t hear 
           you...

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Sorry, did you say this afternoon? I 
                        couldn’t hear- what was that? Hold on.

           Dale yanks Frank under his arm like a fat football and walks 
           off the Santa set, fumbles him into shocked Mommy’s arms, 
           totally distracted, not looking at her, without slowing down.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)

                        He’s only gonna stay ‘til 5. If we 
                        miss him, it’ll be months ‘til 
                        something opens up again.

           RUN, RUN, RUDOLPH continues as they speed down the freeway.

                        You can’t just come right out and ask 
                        him about the bomb - he’s a PR hack. 
                        He’ll deny it.

                                 DALE
                        No, he’ll deny it on film. An official 
                        government denial recorded for 
                        posterity. Only thing more important 
                        than the smoking gun, is capturing the 
                        moment someone denies the gun exists.  

                                 ROY
                        But we don’t have a smoking gun.

                        I know; but we’ll find it. We have to.
                        Shit! I left my bag at the mall!

                                 ROY
                        What bag?

                                 DALE
                        The bag with my clothes in it.

           TIGHT ON: A Watch reading 5:02. REVEAL ALONZO TATE (50’s, 
           handsome, razor-sharp), next to him is AIRMAN FIRST CLASS 
           CLARK PETERS (20’s, boyish). Tate looks up from his watch...

                                 TATE
                        No good deed goes unpunished, Peters. 
                        Tell Mr. Julin I waited, then I left. 

                                 PETERS
                        Yessir.

           As Peters notes this on his clipboard, Tate turns to go. He 
           walks toward camera when, way behind him doors open and Dale 
           (in Santa suit) and Roy run in...

                                 DALE
                        Hey. Hi. I’m here. I’m here.

           WIDE SHOT: Dale hurries across the expansive hanger. Silence 
           save for his bells jingling/echoing in the space.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Hi. Dale Julin. Sorry I’m late.

                                 TATE
                             (unamused)
                        Sleigh break down?
                                 DALE
                        Oh, this... I was doing another piece, 
                        forgot my clothes, you know how it is.

           Tate just stares back ... he doesn’t know “how it is”.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Ok - well, let’s get started.

           TIME CUT TO... Dale sits across from Tate. Roy films. 

                                 TATE
                        Travis has expanded in both acreage 
                        and personnel since your father first 
                        transferred here. Back then we were 
                        the 15th largest base in the U.S. Now 
                        we’re the 9th. 

                                 DALE
                        My father currently works in a 
                        civilian capacity for Air Force alumni 
                        relations. What role do those who 
                        previously served on the base play in 
                        present day Travis? 

                                 TATE
                        Our alumni are vital to this base. 
                        They’re family. Men like your father 
                        are appreciated and respected for 
                        their work, dedication and sacrifice.

           Dale shifts in his seat, looks at his notes, readies for...

                                 DALE
                        Speaking of sacrifice, this base was 
                        originally called Fairfield-Suisun 
                        before being renamed after General 
                        Travis who died in a tragic 1950 
                        crash.

                                 TATE
                        That’s correct. Suisun is Indian for 
                        “where the west wind blows” after the 
                        prevalent winds in the region. And 
                        like those winds, we like to think the 
                        strength of General Travis is always 
                        around us.

                                 DALE
                             (deep breath, into full 
                              “reporter mode”)
                        Regarding that crash, it is believed 
                        by some that the bomb on board was not 
                        conventional, but instead had nuclear 
                        components--

                                 TATE
                        --I’m sorry?
                                 DALE
                             (a bit nervous)
                        I’m just looking for confirmation of 
                        what was on-board that plane. There 
                        have been some inconsistencies--

           Roy keeps filming as Tate becomes more defensive/suspicious.

                                 TATE
                        --I was told this was a courtesy for 
                        your father--

                                 DALE
                        --Major Tate, is it possible it was 
                        not a conventional weapon--

                                 TATE
                             (”the pamphlet” by rote)
                        On August 5, 1950, a B-29 carrying a 
                        weapon, but no capsule, experienced 
                        two runaway propellers and landing 
                        gear retraction difficulties on 
                        takeoff from Fairfield/Suisun AFB--

                                 DALE
                        --I’ve read the pamphlet, sir--

           Tate gets more heated. So Roy keeps filming.

                                 TATE
                        The aircraft attempted an emergency 
                        landing and crashed and burned. The 
                        fire was fought for 12-15 minutes 
                        before the weapon’s high explosive 
                        material detonated. 

                                 DALE
                             (a bit more aggressive)
                        --But what was that high explosive 
                        material?

           Continuing to recite, Tate stands.

                                 TATE
                        19 crew members and rescue personnel 
                        were killed in the crash --

           Dale, almost “out of body”, springs up, pissed.

                                 DALE
                        And people are still dying!

           Dale really raised the volume. It surprised everyone there, 
           even him. Beat - tense silence. Dale stares Tate in the eye, 
           kinda scared as hell. He swallows hard but won’t back down. 
           Then Tate spins, steps hard to Roy, hand out...
                                 TATE
                        Give me that tape.

                                 ROY
                        Gimme’s don’t get.

           Roy shoves the tape in his carry-bag. Dale jumps between them.

                                 DALE
                        That’s private property--

                                 TATE
                        --It’s a recording on federal land 
                        made under false pretenses which makes 
                        it a federal crime. You have 5 seconds 
                        to hand it over or you’re in the brig. 
                        And I’ll make sure you’re buried in 
                        enough red tape that it’ll take months 
                        before your lawyers can dig you out.

           Dale and Tate are eye to eye. Dale doesn’t blink.

                                 TATE (CONT’D)
                        Five. Four --

                                 ROY
                        Does brig mean prison?

                                 TATE
                        Three. Two...

           Dale stands his ground. Roy, not so much...

                                 ROY
                        ‘Cause I’ve seen prison movies, and 
                        very bad things happen in the showers.

                                 TATE
                        One. Airman Peters, call the MPs --

                                 ROY
                        Here ya go.

           Roy shoves the tape at Tate. Dale can’t believe it.

                                 TATE
                        Now get the hell off my base.

           INT. ROY’S VAN - LATER

           Roy drives super fast down the freeway.  Dale fumes.

                                 ROY
                        Man, that guy was a beast. Officer and 
                        a Gentleman my ass--
                                 DALE
                        --Slow down. Bad enough you folded 
                        like a card table back there, don’t 
                        kill us on the ride home.  

                                 ROY
                        Just wanna get as far away from the 
                        base as possible before he watches 
                        that tape.

           Dale turns to Roy, curious...

                                 DALE
                        Why?

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. TATE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           TIGHT ON TV: Fat Frank cries on Santa Dale’s lap. REVEAL Tate 
           and Peters watching. Roy switched the tapes! Tate burns.

                                 TATE
                        We’re dealing with one slick 
                        sonuvabitch.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DALE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Dale (in tiara, wig, jewels) dances/sings for his girls.

                                 DALE
                        I’m a pretty, pretty princess - watch 
                        me dance. I’m a pretty, pretty 
                        princess - I live in France.

           The kids laugh/squeal. Patti enters, ready to leave.

                                 PATTI
                        Ok. Rosie’s snacks are in the fridge 
                        door; Mara Mae only wants Sesame 
                        Street and Daisy will need a nap in a 
                        few hours. You can handle this? 

                                 DALE
                        Why’re you still here? We don’t need 
                        ya. Beat it. Go Mommy-Day your ass off.

           They exchange kisses/“love ya’s”. Patti leaves. Beat, then...

                        Who wants to review documents with Daddy?
           INT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Daisy on Dale’s lap; he feeds her mush as he reviews papers 
           covering the table. Rosie stands on a chair, puts make-up on 
           him. Mara Mae sings C is for Cookie playing on a counter-top 
           TV. It’s kind of madness. As Dale high-lites a document...

                        head.

           Phone rings. He balances Daisy as he answers.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.

                        Is this Dale Julin?

           As Dale fights off Rosie who tries to put lipstick on him...

                        I’m sorry. Yeah, this is Dale.

                        I have a file you might want to see. 
                        About the crash.

           Holy shit. Dale freezes. Rosie uses this opportunity to drag 
           the lipstick sloppily across his lips/face. 

                                 DALE

                        near your house.

                        How do you know where I live?

                        You have one hour. 
           Click. OFF Dale, smeared lipstick, in the middle of kiddie 
           madness, clock ticking on the break he’s been hoping for.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER

           Darkness. Shadows. Dale’s car’s parked far in the back, 
           barely visible. He moves slowly toward camera, obscured.

                                 DALE
                        Hello? Anyone here?

                                 SECRETIVE VOICE (O.S.)
                        That’s far enough.

           From a dark corner appears a SHADOWED FIGURE. He stays away 
           enough to remain UNIDENTIFIABLE. He holds something...

                                 DALE
                        Is that the file?

                                 SHADOWY FIGURE
                        Yes it is. 
                             (beat, confused)
                        Is that a baby?

           Dale steps from the shadows, Daisy hangs from a BABY BJORN.

                        Yes it is.

           A beat, then the file’s slid across the ground to Dale. Dale 
           opens it, scans the contents.

                                 SHADOWY FIGURE
                        The Response Team roster from the 
                        night of the crash. 

                                 DALE
                             (holy shit!)
                        These are all the firemen - they saw 
                        everything. The explosion, the fire...
                             (looks up from file)
                        Who are you?

                                 SHADOWY FIGURE
                        It doesn’t matter. My identity can’t 
                        ever be known--

           FLASH! The headlights of Dale’s minivan turn on - 
           illuminating young AIRMAN PETERS in bright light.

                                 PETERS
                        Come on!

                                 DALE
                             (spins to the minivan)
                        Girls! I told you no buttons! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                        Now get in the back or it’s Time Out!
                             (turns back to Peters)
                        Sorry ‘bout that. Hold on - you’re the 
                        guy, Tate’s guy... Peters!

                                 PETERS
                        Please. I could lose my job. Or worse.

                                 DALE
                        I won’t say anything. I promise... But 
                        why are you doing this?

                                 PETERS
                        Because I’ve never seen Tate react to 
                        anything like he did when you brought 
                        up that crash. Never seen him scared 
                        before. Never seen anyone stand up to 
                        him before either. I tried to find 
                        anything I could on the plane but it’s 
                        like it never happened. Only found 
                        that file ‘cause it was buried in some 
                        fire safety binders. Powers That Be 
                        must’ve forgot it was there... now I 
                        need you to forget I was here.

                                 DALE
                        You have my word... and thank you.

           Dale moves to his car, straps in Daisy. Peters watches, it 
           affects him. Dale’s a regular guy, a dad. As Dale gets 
           seated, Peters approaches the car window.

                                 PETERS
                        Be careful, Dale. You’re exposed now. 
                        Tate knows you’ve been asking around. 
                        Dangerous men will be watching you.

           Dale, in his seat, puts on his best tough guy look/persona...

                                 DALE
                        I’m not scared of dangerous men. 
                        Dangerous men should be scared of me.

           He starts up the engine and “C is for Cookie” blasts on the 
           radio. God dammit! Dale fumbles the knobs, makes it louder, 
           eventually turns it off. Humiliated, he drives off.

           EXT. DALE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Dale pulls up to find Don’s car parked in his driveway...

                                 ROSIE
                        Grampa’s car!

                                 DALE
                             (not happy about this)
                        Yes it is. 
           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The kids race inside to Don, seated at the kitchen table. 

                                 DON
                        My little pilots.

           As he hugs/kisses his girls, Dale shares a look with Patti. 
           She gives him a look that says “This is not good.”

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Here’s some coins. Now go count 
                        it up. Get it right and Grandpa has 
                        more for you.

                                 PATTI
                        C’mon girls, I’ll help you.

           Patti ushers the kids out. Dale watches, not wanting to be 
           alone with Don. As soon as the kids are gone, Don changes.

                                 DON
                        A birthday video? What the hell were 
                        you thinkin’?

                                 DALE
                        Dad, it wasn’t my intention to get 
                        into--

                                 DON
                        --don’t give a rat’s ass what your 
                        intention was. Alonzo Tate is a 
                        respected figure at Travis. We have 
                        mutual friends. I respect the hell out 
                        of the man. And you ambush him with 
                        ghost story bullshit?

                                 DALE
                        I’m believe it’s more than a ghost 
                        story--

                                 DON
                        --Family takes care of its own. If 
                        there was something on that plane that 
                        was dangerous, the Air Force would’ve 
                        said something--

                                 DALE
                        --I’m not condemning the whole Force, 
                        Dad. I love the Force. I think just a 
                        few people decided to cover this up 
                        and the lie’s been handed down, decade 
                        after decade--

                                 DON
                        --You think? You’re Edward R. Murrow 
                        all of sudden? You interview magicians 
                        for Christ’s sake.   
           This stings Dale. A lot. He’s a bit stunned from the venom.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        There’s talk of taking me off Alumni 
                        Relations. 

                                 DALE
                        What? Why?

                                 DON
                        Seems they don’t appreciate my own son 
                        trying to slander them in the press. 
                        Air Force is funny that way. I lose my 
                        job, I gotta leave the base--

                                 DALE
                        --Dad, I’m sorry--

                                 DON
                        I mean, what the hell do you have? 
                        Other than a theory? How many people 
                        have you spoken to?

                                 DALE
                        Fair amount.

                                 DON
                        Anyone confirm your hypothesis?

                                 DALE
                        No.

                                 DON
                        You have any hard evidence?

                                 DALE
                        No.

                                 DON
                        Well at least I won’t lose my home 
                        over nothing.

                                 DALE
                        Dad, I wasn’t trying to hurt you. Or 
                        the base. Travis was my home too--

                                 DON
                        --Was your home. It is my life. The 
                        name Julin means something at Travis. 
                        No thanks to you--

                           DALE
                 (softly)
           ...Dad...
                                                           DON
                                              --And I’m not about to have 
                                              you drag it down even more--

                                 DALE
                             (this really hurts)
                        ...I’m sorry...
                                 DON
                        When I’m in the bar and that show of 
                        yours comes on, I tell ‘em to put on 
                        the sports channel before anyone even 
                        has a chance to see--

                                 PATTI (O.S.)
                        --That’s enough!

           REVEAL Patti in the doorway, protective. A beat of silence...

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        You need to leave my house now.

           A beat, then Don stands, empties coins onto the table for the 
           kids. He walks past Dale,  exits. A beat, then, softly...

                                 DALE
                        He’s right. I haven’t proven anything.

                                 PATTI
                        Dale...

                                 DALE
                        All I’ve done is hurt him... he’s 
                        embarrassed because of me... he 
                        embarrassed of me.

           He drops the folder he just got from Peters in the garbage, 
           exits. Patti watches him go, heart breaking for her husband.

           INT. DALE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           4:30 AM. Alarm sounds. Dale does the same uninspired routine 
           from the top of the film: shower, coffee, etc...

           INT./EXT. DALE’S CAR - EARLY MORNING, STILL DARK

           Dale drives to work. At the stop sign, the same cop at the 
           corner but Dale comes to a complete stop, drives on - the 
           fight has been taken out of Dale Julin. 

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dale tosses all of his research into boxes... he’s done.

           INT. DALE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Christmas. Kids play with toys. Dale/Patti shove torn 
           wrapping paper into a garbage bag. Phone rings. Dale answers.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello?
           INTERCUT WITH A HESITANT TEDDY KOKINIUS AT PAY PHONE...

                                 TEDDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Dale. Hey. It’s Teddy. From the base.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah, Teddy. Of course. 

                                 TEDDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Sorry to bother you on Christmas, but 
                        I heard a rumor you were looking into 
                        some stuff on the base, stuff that 
                        may’ve made my girl sick. Wondering 
                        what you may’ve found out...

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah, well, I’m, uh, not really sure 
                        I’ll ever really crack that thing. Was 
                        never able to get anything concrete.

                                 TEDDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Oh. Ok. 

                                 ROSIE (O.S)
                        Daddy, can you put this together!

                                 TEDDY (INTO PHONE)
                        Sounds like you’re busy over there. 
                        I’ll leave you be.

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey, listen, Teddy--

           Click. But Teddy has hung up. OFF Dale, affected.

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - MORNING

           Dale finishes up another uninspiring segment...

                                 DALE
                        And remember Blackjack, the playoff 
                        picking Boxer? Well, for the 5th year 
                        in a row she accurately called the NFL 
                        Division champs based on where she 
                        sprinkles on the sports page. And to 
                        think some said her picks were “all 
                        wet.” I’m Dale Julin and we’ll K-See 
                        you tomorrow, Fresno. 

                                 PRODUCER SCOTT
                        And we’re out.

           Dale’s forces a smile/nod to the crew and is off. 
           INT. STUDIO BACK HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale walks down the hall. As Wayne passes, head in folder.

                                 WAYNE
                        Great job Dale. You’re more focused 
                        past few weeks. Keep it up.

           Wayne doesn’t even slow, passes by. Dale turns into...

           INT. DALE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Dale moves to his desk. Knock at the door. Roy enters. 

                                 ROY
                        Got a second?

           Roy enters. Dale steps to him.

                                 DALE
                        What’s up?

           Roy SLAPS Dale across the face.

                                 ROY
                        That’s up bitch.

                                 DALE
                        What the hell, man.

                                 ROY
                        What’s wrong, Dale? Is Daddy a little 
                        disappointed in you? Welcome to my 
                        world, sweetheart.  

           He SLAPS Dale across the face again. 

                                 DALE
                        Cut it out!

                                 ROY
                        That’s five fingers worth of Grow Some 
                        Pubes. When I was 9 my dad asked me 
                        what football position I wanted to try 
                        out for. I told him I wanted to be 
                        cartoonist. He didn’t ask me another 
                        question for four years.

                                 DALE
                        Look, it’s complicated--

                                 ROY
                        --No, it’s simple. You start 
                        something. You finish it.
                                 DALE
                        Really? How’s that Hooked On Ebonics 
                        idea you had a few years ago?

           Roy stares back at Dale a beat, then...

                                 ROY
                        It be comin’ along.

                                 DALE
                        We’re done.

           Dale moves to leave the room but Roy steps in front of him.

                                 ROY
                        No. This isn’t fair. You think I was 
                        happy sitting at home getting high all 
                        night, watching porn and Alf reruns? 
                        Only a lot of the time. But then you 
                        asked me to be part of something 
                        important - for the first time someone 
                        asked for my help - someone thought I 
                        was more than a camera monkey. I 
                        haven’t gotten stoned in months 
                        because I wanted to do a good job for 
                        you. And for myself. You can’t just 
                        take it away from me now...
                             (throws a file at Dale)
                        Especially since I’ve been doin’ all 
                        the damn work lately.

                                 DALE
                        What the hell’s this?

                                 ROY
                        Patti was worried about you. Came to 
                        see me. Man, such a great ass--

                                 DALE
                        She gave you the file I got from Peters?

                                 ROY
                        Tracked down everyone I could. Look at 
                        this... 
                             (points to his file notes)
                        Gavin McCreary. Died. Lung Cancer. 
                        Lawrence Sands. Died. Abdominal 
                        Cancer. Norman Clay - the base Fire 
                        Chief at the time - died at 44 of 
                        cancer - symptoms started right after 
                        the crash. His daughter sent me a copy 
                        of his death certificate. 

           Dale picks up the Death Certificate, reads it...

                        If you’re clueless enough, people let 
                        their guard down ‘cause they think 
                        you’re an idiot. Learned from watching 
                        you... so, is that our smoking gun?

                                 DALE
                             (still scanning doc)
                        Close. Government will say he must’ve 
                        been exposed to radiation someplace 
                        else. We still need someone to confirm 
                        what was on that plane.

                                 ROY
                        We? That mean you’re putting your big 
                        boy pants back on, Baby Pants?

                                 DALE
                        Doesn’t even make sense.

                                 ROY
                        Totally does. We can debate it on the 
                        way to Mr. Connors house.

                        One of these guys is still alive?

                                 ROY
                        Yup. Joe Conners, lives close... but 
                        he wouldn’t talk to me. 

                                 DALE
                        Why not?

           EXT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE BACKYARD (NOT ON BASE) - DAY

           JOE CONNORS (70’s, tough) in warm jacket/gloves pries metal 
           from a rusted HARVESTER with a crowbar. Dale/Roy approach.

                                 DALE
                        Mr. Connors?

           Joe turns to them, still holds the crowbar. 

                                 JOE
                        Yeah?

                                 DALE
                        Name’s Dale Julin. Wondering if I 
                        could have a minute of your time?

                                 JOE
                        What for?
                                 DALE
                        Was hoping to ask you a bit about your 
                        wartime service--

                                 JOE
                             (steps to them, ornry)
                        You’re the fella, called last week.

                                 ROY
                        No sir, that was me.

                                 JOE
                        Told ya I didn’t have nothing to say. 
                        Now you get the hell off my land 
                        before I take my crowbar to you--

                                 DALE
                        We know men you served with died of 
                        cancer from radiation exposure--

                            JOE
           --I said get offa my land--
                                                          DALE
                                              --Please, you were there. We 
                                              just want to know what was on 
                                              that plane--

           As Joe moves hard at Dale, raising the crowbar to strike--

                                 JOE
                        God dammit, I didn’t ask for any of 
                        this--

                        Joseph!

           Joe stops in his tracks. REVEAL behind him, on the back 
           steps, his wife, MARIE (70’s). The men all freeze...

                                 MARIE
                        It’s been more than 40 years. What can 
                        they do to you now?

           A beat, off Dale looking at a torn Joe Connors. TIME CUT TO:

           INT. WEATHERED FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Marie puts coffee mugs on the table between Joe (in an easy 
           chair) and Dale (on sofa). Uncomfortable silence as Roy 
           enters with his camera and tripod. Joe sees this and...

                                 JOE
                        No.

           Dale shakes his head at Roy. Roy puts the camera down.
                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        No film. I’ll tell you what happened. 
                        If anyone asks, I’ll deny it all.

                                 DALE
                        Ok. 

           Joe looks to Marie who nods, puts her hand on his forearm. 
           After a long/painful beat, he begins to talk, reliving it...

                                 JOE
                        Those damn Suisun Winds, fanned the 
                        hell outta the flames that night. I’d 
                        been a firefighter 25 years, never 
                        seen a blaze whip up like that. We 
                        knew there were bombs on board, so we 
                        kept our distance, but after about 15 
                        minutes or so... 

           He trials off, eyes moist...

                                 DALE
                        After 15 minutes or so, what?

           Joe rolls up his sleeves, shows brutal scars up both arms.

                                 JOE
                        I was one of the lucky ones. Water 
                        truck shielded me. Crawled outta a 
                        crater, like an ant outta a fruit bowl 
                        -- hole hadda be 6’ deep, 30 yards 
                        wide -- know it sounds crazy, 
                        surviving an atomic blast...

           Dale and Roy share a look - holy shit.

                                 DALE
                        What do you mean an “atomic blast”?

                        We’re here to figure out what 
                        happened. I know a conventional bomb 
                        couldn’t have done that damage, but an 
                        atomic weapon would’ve taken out 
                        several miles--

                        I break my ankle. Sent me to the 
                        hospital in San Francisco; orderlies 
                        there said they heard the explosion.

                        Did anyone from the Air Force ever

                                 JOE
                        Didn’t have to. They sent docs to see 
                        us for weeks with those machines with 
                        them badges to check for radiation. 
                        Precautionary Measure’s the line they 
                        fed us. Said we’d lose our jobs, go to 
                        jail if we told anyone. State Secrets 
                        Act. So we kept our mouths shut. Now 
                        they’re just waiting for the last of 
                        us to die, so the truth dies with us.

                        Force -- and I won out. That always 
                        made me feel special. Being Don 
                        Julin’s son always made me feel 
                        special. So thanks for everything Dad. 
                        And Happy 75th Birthday.

           OFF Don watching the video, taking it in...

           INT. ROY’S VAN - NIGHT

           Roy drops Dale off in the otherwise empty K-SEE parking lot. 
           As they finish off fast food, they debate--

                                 ROY
                        If we don’t have enough now, then 
                        we’ll never have it. Size of the 
                        blast, the cancer, the testing for 
                        radiation--

                                 DALE
                        --Can all be explained away. And Joe 
                        Conner won’t go public.

                                 ROY
                        But everything he told us--

                                 DALE
                        We promised we wouldn’t repeat. We 
                        can’t run this story ‘til we--

                       DALE (CONT’D)
           Find the smoking gun.
                                                           ROY
                                                (so tired of saying it)
                                              Find the smoking gun.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Alright. See you tomorrow.

           Dale exits the van, turns back to Roy...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Smartest thing I did with this 
                        story was bring you on board. You’re 
                        more than a great camera monkey... 
                        you’re a great best friend.

           Roy doesn’t know what to say. He smiles slightly, nods.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        See you tomorrow.
           Roy drives off. Dale moves to his car, then -- BAM! He’s 
           clocked from behind by an unseen assailant. He falls to the 
           ground, is instantly kicked in the stomach many times. Dale 
           curls up. The attack is fast, efficient. It ends. Dale coughs 
           for breath. In front of him are two shoes, all he can see...

                                 VOICE (FROM ABOVE DALE)
                        If you weren’t Don Julin’s son, this 
                        would be worse. Keep it up, it will be 
                        worse.

           Dale’s POV as the shoes walk off. His eyes close as we FADE 
           TO DARKNESS.

           INT. DALE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Patti asleep. Dale enters quietly. Steps on a kid’s toy - 
           electronic lights and sounds go off. Patti stirs...

                                 PATTI
                        Baby?

                                 DALE
                        Go back to sleep. I’ll be in in a 
                        minute.

           He enters the bathroom, closes the door, gingerly lifts his 
           shirt to reveal large bruises. 

                                 PATTI (THROUGH THE DOOR)
                        Are you mad at me for going to Roy?

                                 DALE
                        No.

                                 PATTI
                        I just know how important this is to 
                        you. Didn’t want you to give up unless 
                        it was for a really good reason.

           Dale looks at himself in the mirror - is getting your life 
           threatened a good enough reason?

           INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wayne watches a news reel. Dale enters.

                                 DALE
                        Wanted to see me?

           Wayne pauses the reel. He seems serious, subdued.

                                 WAYNE
                        Yeah. Why don’t you have a seat, Dale.
           Dale sits - clearly thrown by Wayne’s demeanor.

                                 DALE
                        What’s goin’ on?

                                 WAYNE
                        Got a call from Travis Air Force Base.

                                 DALE
                        Lieutenant Tate.

                                 WAYNE
                        That would be the irate gentleman I 
                        spoke to... I told you Dale... I told 
                        you to just be happy doing your job... 
                        And now you don’t have a job.

           Wayne takes no pleasure in this. 

                                 DALE
                        They’re making you fire me?

                                 WAYNE
                        Federal Government? The FCC? Kinda 
                        important around here.
                             (runs hand through hair, 
                              frustrated)
                        Sneaking around the base. Throwing out 
                        accusations. You’ve got three kids. 
                        What the hell were you thinking? 

                                 DALE
                        That I’m right. 

                                 WAYNE
                             (angry now)
                        Great. Put that fourth on your list 
                        behind Unemployed, Poor and Unhireable. 
                        Better yet, put it on your tombstone. 
                        Here lies Dale: He was Right. 

                                 DALE
                             (just as pissed)
                        They have been hiding this thing for 
                        decades--

                                 WAYNE
                        --Give it a god-damn rest, Silkwood!  
                        There’s no cover-up and you’re neither 
                        Woodward nor Bernstein--

                                 DALE
                        --If I’m fired, I don’t have to listen 
                        any more--

           Dale slowly gets up out of the chair, winces--
                                 WAYNE
                        Why start now?
                             (re: Dale’s slow movement)
                        --what the hell’s wrong with you?

           Dale turns, raises his shirt to show his bruises.

                                 DALE
                             (fuck off)
                        It’s nothing. Just part of their non-
                        cover up. 

           Dale turns to go. Wayne stops him, suddenly concerned.

                                 WAYNE
                        Hold on. That’s from you poking around?

                                 DALE
                        Don’t tell anyone. I don’t want Patti 
                        finding out.

           Wayne takes this in, grasps that Dale might really be right.

                                 WAYNE
                        Ok. As far as the affiliate’s 
                        concerned, we have no idea you’re 
                        still looking into this. But if you 
                        need some time to dig or access to the 
                        editing bays... I look the other way.

                                 DALE
                        Thought the government wanted me 
                        fired.

                                 WAYNE
                        I don’t remember those dickholes 
                        buying any ad time on my air. Now be 
                        careful, stupid.

           Dale smiles, exits. OFF Wayne, watching him go.

           INT. DALE’S DINING ROOM - DAY

           Dale pours through research, the kids watch a show. Patti 
           enters from outside with a bag of groceries and the mail...

                                 PATTI
                        Hey ladies. And gentleman. 

           She pecks Dale’s head, sits. He’s focused on the papers.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Found a store with Double Coupon 
                        Tuesdays. Cross town but now we can 
                        have vegetables... well, the kids can 
                        have vegetables. How’d the show go?
                                 DALE
                             (engrossed in his work)
                        Covered the Central Valley hot-air 
                        balloon races.

                                 PATTI
                        Sounds like an uplifting story.
                             (off Dale’s look)
                        Sorry. Couldn’t help it. Any progress 
                        with Travis?

           Dale pushes the papers away, frustrated. 

                                 DALE
                        Nothing. I’m at a dead end. 

           He tosses his pen to the table, rubs his forehead...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        I’m just so damn close. I know it’s 
                        right in front of me but I just can’t 
                        grasp it. It’s like Mr. Miyagi and the 
                        fly - with the chopsticks...

                                 PATTI
                             (tries to encourage)
                        But Miyagi caught the fly.

                                 DALE
                        Ralph Macchio caught the fly.

           Dale drops his forehead to the table, totally spent...

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll never be Ralph Macchio.
                             (looks up, worked up)
                        And you know who’d really hate this? 
                        More than anyone?
                             (lifts book with photo of...)
                        General Travis. West Point. 35 combat 
                        missions against the Nazi’s. 
                        Distinguished Flying Cross. He was a 
                        man of integrity and honor and he’d be 
                        lit up if he knew his name hung over 
                        the archway of a lie. What they’re 
                        doing - it dishonors him. Dishonors 
                        anyone who ever served.

           Patti cups his face, loves his passion.

                                 PATTI
                        Man of integrity and honor? Bet he 
                        woulda liked you.

           She kisses his forehead, takes the groceries to the kitchen, 
           leaving the mail behind. Dale flips through it: Collection 
           Notice; Past Due; etc. 
           He opens one from FRESNO SAVINGS & LOAN: Dear Mr. Julin; 
           Delinquent, Foreclosure Sale Scheduled, etc. 

           He’s losing his home. He takes the letter, folds it, shoves 
           it in his pocket. Fuck. He spots an envelope made out to Dale 
           -- the Post Mark is from the Travis Post Office. Dale tears 
           it open. He PALES. We don’t see what was in the envelope...

           ON PATTI in the kitchen, cleaning vegetables. Dale races past 
           without slowing down, waving the letter over his head...

                                 DALE
                        I’ll be back later!

                                 PATTI
                        Where are you going?!

                                 DALE
                        I caught the fly! I’m Danielsan!

           And he’s out the door. OFF Patti.

           INT. DALE’S OFFICE - LATER

           TIGHT ON the letter being slammed onto the desk. FLIGHT 
           MANIFEST: AUGUST 5, 1950: TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE. There are 
           alphabetized names with check marks and phone #’s/addresses 
           next to them. Dale, energized, explains to Roy...

                                 DALE
                        It’s the crew list from the flight. 
                        Four have check marks. Assume that 
                        means they’re still alive.

                                 ROY
                        Sweet Mother’s Milk. Who sent this?

                                 DALE
                        Post-marked from the base. Airman 
                        Peters strikes again.
                             (grabs Roy)
                        These guys were on the goddamn plane. 
                        With whatever weapon was in there.

           BEGIN MONTAGE: Dale/Roy calling the crew members on Speaker. 
           Via JUMP/BLEND cuts we see Dale taking notes as he talks...

                        Hi, Mr. Longo. I’m doing a piece on 
                        the 1950 crash...

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Do you recall what kind of weapon you

                        Oh, most likely a standard Tarzon,

                        Hello?

           There is NOISE in the background - sounds like a party...

                                 DALE
                        Hi; I’m looking for Mr. Alberto Perdomo.

                                 AL
                        This is Al? Who’s this?

                                 DALE
                        This is Dale Julin-- 

                                 AL
                        --Who? Speak up a bit--

                                 DALE
                        Dale Julin. I’m a reporter doing a 
                        piece on the 1950 Travis crash and I 
                        got your name from the manifest. I was 
                        hoping I could talk to you...
                             (beat, silence...)
                        Mr. Perdomo? You still there?

                                 AL
                        You think I’m gonna let you guys lay 
                        the blame on me again? You can take it 
                        to hell, Mr. Julin.

                                 DALE
                             (confused)
                        The crash was from mechanical failure. 
                        Why do you think I’d blame you? 
                                 AL
                        Because that’s what they did to me. 
                        They always crucify the pilot. 

           Roy mouths to Dale: The fuckin’ pilot! Roy slaps Dale’s arm, 
           motions for him to keep talking.

                                 DALE
                        Just hear me out, sir. I’m a war 
                        pilot’s son. I’m not looking to hurt 
                        you... I just wanna talk. I see you 
                        live just outside of Modesto. I can 
                        come over now... please... 

           A tense beat - they wait for an answer. Then an unsure...

                                 AL
                        Ok... but dress nice... 

           Al hangs up. Roy turns to Dale. 

                                 ROY
                        Did I hear Mariachi music?

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. AL PERDOMO’S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           A MARIACHI BAND PLAYS. It’s a Quinceanera for Al’s 
           granddaughter. Backyard’s full of family, food, drink, 
           dancing. Lights string from the house to the fence. Festive.

           TIGHT ON: a hand plunges into a tub of ice, pulls out 3 
           beers. AL (70’s, Latin, grandfatherly) pops the tops, hands a 
           beer to Dale (in suit) and Roy (in plaid sports coat).

                                 AL
                        Let’s sit away from the music.

           Al walks with a limp; Dale and Roy follow. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        This hitch in my giddyup, courtesy of 
                        the crash. 12 surgeries. I’m lucky. 
                        Most of the others weren’t. 

                                 DALE
                        You were close with your crew?

           As they sit at a picnic table Roy notices, down at the other 
           end, a HEFTY GIRL in her 20’s - she smiles, eyeballs Roy up 
           and down. He nods back with an uneasy smile.

                                 AL
                             (difficult for him)
                        Like brothers. 
                                 DALE
                        I spoke with some of them today. Not 
                        one of them blamed you for the crash. 

                                 AL
                        Tried like hell to keep that bird 
                        right -- couldn’t get her straight.

                                 DALE
                        The fact that anyone survived that 
                        crash is a testament to your ability 
                        as a pilot.

                                 AL
                        Not according to the guys they sent. 

                                 ROY
                        What guys?

                                 AL
                             (still hurts years later)
                        I’m in the hospital, banged to hell, 
                        and they come there to tell me I 
                        gooned up the ride... I did my job 
                        that day. I avoided every building on 
                        that base--

           Al, emotional, catches himself. The band begins playing a 
           slow, soulful, latino version of Billie Jean. It’s sexy, 
           romantic and melancholy all at once. Al realizes...

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        This was a mistake.
                             (as he stands)
                        Sorry you came all this way.

           Dale can’t believe it’s over. Roy, desperate, buying time, 
           motions to Hefty Girl at the end of the table.

                                 ROY
                        Who’s, uh, that pretty young lady over 
                        yonder?

                                 AL
                        That’s my grand-niece, Veedee.

                                 ROY
                        I don’t mean to be too forward, but 
                        you think I could ask her to dance?

                                 AL
                        You want to dance with Veedee?

                                 ROY
                             (no he doesn’t)
                        Boy howdy I do.
           Confused, Al motions “go ahead.” Dale watches in awe as Roy 
           walks to Veedee, puts out his hand and she happily moves with 
           him to the dance floor. As they sway together...    

                                 DALE
                        Guess we have a few minutes.

           Al looks from Roy/Vedee to Dale, sits, drinks his beer, 
           eyeballs Dale, unsure, sizing him up...

                                 AL
                        How do I know you’re really Air Force? 
                        From Travis?

                                 DALE
                        All the houses had military green and 
                        gray furniture. Every day, at 5 pm we 
                        stopped wherever we were for the 
                        lowering of the flag. My mom used that 
                        heavy blue starch the base sold that 
                        made my pants so stiff I could hardly 
                        bend my knees. And when my Dad was 
                        gone running missions I’d pray so hard 
                        at Chapel One that those knees would 
                        wear out ... So... what men were sent 
                        to see you, Mr. Perdomo? 

           Al takes in Dale... believes he can trust him... then...

                                 AL
                        Government boys. Told me I nosed up 
                        too hard on take-off, angled the 
                        landing gear retraction. Said they 
                        didn’t want me getting the brig for 
                        Reckless Homicide so they promised to 
                        blame it on prop failure and such so 
                        long I kept my mouth shut if anyone 
                        asked me anything about the crash.   

                                 DALE
                        They lied. That crash was mechanical 
                        failure.

                                 AL
                             (still not certain of that)
                        I know that.

                                 DALE
                        Listen to me. It was not your fault. 
                        They didn’t want anyone talking about 
                        the crash because they loaded 
                        something a lot more dangerous than a 
                        standard bomb on that plane. Something 
                        that gave off radiation and made 
                        people sick. I need to know what that 
                        something was.
                             (reads Al’s face, realizes)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                        You didn’t know about the bomb, did 
                        you?

                                 AL
                             (stunned, dazed...)
                        I was just the pilot. They told me to 
                        fly to Guam, those were my orders. You 
                        sure? About all this you’re tellin’ me?

           Dale nods reassurance. Al’s eyes grow wet...

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve spent my whole life wondering... 
                        if I’d done something... thank you.

                                 DALE
                        Thank you for your service... I’ll let 
                        myself out. 

           As Dale stands to go...

                                 AL
                        You should see if you can find Lou 
                        Giordano. He’d definitely know what we 
                        were carrying. 

           Dale stops.

                                 DALE
                        Who’s Lou Giordano?

                                 AL
                        The Bomb Commander - he’s the one who 
                        loads the damn thing. You’ve got the 
                        manifest, right? 

           Confused, Dale takes the manifest from his pocket, shows it 
           to Al who runs his finger down the LIST OF LAST NAMES...

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Last I heard, Lou was still kickin’. 
                        Right here. His name should be here -
                        between Ferro and Gustavson...

           Dale studies the space between the two names. 

                                 DALE
                        I think his name was there.

           Dale touches his finger to his tongue and rubs a small black 
           smudge on the paper... it doesn’t come off - it’s from a 
           white strip being put over a name before copying a document.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                             (realizing)
                        They redacted his name.
           ON Roy/Veedee dancing, their heads on each other’s shoulders. 
           Roy is actually diggin’ it. But Dale pulls him by the arm.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        We gotta go.

                                 ROY
                        In the middle of something here, boss.

                                 DALE
                        We found him!

                                 ROY
                        Who?

                                 DALE
                        The smoking gun.

           As Dale moves off, Roy turns to Veedee...

                                 ROY
                        I just would been trouble, baby.

           ... and he hurries after Dale.

           INT. K-SEE STUDIO STAGE - DAY

           Dale sits on the Host Desk, the whole team around him: 
           Stephanie (weather girl), Burt (traffic), Dr. Katharti 
           (Indian medical correspondent) and Jay (black sports guy). 
           Roy stands next to the Host Desk.

                        And that’s what I’ve been doing these

                             (off Dale’s nod)
                        My goodness.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You said you needed our help?

                                 DALE
                        Right. This whole thing turns on 
                        finding Lou Giordano--
                                 JAY
                        Pump the brakes there, partner.
                             (to Wayne, pissed)
                        How come he can run around doin’ this 
                        story when I been askin’ for years to 
                        look into McGwire and Canseco--

                                 WAYNE
                        --For the last time, they’re baseball 
                        players. Football players do 
                        steroids... Canseco lifts weights. 
                             (to Dale)
                        Okay, wrap it up...

                                 DALE
                        Giordano. No idea where he lives or if 
                        he’s even alive. But if he is, he 
                        knows what he loaded into that B-29. 
                        Roy and I called every NBC affiliate 
                        in the country and asked them to send 
                        copies of their phone books-- some 
                        have 2 or 3 versions of the White 
                        Pages, and I asked for back issues in 
                        case he was listed a few years ago but 
                        isn’t any more... so we’re expecting 
                        upwards of 900 volumes over the next 
                        few weeks--

                                 JAY
                        --how you get them to do that?

                                 DALE
                        Said we were doing a story on 
                        telemarketers.

                                 ROY
                        My boy’s wicked good at makin’ shit up.

                                 WAYNE
                        So, here’s the deal. 1) Upstairs can’t 
                        know about this; 2) Upstairs can’t 
                        know about this; and 3)... Let’s help 
                        Dale find this guy.

           BEGIN MONTAGE... over score we see...

           - DALE’S HOME (NIGHT): Dale/Patti at the dining room table, 
           eat take-out, surrounded by phone books, searching...

           - K-SEE STUDIOS (DAY): Stephanie in Make-Up, scans a phone 
           book, no Giordano. She marks the cover with an black X.

           - Dr. Katharti cuts open a bunch of boxes, hands phone books 
           out to Burt and Wayne...

           - Roy, with ALF on the TV, pours through stacks of phone 
           books. Buds McKenzie is next to him but it’s a VASE now.
           - Jay, in his office, full of phone books, his eyes land on a 
           page... and go W-I-D-E... 

                                 JAY
                        Motha-fucka, I got you!

           He springs from his chair and races down the hall with the 
           phone book under his arm like a football...

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I got him! I got the Italian 
                        sonuvabitch!

           INT. DALE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone’s cramped inside. Dale sits at his desk, staring at 
           the phone book page, nervous...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You really think it’s him?

                                 JAY
                        Even has the same middle initial. I’m 
                        telling you, it’s the guy.

                                 DALE
                             (looks at the cover)
                        Covers Cocoa Beach. Lotta vets retire 
                        there ‘cause it’s near Patrick Air 
                        Force Base.

                                 BURT
                        So call him.

                                 DALE
                        This book’s 2 years old. How do I know 
                        he’s not dead?

                                 DR. KATHARTI
                        Medically speaking, if he answers the 
                        phone, he’s not dead.

           Dale hesitates.

                                 ROY
                        Maybe we should let Dale make this 
                        call alone. 

           Everyone filters out; as Roy closes the door behind him...

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Good luck, pal.

           Dale nods. Exhales. Dials. The phone rings. A man answers.
                                 VOICE (OVER SPEAKER)
                        Hello?

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yessir. My name is Dale Julin. I’m 
                        hoping to speak to a Mr. Louis 
                        Giordano.

                                 VOICE (OVER SPEAKER)
                        This is Lou. 

           SLOWLY PUSH IN ON Dale as he takes it that he’s talking to 
           the man with THE ANSWER.

                                 GIORDANO (OVER SPEAKER)
                        How can I help ya, Dale?

           Dale hesitates, makes the sign of the cross, then...

                                 DALE (INTO PHONE)
                             (please God let this work)
                        Well... sir... I’m a reporter for K-
                        SEE in Fresno, California and I’d like 
                        to talk to you a bit about the Travis 
                        Base Crash in 1950. Specifically, as 
                        the bomb commander, I’m looking for 
                        information about the exact kind of 
                        weaponry that was on that flight. Do 
                        you think you could help me with that, 
                        Mr. Giordano?

           Long beat of tense silence. Dale sweats it out.  Then...

                                 GIORDANO
                        I’ve been waiting 44 years for this 
                        call... Have you ever been to Florida, 
                        Dale?

           OFF Dale - stunned but thrilled. CUT TO:

           INT. GARY GABRIELLE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Gary stands in front of a mirror, practicing/enunciating...

                                 GARY
                        The mastermind of the World Trade 
                        Center bombing has been identified by 
                        the FBI as Ramzi Yousef ... Rrrrr-amzi 
                        Yousef ... 

           Dale barges in, winded. 

                                 DALE
                        I need you to cover for me for 
                        tomorrow morning. 
                                 GARY
                        The Sunshine Show? Don’t think so, papi.

                                 DALE
                        C’mon, man. I have to interview 
                        someone for a story. Biggest story of 
                        my life. Wayne asked for you to cover. 

                                 GARY
                        Wayne asked?

                                 DALE
                             (lying)
                        He said the only thing better than 
                        Gary Gabrielle once a day is Gary 
                        Gabrielle twice a day.

           OFF Gary absorbing the compliment -- it worked... CUT TO:

           INT. DALE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Patti watches Dale pack furiously as Roy sits cross-legged on 
           the floor, coloring with Rosie - each has their own book.

                                 DALE
                        Where are my black pants? 

                                 PATTI
                        The nice ones or the ones from the 
                        mall?

                                 DALE
                        The nice ones. I’m not doing the 
                        interview of my life in mall pants. I 
                        can’t find the nice pants anywhere.

                                 PATTI
                        For the love of God...

           As Patti bends over to open the bottom drawer, Roy’s eyes 
           lock in on her ass, mesmerized. Dale notices.

                                 DALE
                        Don’t even.

           Roy raises an eyebrow, gives Dale a thumbs-up. Patti turns, 
           throws black pants to Dale who catches them.

                                 PATTI
                        Nice black pants.

                                 DALE
                        We’re barely gonna make the red-eye. 

                                 ROY
                             (holds up grocery bag)
                        Don’t blame me. I’m packed.
                                 PATTI
                        Assuming the station is picking up the 
                        air fare?

           Dale spins from his bag to Patti as he opens a draw, 
           frantically grabs some ties to compare in the mirror... 

                                 DALE
                             (sheepish)
                        Know what happens when you assume.

                                 PATTI
                        A last minute cross-country flight? We 
                        can’t swing that...

                                 DALE
                        Correct. But our credit card company 
                        doesn’t know that yet. 

                                 PATTI
                        You charged it?

                                 ROY
                        Both of ‘em.

           Patti turns to Roy who looks up from his coloring and waves.

                                 PATTI
                        Seriously?

                                 DALE
                        I need him there. We can’t have 
                        another Mr. Conners situation. We have 
                        to get this on film. 
                             (leans in to her, sotto) 
                        And Roy doesn’t even have a credit 
                        card. You should see how he lives.

                                 ROY
                        Like an animal. 
                             (off Rosie’s giggle)
                        What are you laughing at? ... your 
                        coloring sucks. All over the place.

           Patti pulls Dale into toward their bathroom.

                                 PATTI
                        A word.

           INT. DALE’S BEDROOM BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Patti closes the door.

                                 PATTI
                        I know this is it. Bottom of the 
                        ninth. Overtime. Hail Mary. All that 
                        shit. But I got a call from the bank-- 
           Dale’s expression falls.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        When were you going to tell me?

                                 DALE
                        I was hoping I wouldn’t have to.

                                 PATTI
                             (softly)
                        You didn’t think I’d notice being 
                        thrown out of my own house?

           Dale rubs his eyes - this has all been so hard.

                                 DALE
                             (looks at her, ashamed)
                        I just thought - I hoped maybe if I 
                        broke this story, things would turn 
                        around or something. Maybe more work 
                        would come of it, or I’d get to anchor 
                        - a bit more money... I don’t know... 
                        Thought maybe I’d be able to take you 
                        out for Sizzler one night... 
                             (beat then...)
                        It’s just -- people got sick, people 
                        died -- I couldn’t just walk away from 
                        it... Foreclosure - Jesus. Never 
                        thought I’d become that guy. 

           A beat. Patti takes him in. Heart breaks for him.

                                 PATTI
                        Well guess what? You are.

           Dale looks up at her...

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        You are that guy. The guy who has the 
                        balls to take a chance. Not just for 
                        himself. For other people. 

           Dale brightens.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        So go to Florida. Get your smoking 
                        gun. And when Mr. Giordano tells you 
                        about the nuclear weapon, it’ll all be 
                        worth it.

                                 DALE
                             (hesitant)
                        Yeah. Well. He wouldn’t really confirm 
                        that over the phone. Said he wanted to 
                        look me in the eye when we talked.
                                 PATTI
                             (incredulous)
                        You’re doing all this and you don’t 
                        even know what he’s going to say?

           Beat, then...

                                 DALE
                        Kinda.

                                 PATTI
                             (I just might kill you)
                        You should go now. 

                                 DALE
                        Okay. Best wife ever.

           He quickly pecks her cheek and races out.

           EXT. FLORIDA AIRPORT/SKY - MORNING

           A 747 touches down at Jacksonville International Airport.

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Dale hustles out of the airport, throws change on a news 
           stand, grabs a LOCAL PAPER. Roy is on his heels...

                                 ROY
                        We can’t just show and ask for their 
                        equipment...

                                 DALE
                        Over there.

           Dale hustles toward the rental cars as he quickly flips 
           through the paper. Roy is still harping...

                                 ROY
                        Wayne said no trail back to him. So 
                        how the hell are we gonna get WTLV to 
                        loan us five figures worth or cameras 
                        and lights?

           Dale’s eyes land on something in the paper. He stops, spins 
           it to face Roy... it’s a news story with a PHOTO of MODERN 
           DAY NATIVE AMERICANS DANCING AROUND A CEREMONIAL CAMPFIRE.

                                 DALE
                        With the help of these guys.

                                 VOICE (PRELAP)
                        The Timucuan Indians?
           INT. WTLV OFFICES - LATER

           Dale and Roy sit across from WTLV STATION MANAGER...

                                 WTLV MANAGER
                        Why the hell does the Fresno affiliate 
                        care about them?

                                 DALE
                        Well, they have a sister tribe in the 
                        Central Valley. 
                             (pulling it from his ass)
                        The Un-too-choc-tow. Untoochoctow.

                                 ROY
                        It’s a tongue twister. Un-choc-two... 
                        I can’t say it...

                                 DALE
                        We want to do a piece for Native 
                        American History Month.

                                 WTLV MANAGER
                        That’s November.

           Beat, then...

                                 ROY
                        We’re late... 

                                 DALE
                        Look, we couldn’t bring all our stuff 
                        on the plane... I promise to have the 
                        equipment back by end of day...

                                 WTLV MANAGER
                        Ok. But, you break it, you buy it.

           QUICK CUTS: Equipment loaded into the rental car trunk. Truck 
           slammed. Ignition turned. The car flies down the interstate.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - SAME TIME

           Dale drives. Quiet, then Roy becomes reflective...

                                 ROY
                        This is it, huh? All comes down to 
                        this. 

           Dale registers this fact... 

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        All the time. The work. The cost.  

           Dale begins to pale...
                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        Everyone startin’ to think you might have 
                        something here. Not to mention the 
                        foreclosure - sorry, I was listening...

           Dale now looks sick...

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        If this guy doesn’t come through -- 
                        might as well baste us, we are cooked.

                                 DALE
                        Take the wheel.

           Roy GRABS the wheel as Dale VOMITS out the window.

           EXT. ENCLOSED BACK PORCH - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Camera/lights being set. A chair being placed. An 
           older man’s forearm with a USAF tattoo seeping a tea bag. 

                                 DALE
                             (anxious)
                        Okay. Ready to begin?

           REVEAL Lou Giordano (79). Cracked-leather tough, kind eyes.

                                 GIORDANO
                        If you’re ready, I’m ready.

           Roy rolls film. Dale looks to Roy - a moment between them; 
           all they’ve been through comes to this. Roy nods, Dale can 
           begin. Dale turns to Mr. Giordano, deep exhale...

                                 DALE
                        Mr. Giordano. On August 5, 1950, a B-
                        29 bomber crashed at then Fairfield-
                        Suisun Air Force Base. A weapon on-
                        board detonated. Was it a conventional 
                        weapon or was it something else?

                                 GIORDANO
                        No foreplay? Just gonna stick in it 
                        dry, huh?

                                 DALE
                        Thought it best to get to the matter 
                        at hand. 

                                 GIORDANO
                        Man after my own heart.

           Giordano deliberately steeps the tea, then sips it. He’s 
           pushing 80, so there’s no rush. Dale watches. Tense. Seems 
           like an eternity. He puts the cup down, looks at Dale, then:
                                 GIORDANO (CONT’D)
                        There was an atomic bomb on that 
                        aircraft.

           ON Dale taking this in... he finally has the answer! Roy’s 
           hand grips the camera tighter; he swallows and pushes in.

                                 DALE
                             (voice almost shaking, but 
                              still professional)
                        And how do you know this?

                                 GIORDANO
                        I was the bomb commander. I was the 
                        one who put it on that plane. 

           Dale can’t help but audibly exhale relief.

                                 DALE
                        Can you please elaborate? Because 
                        wouldn’t an atomic weapon have caused 
                        devastation similar to what happened 
                        in Japan in World War II?

                                 GIORDANO
                        If it had a plutonium capsule in it - 
                        hell, woulda changed the map of 
                        California. But the capsule was on 
                        another plane. The B-29 that went 
                        groundhog that night - it was carrying 
                        the bomb’s tamper - the casing for the 
                        nuclear core; made out of Uranium 238. 

                                 DALE
                        How much?

                                 GIORDANO
                        Hundreds of pounds. And the shell had 
                        thousands of pound of TNT. When it 
                        went up... Pssssshuuuu.... all that 
                        Uranium went up with it... 

           Dale takes in the magnitude of what he’s hearing. Then...

                                 DALE
                        Mr. Giordano, we’ve learned that other 
                        veterans were threatened not to talk 
                        about the crash. Why are you speaking 
                        up today, after all this time?

           TIGHT ON Giordano, repeating what he said earlier...

                                 GIORDANO
                             (with pained guilt)
                        I was the bomb commander. I was the 
                        one who put it on that plane.

           PULL BACK to REVEAL we are watching Giordano ON TAPE in...
           INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - DAY

           ENTIRE K-SEE staff watches Dale’s fully produced story. As 
           Dale “signs off” on the story, Stephanie whispers to Roy...

                                 STEPHANIE
                        You worked with him on the entire 
                        piece?

                                 ROY
                        Um... yeah.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Wow. That’s really impressive.

           Roy swallows hard. Dale stops the tape.

                                 DALE
                        That’s it. That’s the story.

           A beat of silence, then...

                                 DR. KATHARTI 
                        Holy fucking shit.

           Wayne springs into full carnival barker mode; he’s great at it.

                                 WAYNE
                        Ok. We’re gonna run non-stop 48 hour 
                        promos on this thing. Call it THE 
                        ATOMIC BOMBSHELL. Then we run it prime-
                        time. Top story. The whole damn thing.

                                 PRODUCER SCOTT
                        It’s 30 minutes long.

                                 WAYNE
                        Don’t give a fuck. Anyone have a 
                        problem trimming their segments?

           The team shakes their heads, they’re happy to do it.

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Dale, this is... I don’t know what to 
                        say. I’ll kiss your ass later.

           Dale is just so damn happy ... and excited ...

                                 WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        But for now you need to bunker up with 
                        Gary and prep him on everything. Gary, 
                        you gotta know this stuff backwards 
                        and forwards before goin’ live.

                                 ROY
                        What do mean before he goes live?
                                 WAYNE
                             (doesn’t get it)
                        He’s our news anchor. Gary will 
                        present it in studio and we’ll tape 
                        some transitional stuff to splice in 
                        over Dale’s appearances in the piece--

                                 DALE
                        --I killed myself for this thing. I 
                        turned down paying work to do this -- 
                        I’m getting thrown out of my house--

                                 WAYNE
                        You’ll get credit for the reporting--

                                 DALE
                        --It’ll be Gary on air. It’ll be Gary 
                        everyone remembers.

                                 GARY
                        Wayne, it’s Dale’s story. I don’t 
                        wanna do this.

                                 WAYNE
                        Thank God I’m not in the “What Gary 
                        Wants” business. 
                             (off everyone’s disgust)
                        Guys. Even if I thought it was a good 
                        idea for Dale to run with this story - 
                        you think upstairs is going to let the 
                        morning show Time & Temperature guy go 
                        prime time? I’m sorry. Just how it is.

           Wayne grabs the tape. As he walks out, passing Roy...

                                 ROY
                             (quietly)
                        Eat a dick, Wayne.

                                 WAYNE
                        Fuck you.

           Everyone turns to Dale, who is crushed. A beat, then he walks 
           out, dejected. They can’t do anything but watch him go.

           EXT. DALE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dale sits on the stoop, drinking a beer. Patti exits, sits 
           next to him. She has a beer too. Dale just stares off.

                                 PATTI
                        Remember in Albany, you saw that guy 
                        steal a car radio, and you chased him 
                        even though he was twice your size and 
                        three times as fast... I’m even 
                        prouder of you now.
                                 DALE
                             (I’m a loser)
                        I slipped on ice and broke my arm. He 
                        got away. Just once I’d like to avoid 
                        the ice.

           HONK! HONK! A CAR races toward them, down the cul de sac, 
           lights flashing, skids to a stop in front of the house. Jay 
           races out, full of energy...

                                 JAY
                        Get your drink on later, DJ. We gotta go.

                                 DALE
                        Jay? It’s late. I have neighbors--

                                 JAY
                        --Upstairs won’t let you carry the 
                        ball ‘cause they don’t think you can 
                        do the job. So we’re just gonna show 
                        ‘em your reel, baby.
                             (notices beautiful Patti)
                        This your wife? Yo, she’s fine...

                                 DALE
                        My reel is just morning show schtick. 

                                 JAY
                        Not the reel we’re gonna make.

           INT. STUDIO - LATER

           Dale follows Jay in to find the entire gang (except Wayne) 
           setting up lights, cameras, etc. Gary (in a suit) rigs cables 
           with Stephanie. Dr. Katharti (in civvies) puts on an apron. 

                                 ROY
                        Finally. Get him ready.

           Make-Up Lady throws Dale into a chair, begins working on him. 
           The SCORE carries us through the making of DALE’S FAKE REEL.

           - ON Gary at the Anchor Desk in his suit.

                                 GARY
                        We now take you to on-the-scene 
                        reporter Dale Julin who’s in the heart 
                        of the riots as we speak...

           CUT TO Outside. Night. Dale interviews “shop keeper” Katharti 
           (in apron/moustache). Burning garbage can in the background.

                                 DALE
                        Thank you Gary. I’m with deli owner 
                        Abeye Singh. Mr. Singh, can you tell 
                        me what happened to your store?
                                 DR. KATHARTI 
                        It was overrun. By loads of black 
                        people...

           ON Jay, who’s holding a light - What the fuck?  CUT TO:

           - Dale on STAGE, across from Stephanie, a serious one-on-one 
           interview. ON THE MONITOR her face has been “blurred-out”.

                                 DALE
                        And what kind of services did you 
                        provided the senators?

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Solo shows. Group sex. Sex with woman 
                        while they watched...

           ON Roy, mouth agape, rapt. CUT TO:

           - Outside. Night. ANGLE UP, looking at Dale in a helicopter. 
           Burt flies it. Dale shouts over the sound of the blades...

                                 DALE
                        I’ve just spotted the presidential 
                        motorcade. It’s got traffic stopped 
                        all the way down the 41. If you were 
                        planning on getting home for dinner, 
                        change your order to bacon and eggs.
                             (looking down)
                        You got it?

           REVEAL Roy on his back in the parking lot, points the camera 
           up at Dale in a GROUNDED helicopter. Roy gives a “thumbs up”.

                                 BURT
                             (deadpan)
                        We should put the helicopter back now. 
                        This is the kind of thing that gets 
                        people fired.

           EXT. LARGE, UPSCALE HOME - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           CARTER SOLOMON (late 60’s, rich, brusque) leaves his home, 
           heads toward his luxury car. Dale pulls to a hard stop in his 
           car, hurries to Solomon, tapes in hand.

                                 DALE
                        Mr. Solomon? Mr. Solomon, sir.
                             (as Solomon turns to him)
                        I’m Dale Julin. I host the morning 
                        show for your K-SEE affiliate.

                                 SOLOMON
                        My corporation owns over 50 media 
                        concerns Mr. Julin, I don’t know 
                        everyone who works at them. Why are 
                        you in my driveway?
                                 DALE
                        To give you these.
                             (hands over the tape)
                        It’s my reel and an expose I just did 
                        that’s airing tomorrow. Your execs 
                        think a morning show host can’t be the 
                        face of the story. I think they’re 
                        wrong. 

           Solomon hands the tapes back to Dale, slides into his car...

                                 SOLOMON
                        Our news stories are handled by our 
                        investigative journalists. I’m sorry.

                                 DALE
                        I am an investigative journalist. I 
                        mean, your number’s not listed, your 
                        home isn’t listed - but I found you, 
                        didn’t I? Here I am... in your 
                        driveway... of your house that’s owned 
                        by an off-shore Cayman account...
                             (off Solomon’s look)
                        ...that I won’t tell anyone about.

           A beat, Solomon sizes him up, then puts out his hand. Dale 
           quickly hands him the tape.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Thank yo--

           But Solomon slams the door. Dale watches him drive off...

           EXT. K-SEE STUDIOS - PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY

           Dale stands alone, surrounding by sky and field, and paddle-
           balls. Whap-whap-whap-whap. Thinking. Stressing. Hoping.

           INT. K-SEE STUDIOS - SAME TIME

           REVEAL: Roy watching Dale from the window, worried for his 
           pal. A hand on Roy’s shoulder from behind - it’s Stephanie.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        How’s he doing?

                                 ROY
                        Stopped counting at a thousand..

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I hope he gets to do it. He took a 
                        shot, he should be rewarded.

           Stephanie leaves. But Roy turns, stops her with a commanding:
                                 ROY
                        Hey... Weather Girl.

           She turns back. He steps to her, all business, grabs her and 
           plants one helluva kiss right on her lips.

                                 ROY (CONT’D)
                        That’s just me, takin’ a shot.

           Then she kisses him back. The camera RACKS FOCUS to pick up 
           Wayne walking to Dale. We see them talk. Can’t hear it. Wayne 
           turns and walks back out of frame. Beat... what’s the verdict 
           - then Dale EXPLODES jubilantly into the air and begins 
           running around the parking lot like a mad man! TIME CUT TO:

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - ANCHOR DESK - NIGHT

           We’re live! Gary introduces Dale’s piece. Dale at his side. 
           CHYRON: JULY 8, 1992.

                                 GARY
                        Tonight, a K-SEE exclusive uncovers a 
                        radioactive accident that’s been 
                        hidden for over four decades - right 
                        here in the Central Valley. Our own 
                        Dale Julin brings us his story.

                                 DALE
                        Good evening. This report revolves 
                        around Travis Air Force Base, an 
                        institution that’s home to countless 
                        brave Air Force personnel, an 
                        institution that was once my home. 

           The piece begins. CUT TO people watching the News Report.

           - Patti and home with the girls  on the couch/in her lap...

                                 PATTI
                        Look. Look what Daddy did.

           - The pilot, Al Perdomo, watches Dale mention his name...

           - Second Lt. Tate burns as he watches the moment where he 
           demands the tape from Roy...

           - Dr. Lubert - the college professor Dale spoke to - watches 
           his interview about U238 and radioactivity...

           - Don watches at the bar - a packed house watches along. 

                                 AGGRAVATED PATRON
                        Blaming the Air Force for all that 
                        nonsense... Turn this shit off--
                                 DON
                             (to the bartender)
                        Don’t touch it.

           And that’s all Don has to stay - it’s staying on. OFF Don, 
           watching his son on the screen, breaking the story...

           BACK TO THE STUDIO...

                                 GARY
                        Thank you Dale for that incredible 
                        investigative work. And this just in, 
                        K-SEE just received word from Second 
                        Lt. Alonzo Tate, PR liason for Travis, 
                        stating he will hold a Press 
                        Conference in two days to refute the 
                        aforementioned report which he claims 
                        is “overstated”, “erroneous” and 
                        “irresponsible”. Do you have any 
                        response to their allegations, Dale? 

           Beat, as Dale takes in this new development... Then...

                                 DALE
                        I stand by my story.

           EXT. HANGER - TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           CHYRON: JULY 10, 1992

                                 TATE (PREPRELAP)
                        Yes, there was Uranium 238 onboard. 
                        But the existence of radioactive 
                        material was not covered-up by the Air 
                        Force at anytime...

           INT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

           Press Conference. Hanger full of press, Roy (camera rolling), 
           Wayne, others. Dale’s parents and Patti and the kids in the 
           audience. Scores of Residents from the base. It’s an EVENT.

           Alonzo Tate stands at a podium. An uneasy Airman Peters sits 
           to his right at a table. 

                                 TATE
                        --In fact, we felt, and still believe, 
                        that the risk, if any, of U238, as 
                        opposed to the much more volatile 
                        Uranium 235 - which actually makes up 
                        the core of an atomic bomb, was indeed 
                        de minimus. If the reporter in 
                        question had cared as much about 
                        research as he did ratings, his work 
                        would have bore that out.
           Dale raises his hand.

                                 TATE (CONT’D)
                        Of course, Mr. Julin. You have a 
                        question?

                                 DALE
                        Um, yes... I did do the research. 
                        According to Dr. Bruce Lubert of the 
                        Universtiy of Colorado - an expert in 
                        atomic and nuclear weaponry, U238, can 
                        become quite dangerous when exposed to 
                        high temperatures. A massive fireball 
                        kind of fits that bill...

           ANGRY RESIDENT OF THE BASE stands, points finger at Dale.

                                 ANGRY RESIDENT
                        You’re trying to turn our home into 
                        some kinda Superfund site so you can 
                        get rich prancin’ around on TV?! Why 
                        don’t you go back up to Fresno!

           Angry cheers erupt. Dale’s Dad silently takes it all in.

                                 DALE
                        I’m not trying to hurt anyone, and I’m 
                        not rich. My information was gathered 
                        by the very people who served on this 
                        base--

                                 TATE
                        Glad you brought that up, Mr. Julin. 
                        Because, with a few exceptions, the 
                        names of those parties are classified. 
                        I’d like to know how you obtained 
                        them? Because you, and whoever 
                        provided it to you, might be facing 
                        federal criminal charges. 

           Dale looks to a wide-eyed Peters. ON Wayne, to Roy...

                                 WAYNE
                        If you guys get arrested, our ratings 
                        go through the roof.

                                 DALE
                        I have sources that I refuse to reveal 
                        - I gave them my word - and anonymous 
                        sources I have yet to ascertain--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I sent him the damn crew list.

           Everyone turns to find Don Julin standing up in the crowd.
                                 DON
                        As alumni supervisor, I’ve got access 
                        to lots of old records; things that 
                        have been “stashed away” for whatever 
                        reason. 

                                 TATE
                        So you shared it with a civilian?

                                 DON
                        I’m a civilian, Alonzo. Retired before 
                        you learned to piss straight. So if I 
                        can see these papers; how the hell are 
                        they classified?  
                             (to the crowd)
                        You all know me, what Travis means to 
                        me. But when it comes to all this, you 
                        can question my son’s findings if you 
                        want... but don’t question his 
                        motives, or his character. You attack 
                        him... you attack me.

           A beat as he seems to stare in the eyes of everyone there, 
           finally locking eyes with Dale who, dumbstruck, nods thanks 
           to his father. Don sits; Velma puts her hands on his.

                                 TATE
                        Alright. Then let’s just judge his 
                        findings. You all have, under your 
                        chair, a soil report from Alliance 
                        Environmental - an independent concern 
                        whose reputation is beyond reproach. 

           RUSTLING as everyone takes out one of these reports.

                                 TATE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll see soil samples taken from the 
                        crash site just two days ago were 
                        benign. The conclusion is there’s no 
                        radiation, no toxicity, no danger. Mr. 
                        Julin, if the soil’s not contaminated, 
                        how can these decades worth of alleged 
                        ailments be blamed on the 1950 crash?

           Murmurs through the crowd as Dale flips through the report.

                                 TATE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Julin. I’m waiting?

                                 DALE
                        I haven’t had a time to fully digest 
                        what’s in here...

                                 TATE
                        I frankly don’t think you’ve had time 
                        to fully digest the ramifications of 
                        the defamatory report your affiliate 
                        aired. I’ll ask again.

                        How can people get sick from 
                        contaminants that don’t exist on the 
                        site?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Because they moved the soil.

           Dale looks up. Joe Connors (the firefighter with breast 
           cancer who refused to go public) walks down the center aisle.

                                 DALE
                        Mr. Connors?

                                 TATE
                        I’m sorry sir. Who are you exactly?

                                 JOE
                        Deputy Fire Chief Joseph Connors. 
                        Travis Air Force base - 1938 through 
                        ‘60. I was there when it happened...
                             (hard to say)
                        The day after the crash, they came 
                        with bulldozers...

           Tate’s face falls - can’t believe this is happening...

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Took off the top few feet of soil and 
                        got it out of there. I helped ‘em. And 
                        now I’m dying for it. 

                                 DALE
                        Joe. Where’d they put the soil?

                                 JOE
                        Don’t know. But I know this - those 
                        dozers never left Travis. Can only 
                        guess they spread it around the base.

           The room ERUPTS. Dale spins back to Tate.

                                 DALE
                             (over the din)
                        Lt. Tate. Lt. Tate...
                             (the room quiets, waits 
                              for Dale’s question)
                        Was the Air Force aware that the 
                        contaminated soil has been moved?

                                 TATE
                             (hesitates, stunned...)
                        It’s our position... at this time...

           He stops, at a loss of what to do/say...
                                 DALE
                             (cocky now)
                        You might as well say it. You know 
                        I’ll just find out eventually.

                                 TATE
                             (a beat, then...)
                        Yes... this press conference is concluded. 

           The room erupts again as Tate exits the podium/room. Airman 
           Peters nods respectfully at Dale who nods back. Reporters 
           share notes, residents buzz as Dale collects his things. He 
           then stops, leans against his chair and just EXHALES...

           EXT. DALE’S PARENTS HOUSE - LATER SAME DAY

           As Patti, Dale and his parents pack up the kids/the car... 

                                 DON
                        So traffic shouldn’t be so bad now.

                                 DALE
                        No. Should be ok.

                                 DON
                        Back left tire’s low. Check that. Most 
                        important part of a car is the tires.

           Dale opens the door to the car. Stops, turns...

                                 DALE
                        Thanks. For sending the crew list. It 
                        broke it all open for me.

                                 DON
                        No big deal. You were working hard on 
                        this thing - I respect that ... 
                             (looks Don in the eyes)
                        I respect the hell outta you.

           Dale is floored by the ultimate compliment Don Julin could 
           give. He’s waited his whole life to hear this. 

                                 DALE
                        Thank you, Dad.

                                 DON
                             (hard to say)
                        Just because I sometimes didn’t... 
                        understand you... doesn’t mean I 
                        didn’t... I’m very proud of you.

           He puts his hand out to shake. They shake. Then Don pulls 
           Dale in, hugs him. Dale hugs back. Patti watches, moved.
                                 DALE
                             (choked up but hiding it)
                        Okay, let’s go troops...

           They get in the minivan and drive off... TIME CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - FRONT GATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale approaches the gate. Slows down, sees something... 
           REVEAL Teddy Kokinius standing at the gate, waiting... Dale 
           stops the car, Teddy moves to the open side window...

                                 TEDDY
                        So that’s it. It’s over.

                                 DALE
                        Seems that way. They’ll have to do 
                        something about it now.

           Daisy drops her small bunny out the window. Teddy picks it 
           up, hands it back to her, gently touching her hand with his 
           finger, remembering his own daughter’s touch. Dale notices.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        You gonna be ok, Teddy?

                                 TEDDY
                        No... but I’ll be better... see you 
                        ‘round, Dale.

           Dale puts the car in drive but Teddy stops him with...

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        It had been driving me crazy since we 
                        sat in that bar - that I couldn’t 
                        place you - but then I remembered when 
                        all the shop kids accidentally burned 
                        down the trade school garage. Everyone 
                        made fun of us dummies... but you 
                        started a fund raiser, right? So we 
                        could rebuild, still graduate on time?

                                 DALE
                        Yeah. That was me.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah. I remember you now, Dale. You’re 
                        the guy who helps people.

           Teddy turns, walks off. Dale watches him go...

                                 DALE
                        Think things will really get better 
                        for him?
                                 PATTI
                        I do. I think things will change for 
                        the better for all of us.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. DALE’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING, STILL DARK

           TIGHT ON: Alarm clock flips from 4:29 AM to 4:30 AM. CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dale in shower, head down, just like the beginning of our 
           story except now the music sounds like shit because the 
           shower radio still hangs from when Dale smashed it. CUT TO:

           - KITCHEN - 4:47 AM - glassy-eyed coffee and bagel. CUT TO: 

           - QUICK CUTS - kiss, kiss, kiss - on the foreheads of Rosie, 
           Daisy, Mara Mae ... but Patti ins’t in bed... CUT TO:

           - LIVING ROOM - Dale enters to find Patti packing boxes...

                                 PATTI
                        Hey. Figured I’d get a jump on it. 
                        Moving day’s in one week.

                                 DALE
                        It’s not a bad apartment, right?

           She steps to him, optimistic, she has to be.

                                 PATTI
                        It’s adorable. The girls are excited 
                        to share a room. It’s gonna be great.

                                 DALE
                        Ok -- it’s just -- I’m sorry. I 
                        thought the story would fix things for 
                        us, I thought--

           She puts her fingers to his lips, kisses him.

                                 PATTI
                        You think too much. We’ll be fine.

           INT. DALE’S CAR - MORNING

           5:03 AM. Dale drives, scans station, stumbles across...
                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...Weeks after the Air Force admitted 
                        an atomic bomb detonated on Travis Air 
                        Force base decades ago and the 
                        fallout, no pun intended, continues. 
                        The EPA has now called for extensive 
                        testing on site’s groundwater--

           INT. NEWS SHOW SET - MORNING

           Dale hosts - his guest? A TRAINER and skateboarding bulldog, 
           streaking across the stage, pushing with his little legs.

                                 DALE
                        Wow, would ya look at that! Now lemme 
                        ask you, is he good at any other 
                        sports, like surfing?

                                 TRAINER
                        No. Of course not.

                                 DALE
                             (to camera)
                        Of course not. Because a surfing 
                        bulldog would be ridiculous. I’m Dale 
                        Julin and we’ll be back in just a 
                        doggone moment!

           Producer Scott calls “We’re Out” and Dale’s shoulders fall. 
           He’s back to doing the same old shit.

           INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Wayne and Roy approach Dale. Wayne has a MANILA ENVELOPE.

                                 WAYNE
                        Good show, big fella.

                                 DALE
                        My favorite part was when I stepped in 
                        shit.

                                 WAYNE
                        Mine too. Here, this just came in for 
                        you. You might want to read it now.

           Roy is a Cat with the Canary as Dale removes the contents.

                                 DALE (READING ALOUD)
                        Mr. Julin, it is our pleasure to 
                        inform you that you have won this 
                        year’s Peabody Award for journalistic 
                        excellence... 
                             (looks up, wide-eyed)
                        If you guys are fuckin’ with me...
                                 ROY
                             (proud grin)
                        Don’t need to. I’m fuckin’ the Weather Girl.

                                 WAYNE
                        It’s real, Dale. Now listen dummy. I 
                        got a dozen requests this morning for 
                        you for speaking gigs, real money - so 
                        get on that ‘cause I’m not your 
                        fuckin’ agent. Also, the affiliate’s 
                        gonna pimp your ass like an Atlantic 
                        City hooker so drop a few pounds 
                        ‘cause you’re goin’ up on billboards--

                                 DALE
                        --I gotta go.

           Dale sprints down the hall. Roy and Wayne watch him, happy--

                                 WAYNE
                        There ya go. Run some laps.

           INT. DALE’S OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           Dale, on the phone, frantically paces. It rings. Patti answers.

                                 PATTI (OVER PHONE)
                        Hello?

                                 DALE
                        Hey. Baby. It’s me.

                                 PATTI (OVER PHONE)
                        Dale what’s going on? You’re out of 
                        breath. 

                                 DALE
                        I ran... Everything’s fine... Great... 
                        I just wanted to ask you something...

                                 PATTI (OVER PHONE)
                        Ok...

           Dale swallows, eyes wet, everything’s gonna be okay for him, 
           his girls, and his beautiful, supportive wife.  As we PUSH IN 
           tight on our hero’s face, his journey over, a smile...

                                 DALE
                             (voice catches a bit)
                        I love you... and I thought maybe 
                        tonight... do you wanna go to Sizzler?

           HARD CUT TO BLACK... THE END.
