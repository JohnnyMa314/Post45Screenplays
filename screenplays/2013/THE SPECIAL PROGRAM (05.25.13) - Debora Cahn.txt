           INT. WASHINGTON - SECRET SERVICE COMMAND POST - MORNING 

           A cramped windowless office.  Unassuming.  Could be anywhere.  
           TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS drink coffee and watch CNN on a 
           small television.  The twin towers.  Burning. 

                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        The second plane appears to have 
                        been a commercial airliner, we do 
                        not have confirmation yet but...

                                AGENT ONE
                        Jesus Fucking Christ.  

                                AGENT TWO
                        Hand me the sugar.

           Because they're disturbed by what's on the screen but not 
           particularly agitated.  After all, it's in New York.  

           That's when a third guy, AGENT SCOTT, blows through the door 
           and rips open a metal cabinet, two more agents behind him. 

                                AGENT SCOTT
                        SECURE ANGLER.  UNIDENTIFIED 
                        INBOUND AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE A TARGET.

           He tosses them submachine guns as they tear out of the room.  

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Through a window we see those five agents RUNNING, at which 
           point it becomes clear that the cramped windowless office was 
           inside the White House.  

                                HEIDEN (V.O.)
                        We’ve got the call.  They’re just 
                        about ready to go.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT - MORNING 

           RICHARD B. CHENEY scrutinizes the image on the television.  
           SCOOTER LIBBY, CONDOLEEZA RICE and others circle his desk as 
           executive assistant DEBBIE HEIDEN enters and picks up 
           Cheney’s desk phone.

                                CHENEY
                        Who’s on?

                                HEIDEN (INTO PHONE)
                        I have the Vice President, which 
                        departments are on the conference?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    2.

                                LIBBY
                           (to an AIDE)
                        See if the President’s wheels up.

                                HEIDEN
                        State, DOD, FBI, Clarke’s in the 
                        Sit Room.

           That’s when the five Secret Service agents burst into the 
           room and push through the group.  

                                AGENT SCOTT
                        Sir, we need to move you.

           Cheney nods, and turns back to Heiden.

                                CHENEY
                        Make sure FAA and--

                                AGENT SCOTT
                        NOW!

           ...as he SLAMS his hand on the desk.  Then he and another 
           agent grab Cheney by his arms and the back off his belt.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - MORNING

                                AGENT TWO
                        EXCUSE US.  

                                AGENT ONE
                        MOVE!

           Staffers scurry out of the way.  Cheney's feet barely touch 
           the ground as the agents sprint him through the halls.  

                                AGENT SCOTT
                        There’s an unresponsive plane 
                        headed toward us.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE GATE - MORNING

           A mob of running STAFFERS and screaming GUARDS.

                                GUARD
                        RUN!  LADIES, TAKE OFF YOUR HEELS 
                        AND RUN!
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    3.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BUNKER - MORNING 

           The Presidential Emergency Operations Center.  Cheney’s at a 
           large table, with Rice, Libby, NORM MINETA.  Mineta, MIKE 
           FENZEL, STEVE HADLEY, JOSH BOLTON, a MILITARY AIDE are all on  *
           phones.  At least three conversations are happening at once.   *

                        HADLEY
                                                     FENZEL
           A helicopter just hit the 
           Pentagon.
                                          There’s been a bombing at the  *
                                          Capitol.

                         RICE
           On the building or on the 
           grounds?
                                                     MINETA
                                          It wasn’t a helicopter.  It 
                                          was a plane.  Another plane.

                                CHENEY
                        Activate the COG Plan.  Evacuate 
                        the Speaker of the House, and the 
                        President Pro Tem of the Senate.

           Rice nods and picks up a phone.

                        MINETA
           We have two more -- three 
           more planes failing to 
           respond.
                                                RICE (INTO PHONE)
                                          This is the National Security 
                                          Advisor, I’d like to activate 
                                          the Continuity of Government 
                                          Plan.

                        Make sure there’s a fighter escort 
                        on Air Force One.

           It’s bedlam.  Except for Cheney -- focused, calm.  In charge.

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - MORNING

           GEORGE W. BUSH projects a different energy.  He's fucking 
           screaming at ANDY CARD.  

                                BUSH
                        Turn the plane around!

                                CARD
                        Mr. President, we can’t go to 
                        Washington if there’s--

                                BUSH
                        Send the goddamn pilot in here!
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    4.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BUNKER - MORNING 

           Cheney’s the still point in the chaotic room.  He’s glued to 
           the two screens in front of him -- a choppy image of RICHARD 
           CLARKE in the Situation Room, and CNN.  

                                                     MINETA
                                          I need a response from-- no, 
                                          I need a confirmation on the-- *
                                          what are the flight numbers??
                   CLARKE (ON SCREEN)
           ...The Pentagon has been hit, 
           the White House has NOT been 
           hit.  The Capitol has NOT-- 
           I’m sorry-- what?

                                CHENEY
                        Get Clarke on a hard line. 

           The Military Aide, on a phone, whips around to Cheney.

                                MILITARY AIDE
                        We have an aircraft approaching 
                        Washington, nonresponsive.  Command 
                        is unable to reach Air Force One.  
                        Combat Air Patrol is up.  
                        Requesting permission to engage the 
                        aircraft.

           It’s less than a beat before--

                                CHENEY
                        Yes.  

                                MILITARY AIDE (INTO PHONE)
                        Permission to engage.  Yes, 
                        granted.  The Vice President.  

                        MINETA
           We’ve got another two flights 
           failing to respond.
                                            MILITARY AIDE (INTO PHONE)
                                          Yes.  We have a weapons free 
                                          command.

                                MILITARY AIDE (CONT’D)
                           (to Cheney)
                        Aircraft is 60 miles out, confirmed 
                        as hijacked.  Engage?

                                CHENEY
                        Yes.  

           There’s one more hint of hesitation from the Aide, and it’s 
           met with a hint of irritation from Cheney:

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        Take it out.

                                MILITARY AIDE (INTO PHONE)
                        Engage the aircraft.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    5.

           For the first time since we’ve entered the bunker there’s 
           SILENCE.  The Vice President’s just ordered the Air Force to 
           fire on a planeload of Americans.  Rice looks at Libby, 
           catching his eye before he makes a note on his pad.  Josh 
           Bolton leans in.

                                BOLTON
                        Maybe we should tell the President 
                        about that order.

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE/BUNKER - INTERCUT - MOMENTS LATER 

           Bush paces as much as the phone cord allows. 

                                CHENEY 
                        Air cover’s gone up, the Air Force 
                        is requesting permission to shoot 
                        down planes presumed hijacked and 
                        hostile.  We’ve got one approaching 
                        DC right now.

                                BUSH
                        Commercial?

                                CHENEY 
                        Yessir.

                                BUSH
                        You gonna try and make contact 
                        first?  Talk ‘em down?

           Cheney musters his patience. 

                                CHENEY
                        Certainly.  But if we don’t have a 
                        choice...

           Cheney’s guiding him toward the decision -- it’s important 
           that he get there, particularly since Cheney’s already given 
           the order.  Bush chews his cheek for a second.

                                BUSH
                        Yeah, I’ll sign up to that.

           Cheney nods to the Military Aide, confirming the order that 
           Cheney already gave.  It’s a subtlety that does not escape 
           Rice and Bolton.  

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me.  I’m coming back.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    6.

                                CHENEY
                        Sir, Offut Air Base has great 
                        communications, it’s secure as 
                        hell, at this point you cannot come 
                        back here.

                                LIBBY
                           (holding a phone)
                        Clarke.

                                CHENEY
                        Mr. President, I need to call you back.

                                BUSH
                        Yeah.

           Bush hangs up the phone and turns to Card.  Pensive.

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        I just authorized them to shoot 
                        down a hijacked aircraft.

           Bush looks at his staff.  Sharing the weight of the moment.  

           INT. BUNKER - MOMENTS LATER 

           Cheney’s not sharing the weight of anything, he’s making a 
           list of flights with Norm Mineta, who’s now on two phones.

                                CHENEY
                        American 706 headed for...

                                MINETA
                        Memphis.  No -- check that, it’s 
                        United 706.

           Cheney turns to Libby.

                                CHENEY
                        I need Addington down here.

           EXT. WASHINGTON - MEMORIAL BRIDGE - MORNING

           We're high above a tide of humans leaving Washington DC on 
           foot.  One stops, answers his ringing cellphone.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        David Addington.

           And then he turns, heading upstream through the fleeing 
           crowd.  DAVID ADDINGTON, walking back to the White House.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    7.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BUNKER - DAY

           Addington stands by the wall, deferential.  Cheney’s on the 
           phone.  We hear SENATOR NICKELS through the receiver, angry.

                                NICKELS (O.S.)
                        You want to tell me exactly why the 
                        executive branch has the right to 
                        decide when members of Congress 
                        come back to Washington?

                        Cause we’ve got the helicopters, Don.

           Nickels rambles on as Cheney puts a hand over the receiver 
           and leans back to Addington.  

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        It looks a lot like we’re at war 
                        with a terrorist organization.  
                        Figure out what kind of powers the 
                        President’s going to need that he 
                        doesn’t have.

           Cheney returns to his call, and Addington to his corner.  Now  *
           he’s scribbling, Addington is.  A few thoughts, on a blank 
           piece of paper.  This is where it starts.  And we fade to the

           TITLE:           THE SPECIAL PROGRAM

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY  

           A few days have passed and it’s calm now.  Eerily.  As we get 
           closer, we notice the new fortifications.  Surface-to-air 
           missiles on the roof.  Concrete barriers.  Marines wave cars 
           off, blocks away.  Nobody can get near the place.   

                                NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        The President has asked Congress 
                        for the authority to use military 
                        force in the pursuit of terrorists 
                        responsible for the attacks.  

                                BUSH (V.O.)
                        I’m a loving guy.  And I’m also 
                        someone, however, who’s got a job 
                        to do, and I intend to do it.

                                CABLE NEWS TALKING HEAD (V.O.)
                        We’re gonna run around Afghanistan 
                        rounding up terrorists?  Then what?  
                        Flog ‘em?  Shoot ‘em?  I don’t want 
                        ‘em here, I tell you that much.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY  

           JOHN YOO hurries down the hall.  As he passes through a 
           doorway to a suite of offices, we see a placard on the wall 
           that reads OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY  

           Cheney’s at his desk, with Gonzales, TIM FLANIGAN and 
           Addington, when Heiden KNOCKS and opens the door to let in...

                                HEIDEN
                        John Yoo.

           Heiden closes the door as she exits.  Yoo stands, nervous.  
           It’s his first time meeting the Vice President.  There are no  *
           handshakes, it’s straight to business.

                                ADDINGTON
                        John’s from the Office of Legal 
                        Counsel over at Justice, he’s going 
                        to help us with the legal 
                        underpinnings.

                                CHENEY
                        David put together a framework for 
                        dealing with the terrorists we 
                        capture once we’ve got boots on the 
                        ground.  Sort out the legal end, 
                        then we’ll make it an executive 
                        order.

           Addington hands Yoo a document.  Yoo glances over it.

                                YOO
                        Military commissions?

                                ADDINGTON
                        We’re not gonna haul a bunch of 
                        terrorists into federal court.  

                                FLANIGAN
                        And the court martial system’s too 
                        cumbersome.  This’ll give us more 
                        flexibility.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Powell’s putting together an 
                        interagency group to look into 
                        this, but it’ll take them forever 
                        to get rolling.  We don’t have that 
                        kind of time.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    9.

                                YOO
                        I’d like to bring in one of my 
                        colleagues at Justice, so I can get 
                        through it more quickly.  Is 
                        that...

           Addington looks to Cheney, unsure.

                                CHENEY
                        One.

                                YOO
                        And do I coordinate with Powell’s 
                        group?

                                CHENEY
                        This room.

           EXT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Like the White House, the State Department’s now heavily 
           fortified.

                                PROSPER (PRE-LAP)
                        Secretary Powell, would you like to 
                        start us off?

           INT. STATE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY  

           A vast conference table, and a lawyer at every seat.  COLIN 
           POWELL’s at the head of the table.  PIERRE PROSPER watches 
           him, deferential.

                                POWELL
                        We’ve got troops on their way to 
                        Afghanistan, they’re going to start 
                        capturing people and we need to 
                        figure out what exactly we do with 
                        them.  Your job will be to--

                                PROSPER
                        Hang on, sir, I’m sorry, I’m not 
                        sure everybody knows everybody -- 
                        should we go around and do names? 

           Powell sighs.  It’s a long table.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSICE - DAY

           John Yoo rushes in.  On his end, things are moving fast.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    10.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - YOO’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Yoo huddles with PATRICK PHILBIN.  

                                YOO
                        We want to use something called a 
                        military commission.  

           That’s when there’s a perfunctory KNOCK on the door, and 
           Attorney General JOHN ASHCROFT lets himself in.

                                ASHCROFT
                        You done with the immigration 
                        thing?

                                YOO
                        Yes sir, it should be on your desk.

           Ashcroft nods.  There’s a beat.  Yoo’s reflexively angled the 
           document in his hand away from Ashcroft.  Ashcroft doesn’t 
           notice the paper, but he notices the awkward silence.  

                                ASHCROFT
                        Okay.

           He exits.  Philbin caught the move with the document.  He 
           looks at Yoo, puzzled.

                                YOO
                        This came from the Vice President’s 
                        office.  They want to keep the 
                        circle small.

                                PHILBIN
                        Smaller than the Attorney General??

                                YOO
                        When I said we’re not telling 
                        anybody, I meant it.

           The whole thing makes Philbin nervous.  He takes the document  *
           from Yoo and begins to read. 

                                YOO (CONT’D)
                        Addington wrote it, we need to find 
                        a way to back it up under the 
                        commander-in-chief powers.  

           We’re on that document in Philbin’s hands.  We’ll follow it 
           closely as it reappears in...
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    11.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BUSH’S PRIVATE DINING ROOM - DAY 

           Cheney places the document on the table next to Bush, who’s 
           already eating when Cheney arrives.  Bush glances at it, but 
           a real read would mean ketchup on the pages, so...

                                BUSH
                        What am I looking at?

                                CHENEY
                        Military commissions.  It’s a way 
                        to put the terrorists on trial, 
                        without getting bogged down in 
                        every human rights treaty the UN 
                        ever cooked up.

                                BUSH
                        Powell and his gang came up with 
                        this?  

                                CHENEY
                        We put it together in-house.  
                        Justice cleared it.  Seems to hold 
                        water.

           Bush nods as he skims the first page.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OUTSIDE THE OVAL - DAY 

           Cheney hands the document back to Addington.  He's about to 
           go when he pauses.  Quietly...

                                CHENEY
                        The President wants to sign it 
                        today.  Let’s bypass staff review.  

           Even Addington looks slightly surprised by this order.  But 
           he nods and Cheney moves on.  We follow the document to

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TIM FLANIGAN’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Addington hands it off to Flanigan.

                                FLANIGAN
                        Bypass staff review??  

                                ADDINGTON
                        It must be possible.  Right?  

           Addington and Flanigan look flummoxed.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    12.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STAFF SECRETARY’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Flanigan hands the document to STUART BOWEN.  Flanigan’s got 
           his game face on now.

                                FLANIGAN
                        The big guy’s about to head out to 
                        Crawford, can you prep this for 
                        signature before he goes? 

           Bowen looks at him like he's insane.  

                                BOWEN
                        It’s a presidential order.  It has 
                        to be reviewed.  

                                FLANIGAN
                        It’s been taken care of.

                                BOWEN
                        You know how many thousands of 
                        documents pass through this office?  

                                FLANIGAN
                        Stuart--

                                BOWEN
                        They all need a chop from Andy 
                        Card.  Condi.  Steve Hadley.  

                                FLANIGAN
                        The helicopter’s on the lawn.

                                BOWEN
                        We don't just print things out and 
                        shove them in front of him.  His 
                        administration reviews it -- that's 
                        how he gets the advice he needs.  
                        That’s how every President in--

                                FLANIGAN
                        He got the advice he wanted.  He 
                        would like to sign it.  Now.  

           Bowen’s simply appalled.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY 

           Bush is talking with an AIDE when Bowen enters, a blue 
           portfolio in his hand, embossed with the presidential seal.  
           Bowen holds the folder open, revealing a more formal 
           presentation of the very same document we’ve been following.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    13.

                                BUSH
                        Iftaar?  Am I saying that right --
                        Iftaar?

                                AIDE
                        I believe so.

           Bush quickly signs the document.

                                BUSH
                        Why don’t we check before I spend a 
                        month hearing about how I can’t 
                        pronounce their holiday.

           Then he rushes out the door to the waiting Marine One.  Bowen 
           watches him go, sick to his stomach.  

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - ASHCROFT’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Ashcroft’s reading at his desk, CNN on in the background.

                                CNN NEWSCASTER
                        President Bush signed an order 
                        today allowing for the creation of 
                        special tribunals to try foreign 
                        terrorists.

           Ashcroft stares up at the screen.  Astonished.

           INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - COLIN POWELL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Powell’s staring at the same CNN broadcast.

                                CNN NEWSCASTER
                        These “military commissions,” as 
                        the White House is calling them, 
                        will write their own rules and 
                        operate outside the normal channels 
                        of US criminal and military courts.  

                                POWELL
                        What the fuck just happened???  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY  

           A number of lawyers assembled around the long table, startled  *
           to see John Ashcroft shouting at an unflappable Dick Cheney.

                        I am the President's senior law 
                        enforcement officer.

            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    14.

                                ASHCROFT (CONT'D)
                        I oversee terrorism prosecutions.  
                        Not the Pentagon.  

                                CHENEY
                        John--

                                ASHCROFT
                        I’m not handing over suspects to 
                        some... commission I’ve got no say 
                        in!  Even if it made legal sense, 
                        which I can’t imagine--

                                CHENEY
                        It does.  We’ve already spoken to 
                        your people.

                                ASHCROFT
                        Who?

           Cheney turns and looks down the table to one of the lawyers 
           seated at the other end.  John Yoo.  Yoo looks back at 
           Ashcroft, not pleased that he publicly humiliated his boss, 
           but not prepared to take it back either.  It’s an infuriating 
           moment for John Ashcroft.  

                                ASHCROFT (CONT’D)
                        I had asked to discuss this with 
                        the President.  This meeting was 
                        supposed to be with--

                                CHENEY
                        He wasn’t available.  

           Ashcroft looks at him for a moment, and makes a decision.  He  *
           walks out of the room, and makes a right, toward the Oval 
           Office.  Cheney shoots a look at Addington -- an order.  
           Addington rises, following Ashcroft out of the room.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OVAL - DAY  

           Addington catches up to Ashcroft.

                                ADDINGTON
                        John!

           Ashcroft stops.

                                ASHCROFT
                        I have a legitimate concern, I plan 
                        to voice it to the President before 
                        we do something we’ll regret.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    15.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Your concern is noted.

                                ASHCROFT
                        The President hired me to advise 
                        him when this kind of--

                                ADDINGTON
                        Dick Cheney hired you, not the 
                        President.  And he did it when 
                        you’d just lost an election to a 
                        dead man.  The President was gonna 
                        give your job to Frank Keating.  
                        You want to trade places with him 
                        right now?  

           Ashcroft’s blood is boiling.  And he’s steps from the Oval.  
           He could ask for an appointment and get it almost 
           immediately.  But he doesn’t.  He turns the other way, and 
           walks out of the White House. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY  

           Cheney’s in his office with Libby, CIA director GEORGE TENET,  *
           and NSA director GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN.  

                                CHENEY
                        I want to know what we can do that 
                        we’re not already doing.

                                TENET
                        The big hole right now is how do we 
                        find terrorists inside the US. 

                                HAYDEN
                        You want to track some guy in 
                        Pakistan, NSA can tap his phone, 
                        read his email, tell you every time 
                        he makes a bank deposit.  He comes 
                        here, we can’t look.  

                                LIBBY
                        Because...

                                HAYDEN
                        Nixon used the NSA to spy on his 
                        political enemies.  Congress shut 
                        it down.

                                CHENEY
                        What recourse do we have? 
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    16.

                                HAYDEN
                        The FISA court -- you can apply for 
                        a warrant, and surveil someone 
                        here.  But you need probable cause.  

                                TENET
                        It works when you’re after known 
                        suspects.  We need to root out the 
                        ones we don’t know about.  

           It’s appalling.  The burden of responsibility is squarely on 
           their shoulders, and they’re completely hamstrung.  Hayden 
           stands.  There’s a white board nearby.  He grabs a marker and  *
           draws a circle, and scribbles ALL next to it.

                                HAYDEN
                        Here’s everything you want to be 
                        able to hear, to find a bad actor.

           He draws another, intersecting circle, and labels it TECH 
           POSSIBLE.

                                HAYDEN (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what we have the 
                        technological power to access.

           Now he draws a third circle -- a Venn diagram.  He labels 
           this one LEGAL.

                                HAYDEN (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what we can do legally.

           He colors in the small triangle where the three circles 
           intersect.  It’s not much.  Cheney stares at it.  Displeased.   *
           Then he rises, grabs the eraser, and swipes the third circle 
           off the board.  The word LEGAL is still barely legible.  But 
           mostly gone.  He turns to Hayden.

                                CHENEY
                        Better?

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - ASHCROFT’S OFFICE - EVENING  

           John Yoo’s watching the Attorney General read.  Ashcroft 
           looks surly as he tries to decode the document in his hands.   *
           Because he can’t quite follow it.  And because he hates John 
           Yoo.

                                YOO
                        I think the signature goes on page--

                                ASHCROFT
                        I’m still reading.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    17.

                                YOO
                        Would it help if we talked through 
                        it again?

                                ASHCROFT
                        It would help if I could discuss it 
                        with Larry.  Or Bybee.

                                YOO
                        Unfortunately they’re not read in.

                                ASHCROFT
                        My deputy isn’t read in; and the 
                        head of the OLC isn’t read in.  
                        Doesn’t strike you as odd?

                                YOO
                        I’m happy to answer any--

                                ASHCROFT
                        You wrote it, of course it makes 
                        sense to you.  I want to know if it 
                        makes sense to anyone else.

                                YOO
                        You’re only authorizing it for 45 
                        days.  It’s an emergency measure.  

                                ASHCROFT
                        Because even the people who came up 
                        with it are uncomfortable with the 
                        idea of the NSA eavesdropping on 
                        Americans in their own homes.  

           Yoo’s prepared to weather this temper tantrum.  

                                YOO
                        The Vice President would like to 
                        have the President sign it by--

                                ASHCROFT
                        I want to read it one more time.  
                        You mind?

           Yoo stands for a moment, unsure.  Then he exits.  Ashcroft 
           watches him go, filled with disdain.  Then he squints at the 
           document.  He can’t make heads or tails of the thing.  
           Defeated, he turns to the last page.  And signs his name.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - NIGHT  

           Cheney, Addington, Gonzales, Flanigan, and John Yoo.  Seated 
           around the coffee table.  It feels more intimate than formal.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    18.

                                CHENEY
                        We need to sort out where we put 
                        the terrorists once we’ve got them -
                        - they can’t go to Sing Sing...

           This conversation OVERLAPS, both visually and aurally, with 
           ANOTHER, on ANOTHER DAY.  Same characters.  Same room.

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        The surveillance program we’re 
                        putting in place at the NSA, I want 
                        to make sure we’re utilizing it in 
                        concert with FBI and CIA.

           And then ANOTHER...

                                ADDINGTON
                        How about interrogation.  

                                CHENEY
                        Yeah, we’ve got to put together 
                        some guidelines for the guys who 
                        are trying to get information out 
                        of these people...

                                YOO
                        And this is gonna be...

                                CHENEY
                        Executive order.

           We might see shifts in seating, but it’s always these men, in 
           this office, all directing their inquiries at John Yoo, who 
           scribbles notes for himself as they go.  This is where the 
           real work gets done.  This is how.  

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING 

           It’s a blindingly bright morning outside the White House.  
           The words...

                                SPRING, 2003

           ...appear and disappear from the screen.  We hear Bush 
           speaking on a newscast.

                                BUSH (V.O.)
                        On my orders, coalition forces have 
                        begun striking selected targets of 
                        military importance to undermine 
                        Saddam Hussein's ability to wage 
                        war.

                        Mr. Bush sought to tamp down 
                        expectations of a quick victory by 
                        warning that the battles in the 
                        days ahead could be longer and more 
                        difficult than some predict.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ANDY CARD’S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

           ANDY CARD arrives.  His ASSISTANT’s at her desk.  She nods 
           toward the open door to his office.

                                ASSISTANT
                        The Attorney General’s in there.

           That’s bad news, and she knows it when she delivers it.  Card 
           looks defeated, and his day’s just begun.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ANDY CARD’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

           Card enters, gamely pretending he doesn’t know what’s coming.

                        They’re not rubber stamping 
                        executive orders, Andy, a lot of 
                        law gets built in that place.

                        don’t even know who he’s shooting 
                        at!

                                CARD
                        Why don’t I--

                                ASHCROFT
                        He’s not qualified.  That’s the 
                        issue.  I’ll take it to the 
                        President if I have to.

           Ashcroft just threw down the gauntlet.  Fucking hell.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY  

           Cheney’s unmoved.  But Card and Addington are frustrated.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        He’s bluffing.  

                                CARD
                        He said he has some names.  People 
                        he thinks are more qualified.

                                CHENEY
                        Have John Yoo give us a name.  That 
                        oughta simplify matters.  Ashcroft 
                        wants to go crying to the 
                        President, fine.  He only gets to 
                        play that card once.

           INT. WASHINGTON RESTAURANT - DAY  

           JACK GOLDSMITH’s at a table alone, waiting for someone who’s 
           late.  Jack’s carrying a few extra pounds, a shock of 
           untameable hair, and the distracted look of someone who just 
           lost track of his glasses and will shortly discover they’re 
           on his face.  Jack waves as John Yoo rushes in the door.

                                JACK
                        I ate the bread.  Sorry.

                                YOO
                        I’m not gonna be able to stay.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    21.

                                JACK
                        Is everything okay?

           No, is the answer.  Yoo’s clearly upset.  Angry.  But he’s 
           not getting into it right now.

                                YOO
                        I want to recommend you for a job 
                        at the Office of Legal Counsel.

                                JACK
                        You serious?

                                YOO
                        You’d be okay leaving Defense?  

                                JACK
                        Leslie and I were talking about 
                        getting out of Washington.  But to 
                        come and work with you...

           Jack’s thrilled.  But Yoo shakes his head.

                                YOO
                        Bybee’s resigning.  They need 
                        somebody to run the place.

                                JACK
                        They’re promoting you?  

                                YOO
                        I’m leaving.  I want to recommend 
                        you for head of the OLC.

           It’s a stunning offer.  Life changing.  But it doesn’t make 
           any sense to Jack.

                                JACK
                        That should be your job.  

                                YOO
                        The Attorney General’s blackballing 
                        me.  

           It’s a massive blow for Yoo, and Jack knows it.

                                JACK
                        Ashcroft?  Why??

                                YOO
                        Cause he’s an infant.  I don’t 
                        know.  I can’t stay after this.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    22.

                                JACK
                        I’m so sorry--

                                YOO
                        It’s a huge opportunity.  You’ll be 
                        great.

           Jack knows... it’s like winning the goddamn lottery.  

                                JACK
                        If Ashcroft blackballed you, he’s 
                        not gonna hire some guy you picked.

                                YOO
                        It’s not Ashcroft’s decision.  

                                JACK
                        It’s his department.

                                YOO
                        The Vice President’s Office asked 
                        me for my recommendation.  Are you 
                        interested?

                                JACK
                        Are you kidding?  Of course!  

                                YOO
                        I need to ask you a couple things.  
                        Did you give money to a guy named 
                        Henry Perritt?

           Not the kind of question he was expecting.

                                JACK
                        Yeah, he ran for the House.

                                YOO
                        He’s a Democrat.  

                                JACK
                        Did you run a background check on me?

                                YOO
                        I’m recommending you to be the 
                        final authority on the legality of 
                        everything the executive branch 
                        does.  I gave the Vice President’s 
                        Office your name 24 hours ago, they 
                        now know everything about you, they 
                        want to know why you gave $800 to a 
                        Democrat.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    23.

                                JACK
                        Because Henry’s my friend and after 
                        he asked me he looked like he was 
                        gonna cry.

                                YOO
                        Are you a Republican?

                                JACK
                        Are you kidding?  How long have you 
                        known me??

                                YOO
                        I have to ask.

                                JACK
                        Yes, I’m a Republican.  

                                YOO
                        Did you vote for the President?

                                JACK
                        Yes!

                                YOO
                        Okay.

           Yoo’s punching something into his Blackberry now.

                                YOO (CONT’D)
                        I want you to remember that 
                        everyone in the whole place works 
                        for the President.  Ashcroft gets 
                        his balls in a twist when he’s not 
                        at the center of every decision, 
                        that’s not your problem.  

                                JACK
                        John, I don’t know if I’m qualified to--

                                YOO
                        Your phone’s gonna ring in a 
                        minute.  Get the crumbs off your 
                        shirt and... try and make your hair 
                        go flat.

                                JACK
                        What are you--

                                YOO
                        I gotta go.  Sorry about lunch.  
                        You’re gonna be great.

           Yoo’s out the door, and then there’s a WAITER at the table.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    24.

                                WAITER
                        Did you want to order something?

           That’s when Jack’s phone starts BUZZING on the table.  He 
           stares at it.

                                WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - ASHCROFT’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Ayres stands, pissed, as Ashcroft looks over a resume.

                                AYRES
                        Addington already met him.  He’s 
                        John Yoo’s best friend.  They’re 
                        ideological clones.  

                                ASHCROFT
                        He’s sitting out there?  Christ.  

           Ashcroft’s so frustrated he could spit.  He’s been 
           outmaneuvered again, he’s not fast enough or wily enough for 
           this game.  He stabs a phone line.

                                ASHCROFT (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Send him in.

                                AYRES
                        It’s a no.  It has to be.  We’ll 
                        talk to Andy Card.

                                ASHCROFT
                        I already went to Andy, to kill the 
                        John Yoo idea.  I pull that again, 
                        I’ll look like an idiot.  In fact I 
                        already look like an idiot.  That’s 
                        what just happened.

           There’s a tentative KNOCK and the door opens.  In walks Jack.  
           Big smile.  Warm handshakes for Ayres and then Ashcroft.  

                                JACK
                        Hello!  

                                ASHCROFT
                        Come on in.

                                AYRES
                        David Ayres, I’m the Attorney 
                        General’s Chief of Staff.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    25.

                                JACK
                        Jack Goldsmith.  Pleasure.  
                           (and then Ashcroft)
                        Really an honor to meet you, sir. 

           It’s true, he’s thrilled.  If he had a tail, it would be 
           wagging, rapidly.  God, they hate this guy already.

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jack races in the door.  This apartment on Capitol Hill was 
           perfect for a young couple.  Two kids later, it’s busting at 
           the seams.  

                                JACK
                        Leslie?

           Jack’s wife LESLIE hurries into the kitchen, carrying a 
           laptop.

                                LESLIE
                        Will’s asleep and Jack’s crashing 
                        his trains -- we got four minutes, 
                        I want you to look at a couple 
                        houses.

                                JACK
                        We’re not moving, we’re staying.

                                LESLIE
                        Uh uh.  Charlottesville.  Quiet 
                        life.

                                JACK
                        I’m getting a job offer.  Assuming 
                        I charmed John Ashcroft, which is a 
                        big if, he didn’t like the look of 
                        me, and he hates John Yoo--

                                LESLIE
                        What??  

                                JACK
                        John recommended me to run the 
                        Office of Legal Counsel.  

                                LESLIE
                        I don’t even know what that is.

                                JACK
                        It’s like the Supreme Court for the 
                        President.  Twenty lawyers.

                        I’d be running the whole shop.  
                        It’s a game changer, is what it is.

           He’s so excited he can barely contain himself.  This is the 
           opposite of what they’d agreed on, but... He really wants it.  
           She begins to cave.  He pulls her into a hug, thrilled.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Oh god, I love you.

                                LESLIE
                        Yeah yeah.

                                JACK
                        They have to confirm me, I may not

                        Sure.  A girl can dream.

           She’s kind of devastated, but he’s so elated it’s infectious.  
           How could she say no?

                        Meanwhile, the Bush administration’s 
                        facing a flood of questions about the 
                        presumed link between al Qaeda and 
                        Saddam Hussein.

                        No one has said there is evidence 
                        that Saddam Hussein directed or 
                        controlled 9/11, but let’s be very 
                        clear, he had ties to al Qaeda, he 
                        had al Qaeda operatives who had 
                        operated out of Baghdad...

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - MORNING 

           Jack’s unpacking in his new office.  Patrick Philbin pokes 
           his head in, tentative.  

                                PHILBIN
                        Hey there.  Patrick Philbin.  
                        Associate Deputy Attorney General.  
                        Couple doors down the hall.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    27.

                                JACK
                        Jack Goldsmith.  New guy.  

                                PHILBIN
                        I used to be in the OLC.  I was 
                        actually filling in on some of your 
                        stuff while they were lining you up.

                                JACK
                        Oh yeah?

                                PHILBIN
                        Yup.  Glad you’re here!

           Philbin doesn’t really have Jack’s attention -- Jack’s 
           messing around with the arrangement of things on his shelves.

                                PHILBIN (CONT’D)
                        Had any briefings yet?

                                JACK
                        No, but I think there’s one this 
                        afternoon.

                                PHILBIN
                        It’s a trip.  They put you in a 
                        secure room, some nervous looking 
                        guy from CIA tells you how the 
                        world’s gonna end.

           Philbin looks pretty nervous himself.  Jack’s too distracted 
           with his unpacking to notice.  Jack’s new assistant CHARLOTTE  *
           arrives in the doorway.

                                CHARLOTTE
                        Alberto Gonzales is on the phone.

                                JACK
                        For me?  Great! 

           Philbin has something on his mind, but it’ll have to wait.  
           Charlotte steps out, and after a second, so does Philbin.  
           Jack gives him a wave, as he pokes a flashing phone line.

                                JACK (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        This is Goldsmith.  

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - ASHCROFT’S OFFICE - DAY

           A few days later.  Ashcroft and Ayres look over an opinion as 
           Jack waits, eager to hear their response.  It’s his first 
           official answer on the job, and he’s happy with it.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    28.

                                ASHCROFT
                        Gonzales asked you this?  

                                JACK
                        Yes sir.

                                ASHCROFT
                        And you’re concluding Iraqi terrorists 
                        do have Geneva protections?  Am I 
                        reading this right?

                                JACK
                        Yes.  Iraqi soldiers in Iraq are 
                        lawful combatants.

           Ashcroft nods, but looks to Ayres.

                                AYRES
                        You realize... that isn’t exactly 
                        the President’s position.

                                JACK
                        Well they couldn’t have been sure, 
                        that’s why they asked.  Right?

           Seems obvious to Jack, but there’s still an odd silence.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Are you uncomfortable with the 
                        decision?

                                ASHCROFT
                        No.  No.  It’s just... When John 
                        Yoo was here... He wasn’t head of 
                        the OLC like you are, but a lot of 
                        these White House questions seemed 
                        to land on his desk, and...

                                AYRES
                        He was reticent to engage the White 
                        House in debate.

                                ASHCROFT
                        We’re glad you don’t have those 
                        qualms.

           Jack nods.  Ashcroft and Ayres stifle a smile.  This guy has 
           no idea what he’s getting into.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    29.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GONZALES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Jack and Philbin face Gonzales and Addington, who sit in 
           matching wing chairs, copies of Jack’s opinion in their 
           hands.  Philbin’s eyes are on his shoes, the floor, anywhere 
           but Addington.  Gonzales is calm, measured.  Addington’s head 
           is about to explode.

                                GONZALES
                        I think the thing we’re wondering 
                        about, Jack, is--

                                ADDINGTON
                        They’re terrorists.  Not frat boys 
                        with water balloons.  

                                JACK
                        Of course.

                                ADDINGTON
                        The President has made a decision -- 
                        terrorists do not receive Geneva 
                        protections-- 

                                JACK
                        Right, but--

                                ADDINGTON
                        --you cannot question his decision.

                                JACK
                        He made a decision about the Third 
                        Geneva Convention -- the situation 
                        in Iraq is different.

                                ADDINGTON
                        A terrorist blowing up our troops 
                        is a terrorist blowing up our 
                        troops!

                                JACK
                        We’re an occupying power in Iraq, 
                        that’s not Third Geneva, that’s 
                        Fourth Geneva -- it’s the 
                        Occupation Convention--

                                ADDINGTON
                        If he says Geneva one more time I’m 
                        going to lose my mind.

                                GONZALES
                        Okay, let’s see if we can--
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    30.

                                JACK
                        An al Qaeda terrorist from Yemen 
                        who shows up in Baghdad isn’t the 
                        same as an Iraqi combatant in Iraq.

                                ADDINGTON
                        The Geneva Conventions are quaint!  
                        They’re obsolete!  Frame them on 
                        your wall, they are a relic of 
                        another time!

                                JACK
                        They’re half a century of US 
                        policy!

                                ADDINGTON
                        This is not an academic exercise, 
                        do you understand me?  There are 
                        Americans wearing uniforms, 
                        thousands of miles from home, they 
                        will die because of your decision.  
                        Is that clear?  
                           (beat)
                        OLC shapes counterterrorism policy.  
                        That’s what you’re doing.  

           Jack’s reeling.  He’s never experienced this kind of attack, 
           it’s disorienting.  But that doesn’t change the situation.

                                JACK
                        I don’t take this lightly.  But you 
                        asked me to interpret the Occupation 
                        Convention.  And... I did.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE GATE - DAY

           Jack and Philbin, leaving the White House.  

                                JACK
                        Hopefully he won’t be in the room 
                        next time I deliver an opinion.

                                PHILBIN
                        He’s always in the room.

                                JACK
                        The Vice President’s lawyer?  

           It doesn’t make sense.  But Philbin just walks on, grim.

           EXT. CAMP DAVID - DAY  

           A workspace has been set up on the porch outside the Aspen 
           Lodge at Camp David.  Cheney’s on one phone.  Scooter Libby’s 
           on another. 

                                LIBBY (INTO PHONE)
                        No, the Vice President’s in an 
                        undisclosed location today, we’ll 
                        have to set up a secure link.  Okay.

           Libby hangs up as Addington arrives, fuming.  Addington hands  *
           Cheney and Libby a document.  Cheney’s still on the phone.

                                CHENEY (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m gonna send Scooter to your 
                        office tomorrow, see if we can kill 
                        the House proposal before it gets 
                        any more traction.  Yeah.

           Cheney hangs up.  Libby’s been reading the document Addington  *
           brought them, and he’s chuckling.

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        What.

                                LIBBY
                        Looks like David got himself a new 
                        chew toy.

           Cheney turns his attention to the document.

                                CHENEY
                        This is Goldsmith?  On Geneva?

           Addington nods.  Cheney reads, a look of profound irritation 
           settling over his face. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - HALLWAY - DAY

           A DOJ STAFFER passes Jack.

                                DOJ STAFFER
                        You settling in okay? 

                                JACK
                        Well I’m trying to find the kitchen 
                        and I think I’ve gone around the 
                        loop twice now.  

                                DOJ STAFFER
                        You gotta take a right at the end.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    32.

                                JACK
                        You’re a good man.  I’ve read so 
                        much in the past couple weeks I 
                        can’t see straight.  

                                DOJ STAFFER
                        Yeah, it’s dense, this stuff.  
                           (lowers his voice)
                        I still don’t really understand the 
                        Highland Protocol.  And Stellar 
                        Wind’s completely impenetrable.  
                        You’re not the first man to go 
                        blind trying to get through it all.  

           Jack smiles, polite.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Philbin's getting coffee when Jack enters.

                                JACK
                        Patrick, some nice guy whose name I 
                        can’t remember said I might have 
                        trouble understanding a program I 
                        think I missed completely.  What is 
                        Stellar Wind?  

           Philbin stares at Jack, frozen.  The color draining out of 
           his face.  Jack’s not sure what the problem is.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Stellar Wind?  

                                PHILBIN
                        Please stop saying that.

                                JACK
                        Okay.  Where can I get a copy?

           Philbin can’t even fathom the question, never mind answer it.   *
           He turns and walks out of the room.  Jack watches him go, 
           trying to figure out what the hell just happened. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - PHILBIN’S OFFICE

           Philbin's whisper yelling into the phone.

                                PHILBIN (INTO PHONE)
                        He’s the head of the OLC!  He’s 
                        supposed to sign it!  I can’t keep 
                        signing it, I’m not even in the OLC 
                        anymore!  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    33.

           He stops short when he sees Jack standing in the doorway.

                                PHILBIN (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I need to call you back.

           He hangs up.  

                                JACK
                        Patrick, is there something the 
                        OLC’s doing that I don’t know 
                        about? 

           Philbin looks miserable.  

                                PHILBIN
                        I’m sorry.  I can’t answer that 
                        question.

           INT. EISENHOWER EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING (EEOB) - ADDINGTON’S 
           OFFICE - DAY

           Addington click click clicks the combo on a wall safe.  He 
           pulls out a large envelope, and extracts a document stamped 
           TOP SECRET: STELLAR WIND.  He gives a disgusted glance at 
           Philbin before he addresses Jack.

                                ADDINGTON
                        This is sensitive compartmented 
                        information.  You don’t discuss it 
                        with anyone other than Philbin and 
                        Ashcroft.  Do you understand?

           Jack nods.

                                ADDINGTON (CONT’D)
                        How closely did you deal with the 
                        National Security Agency when you 
                        were at Defense?

                                JACK
                        Not very.  I know they do a lot of 
                        our spying.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        CIA spies in person.  NSA does it 
                        electronically.  Any of our enemies 
                        around the world can be monitored 
                        by the NSA.  But none of that can 
                        happen inside the U.S.  

                                JACK
                        Right.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    34.

                                ADDINGTON
                        But the 9-11 bombers were living 
                        here.  This program allows us to 
                        monitor terrorists domestically.

           He hands Jack the Stellar Wind document.

                                ADDINGTON (CONT’D)
                        It requires re-authorization every 
                        45 days.  You sign it, the Attorney 
                        General signs it, the President 
                        signs it. 

                                JACK
                        Does something change in 45 days?

                                ADDINGTON
                        No.

                                PHILBIN
                        That’s not exactly--

                                ADDINGTON
                        You’re right, Patrick, we may win 
                        the War on Terror between now and 
                        Christmas, in which case we’ll re-
                        evaluate.  

           Philbin has more he’d like to say but he thinks better of it.

                                JACK
                        This copy’s for me?

           For Addington, the question is staggering in its innocence.

                                ADDINGTON
                        You sit in that chair, you read it 
                        and then you hand it back to me.

           Addington’s actually going to watch Jack read it.  It seems 
           weird, but a lot of things around here seem weird to Jack.  
           He’s new.  Jack begins to read, as Addington glares at 
           Philbin, still furious that Philbin talked him into this.   

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - DAY 

           Jack and Philbin walk out of the EEOB, and down Pennsylvania 
           Avenue toward the Department of Justice.  Silent.  

                                JACK
                        I’m not supposed to say the name, 
                        right?  So if I have a question... 
                        what do I say.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    35.

                                PHILBIN
                        Everyone calls it the Vice 
                        President’s Special Program.  
                        Except the Vice President’s Office 
                        who calls it the President’s 
                        Special Program.

                                JACK
                        And they just give me a copy every 
                        45 days and I sign it?

           Philbin lowers his voice, aware they’re on the street.  It’s 
           not crowded, but still.

                                PHILBIN
                        CIA sends you a threat assessment.  
                        They call it The Scary Memo.  
                        You’re so freaked out by the time 
                        you’ve read it you’d let them 
                        wiretap the whole country if they 
                        wanted.  Then you sign it.

                                JACK
                        It’s bold.  No warrants...

                                PHILBIN
                        Yeah.

                                JACK
                        Isn’t there some court you go to if 
                        you want to wiretap an American?

                                PHILBIN
                        The FISA court issues secret 
                        warrants.  But this program was 
                        built to function without them.

           Jack nods.  Philbin was hoping for more push-back on that, 
           and isn’t getting it.  He’s not sure how to broach this.

                                PHILBIN (CONT’D)
                        I can get you the OLC opinion they 
                        based the program on.  Look it 
                        over, see what you think.  

                                JACK
                        I trust you, it’s just... bold.

           Jack’s moving on.  Philbin wants to say more, but he doesn’t.   *

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - NIGHT  

           It’s been a long day.  Jack slips on his coat, ready to 
           leave, when Philbin appears in his doorway.

                                PHILBIN
                        I got you a copy of the opinion 
                        that backs up the program.  If you 
                        want to take a look.

           He doesn’t.  He’s exhausted.  There are mountains of 
           paperwork on his desk.  But Philbin’s worried about this, and  *
           not taking no for an answer anymore.  

                                PHILBIN (CONT’D)
                        There are a couple sticky spots in 
                        the opinion.  I was trying to iron 
                        them out when I was the one who was 
                        re-authorizing it.  
                           (beat)
                        You should take a look.

           Philbin places a document on Jack’s desk and leaves.  Jack 
           sighs, takes his coat back off.  

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - PHILBIN’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Jack enters.  Appalled.  

                                JACK
                        Sticky spots?  

           Philbin shuts the door.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - PHILBIN’S OFFICE - LATER  

           Jack’s trying to get his mind around what he just read.  

                                JACK
                        That’s the baldest declaration of 
                        presidential power I’ve ever seen!  
                        Does it... I’m not sure I followed 
                        the legal argument.  

                                PHILBIN
                        That’s because it’s problematic.

                                JACK
                        Nobody ever questioned it?

                                PHILBIN
                        Like who?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    37.

                                JACK
                        Like State, like legal over at the 
                        NSA--

                                PHILBIN
                        They didn’t read it.  Nobody read 
                        it.  After 9-11...

                                JACK
                        They blew up the Pentagon, they 
                        didn’t kill all the lawyers.  The 
                        President couldn’t have signed 
                        something like that without 
                        clearance from 12 different-- 

                                PHILBIN
                        Nobody was allowed to see the 
                        opinions.

                                JACK
                        Let me get this straight.  NSA 
                        writes a security program--

                                PHILBIN
                        Addington wrote the program.

                                JACK
                           (beat)
                        The Vice President’s lawyer wrote a 
                        national security program?  Is that 
                        normal?

                                PHILBIN
                        No.  I mean, it is now.  

                                JACK
                        Okay.  He asks the Attorney General 
                        to have the OLC draft an opinion--

                                PHILBIN
                        He asks John Yoo.

                                JACK
                           (beat)
                        Did Ashcroft even read it?

                                PHILBIN
                        Eventually.  But it’s complicated 
                        stuff.  He relies on his staff to 
                        unpack it for him.  And they didn’t 
                        want the Deputy AG to read it--

            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    38.

                                PHILBIN
                        The Vice President’s office.  

                                JACK
                        ...doesn’t want the Deputy Attorney 
                        General to read an opinion 
                        generated by his own department??

                                PHILBIN
                        They didn’t even want you to read 
                        it, and you’re the guy who’s 
                        supposed to certify its legality.  

                                JACK
                        They’re letting the NSA eavesdrop 
                        on Americans--

                                PHILBIN
                        And the FBI and the CIA.  No 
                        oversight.  The courts don’t 
                        monitor it.  Congress doesn’t know 
                        about it.

                                JACK
                        And nobody knows that it may not 
                        hold water.  Legally.  Except you.

                                PHILBIN
                        They asked me to do the re-
                        authorization when John Yoo stepped 
                        down.  And the more I looked into 
                        it, the more it seemed like the 
                        whole thing never quite made sense 
                        in the first place. 

           Jack stares at him.  This is inconceivable. 

                                PHILBIN (CONT’D)
                        There are a couple other programs 
                        I’m worried about.  We wrote an 
                        opinion on interrogation for the 
                        Department of Defense -- what you 
                        can do to prisoners when you’re 
                        trying to get information out of 
                        them.  It’s...
                           (beat)
                        You should take a look.

           Philbin takes a pile of documents off his desk.  Holds it out  *
           toward Jack.  It’s not a small pile.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    39.

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Jack’s on the couch, reading through the documents Philbin 
           gave him.  Or he was, anyhow.  Now he’s so shocked by what 
           he’s read, he’s kind of staring into space.  

                                LESLIE
                        What are you doing?

           He didn’t even hear her come down the stairs.

                                JACK
                        Just playing catch up.

                                LESLIE
                        You gonna come to bed?

           Not soon.

                                JACK
                        Soon.

                                LESLIE
                        You okay?

           Not really.

                                JACK
                        Yeah.  

           She heads back to bed.  Jack looks at his work.  What the 
           hell did he get himself into?

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - HALLWAY - MORNING

           There’s a conference room full of people waiting for Jack and 
           he’s on his way in when he runs into Philbin.  They step 
           aside for a moment.  Jack’s not even sure where to begin.

                                JACK
                        I read over the interrogation 
                        stuff...

           Jack just shakes his head.  It’s breathtaking.

                                PHILBIN
                        Yeah.

                                JACK
                        We authorize torture on a level the 
                        country’s never seen and we don’t 
                        let Congress anywhere near it??
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    40.

           There are people passing.  They can’t really talk about this.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        What’s the protocol for addressing 
                        this kind of thing?

                                PHILBIN
                        I don’t know.  OLC’s never 
                        withdrawn an opinion.  The protocol 
                        is, you live with it. 

                                JACK
                        Then why did you ask me to read it?

                                PHILBIN
                           (beat)
                        I guess I couldn’t live with it.  

           Fuck.  Jack doesn’t want any of this.

                                JACK
                        Let’s deal with the surveillance 
                        thing first.  Maybe we talk to 
                        somebody at the NSA, see if we can 
                        untangle what they’re doing.  
                        Probably makes more sense in 
                        practice than it does on paper.

                                PHILBIN
                        And the interrogation memos?

                                JACK
                           (beat)
                        I don’t know.  

           Jack continues into his meeting.  We see his staff waiting 
           for him.  Twenty lawyers.  Miles of new work to do.  

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Alright, which one of you’s Jed?

           A lawyer raises his hand.

                                JACK (CONT'D)
                        We get anywhere on firearm transfer?

           INT. THE CAPITOL - HALLWAYS - DAY

           Cheney, striding through the halls as Addington briefs him.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    41.

                                ADDINGTON
                        The new head of the OLC’s developed 
                        an interest in the Special Program.  
                        He says he doesn’t understand it.  

                                CHENEY
                        People only have questions about 
                        things they’ve read.  

           It’s a rebuke, and Addington knows it.  He presses on.

                                ADDINGTON
                        He’s been poking around at NSA.  
                        He’s got their general counsel 
                        coming to meet with him this week.

           Cheney looks at Addington, displeased.  

                                ADDINGTON (CONT’D)
                        He had rock solid credentials.  
                        Aggressive views on presidential 
                        authority.  I didn’t expect this.

                                CHENEY
                        Get him off it.

           Addington nods. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - COMMAND CENTER - DAY

           Jack and Philbin pass copies of a few different documents to 
           JOEL BRENNER and VITO POTENZA.  

                                PHILBIN
                        These are the OLC opinions that 
                        provide the foundation for the 
                        domestic surveillance program.  The 
                        first one is October 23rd, 2001--

           That’s when the door opens and Addington blows in.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Morning.

           Nobody was expecting him.  He wasn't invited.  

                                JACK
                        Hi.  Um...  Do you all...
                        David Addington -- Joel Brenner, 
                        inspector general of the NSA.  Vito 
                        Potenza.  NSA general counsel.

           No handshakes.  Addington barrels past the introductions to--
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    42.

                                ADDINGTON
                        What are we doing?

                                JACK
                        Vito and Joel asked us if they 
                        could take a look at the OLC 
                        opinions that back up the, uh, 
                        President’s Special Program.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Why.

                                POTENZA
                        Well, Jack and Patrick asked us 
                        some questions about how it worked.  
                        And as we got talking we realized 
                        OLC was assuming that we’d 
                        certified the legality of the 
                        program.  And over at NSA, we 
                        assumed OLC’d certified it.  Sort 
                        of a circular thing.

                                BRENNER
                        So we figured we should sit down 
                        and... make sure everything tracks.

           Beat.  Then comes the screaming.

                                ADDINGTON
                        This is none of your business!

                                BRENNER
                        I don’t--

                                ADDINGTON
                        The President doesn’t want this! 

                                POTENZA
                        But he’s--

                                ADDINGTON
                        Give me those!  

           He’s grabbing the papers off the table.

                                JACK
                        David.  These guys are--

                                ADDINGTON
                        YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR LANE.

           It’s an appalling display for a room like this.  We whip to --
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    43.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jack and Philbin, tearing into the office, closing the door.

                                JACK
                        Why would you tell him about the 
                        meeting?

                                PHILBIN
                        I didn’t!

                                JACK
                        So who did?  Charlotte?

                                PHILBIN
                        They know.  

                                JACK
                        What do they know?

                                PHILBIN
                        They know everything.  OVP.  The 
                        Vice President.

                                JACK
                        For god’s sake, Patrick, he’s not 
                        actually Darth Vader.  What, do you 
                        think they bug the place?

           It was a joke, but...

                                PHILBIN
                        They read the emails. 
                           (beat)
                        I know a guy at the National 
                        Security Council who figured out 
                        that the VP’s Office gets a blind 
                        copy of every email anybody over 
                        there sends to their own staff.  
                        Cheney set it up with Hadley.  
                        Maybe he made the same deal with 
                        Ashcroft. 

                                JACK
                        You think Dick Cheney heard about 
                        our meeting, and sent Addington to 
                        shut it down??

                                PHILBIN
                        How else did Addington find out 
                        about it?  I didn’t tell him.  You 
                        didn’t.  I’m sure NSA didn’t -- 
                        they’re spies, they don’t talk 
                        about anything.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    44.

           Jack’s reeling.  

                                JACK
                        He loses his mind when we just want 
                        to have someone read it?  What the 
                        hell are they doing?

           There’s a KNOCK at the door.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        What.

           In walks JAMES COMEY.  Tall.  Handsome.  Big smile.  Teeth 
           that'll light the room.  

                                COMEY
                        Hey!  Jim Comey, just wanted to say 
                        hi.  

                                JACK
                        Jack Goldsmith.  You’re Ashcroft’s 
                        new Deputy?

                                COMEY
                        That’s what they tell me.

                                PHILBIN
                        Patrick Philbin.  I work for you.  

                                COMEY
                        Fantastic.  Do you work for me too?

                                JACK
                        No, I run the OLC.  Office of Legal 
                        Counsel.  

                                COMEY
                        Great.  Thinking the big thoughts.

                                JACK
                        Yeah, I guess so.

           Beat.  Comey notices that Philbin and Jack look like death.

                                COMEY
                        Everything okay?

                                JACK
                        Long day.  Take a good look at your 
                        kids.

                                COMEY
                        I’ll do that.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    45.

           There’s that big smile again, and he exits. 

                                JACK
                        Is that what I looked like when I 
                        started?

           Philbin nods.  These guys are in way over their heads.

           INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY - HAYDEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hayden’s behind his desk.  Brenner and Potenza face their 
           boss, worried.

                                BRENNER
                        He wouldn’t even let us read the 
                        documents.  It’s our program.

           Hayden shakes his head, troubled.

                                HAYDEN
                        Okay.
                           (beat)
                        Thanks guys.  

           The guys are sure this can’t be the end of the meeting, 
           but... it appears to be.

           Brenner and Potenza head for the elevator.

                                BRENNER
                        What the fuck was that?

                                POTENZA
                        What.

                                BRENNER
                        Kind of a short conversation, given 
                        the circumstances.  No?

                                POTENZA
                        What, did you think he was gonna 
                        call Addington, spank him, and then 
                        demand we see the opinions?

                                BRENNER
                        Well what are we gonna do?

                                POTENZA

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Jack’s at his desk working, late at night, when Philbin 
           appears in the doorway, silent.  Jack looks up at him.

                                JACK
                        I tried.  I don’t run the NSA.  I 
                        can’t...

           Philbin nods.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        I’m going over this torture stuff 
                        again.  Maybe there’s something we 
                        can do there.

                                PHILBIN
                        Like what?

                                JACK
                        I don’t know.

           They both feel horribly powerless.  Philbin leaves.  Jack 
           turns back to his work.  TV news has been playing in the 
           background, and Jack notices Cheney on the screen.  An 
           interview.  Jack turns up the volume.

                                INTERVIEWER (ON SCREEN)
                        There’s been a lot of talk recently 
                        about the power of the presidency -- 
                        and you served in the Ford White 
                        House, when presidential power 
                        reached an absolute low.  I'm 
                        curious how that shaped your views.

                                CHENEY (ON SCREEN)
                        I do have the view that over the 
                        years there had been an erosion of 
                        presidential power, a lot of things 
                        around Watergate and Vietnam did 
                        that.  And the President needs to 
                        be effective especially in a 
                        national security area.  I do think 
                        now we've been able to restore the 
                        legitimate authority of the 
                        presidency.

           Legitimate.  Jack almost winces at the word.  Is this what 
           he’s facing?  A wrestling match over presidential power, with 
           a giant who’s been at it for decades?  It’s a much bigger 
           battle than he signed up for.

           Winter.  Jack’s car drives the empty streets.  

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           It’s 1 a.m. when Jack enters.  Drops his coat and briefcase.  
           Leslie comes down the stairs.  

                                JACK
                        Sorry, I tried to be quiet.

                                LESLIE
                        I was awake.  Just put him back 
                        down.  Is this gonna be every 
                        night?

                                JACK
                        I don’t know.  Yeah, probably.  
                        There’s all this...  I can’t talk 
                        about any of it.
                           (beat)
                        John Yoo wrote some stuff that’s... 
                        way out there.  I don’t know what 
                        the hell to do with it.  

                                LESLIE
                        Fix it.  

                                JACK
                        We don't change old opinions, we 
                        write new ones.  And this... 20 
                        year-old American kids are on the 
                        other side of the planet, doing 
                        things my office said were legal.  
                        I pull that rug out now...?  

                                LESLIE
                        It’s an evolving situation.

                                JACK
                        Yeah but it’s not just what they’re 
                        authorizing, it’s how they built 
                        it.  It starts to look like maybe 
                        it’s part of a campaign that’s been 
                        going on for a long time, to really 
                        change the nature of the 
                        presidency.  Decades, even.

                                LESLIE
                        Is the grassy knoll gonna come into 
                        this at some point?

                                JACK
                        Do I sound like a guy under a 
                        bridge?

           He kind of does. 

                                LESLIE
                        Just do what you can do.

                                JACK
                        John got me the job.  My first move 
                        in office is I start screaming that 
                        everything he did is crazy?

                                LESLIE
                        If it’s crazy, yeah. 

           Leslie kisses him on the head.  She loves him, but they’re 
           both a wreck.  She’s got a newborn.  She’s exhausted too.  
           She hauls herself back up the stairs.  Jack’s alone.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - ASHCROFT’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Ayres, Philbin, Ashcroft, Jack.  Jack treads in carefully.

                                JACK
                        The March 2003 opinion approves 24 
                        interrogation techniques for the 
                        Department of Defense.  I don’t 
                        take issue with any of them.  But 
                        the opinion itself is a disaster.  
                        It’s legally flawed.  It’s wildly 
                        broader than necessary to support 
                        what’s actually being done -- which 
                        means it could be used to justify 
                        much more aggressive 
                        interrogations.  And it says 
                        Congress is entirely disabled from 
                        controlling the President.  

                                PHILBIN
                        And it’s a secret opinion.

                                JACK
                        I’m revoking it.  I'll continue to 
                        support the specific techniques, pull 
                        out the generalizations, and reissue 
                        the opinion.  

           Silence.  They’re all concerned.

                        midstream like this...

                                JACK
                        I don’t like it either.  I'm not an 
                        expert on what our enemies are up 
                        to or what it'll take to stop them.  
                        It's not my job to tell you if a 
                        policy is wise... but it is my job 
                        to tell you if it’s legal.  

                                AYRES
                        And it’s not?

                                JACK
                        We’ve got laws in this country 
                        against torture.  

                                ASHCROFT
                        It’s the President’s prerogative to 
                        act aggressively in defense of the 
                        country.

                                JACK
                        Sure.  If they need to do this, and 
                        we need to authorize it...  So be 
                        it.  But we should do it carefully.  
                        Defense asked about specific 
                        techniques, that contain elaborate 
                        provisions for the safety of the 
                        detainee.  Meanwhile the OLC 
                        opinions are a blank check.  You 
                        want to write a blank check on 
                        torture?  

           Ashcroft doesn’t love any of this.  But, reluctantly...

                                ASHCROFT
                        Okay.  Take it down.

           Jack nods, grim.  But then there’s another thing.

                                JACK
                        I hate to push my luck here, but 
                        the memo answers questions posed to 
                        my office by the Department of 
                        Defense.  Not by the White House.  
                        For simplicity's sake, I would like 
                        to inform Defense of my plans.  
                        But... no one else.  

           It’s incredibly audacious.  Ashcroft’s pretty sure this guy’s 
           out of his fucking mind.

                        that, right?

           He does.  Reluctantly, Ashcroft nods his assent.

           Saturday.  Jack’s in casual clothing as he walks the stately 
           halls of the empty building.  His three-year-old son JACK 
           JR.’s at his side, holding his hand, trotting to keep up.  

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Jack sits his son in the big desk chair, puts a piece of 
           printer paper in front of him.  Gathers a pile of 
           highlighters, pens, post-its...

                                JACK
                        Blue or yellow?

                                JACK JR.
                        Both.

           The boy sets to work, peeling sticky notes off the stack.  
           Jack drops onto the couch, digging into the massive pile of 
           work that awaits him.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           The kid’s now asleep on the couch.  Jack’s in his desk chair.

           He points out the sleeping child.  Philbin lowers his voice.

                                PHILBIN
                        He working for us now?

                           (beat)
                        We should probably go out to the 
                        NSA again.  Talk to somebody on the 
                        operational side.  

           Jack stares at him, incredulous.  

                                JACK
                        I’m about to revoke a memo on 
                        prisoner interrogation.  You think 
                        I’m going to follow it with a 
                        ritual disemboweling of their 
                        surveillance program? 

           Philbin looks at the floor, cowed.  

                                PHILBIN
                        It expires next week.  NSA’ll send 
                        somebody over with the 
                        authorization for you and Ashcroft 
                        to sign.  You do it in Ashcroft’s

                        Fine.

           Philbin leaves.  Jack looks at his son.  This job is ruining 
           his life.

                        Yes I have. 

                                ASHCROFT
                        AMY!

                                NSA OFFICIAL
                        Initial here please.

           Jack does.  The Official hands the document to Ashcroft, who 
           scribbles his initials as well.  AMY appears at the door.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    52.

                                ASHCROFT
                        I had a briefing book right here -- 
                        I don’t know where it went.  

                                NSA OFFICIAL
                           (to Jack)
                        You’re now confirming with your 
                        signature that the constitutional 
                        standard of reasonableness has been 
                        met and you certify the 
                        authorization as to form and 
                        legality. 

                                ASHCROFT
                        Did Ayres make off with it?

                                AMY
                        I can ask him.

           Jack hesitates for a moment.  He’s sweating.  A wave of 
           nausea washing over him.  He glances up at Philbin, who knows  *
           exactly what he’s feeling.  He’s been trying to warn Jack, 
           and Jack never really got it, until now.

                                NSA OFFICIAL
                        Sir?

           Jack signs the document.  The Official whips the document out  *
           from under him and places in front of Ashcroft who signs, 
           distracted.  He calls to Amy who’s on her way out.

                                ASHCROFT
                        I clipped a buck slip to it, but I 
                        didn’t write anything on it, so 
                        look for briefing book with a blank 
                        buck slip.

           Jack looks like he’s gonna throw up.  He’s never signed his 
           name to a lie before.  

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jack and Patrick walk in silence.  Jack, shaken.  Finally--

                                JACK
                        We need to drive back out to the 
                        NSA, figure out what the hell 
                        they’re doing.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    53.

           INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           NSA employee WARREN leads Jack and Philbin into a secure 
           conference room that’s loaded with about 50 boxes of files.

                                WARREN
                        We printed it out so you could see 
                        what we’re dealing with.  I guess 
                        it’s all kind of abstract on your 
                        end.

           Philbin opens a box and starts pulling out files.  

                                JACK
                        This is everything since the 
                        inception of the surveillance 
                        program?

           Warren stares at him for a moment, puzzled by the stupidity 
           of the question.

                                WARREN
                        No, this is yesterday.  
                           (off the label on a box)
                        From 2 to 4.

           INT. PHILBIN’S CAR - DAY  

           Philbin pulls out of the NSA parking lot, and onto the 
           Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  Jack stares out the window, 
           disturbed by what they learned.  

                                JACK
                        Addington made it sound like they 
                        were tapping a couple phones.  Bin 
                        Laden’s in-laws in Tampa. 

                                PHILBIN
                        It’s grown, since they started.  

                                JACK
                        That’s what happens when you build 
                        a security program with massive 
                        capability and no oversight.  
                        Starts to look like the Stasi.  

                                PHILBIN
                        Maybe we can talk them into getting 
                        the FISA court involved.  Would 
                        that take some of the stink off it?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    54.

                                JACK
                        What takes the stink off is going 
                        public.  If it’s a national 
                        security imperative, you stand up  
                        in the village square, you say 
                        “We’re doing this, you’re not gonna 
                        like it, it violates at least two 
                        felony statutes, not to mention the 
                        Constitution, but we have to, to 
                        protect the country.”  You do it in 
                        the dark like this... 
                           (beat)
                        See if you can sketch out a fix 
                        from the FISA angle.  I’ll put 
                        together a proposal for 
                        congressional authorization.  Maybe 
                        we come up with some ideas on how 
                        to scale it back.  
                           (beat)
                        We should get the new guy read in.  
                        Comey.  See what he thinks.

                                PHILBIN
                        Cause you want his opinion or cause 
                        you want cover?

                                JACK
                        Both.  

                                PHILBIN
                        You tell Defense about the 
                        interrogation opinion yet?

                                JACK
                        Not yet.  This week.  I want to 
                        make the transition to the new 
                        guidelines as painless as possible.  
                           (beat)
                        I guess painless is the wrong word.

           He yanks a roll of Tums out of his pocket.  Pops a couple in 
           his mouth.  All of this makes him nauseous.  And he’s pissed 
           too.  Pissed at Philbin.  He finally looks at him.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Did you know how bad it was, before 
                        I got here?

                                PHILBIN
                        I didn’t know the extent of it.  

                                JACK
                        But you had a general idea.  And 
                        you didn’t say anything.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    55.

           Philbin’s quiet for a second.  

                                PHILBIN
                        I wanted to be Solicitor General.  
                        Thought I might be good at it.

                                JACK
                        You would.

                                PHILBIN
                        The minute I made Addington read 
                        you into the program... that was 
                        the end of it.  They’ll make sure I 
                        never get another promotion.

           That lands on Jack, hard.  It was a big sacrifice.

                                JACK
                        Why’d you do it?

                                PHILBIN
                           (beat)
                        I wasn’t sure why I should be 
                        Solicitor General if I’d repeatedly 
                        certified the legality of a 
                        document I believed to be 
                        unconstitutional.

                        to take over the investigation.

           Cheney doesn't seem to be listening.  He's on the phone.

                                CHENEY (INTO PHONE)
                        I want a translation of the al

           He hangs up as Libby blows into the office.

                        and could we have Comey read in, he 
                        said, “Fine, if you can talk

                        Where is it?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    58.

                                RUMSFELD
                        A prison outside Baghdad.
                           (looking at his notes)
                        Abu Ghraib. 

                                POWELL
                        Is this something to do with the 
                        new interrogation rules?

                                RUMSFELD
                        I don’t think so.  Defense is still 
                        adjusting to the new memo, but I 
                        doubt it’s related.  

           Cheney's been silent, but at “new memo” his eyes flicked up.  

                                CHENEY
                        What new memo?

           Rumsfeld looks up, confused.  Then surprised, as it becomes 
           clear Cheney was kept out of the loop on the new 
           interrogation memo.  They’re all putting it together -- 
           Ashcroft was involved in pulling a fast one. 

                                RUMSFELD
                        OLC revised an interrogation 
                        opinion for Defense.  Goldsmith.    
                        We’ll get you a copy.

           Rumsfeld makes like nothing’s wrong, and pushes forward.  
           Ashcroft’s working hard to look anywhere but at Dick Cheney.  

                                RUMSFELD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s start with Afghanistan.  I 
                        think we caught a break with the 
                        Loya Jirga ratifying the 
                        constitution...

           We’re on Cheney, looking at Ashcroft.  He was blindsided.  A 
           man who very much dislikes being blindsided.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Addington stalks the hallway.  Irate.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GONZALES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Jack's with Gonzales... 

                                GONZALES
                        The President wants to keep this 
                        close hold.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    59.

           ...when Addington blows in.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        Are you out of your mind?  You 
                        change the rules for interrogation 
                        in the middle of a war?  

                                JACK
                        I explained to Defense --

                                ADDINGTON
                        People are risking their lives to 
                        find out where the next attack on 
                        YOU is coming from.

                                JACK
                        There is not a single enumerated 
                        interrogation technique that’s off 
                        the table under the revised memo. 

                                ADDINGTON
                        People who think they might face 
                        criminal prosecution for doing 
                        their jobs... stop doing their 
                        jobs!  That’s why the CIA is the 
                        largest, best funded ineffectual 
                        agency in the history of the world!  
                        How do you think we got here in the 
                        first place??  The CIA, DOD, 
                        they’ve had decades of lawyers 
                        pulling their teeth out!

           Gonzales, thinking changing the subject might help...

                                GONZALES
                        Jack was hoping to read Jim Comey 
                        into the President’s Special 
                        Program.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        Absolutely not.

                                JACK
                        I could use a sounding board.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Comey’s extremely busy right now, 
                        investigating the White House.  

                                JACK
                        I’m sure he can --
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    60.

                                ADDINGTON
                        The President doesn’t want the 
                        circle to be any wider.

                                JACK
                        The President or the Vice 
                        President?

           Before it’s out of his mouth, Jack knows that was a mistake. 

           INT. DOJ - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Philbin finds Jack, just back from the White House.

                                PHILBIN
                        How’d it go?

           Before he can answer Comey strides by.  Energetic.

                                COMEY
                        Hey there.

           They wave and watch him go.  Jack and Philbin look like utter 
           hell.  Pale.  Bedraggled.  

                                JACK
                        ...That’ll wear off.  

                                PHILBIN
                        What did they say?

                                JACK
                        What do you think they said?

           They enter...

           INT. DOJ - JACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Philbin’s gripped with anxiety about all this.  

                                PHILBIN
                        Comey’s my boss, Jack.

                                JACK
                        And yet you’re in here a whole lot.

                                PHILBIN
                        Eventually he’s gonna notice I 
                        spend half my time driving out to 
                        the NSA.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    61.

           Jack’s digging a couple lint-covered aspirin out of his 
           jacket pocket.  He notices the pocket’s torn.

                                JACK
                        Goddammit.  

                                PHILBIN
                        I can’t even tell him what I’m 
                        working on.

                                JACK
                           (yells to Charlotte)
                        CAN I GET A DIET COKE IN HERE?

                                PHILBIN
                        He’s gonna think I’m lying, or 
                        hiding something from him.

                                JACK
                        That’s because you are.

                                PHILBIN
                        We need to have him read in. 

                                JACK
                        I tried!  Addington practically 
                        ripped off my face with his teeth.

           He pops a few aspirin in his mouth, washing them down with a 
           sip of yesterday’s coffee from a mug on his disaster of a 
           desk.  It’s even more disgusting than he’d anticipated.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Uch!  

           Charlotte is there now with the Diet Coke.  He tears into the 
           Coke can to wash down the bad coffee.  It’s a foul 
           combination.  He sinks into his chair, defeated.  By 
           everything.  Philbin places a document on Jack’s desk.

                                PHILBIN
                        Some possible fixes.

           Great.  That’ll be a big hit.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GONZALES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Addington stares at Jack, homicidal.  Gonzales braces himself 
           for the explosion.  They’re both holding copies of Philbin’s 
           document.

                                ADDINGTON
                        A piece of legislation??
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    62.

                                JACK
                        Just to shore it up.

                                ADDINGTON
                        It’s a secret program!  

                                JACK
                        Then you should take a look at 
                        option three -- we utilize the FISA 
                        court, they evaluate secret 
                        evidence, provide secret warrants.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Do you have any idea how slow they 
                        are??

                                JACK
                        So rework their procedures.

                                ADDINGTON
                        We are one bomb away from getting 
                        rid of that obnoxious court!

                                GONZALES
                        David.

                                JACK
                        Pick a branch of government -- any 
                        one.  I don’t care.  Just bring in 
                        somebody else!

                                ADDINGTON
                        That will destroy the Program’s--

                                JACK
                        No it won’t!  This isn’t about al 
                        Qaeda, it’s about the strength of 
                        the presidency -- and god bless, 
                        but you can’t slide an executive 
                        power declaration into every secret 
                        program you create and call it a 
                        national security imperative.  It 
                        starts to look a little Kim Jong 
                        Il.

           Beat.  That was ballsy, and Jack already regrets it.  It’s 
           the first time he’s revealed to Addington that this might be 
           about a bigger fight.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    63.

                                ADDINGTON
                        The President does not need 
                        anyone’s permission to defend this 
                        nation from the tens of thousands 
                        of individuals who are actively 
                        seeking to murder American 
                        citizens.  It is not his right, it 
                        is his responsibility, as 
                        articulated by the Constitution, to 
                        do whatever is necessary to prevent 
                        an attack.  And for some 
                        inexplicable reason, you are eager 
                        to tie his hands.  

           Jack feels the weight of that, and it’s terrible.  

                                JACK
                        I would desperately like to be 
                        wrong.  Let’s read in the Deputy 
                        Attorney General, and have him tell 
                        me I am.  That’ll be the end of it.  

           Addington finds Jack appalling.  But he realizes they’re at 
           an impasse, and this could get bigger than he wants it to. 

           INT. DOJ - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Jack’s walking Comey down the hall.  

                                JACK
                        Hayden’s the director of the NSA.  
                        He’s going to walk you through the 
                        program, because when you read it 
                        with David Addington staring at 
                        you, it can be hard to absorb.

                                COMEY
                        Relax!  It’s not my first 
                        classified program.

           He flashes a smile at Jack as he pushes into a conference 
           room.  Jack watches him, not at all relaxed.

           INT. DOJ - SECURE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Hayden’s affable, as he pulls out stacks of paper for the 
           briefing, and of course so is Comey.  

                                HAYDEN
                        I tell you, I couldn’t be happier 
                        you’re getting a read-in.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    64.

                                COMEY
                        Oh yeah?

                                HAYDEN
                        Now I won’t be alone at the table 
                        when John Kerry’s elected 
                        President!

                                COMEY
                        What table?

                                HAYDEN
                        Witness table.  Hearings.  
                        Congressional investigation.  At 
                        least we’ll have each other, 
                        right?!  

           It was a joke, but it’s got daunting implications.  Comey’s 
           starting to realize what Jack was so worked up about. 

           INT. DOJ - JACK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Philbin arrives to find Jack rifling through a drawer full of 
           Atkins bars.  They’re both anxious.  

                                PHILBIN
                        He’s still with Hayden?

                                JACK
                        Hayden left, now he’s reading the 
                        opinions that back it up.  You want 
                        a bar?  

                                PHILBIN
                           (they’re disgusting)
                        I really don’t.

           That’s when they notice Comey in the doorway.  The smile’s 
           finally lost a few watts.  

                                COMEY
                        Without a warrant?

           Philbin shuts the door.

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        This is what brought down Nixon.

                                PHILBIN
                        Phones, email.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    65.

                                COMEY
                        The opinions... I mean, I’m sure 
                        they make sense once you unwind 
                        them.

                                JACK
                        Then how come they don’t want any 
                        lawyers reading them? 

           Comey shakes his head, mystified.

                                COMEY
                        If there’s no need for probable 
                        cause, what’s the criteria for the 
                        program looking at someone?  

                                PHILBIN
                        We don’t know.

                                COMEY
                        We need to know; we need specific 
                        answers.  Anybody tells you you’re 
                        not authorized to hear what they’re 
                        really doing, you send them to me.  

                                JACK
                        And then what?  We’ve pitched every 
                        fix you can imagine, Addington and 
                        Gonzales won’t even consider them.  

                                COMEY
                        Once we know exactly what they’re 
                        doing, we can evaluate.  Maybe it 
                        doesn’t need to be changed, maybe 
                        it’s just that the opinions are a 
                        mess.  That’s not the end of the 
                        world.

           Jack and Philbin trade a look.  They’ve been in this for a 
           while, they’d be surprised if that was the case.  But they’ll  *
           try again.

           INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY  

           Jack and Philbin are with Warren again.  He’s speaking 
           quietly, even though he’s in a secure room, in a secure 
           building.  He can’t quite believe he’s saying this out loud.

                                WARREN
                        Before 9-11, we developed a program 
                        called Thin Thread.  It analyzed 
                        networks of people.  
                                (MORE)
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    66.

                                WARREN (CONT'D)
                        We know you’re a bad guy, we look 
                        at who you’re emailing, and then we 
                        know they might be bad too.  We 
                        used it to find new suspects, 
                        uncover new plots.  All over the 
                        world.  And we did that by 
                        analyzing basically every 
                        electronic transmission.

                                JACK
                        ...in the world?

                                WARREN
                        We have a really big computer.

           That’s an understatement.

                                WARREN (CONT’D)
                        But we never looked at domestic 
                        communication.  And if somebody 
                        overseas was emailing somebody 
                        here, the domestic side was 
                        automatically encrypted.  We 
                        couldn’t see the name, the address, 
                        nothing.  

                                PHILBIN
                        So what changed?

                                WARREN
                        After 9-11, they realized they 
                        needed a way to find the bad guys 
                        they didn’t know about.  Here.

                                PHILBIN
                        How did you decide who to look at?

           Warren hesitates.

                                JACK
                        Comey talked to Hayden -- this is 
                        supposed to be the whole story.

                                WARREN
                           (beat)
                        They don’t “decide who to look at.”   
                        It was like we had a valve that 
                        shut off all the domestic flow.  We 
                        opened the valve.  And removed the 
                        encryption.  And then fed it into 
                        the program.  
                           (beat)
                        All of it.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    67.

           Jack and Philbin can’t believe what they’re hearing.  It’s 
           breathtaking.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - JACK’S OFFICE - EVENING  

           Philbin’s sitting.  Jack’s on the phone with Comey.  On his 
           feet.  Beside himself.

                                JACK (INTO PHONE)
                        No, you don’t understand -- it’s 
                        not that they can look at anyone.  
                        It’s that they are looking at 
                        everyone!

                                COMEY (O.S.)
                        How is that even possible?

                                JACK (INTO PHONE)
                        All of the communication in the 
                        country!  And then they keep it -- 
                        INDEFINITELY.

                                PHILBIN
                        Jack.

           Jack looks at Philbin.  Philbin silently mouths You shouldn’t  *
           talk about it on the phone.

                                JACK
                        I can’t hear you, speak up.

           Philbin tries again.  But Jack’s not much of a lip reader.

                                JACK (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Patrick’s mouthing things at me.
                           (to Philbin)
                        It’s just Comey -- talk out loud!

           Patrick doesn’t.  He grabs a piece of paper and scribbles 
           something.  Then he holds it up for Jack.

                                COMEY (O.S.)
                        What’s his problem.  Jack.  Jack?

           But Jack’s silent.  Frozen.  Starting at the paper in 
           Philbin’s hand.  It reads THEY TAP PHONES.

           EXT. BENCH - NIGHT  

           Jack and Comey sit on a bench on a deserted street.  They 
           feel like fucking idiots. 
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    68.

                                JACK
                        Patrick’s paranoid.  

                                COMEY
                        Yeah.  But you know what they 
                        say... just cause you’re paranoid, 
                        doesn’t mean the government’s not 
                        tapping your phone, bugging your 
                        office, and reading your email.

           It’s a joke.  But only kind of.  Jack, joking too...

                                JACK
                        We should come up with a code.  

                                COMEY
                        Right.  Call it the Hydrangea 
                        Initiative.

                                JACK
                        We’ll meet here on days you’ve got 
                        a flower in your lapel.

           Comey smiles.  But then the fun drains out of the moment.  
           Because underneath it all, they’re genuinely horrified.

                                COMEY
                        Everybody?

           Jack nods.  

                                JACK
                        At first it just sounded weird.  A 
                        national security program written 
                        by Cheney’s lawyer, the OLC 
                        opinions are a mess, they don’t 
                        want anybody to read it... It 
                        looked like a gross violation of 
                        protocol.  But now... they’re way 
                        outside the law.  On a massive 
                        scale.

           Fuck.  Comey was hoping he wouldn’t have to take this on.  
           And it’s just getting bigger.

           EXT. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           INT. CIA - SCOTT MULLER’S OFFICE - NIGHT  

           Comey shakes hands with SCOTT MULLER, CIA General Counsel.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    69.

                                COMEY
                        Sorry to be dropping by so late.

           He’s about to sit, when he realizes something.

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a secure conference 
                        room we can sit in?

           Scott smiles at the newbie.  

                                SCOTT MULLER
                        The paranoia passes, few weeks.

           Comey nods.  But he’s not gonna sit down.  Weary, Scott rises. *

           INT. CIA - SECURE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER  

           Scott’s been listening for a while, with growing concern.

                                SCOTT MULLER
                        They can’t be sifting through all 
                        the electronic communication in the 
                        country.

           But Comey’s look says they are.

                                SCOTT MULLER (CONT’D)
                        So every time anybody follows one 
                        of these leads, they’re violating 
                        the 4th amendment?

                                COMEY
                        And possibly the 1st.  And the 5th.

                                SCOTT MULLER
                        Christ.

                                COMEY
                        Unless we’re missing something.  
                        I’d be happy to hear we’ve analyzed 
                        this all wrong.

           Scott shakes his head.

                                SCOTT MULLER
                        I had doubts about it from the get 
                        go.  

                                COMEY
                        And you... did you say anything?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    70.

                                SCOTT MULLER
                        I wasn’t sure how to-- I mean, the 
                        VP’s office is...

           He was too scared.  And he’s embarrassed to admit it.

                                SCOTT MULLER (CONT’D)
                        You talk to anyone at the FBI about 
                        this?

                                COMEY
                        Not yet.

           Scott picks up a phone on the table.

                                SCOTT MULLER (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey, it’s Scott over at CIA.  Yeah, 
                        Jim Comey’s gonna need to sit down 
                        with somebody over there--

                                COMEY
                        With the Director.

                        With the Director.  As soon as 
                        possible.  

           INT. FBI - OUTER OFFICE/DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT  

           Comey enters ROBERT MUELLER’s office.  Muller and Mueller 
           have unfortunately similar names, but Robert Mueller’s the 
           Director the goddamn FBI, and we’ll know it because Comey’s 
           visibly deferential as he shakes Mueller’s hand and settles 
           in a chair across from his imposing desk, and also because 
           when an assistant shuts the door we’ll see a plaque on it 
           that says ROBERT MUELLER.  DIRECTOR.  FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
           INVESTIGATION.  Comey’s taking this all the way up the chain.   *

           INT. DOJ - ASHCROFT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Comey and Ashcroft.  

                                COMEY
                        Goldsmith and Philbin turned the

                        they understand it better than the 
                        Director of the NSA does.  I spoke 
                        to the Director of the FBI--

                        You talked to Bob Mueller?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    71.

                                COMEY
                        And the General Counsel of the CIA.  
                        It’s the biggest mess any of us 
                        have ever seen.  And it’s got some 
                        constitutional implications that 
                        are... deeply disturbing.

           Ashcroft shakes his head.  It’s daunting, the whole thing.

                                ASHCROFT
                        The program expires when? 

                                COMEY
                        In a week.  If the White House 
                        agrees to make some changes, we can 
                        try and fix it.  If not... I’m 
                        recommending you do not re-certify.  

           Ashcroft’s overwhelmed by the ramifications of that advice.

           EXT. DOJ - COURTYARD - DAY

           Comey finds Jack walking across the courtyard, past staffers 
           sitting at outdoor tables with Starbucks cups.  

                                COMEY
                        Jack.  

           Jack stops, and Comey catches up.

                                COMEY (CONT'D)
                        The, uh... Hydrangea Initiative?

           Jack smiles.  Nods. 

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        Make a list.  If they don’t agree 
                        to every change, Ashcroft’s not 
                        gonna sign it.  

           Jack can’t believe what he’s hearing.  

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s speaking at a conference this 
                        afternoon.  Have something on his 
                        desk by the time he gets back.

           Comey leaves.  Jack’s flooded with relief.  It’s almost 
           inconceivable.  He actually won.  Things are looking up.  

           That's when the shit really hits the fan.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    72.

           INT. GREEN ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ashcroft's reviewing his speech when he feels a sharp pain in 
           the upper right side of his abdomen.  His aide, MARK, is 
           nearby, glued to his Blackberry.

                                ASHCROFT
                        Mark, get me some water.

           Mark checks out a table that’s got soda, Odwalla...

                                MARK
                        Mango Tango?  Mo’ Beta?

                                ASHCROFT
                        Water.

                                MARK
                        Copy that.  

           Mark heads out to investigate.  Ashcroft’s sucking slow 
           breaths.  He’s in real pain. 

           INT. HALLWAY/GREEN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mark ambles down the hall with a female INTERN, each carrying 
           a few water bottles.  Mark’s working the Department of 
           Justice angle.  

                                MARK
                        When I got the job, I started 
                        telling people I worked for the 
                        Justice League of America.

                                INTERN
                        Really?

                                MARK
                        Nobody questions it.  

                                INTERN
                        You’re lying.

                                MARK
                        I’m not, people do not know the 
                        difference.

           The intern’s not laughing though, because they just entered 
           the green room and she spotted the Attorney General of the 
           United States flat on his back on the floor.  Dropping the 
           bottles and running in--
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    73.

                                MARK (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.

           EXT. WASHINGTON STREETS - AFTERNOON

           An ambulance SCREAMING through the streets.  Police escort. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIBBY’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Cheney's on the video screen, scrutinizing a speech draft as 
           Libby and a terrified SPEECHWRITER take notes.  Cheney's in 
           an undisclosed location (his home in Wyoming).  He's speaking 
           at the upcoming Gridiron Dinner, and this poor schmuck got 
           tasked with writing the jokes.  Demonstrating one...

                                SPEECHWRITER
                        “I felt a tightness in my chest.  I 
                        started gasping for air and 
                        breathing irregularly.  Then I 
                        realized... it's called laughing.”

           Crickets.

                                SPEECHWRITER (CONT’D)
                        Cause a bunch of reporters’ll do 
                        skits before you go up.  So it’s 
                        like maybe you laughed at one of 
                        them.  But you didn’t know what it 
                        was.  Cause you don’t laugh.

           The guy’s pretty sure he’s about to be the Admiral that Darth 
           Vader suffocates to death with a glance.

                                CHENEY (ON SCREEN)
                        I followed it.  I just wasn’t sure 
                        it was funny.

                                LIBBY
                        This thing about duck hunting with 
                        Scalia’s a little close to the 
                        bone. 

                                SPEECHWRITER
                        I can take it out.

                                CHENEY (ON SCREEN)
                        Leave it.  

           Libby’s AIDE KNOCKS and walks in a note.  

                                AIDE
                        Excuse me, gentlemen.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    74.

           She holds it up to the video camera so only Cheney can see.   
           Cheney reads it.  Shakes his head.

                                CHENEY (ON SCREEN)
                        Scooter.

           She hands the note to Libby.

           INT. DOJ - LOBBY - DAY

           Ayres, Goldsmith, Comey huddle in the cavernous lobby.  

                                AYRES
                        Severe gallstone pancreatitis.  
                        They rushed him to the ICU.  
                        They’re trying to figure out if 
                        they should operate.  

                                COMEY
                        What happens now?

                                AYRES
                        When the Attorney General’s 
                        disabled, his Deputy becomes Acting 
                        Attorney General.  

           Jack looks at Comey.

                                JACK
                        You’re the Attorney General now.

           Comey hadn’t thought of that until Ayres said it.  It takes 
           him a second.  

                                AYRES
                        You should probably put that in 
                        writing.  Copy the White House.

           Jack nods.  Ayres leaves.  Comey stops Jack.  Quiet...

                                COMEY
                        We’re gonna have a problem with 
                        the, uh... Hydrangea Initiative.  

           This time it’s not a joke.

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        Ashcroft said he wasn’t gonna sign.  
                        But he didn’t write it down.  He 
                        didn’t tell anybody but me.  The 
                        thing’s gonna expire in a week.  If 
                        he’s still incapacitated...

           They share a look.  Now they’re really fucked.  

           EXT. AIR FORCE TWO - DAY

           Addington and Gonzales rush up the stairs to the Vice 
           President’s plane.

           INT. AIR FORCE TWO - CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cheney’s at the desk in his Air Force Two office as Addington 
           and Gonzales reluctantly bring him and Libby up to speed.

                                CHENEY
                        What kind of problem?

                                GONZALES
                        Goldsmith’s not 100% convinced it’s 
                        all legal.  

           Addington’s not delighted he was that bald about it.

                                ADDINGTON
                        He wants Congress holding his hand, 
                        is what it comes down to.

                                CHENEY
                        Wasn’t he supposed to be an 
                        advocate of a strong presidency?  

                                ADDINGTON
                        Apparently when push comes to 
                        shove, he’s all about the 
                        legislature.

                                CHENEY
                        And you told him no?  

                                ADDINGTON
                        Sure.  But now, with Ashcroft...   

           Cheney is not pleased.  With the situation.  With his staff.

                                CHENEY
                        I want a memo from Justice that 
                        says John Yoo’s opinions covered 
                        the program.  

                                GONZALES
                        Based on Goldsmith’s analysis or--
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    76.

                                CHENEY
                        I don’t want a new opinion -- I 
                        want it clear, in writing, that the 
                        prior opinions had concluded the 
                        program was legal.  We don’t need 
                        to rehash old work.  

           Addington and Gonzales head for the door.

           INT. DOJ - JACK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Comey, Goldsmith, Philbin in a sea of paper, dotted with take-
           out trash.  They've been at it for hours.  Bleary eyed.

                                JACK
                        We can’t give him the memo he’s 
                        asking for.  There’s no way.  

           Comey just noticed there’s a CD playing in Jack’s office.

                                COMEY
                        Can we kill the music?  My head’s 
                        pounding.

           Jack glances at Philbin, embarrassed.  Comey realizes...

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re worried they bugged the 
                        office.

                                JACK
                        It’s stupid.  I can turn it off.

                                COMEY
                        Leave it on.

           He thinks they’re crazy, but unfortunately he’s not sure.  

                                PHILBIN
                        What’s he gonna say when you tell 
                        him no memo?

                                COMEY
                        What’s he gonna say when I tell him 
                        I’m not signing the reauthorization?

           Jack never imagined Comey would take it this far.

                                JACK
                        You’re really not signing it?

                                COMEY
                        I told Ashcroft not to, how am I 
                        supposed to sign it myself?

                                JACK
                        I thought it was supposed to be a 
                        threat. You don’t sign it, it shuts 
                        down.  This is the eyes and ears of 
                        the counterterrorism program.  It’s 
                        how we spot the next attack.  

                                COMEY
                        What exactly is the alternative?

                                JACK
                        I want to rein it in, or build in 
                        some oversight.  Not shut it down.

                                COMEY
                        You got a fix you’re keeping under 
                        your hat?  That they haven’t 
                        already rejected?  Cause now’s the 
                        time!

                                PHILBIN
                        They’ll cave.  They have to.  It’s 
                        too important.  They’ll make the 
                        changes.

           Comey and Jack look at him, hoping he’s right.  Pissed at 
           each other.  At themselves.  They can’t believe they’re in 
           this fucking mess.  It’s all gotten way out of control.

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE - JACK JR.’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Leslie comes into her three-year-old's room to find her 
           husband sitting on the floor, staring at his sleeping son in 
           the tiny bed.  She sits on the floor next to him.  

                                JACK
                        He’s bigger.  

                                LESLIE
                        He eats.  All the time.

           This is what they can talk about.  They never see each other.  
           He can’t talk about what’s actually going on in his life.  

                                JACK
                        Am I missing his whole childhood?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    78.

                                LESLIE
                        A bunch of it, yeah.

                                JACK
                        I didn’t want to be this kind of 
                        father.

           Beat.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid I’m about to do 
                        something stupid.  And dangerous.

                                LESLIE
                        Then don’t do it.

                                JACK
                        I think I have to.  Maybe it’s not 
                        dangerous, maybe it’s just an ugly, 
                        extremely high stakes game of 
                        chicken.  

                                LESLIE
                        Are you winning or losing?

                                JACK
                        I don’t know.  Either way I’m gonna 
                        make a lot of people angry.  

                                LESLIE
                        So they fire you.  It’s okay.  

                                JACK
                        They can’t fire me.  It’ll look 
                        bad.

                                LESLIE
                        Then what can they do?

                                JACK
                        They ruin people.  Reputations.  
                        They’ll ruin my whole career.    

           It’s true.  And he’s terrified.  They both are.  She takes 
           his hand.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

           It’s Saturday.  Goldsmith and Philbin walk the empty halls. 
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    79.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GONZALES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Jack and Philbin just stated their position, and there's a 
           silence as Gonzales and Addington try to digest the 
           information.  They simply can't fucking believe it.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        You’re not recertifying the program.

                                JACK
                        Not unless we’re able to make some 
                        changes.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Are you out of your mind??

                                GONZALES
                        Okay, let’s take a minute and--

           But Addington just explodes.

                                ADDINGTON 
                        There will be bodies in the 
                        streets!  

                                GONZALES
                        David.

                                ADDINGTON
                        If you rule this way, the blood of 
                        the 100,000 people who die in the 
                        next attack will be on your hands!  

                                JACK
                        I understand that.  I wish I 
                        didn’t.  If the President wants to 
                        overrule me and act...

           He's trying to find the right word, and it's delicate, 
           because it's quite an accusation.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        ...extra-legally... That is his 
                        prerogative.

           Addington’s simply astonished.  This is the most reckless act  *
           he’s ever seen.  

           EXT. WASHINGTON STREETS - NIGHT

           The Vice President’s motorcade glides through the city.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    80.

           INT. CHENEY’S LIMO - NIGHT

           Gonzales rides with Cheney to the Gridiron Dinner. 

                                GONZALES
                        Justice says they can’t recertify 
                        unless we make some amendments.  

           The light in Cheney's eyes disappears.  

                                GONZALES (CONT’D)
                        I can take you through it, much of 
                        the Program will remain intact--

           Cheney fixes Gonzales with a look.

                                CHENEY
                        The Program was designed by a 
                        wartime President to protect a 
                        vulnerable nation from imminent 
                        attack.  The Constitution grants 
                        the President that authority.  We 
                        are not changing the Program.  

           INT. GRIDIRON DINNER - NIGHT

           Cheney on-stage, in white-tie and tails.  A packed house. 

                                CHENEY
                        At one point during your skits, I 
                        had a little scare.  I felt a 
                        tightness in my chest.  I started 
                        gasping for air and breathing 
                        irregularly.  Then I realized it's 
                        called laughing.

           The whole place breaks up.  He’s killing it.  Pitch perfect.

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        Lots of familiar faces here 
                        tonight.  I always feel a genuine 
                        bond whenever I see Senator 
                        Clinton.  She's the only person 
                        who's the center of more conspiracy 
                        theories than I am.

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN

           Jack’s on the phone.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    81.

                                GONZALES (O.S.)
                        Jack, it’s Al.  I wondered if we 
                        could sit down for a few minutes.  

                                JACK (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m sorry, sir, I don’t think 
                        there’s much I can do at this 
                        point.

                                GONZALES (O.S.)
                        Hey, come on. 

                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. GONZALES’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Gonzales is working it, hard.  This is incredibly stressful 
           for him too.  He was supposed to be handling this.  

                                GONZALES (INTO PHONE)
                        Just you and me.  No Addington.  I 
                        know he can be tough to talk to.  
                        Let’s just have a conversation.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GONZALES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Gonzales sits with Jack.   

                                GONZALES
                        Give us a 30 day bridge.  So we can 
                        get past the reauthorization on 
                        Thursday.  Get Ashcroft back on his 
                        feet.  

                                JACK
                        Ashcroft shares our concerns.

                                GONZALES
                        Then he’ll say so the minute he 
                        comes back.  You’ve signed it 
                        before.

                                JACK
                        I wasn’t sure before.  I hadn’t 
                        fully unravelled it.  And now I 
                        have, and I’m telling you, you’ve 
                        got half the government illegally 
                        surveilling the American people.

                                GONZALES
                        It’s 30 days, Jack.  You owe it to 
                        the President.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    82.

           This is brutal.  Al's such a nice guy.  And he invoked the 
           President, which makes it a lot harder.  

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

           Addington’s waiting when the Vice President’s motorcade pulls 
           up and Cheney steps out.  Addington shakes his head no.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cheney drops his coat, briefcase.  Pissed.  Card, Addington, 
           and Gonzales await instruction.

                                CHENEY
                        I want the head of every agency 
                        that touches the program in a room.  
                        CIA, NSA, FBI.  See if we can't 
                        clear up who runs the store around 
                        here.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ANDY CARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cheney, Card, Addington, Gonzales, joined by the directors of 
           the CIA, FBI, NSA -- Tenet, Robert Mueller, Hayden.  This is 
           the meeting before the meeting.  Cheney cuts to the chase.

                                CHENEY
                        The new Deputy Attorney General got 
                        handed the keys to the car when 
                        Ashcroft went into the hospital.  
                        Apparently he feels the need to 
                        take it out for a spin and run 
                        something over.  It’s obviously not 
                        an option.  If the Department of 
                        Justice won’t cooperate, the 
                        President may have to reauthorize 
                        the program without their blessing.  

           Cheney’s expecting nods, and gets them from Hayden and Tenet.   *

                                MUELLER
                        I could have a problem with that.

           Cheney fixes his gaze on Mueller, not unlike a man who 
           spotted a fly that managed to slip in the screen door.  
           Mueller's a tough guy, but even he finds that gaze unnerving.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    83.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OUTSIDE CARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           The DOJ team waits - Comey, Goldsmith, Philbin.  So tense 
           they can't speak.  Card opens his door.  

                                CARD
                        Come on in, guys.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - ANDY CARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           The big dogs arrayed around a table for maximum impact.  
           Cheney at the head.  Comey next to him.  Mueller, who dared 
           question the plan, at the far end, out of Comey's eye-shot.  

                                CHENEY
                        This program is vital.  Turning it 
                        off would leave us blind.  It is a 
                        profound mistake.  

                                HAYDEN
                        It’s the only real hope we have of 
                        discovering sleeper agents before 
                        they act.

                                COMEY
                        I understand that.

                                CHENEY
                        You couldn’t possibly.  You’re 
                        risking thousands of lives.  How 
                        can you reverse course on something 
                        this important after all this time?

           Cheney’s incredulous.  The intimidation factor is crushing.  

                                COMEY
                        The program has to operate within 
                        the law.  

                                CHENEY
                        It does -- as the Attorney General 
                        has confirmed, with his signature, 
                        twenty times.  

                                COMEY
                        We know a lot more about it than we 
                        did before.  General Ashcroft and I 
                        reached this decision together.  
                        Right before he fell ill.

           An uncomfortable pause.  Comey’s aware the timing looks bad.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    84.

                        I accept for purposes of this 
                        discussion that it’s as valuable as 
                        you say it is.  That only makes 
                        this more painful.  But it doesn’t 
                        change the analysis.  

                                CHENEY
                        How is that possible?

                                COMEY
                        If I can’t find a lawful basis for 
                        something, you telling me you 
                        really really need to do it doesn’t 
                        help me.

                                CHENEY
                        Well, others see it differently.

           He’s talking about Addington, and Comey knows it.

                                COMEY
                        That analysis is flawed.  In fact 
                        facially flawed.  No lawyer reading 
                        that could reasonably rely on it.

                                ADDINGTON
                        I’m a lawyer and I did.

                                COMEY
                        No good lawyer.

           That sucks the air out of the room.  Addington’s standing by 
           the wall.  He takes a step forward.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        We have a Congressional resolution 
                        that authorizes the President to 
                        wage war on al Qaeda.  The 
                        Constitution empowers the President 
                        to do what is necessary in an 
                        emergency to save the country.  
                        That’s the whole conversation.  

           Jack’s been hugging the wall, hoping Comey would prevail.  
           But now Addington’s on his turf.  So right there in front of 
           the big guys, he steps in.

                                JACK
                        It isn’t, actually -- we can’t 
                        jettison the Fourth Amendment and 
                        three criminal statutes.

            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    85.

                                JACK (CONT'D)
                        Particularly when there’s an extant 
                        court, whose sole purpose is to 
                        provide warrants--

                                ADDINGTON
                        We’re talking about ticking bombs, 
                        we don’t have time for FISA.

                                JACK
                        If the FISA process is too slow, 
                        change it.  We can’t run a program 
                        of this magnitude with no 
                        oversight.  The towers aren’t 
                        burning.  Two years in, it’s our 
                        job to consider a system prone to 
                        abuses.

                                ADDINGTON
                        We’re getting terrorist threat 
                        information right now that is more 
                        frightening than at any time since 
                        9/11.  Nothing has slowed down.

                                JACK
                        Then the President is free to act 
                        extra-legally.  Roosevelt did it, 
                        Lincoln -- 

                                ADDINGTON
                        Honestly...

                                JACK
                        State of emergency.  Lincoln raised 
                        armies, suspended habeas corpus -- 
                        extra-legally.  But he informed 
                        Congress.

                                ADDINGTON
                        Roosevelt and Lincoln didn’t face 
                        anything like the Congressional 
                        restrictions on President Bush.  

                                JACK
                        Right -- and that’s what we’re 
                        really talking about.  But we 
                        should avoid confusing a state of 
                        emergency with an aggressive 
                        program to expand presidential 
                        power for its own sake.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        For its own sake??
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    86.

                                JACK
                        If it’s not about that, if the 
                        program is a legitimate response to 
                        an immediate crisis... tell 
                        Congress.

                                ADDINGTON
                        We can’t tell 535 individuals the 
                        intricacies of our counterterrorism 
                        practices -- we might as well 
                        publish them in the New York Times!

                                JACK
                        So change the program!

                                CHENEY
                        We’re not changing the program.

           It’s quiet.  And final.  Everyone in the room thinks Jack 
           just made some great points.  But nobody thinks that will 
           change anything.  Cheney spoke.  And that’s the end of it.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE GATE - DAY

           Comey, Philbin, and Jack storm out of the White House and up 
           the drive.  After a beat Comey stops.

                                COMEY
                        I was clear, right?  I told the man 
                        he was breaking the law.  And that 
                        he was asking me to break the law.

                                JACK
                        Yes.

                                COMEY
                        And he told me to do it anyway.  
                        That’s what happened.  

           Jack nods.  Comey barrels on.  He was worried before.  
           Scared.  Now he’s just pissed off.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Cheney, Card, Gonzales.  Cheney digs through a pile on his 
           desk, dealing with other matters, but Card won't let it drop.  

                                CARD
                        We need to tell the President.  
                        We’ve got a day before the thing 
                        expires.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    87.

                                CHENEY
                        We’re handling it.

                                CARD
                        He knows it’s under discussion.  
                        Doesn’t he?  He knows they have a 
                        problem.

                                CHENEY
                        Andy, your job is to keep things 
                        off his plate.  

                                CARD
                        He doesn’t know?

                                CHENEY
                        You want to march into the Oval and 
                        tell him there’s a palace coup at 
                        the Department of Justice?  I 
                        prefer to handle it.  

           Cheney returns to his paperwork, confident that he’s handling  *
           it.  Card doesn’t look so sure.  But the conversation’s over.   *

           EXT. CONSTITUTION AVENUE - MORNING

                                TITLE: WEDNESDAY

           Philbin’s on the corner when Jack comes down the street on 
           his way to the office.  They walk in silence for a beat.  

                                PHILBIN
                        What if we’re wrong.

                                JACK
                        You think we are?

                                PHILBIN
                        No.  But, maybe it doesn’t matter. 

                                JACK
                        Maybe we're legalistic, pin-headed 
                        little fucks who are compromising 
                        the safety of the nation?

                                PHILBIN
                        Yeah.

                                JACK
                        It’s entirely possible.

                                PHILBIN
                        We could give it another 45 days.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    88.

           Jack finally stops.

                                JACK
                        Do you or do you not think the 
                        President is subject to the rule of 
                        law?  

           Philbin’s silent.  Yes, is the answer.

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, me too.

           Philbin starts walking toward the building.  Jack’s not 
           walking with him.  Philbin notices.

                                PHILBIN
                        You coming?

           Jack’s taking big slow breaths.  Trying to get his heart rate  *
           to slow down.  The stress it getting to him.

                                PHILBIN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Jack nods.  

                                JACK
                        This happens lately.  It just takes 
                        a minute to... catch my breath. 

           Philbin’s worried about him.  So is Jack, but he’s covering.   *
           He presses on, toward the DOJ building.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOBBY - MORNING

           Comey enters the White House, there for the President's Daily 
           Briefing.  He passes Hayden and Mueller huddled together, 
           speaking in hushed tones, silencing when anyone comes near.  
           They look worried.  Comey's a wreck.  He’s about to take this 
           thing over the edge of the cliff.  He continues on into the--

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OVAL - CONTINUOUS

           Comey spots FRAN TOWNSEND, a friend who works for Rice.  
           She’s waiting for the Briefing too.  

                                FRAN
                        I didn’t read the position paper 
                        you sent -- do you really care or 
                        were you copying me to be polite?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    89.

                                COMEY
                        I was being polite.  I need to ask 
                        you something.

           He glances over his shoulder to see if this corner’s private 
           enough.  It’ll have to do.

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        I'm gonna say a phrase and I want 
                        you to tell me if you recognize it.  
                        Stellar Wind.  Surveillance...  

                                FRAN
                        Is this the Vice President’s thing?  

           He nods.

                                FRAN (CONT'D)
                        I’ve heard whispers, but I don’t 
                        know what it is.  And I’m pretty 
                        sure I shouldn’t have this 
                        conversation.

                                COMEY
                        You’re the President’s 
                        counterterrorism advisor.

                                FRAN
                        I can’t have this conversation.

                                COMEY
                        I need you to find out if your boss 
                        recognizes that name.  

                                FRAN
                        Condi’s not gonna tell me about a--

                                COMEY
                        I just need to know if she’s read 
                        in.

           Fran doesn’t want to get into this, but Comey looks panicked.  
           And he’s not a guy who panics.

           DOWN THE HALL

           Cheney walks with Card toward the Oval, passing Hayden and 
           Mueller, and then Comey and Townsend.  Everyone abruptly 
           hushes as Cheney and Card pass.    

                                CARD
                        We have Caesar’s conspirators in 
                        every corner. You still want to

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           End of the Briefing.  

                                BRIEFER
                        ...there have been statements 
                        already from the five British 
                        citizens we released yesterday from 
                        Guantanamo -- fairly, uh, detailed 
                        accounts of alleged mistreatment.  
                        We should expect some blowback.

                                CHENEY
                        My office will put together a 
                        response.

                                CARD
                        Are we considering any adjustments?  

                                BUSH
                        At Gitmo?

           Card was reluctant to even raise it, so he doesn’t nod so 
           much as half-shrug.

                                CHENEY
                        We respond.  Doesn't mean we change 
                        policy.  It's a prison, no one's 
                        surprised to hear they had a bad 
                        experience.  

           Card considers questioning this, but thinks better of it.

                                BUSH
                        S’that it?  Alright.  Skedaddle.

           The crowd disperses.  Comey glances back, wondering if anyone 
           is going to say anything.  No.  He exits.  

                                CHENEY
                        Andy.

           Card was leaving, but now he hangs back.  He and Cheney are 
           the only ones left with Bush.  Bush is at his desk, looking 
           at a letter he read earlier.

                                BUSH
                        Jenna wants to come out on the 
                        campaign trail with me.  She wrote 
                        a letter.  Isn’t that something?  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    91.

           He's moved.  A hint of tears in his eyes.  Cheney musters a 
           moment of patience for an emotional display he considers out 
           of place in this office.  And then re-directs the president 
           back toward business.  Offhand.  Casual.  

                                CHENEY
                        Sir, the Terrorist Surveillance 
                        Program expires today.  All of a 
                        sudden, the Deputy Attorney 
                        General’s got a bug up his rear 
                        about it.  He’d like to make some 
                        changes.  

                                BUSH
                        Do we support that idea?

           Cheney shakes his head no.

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Why’d he wait till the day the 
                        thing expires to pipe up?

           Card looks to Cheney, expecting him to mention they’ve been 
           complaining about this for months, but Cheney’s silent.  

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        People don’t think.  You notice 
                        that?  Have Al work it out with 
                        Ashcroft.  

           Cheney nods and turns to leave.  Bush is going through papers  *
           on his desk.  Card’s worried enough to jump in.

                                CARD
                        They have some concerns that may be 
                        hard to skirt.

                                BUSH
                        It’s just the one guy or a whole 
                        bunch?

                                CARD
                        It’s more than one.

                                BUSH
                        So sit down with the congressional 
                        leadership, let ‘em know Justice is 
                        getting hinky and we don’t like it.

                                CHENEY
                        We don’t really need congressional 
                        approval to--
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    92.

                                BUSH
                        They know, don’t they?  Didn’t we 
                        brief the leadership on this thing?

           Cheney nods.

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to Columbus--

                        Cleveland.

                                BUSH
                        Whatever.  Another goddamn stump 
                        speech.  Sit with the leadership.  
                        Send ‘em my regrets.  

           Bush is out the door.  Card looks at Cheney, who didn't 
           particularly drive home the gravity of the situation.  

                                CARD
                        Does he know Ashcroft’s in the 
                        hospital?
                           (beat)
                        How exactly does Al work it out 
                        with him?

           Cheney breezes past Card.

                                CHENEY
                        You wanted him to know.  Now he 
                        knows.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - GONZALES’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cheney's in the doorway, Card on his heels.  They find 
           Gonzales at his desk.

           INT. DOJ - COMEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jack and Philbin were summoned.  Comey’s getting ready to 
           leave.

                                COMEY
                        Cheney called a meeting with the 
                        Gang of Eight.  To talk about the 
                        Program.

                                JACK
                           (beat)
                        Did we just win a round?

           Comey’s reticent to gloat, but yeah, it looks like they did.

                                COMEY
                        I’m on my way over there, you want 
                        to go through the bullet with me?

           That’s when COMEY’S AIDE enters.

                                COMEY’S AIDE
                        Sorry.  I called the White House to 
                        say you were coming, they said you 
                        don’t have to.

                                COMEY
                        ...I don’t mind.

                                COMEY’S AIDE
                        Yeah... it’s okay.

           The Aide’s trying to figure out how to put this with people 
           here.

                                COMEY
                        What exactly did they say?

                                COMEY’S AIDE
                        They don’t want you at the meeting.

           It hangs there.  This wasn’t a win.  They were outmaneuvered.

           EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY 

           Comey, Philbin, and Jack are on the street, irate.  And they 
           feel like morons about it, but they’re afraid to discuss this  *
           indoors.  

                                COMEY
                        What if I just show up anyway?
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    94.

                                PHILBIN
                        You can’t crash a meeting at the 
                        White House -- you’re not on the 
                        list, they won’t let you near the 
                        building.

                                JACK
                        Well, maybe once they hear about 
                        it, they’ll step in.  

                                PHILBIN
                        The Gang of Eight?

                                JACK
                        They’re the ranking members of the 
                        House and Senate.  And the ranking 
                        members of the intelligence 
                        committees.  They’re not gonna sit 
                        on their hands.

                                PHILBIN
                        That’s exactly what they’re gonna 
                        do.  Half of them were briefed on 
                        it when it started -- they had to 
                        appropriate the funds to run it.  
                        They came up with the 45 day rule.

                                COMEY
                        And they never checked to see how 
                        it was going?

                                PHILBIN
                        That’s the beauty of how Cheney 
                        built it.  He makes them think 
                        they’re supervising, but he has it 
                        all executed in the executive 
                        branch.  So they only know what he 
                        tells them.
                           (beat)
                        He’s better at this than we are.  

           It’s true.  They’re all furious.  And powerless.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

           Cheney.  Hayden.  Gonzales.  Cheney watches carefully as 
           General Hayden reviews the basics of the program with the 
           Gang of Eight, including NANCY PELOSI, JAY ROCKEFELLER, TOM 
           DASCHLE.  Hayden’s following Cheney's script.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    95.

                                HAYDEN
                        I give you my word as an officer, 
                        we do not collect one photon or 
                        electron more than is absolutely 
                        necessary.

                                PELOSI
                        Well, if Justice can’t get behind 
                        it, I think we need to reconsider 
                        seeking legislative authority.

                                CHENEY
                        I don’t see how that’s gonna work.

                                ROCKEFELLER
                        At least we should brief the rest 
                        of the Intelligence Committee.

           Cheney gives him a look that suggests that’s a nonstarter.

                                ROCKEFELLER (CONT’D)
                        I sent you a letter a few months 
                        ago, I think I was clear I was 
                        uncomfortable with the direction 
                        this was moving.

                                CHENEY
                        I read it.

           That wasn’t a response so much as a dismissal.  

                                DASCHLE
                        Dick, you’re marginalizing 
                        Congress, you can’t be surprised 
                        Justice is up in arms.

                                CHENEY
                        Congress leaks.  It was true when I 
                        was a member, it’s true now.  This 
                        is too important.  And too fragile.  
                        The enemy’s hard enough to find 
                        without us sharing our methodology.  
                        We aren’t doing this for our 
                        entertainment.  We’re talking about 
                        calls to al Qaeda -- if you’re on 
                        the phone with Aunt Sadie in Paris, 
                        we’re not really interested.

                                HAYDEN
                        I think it’s safe to say, had this 
                        program been in place in 2001, we 
                        would have detected the 9-11 
                        terrorists before they acted.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    96.

                                CHENEY
                        We need this.  The idea that we 
                        would close our ears because one 
                        deputy wants to show his tail 
                        feathers in his first week on the 
                        job...

           It does sound appalling.

           Card hesitates.  He knows Cheney didn’t want him getting Bush  *

                        Well call the damn hospital and 
                        sort it out.

           Bush storms out.  Pissed.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           A few minutes later.  Bush is at his desk when Card and 
           Gonzales enter.  Embarrassed.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    97.

                                CARD
                        Sorry... Ashcroft’s security detail 
                        wouldn’t put the call through.

                                GONZALES
                        Apparently his wife said no calls.  

           Bush is supremely annoyed.  He picks up his own damn phone.  

                                BUSH (INTO PHONE)
                        Get me John Ashcroft, please.  He’s 
                        at...

                        GW Hospital.

           Bush waits, looking at Card and Gonzales like they're fucking 
           idiots.  

                                BUSH (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hey there, it's the President.  Can 
                        I get John on the phone for a 
                        minute?  No problem, I'll wait.

                        Hey John!  You feeling okay?  We're 
                        sending flowers, I hope they don't 
                        make you sneeze.  Al and Andy are 
                        going ten rounds with your guys on 
                        this surveillance thing, they're 
                        gonna come down, get your two 
                        cents.  That's great.  

           Bush hangs up.  Gives them a look, like, was that so hard?

           INT. JACK’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jack's having dinner with Leslie and the baby.  A rare event, 
           he's home in time for dinner.  The toddler makes an 
           appearance, in footy pajamas.

                                JACK
                        Uh uh.  Get back in bed, Little 
                        Man.

                                JACK JR.
                        I have a pee.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    98.

                                LESLIE
                        You don’t, you just peed.

                                JACK 
                        Up.  Go.

           He shuffles back upstairs, as Jack's phone rings.  Jack looks 
           at Leslie, apologetic.

                                LESLIE
                        It was too good to be true.

                                JACK (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello.  

           He listens for a second.  Then rises abruptly.  

           INT. COMEY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Comey’s in the car with his Security Detail.  He’s reading in 
           the back seat when he gets the call.

                                COMEY (INTO PHONE)
                        This is Comey.  

           He listens, incredulous.  Then, to his driver DOUG...

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        Doug, we gotta turn around and get 
                        to GW Hospital right now.

                                DOUG
                        Fireworks?

                                COMEY
                        Yeah I think so.

           Doug hits the SIREN.

           EXT. CONSTITUTION AVENUE - NIGHT

           Doug slaps a flashing LIGHT onto the roof, slams on the 
           brakes, and makes a SCREECHING u-turn on Constitution Avenue.

           INT. JACK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jack's driving, he's not Deputy AG, he drives his own crappy 
           car, he's just a guy who works at DOJ, he's not even supposed 
           to be here, and when he pulls up in front of GW Hospital 
           there's no goddamn parking space.

                        Fucking hell.

           Screw it -- he double parks.

           EXT. GW HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Jack jumps out of the car and runs into the hospital.   

           INT. GW HOSPITAL LOBBY/STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Comey's jabbing the elevator button.  Takes forever.  Forget 
           it -- he finds a stairwell, takes the steps two at a time, 
           his Security Detail running behind him.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHENEY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Cheney’s packing up for the night when Libby enters, confused.  

                                LIBBY
                        Andy and Al are going to the 
                        hospital to see Ashcroft?  I 
                        thought he turned over his 
                        authority to Comey.

                                CHENEY
                        If he wants it back, he can take it 
                        back.

                                LIBBY
                        The guy’s in ICU.  We sure this is 
                        a good idea?

           Cheney looks at him, inscrutable, and heads out.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE ASHCROFT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The hallway's quiet; it's been emptied for Ashcroft.  There's 
           an FBI command post set up down the hall.  FBI agents, 
           hospital security, police.  Jack’s standing, waiting, when 
           Philbin races in -- like they all did, running to a fire.  He 
           stops in front of Jack.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ASHCROFT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dark.  Comey, speaking in hushed tones with JANET ASHCROFT, 
           the AG’s wife.

                                JANET
                        In and out.  
                           (crosses to the bed)
                        Honey, Jim Comey’s here.  John.  
                        Open your eyes.

           Ashcroft’s eyes slip open.  Unfocused.

                                COMEY
                        Hi sir, it’s Jim Comey.  It’s good 
                        to see you.

                                ASHCROFT
                        Mm hm.

                                COMEY
                        Sir, do you know that Mr. Card and 
                        Mr. Gonzales are coming here?

           Beat.

                                ASHCROFT
                        To the house?

                                COMEY
                        To the hospital.

                        Sir, do you know you’re in the 
                        hospital?

           There’s a horrible silence where Ashcroft stares at Comey, 
           blank.  The Attorney General has no idea where he is.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE ASHCROFT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Goldsmith and Philbin are waiting when Comey comes out.  He 
           shakes his head.  Then he pulls out his phone and dials.

           Mueller’s out to dinner with his WIFE and DAUGHTER when his

                        Al Gonzales are on their way to the 
                        Attorney General’s hospital -- 
                        they’re going to try to get him to 
                        sign the re-authorization.  He’s 
                        non compos mentis, I don’t know 
                        what they think they’re doing.

           Mueller stands, headed for the door.  

                                MUELLER (INTO PHONE)
                        Give me the head of his FBI detail.  

           Comey pivots to an FBI AGENT and hands him his phone.

                        This is Mueller.  Mr. Comey’s going 
                        to be in the Attorney General’s

                                LYNNE
                        I did, she said you hadn’t decided

           INT. ASHCROFT’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Comey’s in a chair by the bed, quietly speaking to Ashcroft, 
           Jack and Philbin behind him.  Janet’s on the other side, 
           holding her husband’s arm.  TWO FBI AGENTS stand by the door.

                                COMEY
                        Sir, they’re bringing the 
                        authorization for the NSA 
                        surveillance program.  You did not 
                        want to sign that document when we 
                        discussed it, and I want to make 
                        sure you don’t sign it today.  Do 
                        you understand me?  

           Ashcroft's looking at him.  It's not clear anyone's home.  
           That's when there’s a KNOCK at the door.  Card and Gonzales 
           enter.  Gonzales carries an envelope.  

                                GONZALES
                        Hi there.  How are you, General?

                                ASHCROFT
                        Not well.

                                GONZALES
                        I’m so sorry to hear that.  We hate 
                        to bother you, but the President’s 
                        Special Program is expiring.  We 
                        met with the Gang of Eight this 
                        afternoon.  They really would like 
                        the program to carry on.  So if 
                        you’d be willing to... renew the 
                        authorization...

           Silence.  Ashcroft, from some inexplicable source of energy 
           in a body that seems near dead, raises himself up.

                                ASHCROFT
                        You asked to tap a handful of 
                        suspects, and now...  It’s a 
                        monster.  No monitoring.  No 
                        accountability.  I never should 
                        have certified it in the first 
                        place.  

                                GONZALES

                                ASHCROFT
                        You drew the circle so tight I 
                        couldn’t get the advice I needed.  
                        You know you did that.

           He’s looking right at Gonzales now.

                        have known before you ever asked 
                        for my signature.  And if it were 
                        up to me, I would never approve it.  
                        But that doesn’t matter, because 
                        I’m not the attorney general.
                           (pointing to Comey)
                        He’s the attorney general.

           He sinks back onto the bed.  Exhausted.  Gonzales and Card 
           stand for a moment, and then walk out, without a glance at 
           the DOJ guys.  

           Janet Ashcroft is proper woman.  So she doesn't tell them to 
           go fuck themselves on the way out the door.  But she does the 
           closest thing she can.  She sticks her tongue out at them.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE ASHCROFT’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Comey and Jack are outside Ashcroft’s room.  Shaken.

                        They’re a bunch of thugs.  I kept 
                        thinking this was about different 
                        interpretations of the 
                        Constitution, or different visions 
                        of the presidency -- it’s not, it’s 
                        just fucking lawless.  

           Mueller arrives.  

                                COMEY
                        They were gonna shove a pen in his 
                        hand and have him make a mark on a 
                        piece of paper.  Six days ago he 
                        stated it was not legal.

                                MUELLER
                        But he didn’t sign?

           Jack shakes his head no.

                        gonna be testifying about this one.

                        It’s not clear he’s gonna make it.

           steps away.

           Comey hangs up on him.  He leans against the wall for a 
           minute, shaking out his hands.  Because he's trembling.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ASHCROFT’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mueller's in a chair, close to Ashcroft's bed.  The 
           confrontation took a lot out of Ashcroft, and he didn't have 
           much to spare.  

                                ASHCROFT
                        Bob, I’m struggling.

           Mueller takes his hand, silent for a moment.

                        In every man's life there comes a

                        You passed your test tonight.  

           INT. DOJ - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           It's late.  A lot of people are already here, milling around.  
           In their jeans -- they all rushed in from home.  Many have no 
           idea what's going on.  Goldsmith, Philbin, Ayres wait, quiet.   *
           Finally Comey arrives and silence falls over the room.  

                                COMEY
                        We're at an impasse with the White

                        of you don't have the clearance.  
                        In our judgment, the president is 
                        outside the bounds of his lawful 
                        authority.  We've advised the White 
                        House of that, and they are 
                        unmoved.  Andy Card and Al Gonzales 
                        just showed up at the hospital and 
                        tried to take advantage of a very 
                        sick man...

           He trails off, so angry he can barely speak.

                        can't be part of it. 

           There's a silence.  These people are party loyalists.  Bush

           And then some more nods.  One of the staffers looks around 
           the room, astonished.  And pulls out his Blackberry.

           BLEEP.  Staff Secretary BRETT KAVANAUGH just got a text 
           message.  He reads it.  Holy shit.

           Kavanaugh taps on the open door.

                        A couple dozen people over there 
                        are sitting around talking about

                        court.  Somebody.  

           Card's losing his composure.  Cheney's not, though he's 
           certainly losing his patience.

                        quit?  They have children, and 
                        mortgages. 

           Card looks at Gonzales.  It does seem implausible.

                        have no idea what you’re capable of

           genuinely contrite.  And ashamed.

                        I’m aware of that.

                        Maybe we should go to the 
                        President.

           Card looks at him like he's a fucking moron.  

                                CARD
                        The President’s asleep.

                                                          FADE TO:

                                TITLE: THURSDAY

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           The President's Daily Briefing.  Comey’s among the briefers 
           gathered on the couches.  

                                BRIEFER
                        Four commuter trains.  Ten 
                        explosions.  There’s speculation it 
                        could be a group with ties to al 
                        Qaeda, but we’re skeptical.  We’ve 
                        got a call set up with you and 
                        President Aznar.

                                CHENEY
                        They’ll want our advice on domestic 
                        terrorist detection.  They were 
                        under-prepared.

           Cheney doesn’t so much as glance at Comey, but that was for 
           his benefit, and Comey knows it.  

                                BUSH
                        Get on the call with me.

           Cheney nods.  Bush rises, and the group disperses.  Cheney, 
           Addington, Card and Gonzales stay behind.  

                                CHENEY
                        Mr. President...

           Cheney nods to Addington to take the floor.  

                                ADDINGTON
                        We were not able to make any 
                        progress with the Justice 
                        Department.  At this point we 
                        believe you should simply re-
                        certify the program without them.  
                        You have the authority to do it on 
                        your own.

           Bush looks to Gonzales.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    111.

                                BUSH
                        You think that’s a good idea?

           Gonzales is extremely reticent to contradict Cheney and 
           Addington, particularly with them in the room.  Nonetheless, 
           after some uncomfortable shifting in his chair...

                                GONZALES
                        David’s right, we don’t want 
                        anything to interfere with the 
                        program, but... I’m not sure it’s 
                        prudent to proceed without the 
                        Department of Justice.

           Card’s sure Gonzales’ protest wasn’t strong enough to make an  *
           impression.  He’s also terrified to cross Cheney, but he’s 
           really worried.  Tentative...

                                CARD
                        It could be dicey politically.  It 
                        starts to look like an executive 
                        power grab.

           Cheney glares daggers at both of them. 

                                CHENEY
                        It’s a secret program.  It won’t 
                        look like anything.

                                CARD
                        Enough people know.

                                BUSH
                        What does Karen think? 

                                ADDINGTON
                        She’s not up to speed on this.

                                BUSH
                        Karl?  

                                CHENEY
                        They’re not read into the program.  
                        They don’t know it exists.

                                BUSH
                        So all the advice I can get is in 
                        this room.

           Bush says it with that half smirk of his, but he’s not 
           particularly amused by the notion.  

                                CHENEY
                        Thanks guys.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    112.

           Their signal to leave.  Cheney remains in his chair.  Andy 
           Card hesitates for a moment - he knows Cheney's about to have 
           the last word.  But there's nothing he can do.  He leaves.  

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a political hit, internally.  
                        We take ten of those a day.  

           Bush still looks concerned.  

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        Four commuter trains just blew up.  
                        The world is no safer than it was 
                        two years ago, we don’t let down 
                        our guard one inch.  This is a 
                        national security question.  And 
                        you're the chief law enforcement 
                        officer of the United States and 
                        the Commander-in-chief of the Armed 
                        Services.  National security law is 
                        what you say it is.  

           Bush is unsure.  But he’s always relied on this man to 
           interpret the law for him.  To navigate the waters.   
           Following anyone else’s advice... he simply can’t imagine 
           doing it.  Off Bush, searching Cheney’s steadfast face...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OVAL - DAY

           Card’s waiting when Cheney strides out of the Oval.

                                CHENEY
                        He’ll sign it.

                                CARD
                        Did you tell him about the 
                        resignations?

                                CHENEY
                        It didn’t come up.

           Card’s bowled over by that admission.

                                CARD
                        We should tell him about the 
                        resignations.

           Cheney's had about enough shit from Andy Card.

                                CHENEY
                        You made it clear you had concerns.  
                        The President’ll do what he wants.

           INT. EEOB - ADDINGTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Gonzales is with Addington when Cheney blows in.  

                                CHENEY
                        Rewrite the Presidential directive.  
                        Delete Ashcroft's signature line.  
                        No, actually don't delete it, 
                        replace his name.  
                           (thinks for a second)
                        Put Al's name on there.  

           Al looks up, confused to be pulled into the proceedings.  

                                CHENEY (CONT’D)
                        And add some language that reminds 
                        us all that nobody -- not Justice, 
                        or Congress -- constrains the 
                        President's power as Commander-in-
                        Chief.  

           Cheney's out the door.  Addington's typing furiously.  Al 
           looks increasingly uncomfortable, as he puts together the 
           implications of Cheney's instructions.

                                GONZALES
                        I’m not in the chain of authority 
                        that defines criminal law.  David.  
                        Anybody who follows this thing 
                        could be looking at prosecution 
                        without better backing than that.

           David's ignoring him.  Typing.  

                                GONZALES (CONT’D)
                        We don't want to create a situation 
                        where a bunch of high-ranking 
                        Administration officials who 
                        planned and authorized this program 
                        are engaged in a criminal 
                        conspiracy. 

                                ADDINGTON
                        We're all going to be hauled up 
                        before congressional committees and 
                        grand juries.  And you know what?  
                        I'm not gonna get a lawyer.  My 
                        conscience is clear.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Bush is on the phone when his ASSISTANT enters and places a 
           document in front of him.  

                                BUSH (INTO PHONE)
                        How long have I been saying this 
                        isn’t just an American problem?  
                        It’s a contagion thing.  Maybe it 
                        was the Basque, but the idea for a 
                        large scale coordinated attack?  
                        That comes from al Qaeda. 

           Bush signs it, right beside another signature line that says 
           ALBERTO GONZALES.

           The assistant hands the signed document to David Addington.  

           INT. DOJ - COMEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Comey’s typing.  Jack’s standing by his desk, incredulous.  

                                JACK
                        Gonzales signed it?

           Comey nods.  Jack was surprised to hear that even Bush had 
           signed it.  But Gonzales??  

                                JACK (CONT’D)
                        He’s not... The White House counsel 
                        doesn't have the authority to 
                        legitimize a presidential order. 

                                COMEY
                        Nope.

                                JACK
                        What does that even mean?  

                                COMEY
                        It means they’re just making shit 
                        up.  And I'm resigning.

                        These are the guys you hired to say 
                        no to the President.  They said no.

                        David is confident, as is the Vice

                        You can’t make an end run around 
                        the Justice Department when the 
                        Acting Attorney General’s told you 
                        the Program has no foundation in 
                        law.  I run a law enforcement 
                        agency.  You think I can let the 
                        FBI take part in a program that 
                        Justice says is illegal?

                                MUELLER
                        Andy, do you have any idea what’s 
                        about to happen?

           Card's starting to fray now, and spits out - 

                                CARD
                        I am acting on the President's

           Silence.  Mueller comes to a very sad realization.

           Mueller walks out of the White House.  We hear his voice.

                        Dear Mr. President.

           And then another voice.

                        At my confirmation hearing, I was

                        was fundamentally wrong.

                                PHILBIN (V.O.)
                        Resign.

                                COMEY (V.O.)
                        Effective immediately.

           As the voice over ends, Comey addresses the group, grim.

                                COMEY
                        We need to put together a document 
                        for the White House.  Exactly what 
                        we think happened in the last two 
                        weeks.  Let’s be comprehensive.  
                           (beat)
                        I wrote a letter.  I'll give it to 
                        the President in the morning.  

           There's a silence.  And then one of the other lawyers pulls a 
           letter out of his jacket pocket, and places it on the table 
           in front of him.  And then another.  And another.  Jack.  
           Philbin.  Ayres.  Comey looks around the room.  There are 
           easily ten resignation letters on the table.  He can't 
           believe it.  

                                AYRES
                        If it’s possible, I’m gonna ask you 
                        to wait a day or two, until 
                        Ashcroft’s stronger.  He’s gonna 
                        want to resign with you.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    117.

           It’s stunning.  None of them -- even the ones who wrote the 
           letters -- expected this number of resignations.  Comey looks 
           at Jack.  What the hell have they wrought?

           INT. DOJ - JACK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Late that night.  Comey finds Jack staring at the portrait on 
           his wall.  Elliot Richardson, peering down at Jack.  

                                JACK
                        Elliot Richardson.  He was Nixon's 
                        AG.  Served five months before he 
                        quit.  That was the Saturday Night 
                        Massacre.  Two guys at Justice 
                        resigning.  It ended the Nixon 
                        presidency.  What the hell's gonna 
                        happen when 18 people quit?

           Comey can’t bring himself to answer.

           EXT. GONZALES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jack and Philbin ring the doorbell.  Al answers in his 
           pajamas and a robe.  

                                GONZALES
                        You want to come in?

           Jack shakes his head.  Philbin hands Gonzales a large 
           envelope. 

                                JACK
                        Justice put this together -- it’s a 
                        blow by blow of how all this went 
                        down.  So there’s a record.

           Gonzales manages a sad smile.  

                                GONZALES
                        Don’t worry Jack.  It’ll all work 
                        out.  Tomorrow’s another day.  

           Jack looks at him like he's fucking insane.

                                JACK
                        I'm quite sure it’s not gonna work 
                        out.  I think the whole executive 
                        branch is gonna melt down.

           Gonzales clutches the envelope.  Jack and Philbin walk away.

            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    118.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOBBY - MORNING

           Jack and Philbin.  Waiting.  There’s some shifting of weight.  
           Checking of watches.  The things men do when the world 
           appears to be ending and there’s not a thing they can do.

                                JACK
                        The upside is... we leave, maybe I 
                        don’t have a heart attack.

                                PHILBIN
                        You planning one?

                                JACK
                        My chest feels like there’s a rock 
                        on it all the time.  

                                PHILBIN
                        I think I have an ulcer.  

                                JACK
                        Yeah.  I go through a lot of Tums.

                                PHILBIN
                        Does it help?

                                JACK
                        No.
                           (beat)
                        I never would have done it.  

                                PHILBIN
                        What.

                                JACK
                        Any of this.  If you hadn’t done 
                        all that digging.  Figured out what 
                        was really going on.  

           It’s a thank you, and it means a lot to Philbin.

                                PHILBIN
                        I think I ruined your career.

                                JACK
                        That you did, sir.  That you did.  

           They both smile.  Almost.  Gallows humor.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    119.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE OVAL - MORNING

           Comey, Mueller, stand stock still as the other intelligence 
           brass mill around, chatting, waiting for the President's 
           Daily Briefing to start.  Comey and Mueller are pretty sure 
           it’s the last time they’ll see the inside of this building.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PORTICO - DAY

           Condi walks Bush down the portico toward the Oval. 

                                RICE
                        Fran Townsend came to me yesterday.  
                        Have you spoken to Jim Comey?  

                                BUSH
                        I heard about it.  They’ll sort it 
                        out.

                                RICE
                        Are you sure?  Somebody’s giving me 
                        a message about a compartmented 
                        program, third hand, I don’t like 
                        the sound of that.  Do you?

           Bush eyes her, unsure.

                                RICE (CONT’D)
                        Comey’s a reasonable guy.  You need 
                        to make sure you’re really hearing 
                        these folks out.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - LATER

           Comey does his best to focus on the President, but he can’t 
           help but glance at Cheney.  Cheney studiously ignores him.

                                BRIEFER
                        It was found on a jihadist website with 
                        links to Saudi al Qaeda.  Encouraging 
                        their people to attack us by attacking 
                        our allies.  Britain.  Spain.

                                BUSH
                        The trains in Madrid?  You told me 
                        yesterday it was the Basque.

                                BRIEFER
                        We don’t know.  At this point it’s 
                        just... something to consider. 
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    120.

           Bush likes clarity.  He fucking hates “just something to 
           consider.”

                                BUSH
                        Alright, that’s it.

           As they scatter, almost an afterthought...

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Hey Jim, hang back a minute.

           Comey, almost out the door, returns and follows Bush toward 
           the private dining room.  Cheney moves to follow.

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        I’m good, Dick, thanks.

           Cheney watches them go.  Displeased he’s not in the room.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BUSH’S PRIVATE DINING ROOM - DAY

           Bush sits, and nods Comey toward a chair.

                                BUSH
                        You look like hell.  We wearing you out?  

                                COMEY
                        A little bit, sir, you are.

                                BUSH
                        Let me lift the burden from your 
                        shoulders.  I’ve been inside out 
                        this NSA stuff.  Bottom line is, I 
                        decide what the law is for the 
                        executive branch.

                                COMEY
                        That is absolutely true, sir.  But 
                        I decide what the Department of 
                        Justice can certify, and despite my 
                        best efforts I simply cannot.

           Bush shakes his head.

                                BUSH
                        I really wish you weren’t raising it 
                        at the last minute.  The day before a 
                        deadline, how are we supposed to deal 
                        with your problem?

           Comey can barely comprehend what he’s hearing.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    121.

                                COMEY
                        The day before?  Sir, if you’ve 
                        been told that... you have been 
                        very poorly served by your 
                        advisers.  

           Now Bush is confused.

                                COMEY (CONT’D)
                        We've been telling them we have a 
                        huge problem for months.  

                                BUSH
                        Alright -- just certify it.  Give 
                        me six weeks, if we don’t have it 
                        fixed, we’ll shut it down.

                                COMEY
                        I can’t do that.  You say what the 
                        law is in the executive branch, I 
                        understand that.  But sir, I put my 
                        hand on a bible and swore to defend 
                        the Constitution.  If I don’t 
                        believe I’m doing that... I’m 
                        sorry, I can’t stay.

                                BUSH
                        What do you mean?  You’re 
                        resigning??

           Comey’s silent.  Bush never expected anything like this.

                                COMEY
                        It’s probably not my place to say 
                        this, but I want to be sure you 
                        know what’s going on, and it’s not 
                        clear to me you’re getting complete 
                        information.  The Director of the 
                        FBI is going to resign today as 
                        well.  And the head of the Office 
                        of Legal Counsel.  And I believe 
                        the Attorney General.

                                BUSH

                        What???

           George W. Bush is totally fucking gobsmacked.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           Bush's assistant pretends not to hear the voices inside the 
           Oval.  One low and calm, the other fucking pissed off.  
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    122.

           Andy Card enters and stops, startled to hear raised voices.  
           The assistant rises.  The door is ajar.  She clicks it shut.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           It’s just Bush and Cheney now.  

                                BUSH
                        The Attorney General??  Director of 
                        the Goddamn FBI?? 

                                CHENEY
                        Sir--

                                BUSH
                        This guy's got 15, 20 people about 
                        to resign from the government!  You 
                        didn't want to mention it??  

                                CHENEY
                        I didn't think an interdepartmental 
                        wrestling match should shape the 
                        course of our national security. 

                                BUSH
                        That is not a man who’s trying to 
                        bigfoot us -- he says it’s not 
                        legal!  Full stop!  

                                CHENEY
                        We disagree.

                                BUSH
                        It is not just us, my friend!  What 
                        the hell good does it do if we 
                        can't put this stuff on a 
                        foundation that will outlast us??  

                                CHENEY
                        I made a commitment when I joined 
                        your ticket that I would help you 
                        to restore the strength of the 
                        Presidency.

                                BUSH
                        You don’t need to sell me on the 
                        Presidency.

                                CHENEY
                        It's exactly this kind of political 
                        infighting that erodes it.  

           That’s when Bush really loses his shit.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    123.

                                BUSH
                        THIS IS NOT INFIGHTING -- THIS IS A 
                        BLOODBATH.

                                CHENEY
                        Sir--

                                BUSH
                        I AM RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION.  THIS 
                        WILL BE THE END OF MY PRESIDENCY.  
                        YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY POLITICS?  
                        YOU'RE DRIVING MY ADMINISTRATION 
                        OFF A CLIFF.  

           Beat.  

                                CHENEY
                        You have my apologies.  If you're 
                        not comfortable with the decision, 
                        I'm happy to move in another dir-- 

                                BUSH
                        You bet your ass we're moving in 
                        another direction.  And allow me to 
                        be clear.  You don't EVER blindside 
                        me like this again.  

           Cheney stands silent.  Bush yells to his assistant.

                                BUSH (CONT’D)
                        Get the director of the FBI in here.  

                                ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                        Yes sir.

           He looks up and sees Cheney's still standing there.  

                                BUSH
                        That’s it.

           It takes him a second to accept.  Cheney's been dismissed. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOBBY - DAY

           Comey, Jack and Philbin waiting for Mueller.  Finally he 
           emerges from the Oval.  He almost can’t believe it himself.

                                MUELLER
                        He’s rolling it back.  Fix what you 
                        can fix.  Whatever you can’t, we 
                        stop doing.
                           (beat)
                        Back to work, gentlemen.
            THE SPECIAL PROGRAM                            5/24/13    124.

           Mueller walks on.  Goldsmith, Comey, and Philbin are silent, 
           not feeling satisfaction so much as relief.  Three guys from 
           Justice, who almost burned the house down. 

                                COMEY
                        That’s what we wanted.  Right?  We 
                        didn’t actually want to bring down 
                        the presidency.

           He looks at Jack.  There’s just a moment of hesitation.  
           Because Jack’s not really sure.  

                                JACK
                        That’s all we wanted.

           Addington passes, on his way into Cheney's office.  We can 
           see into the office -- Dick Cheney at his desk, his 
           expression dark.  His eyes flick up as Addington enters.  He 
           spots Comey, Jack, and Philbin down the long hall.  

           For a moment, we see Cheney zero in on Jack, filled with 
           contempt.  Libby's by the desk.  He follows Cheney's eyeline,  *
           and sees Jack, frozen in the Vice President’s furious gaze.  
           Libby closes the door.  

           ON A BLACK SCREEN, text crawls:

           Bush authorized Justice to fix Operation Stellar Wind.  Some 
           parts were revised.  Some were deemed illegal, and never 
           performed again.   

           It was the first time in American history that subordinates 
           forced a wartime president to withdraw a military command.

           Comey and Goldsmith then revised what came to be known as The  *
           Torture Memos.  Once the torture program was curtailed, 
           Goldsmith resigned.  Comey left soon after.

           NSA domestic surveillance continues today, but under the 
           supervision of Congress, the FISA court, and three Inspectors  *
           General.

           Cheney's relationship with Bush never recovered.  His 
           influence in the second term, by his own account, was gravely  *
           diminished.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.  

                                THE END
