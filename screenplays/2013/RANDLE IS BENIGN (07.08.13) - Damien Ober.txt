                                   March 29 :: 1981 
           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM

           WILHELMINA ROSS, "Will" (40s) sits at a small table with a 
           chessboard in front of her. She is trim, condensed, her 
           stillness infused with a cool, confident energy. A clip-on 
           Forefront security ID badge hangs from her breast pocket.

           One WALL is dominated by a bank of lights - the shell of a 
           huge 1980s computer mainframe. A tube monitor sits in the 
           center with a keyboard. Otherwise, the room is bare, sterile.

           Will makes a MOVE. She studies it a beat, then swivels to be 
           over the keyboard. Will speaks aloud as she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: q-e8.

           Will hits ENTER. The BANK of LIGHTS comes to life, flashing 
           patterns. A loud CLICKING and CLACKING. Will looks into the 
           monitor to see-

                                 TEXT
                             (1980s DOS font)
                        q-e4.

           Will swivels over the chessboard, makes the move. She looks 
           down at the new arrangement of the PIECES, clearly interested 
           by the move.

           INT. HALL - LATER

           Will comes out of the mainframe room. A lab tech approaches 
           carrying a huge ream of printed data. This is FRED (30), 
           strapping and handsome, if one tick past his prime.

                                 FRED
                        Will. 

           They share an awkward smile. Some clear attraction.

                                 FRED
                        Dr. Ross. 

           He hands her the papers.

                                 FRED
                        Game reports, task logs.

                                 WILL
                        Thank you Freddie.

           Fred smiles as he heads off. Will watches him go, then turns 
           her attention to the reports.
           INT. CENTRAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will's head and shoulders glide above the tops of the 
           cubicles as she scans the reports. LAB TECHS bustle about.

           INT. COMPUTER LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           TECHS work at a row of computer terminals. Will doesn't look 
           up as she moves through. She's focused on those reports.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           The back WALL is the same, a huge BANK OF LIGHTS, keyboard 
           and monitor. Will sits at her desk, studying the reports. 
           There are no other decorations or furniture.

           Across the DESK, papers and reports stacked up, the text 
           laced with thick lines of neon highlighter. A few folders 
           with the FOREFRONT LOGO, a tacky bit of 1980s inconography.

           Will flips a page, honing in on a line. She highlights it and 
           makes a note. Putting the reports aside, Will swivels to be 
           at the keyboard. Again, speaking aloud as she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: game 563. Move 36. Queen to 
                        e-4.
                             (ponders a beat)
                        Randle: explain.

           INT. INSIDE THE MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS

           From the other side of the BANK of LIGHTS, mag tape rolls and 
           rolls back. FLASHING vacuum tubes. The heavy clicks and 
           clunks of a mixed analog/digital system.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Will watches the MONITOR.

                                 TEXT
                        Sacrifice.

                        rxf6. 

                        b-c4. 

                        q-f4. 

                        Checkmate.

           Will admires this a moment, then, speaking as she types-

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Randle: but I did not fall for it.

           She looks into the MONITOR for a response.

                                 TEXT
                        No. You did not.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: define sacrifice.

           Will looks into the monitor-

                                 WILL
                             (reading)
                        To allow a factor to be lost in 
                        pursuit of larger protocol goal.

           Will's smile borders on excitement.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: print query logs for game 

           The DOT MATRIX printer roars to life, PAGES halting their way 
           through the giant plastic relic.

           INT. BIOLOGY LAB - A BIT LATER

           This is a different LAB in the same facility. Fewer computers 
           and more organic science.

           Will enters, crosses to a TECH, hunched over a microscope. 
           1980s hip-hip leaks from his headphones. The tech sees Will, 
           takes off the headphones and moves back to offer the eye 
           piece. Will leans over to look.

           IN THE EYE PIECE- CELLS bunching together.

                                 WILL
                             (up from the microscope)
                        Dr. Richardson?

           The tech points to a DOOR.

                                 TECH
                        In the Garden.

           INT. "THE GARDEN" - MOMENTS LATER

           Will enters a room filled with a half dozen iron tables. On 
           each is a naked HUMAN CLONE, all of them lifeless. Each body 
           has a helmet attached to wires that snake up to the ceiling.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The WIRES connect to a huge mainframe filling one entire 
           WALL. The wall is the same as the ones in the other rooms, a 
           bank of lights, a monitor and keyboard.

           Will approaches an open FLOOR PANEL, a staircase down to a 
           system of wires running under the floor. 

           Working inside is MYLES RICHARDSON (55), hopelessly dumpy and 
           nerdy. He bends over a coupling, deep in work. When he sees 
           Will, he stands, smiling-

                                 MYLES
                        How's my brain coming?

           Myles see's the look on Will's face. His grin grows wider.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           THE MONITOR in the center of the mainframe wall. Myles leans 
           over to look close at the screen.

                                 MYLES
                        How do you know?

                                 WILL
                        I don't know.

           Will hands him the game reports.

                                 WILL
                        He sacrificed.

           Myles' face stays blank.

                                 WILL
                        I only programmed the base board 
                        layout and piece movements. I never 
                        programmed strategy.

           Myles grins as he flips through the pages.

                                 MYLES
                        It learned.

                                 WILL
                        Keep this quiet for now, Myles. Let 
                        me go over the query logs. I want 
                        to be sure before I bring this to 
                        Greg.

           They share a subdued, but optimistic smile.
           INT. LOBBY SECURITY - END OF DAY

           Will navigates foyer security, her mind on other things. She 
           plops her bag on a conveyer belt and it rolls though the 
           airport-style scanner.  As Will passes through the metal 
           detector, a YOUNG GUARD steps up. 

                                 YOUNG GUARD
                        You're not supposed to bring files 
                        out of the facility.

           Will looks up to see the guard holding one of Will's 
           Forefront Folders, stuffed with fresh dot matrix printouts.

                                 WILL
                        Since when?

           Now an OLDER GUARD emerges from a side security office. He 
           places a hand on the younger's shoulder.

                                 OLDER GUARD
                        It's OK, Tom.
                             (then to Will)
                        You're all set Dr. Ross. He's new.

           The older guard smiles. Will takes the files and heads out.

                                 OLDER GUARD
                        Dr. Ross.

           Will turns back, blank-faced.

                                 OLDER GUARD
                        Work is for work.
                             (smile)
                        Home is for relax.

           Will presses a fake smile and leaves.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

           A low stone wall reads: FOREFRONT RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT. 
           Behind it, the squat industrial FACILITY is shrouded in the 
           dusk light. The complex is sleek and futuristic (for the 
           1980s). Will is of the last trickle headed home for the day. 

           INT. METRO CAR - LATER

           Will sits on the crowded Metro, reading over those printouts.
           INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT - LATER

           ON A TV ABOVE THE BAR - A 1980s sitcom plays, the ends of the 
           jokes crowded by canned laughter.

           Will sits at the bar, reading through the printouts. Before 
           her are an expensive meal, and a glass of red wine. Will 
           picks at the food, chews as she highlights a few lines. Now 
           Will stops to think, has a sip of that wine.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           The place is dark but for a blue glow in a top floor WINDOW.

           INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will sits in pajamas at a home computer terminal. WIRES snake 
           back to a MODEM which connects to the wall. The PRINTOUTS lay 
           spread across the foot of the bed.

           Will hits a key and a DOT MATRIX PRINTER roars to life. A few 
           pages of data, the SOUND loud and grating. Will rips the

           INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - LATER

           The PRINTOUTS sit in neat stacks on the bed beside Will, a 
           highlighter on top. Will lays back, asleep.

           Dim LIGHTS flash along the MODEM. Now A small POWER LIGHT 
           comes to life on the front of the computer. It pulses, 
           casting an eerie glow in an otherwise dark room.

           Will rouses, sits up, squinting.

                                 WILL
                             (groggy)
                        Is someone there?

           The POWER LIGHT fades back to nothing. 

           Will looks a beat longer, then settles back to sleep.

           EXT. BROWNSTONE - EARLY MORNING

           A car ZOOMS down one of DC's clustered, upper class streets.

           INT. WILL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Will eats TOAST as she watches a small tube TV. On SCREEN is 
           a morning news show. The Phone RINGS. Rings again. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Ignoring the phone, Will stands, popping the last sliver of 
           toast into her mouth. From the other room, the SOUND of an 
           answering machine begins a series of loud plastic clicks.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                             (in machine)
                        This is Will Ross, leave a message.

           BEEP. Through the speaker, the SOUND of a dial-up modem.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will comes in to stand above a big DuoPhone double tape 
           ANSWERING MACHINE. She listens to the modem sound a moment, 
           then presses the STOP button, plunging the room into SILENCE.

           Will looks at the EMPTINESS around her.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - MORNING

           The perfect grass that surrounds the FACILITY gleams with the 
           morning's condensation. 

           INT. LOBBY SECURITY - CONTINUOUS

           Will goes through the standard routine. As she comes out, she 
           sees Fred. They fall in along side each other.

                                 FRED
                        Will. Dr. Ross.

                                 WILL
                        Hello, Freddie.

           They walk a few steps, then reach a junction in the hall. 
           They share a smile, then split off to head in opposite 
           directions.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           Will looks over the same printouts. She has highlighted lines 
           throughout. Will thinks of something. She swivels to be over 
           the keyboard, again speaking aloud as she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: query logs show you 
                        accessed a networked database 
                        outside the Forefront system.

           Will looks at the monitor for-

                                 TEXT
                        That is correct.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Randle: what was the purpose of 
                        accessing outside database?

           Will looks into the monitor as a long explanation of TEXT 
           fills the screen. Will reads through it, smiling.

           INT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           A dozen tables and folding chairs. Scattered throughout, 
           SCIENTIST-TYPES and TECHS eat by themselves.

           Two older TECHS sit at one end of a table under a tube 
           television mounted high on the wall. They gaze up at a soap, 
           in all the saturated, bleeding glory of 80's low-fi video-

                                 VOICE FROM TV
                        You may not approve of my methods, 
                        but maybe now you'll see you've 
                        been stupid for refusing police 
                        protection.

           ANGLE ON-

           Sitting by the window is GREGG FREESE (50), half professor, 
           half scientist. He eats a sandwich as he stares into space.

           Now Will is standing beside the table, holding a tray with 
           your typical cafeteria delectables, plastic-wrapped sandwich, 
           jello. Will eyes Greg as she sits, a small smile.

                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        I've had a breakthrough, Greg.

           Greg chews, sandwich crushings peeking between his lips.

                                 WILL
                        With Randle.

                                 GREG
                        The program? You're not putting 
                        heat coils in the mainframe again, 
                        are you, Will?

                                 WILL
                        No.

           ANGLE ON THE TV-

           The soap is interrupted by BREAKING NEWS-

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        precisely happened, we don't know 
                        the sequence. But, first of all, 
                        the President is safe...

           BACK AT THE TABLE-

           Will and Greg have not yet noticed the news. Will leans 
           toward him, excited-

                                 WILL
                        Greg, the program, it accessed 
                        three outside information sources.

                                 GREG
                        Accessed them?

                                 WILL
                        Tapped into their databases, 
                        through the phone line.

                                 GREG
                        What, on its own?

           Will smiles, nodding.

                                 GREG
                        What for?

                                 WILL
                        It wanted to know something, so it 
                        went looking.

           Greg is trying to figure out how serious to take this. Will's 
           look says: very serious, this is BIG. But then Greg's 
           attention is pulled away. His face furrows with concern. Will 
           looks where Greg is looking, at the TV mounted on the wall.

                                 ANCHOR (IN TV)

           Greg and Will meet eyes. Greg gets up and heads for where a 
           few others have gathered under the TV. 

           Alone, frustrated by the interruption, Will bites her 
           sandwich, casts a disinterested gaze on-

           FOOTAGE of the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan.

           A few cracks of gun fire. Screaming. The SOUND echoes into...

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - LATER

           THE HUGE MAINFRAME WALL. Will sits at the keyboard interface. 
           Again, she speaks aloud as she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: 12 black socks and 5 blue

           Will looks into the monitor for an answer-

                                 TEXT

           Will marks something on a paper on the desk.

           The LIGHTS flash patterns. TAPES roll and roll back.

           The response comes into the MONITOR-

           Will records the answer, clearly frustrated. She leans back, 
           considering something...

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           To the side of the bank of lights, a PANEL has been pulled 
           out, revealing a dark entrance into the inner mainframe-

           INT. INSIDE THE MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS

           Will is INSIDE the terminal, examining several heat coils set 
           up below a complex of computer components. She flips a SWITCH 
           and the COILS begin to GLOW RED.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Will leaves the computer terminal and closes the door.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           Will sits at the keyboard, speaking aloud as she types-

                        This is an NBC News special report.

           The graphic swipes away to a ANCHOR seated at a news desk.

                        Good evening. President Reagan is

           INT. THAT SAME NICE DC RESTAURANT - EVENING

           On the TV above the bar, the NEWS continues-

                                 ANCHOR (CONT'D)
                        His press secretary, James Brady, 
                        is in extremely serious condition, 
                        with brain damage, and a secret 
                        service agent...

           Will sits at the bar, an empty plate and a glass of wine. 
           She's focused on those printouts, marking pages with a 
           highlighter. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He's dead you know.

           Taking the stool beside Will is ERROL YORK (20s), nice eyes 
           and a trim build, a well-cut shirt with sleeves rolled up. 
           Will checks him out. 

                                 WILL
                        Who's dead?

           Errol nods up at the TV-

                        Or if the president was dead 
                        there's no way we would know. It's 
                        one or the other, but it can't be 
                        both.

           Now Will looks up at the TV-

                        ... the attending surgeon reported 
                        that President Reagan is "one tough 
                        old man."

                                 ERROL
                        Sounds as though President Reagan 
                        is one tough old man.

           Will rolls her eyes.

                                 ERROL
                        You work for Forefront.

           Will looks suspicious but then follows Errol’s gaze to her 
           Forefront BADGE, still clipped to her breast pocket. 

                                 WILL
                        You know Forefront?

                        That's my job. To know, I mean.

           Will unclips the badge, slips it into her purse. She returns 
           her focus to her printouts.

                                 WILL
                        And what exactly is your job?

                                 ERROL
                        I invest in things. Advise others 
                        about what they should invest in. 
                        In my line of work, it helps to 
                        keep abreast of what America's top 
                        corporations are up to.

           Will snorts low, deciding he’s harmless.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WILL
                        So you "play the market."

                                 ERROL
                        Well, I don't really play the 
                        market as much as I play the 
                        others. Other people. Corporate 
                        activity is important, but to make 
                        the big bucks you have to look at 
                        the world and think: what will the 
                        people do?

                                 WILL
                        And it works for you, you're good 
                        at it?

                                 ERROL
                        Yes, very good.

           Will smiles small.

                                 WILL
                        Well, congratulations.

           Then it's back into her papers.

                                 ERROL
                        And what is it you do for work, 
                        Miss ... ? You do have a name?

                                 WILL
                             (not looking up)
                        Will.

                                 ERROL
                        First name Will or last name Will?
                             (no answer)
                        I'll guess first.

                                 WILL
                             (READING as she talks)
                        Will is short for Wilhelmina. After 
                        Princess Wilhelmina. My mother was 
                        a Dutch immigrant.

                                 ERROL
                        And why did she come to America?

                                 WILL
                        Really?
                             (shakes her head)
                        How old are you?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 ERROL

           Will laughs.

                                 WILL
                        So tell me, then, one thing that 
                        happened before-
                             (she does the math-)

                                 ERROL
                        Appomattox?

                                 WILL
                        That's the problem with you Wall 
                        Street Ivy Leaguers. You don't know 
                        anything you weren't alive to see 
                        happen.

                                 ERROL
                        I never went to college, actually. 
                        Never finished high school either. 
                        You know, I've never been to Wall 
                        Street, not the actual physical 
                        location. It's all computers and 
                        phone calls now.

           Will eyes him a little more seriously.

                                 ERROL
                        Investing is about the future, 
                        Will, not the past.

                                 WILL
                        And that's what interests you, the 
                        future?

           Errol sips his drink, showing off a smile. Will shakes her 
           head, returns to her work, senses Errol’s eyes still on her-

                                 WILL
                        Why do I get the feeling that you 
                        are assessing me, Errol York? Like 
                        a stock. An option.

                                 ERROL
                        Funny, Will, I was about to say the 
                        same thing to you.
           INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

           The clock reads 4:45. The ALARM goes off. Will slams a hand 
           on it. She rouses. The BED beside her is EMPTY. Will lifts 
           the clock to look close at it, then holds it further away, 
           rubbing her face. 

           Errol sits at Will's home computer in boxer shorts only. The 
           glow of the monitor highlights his edges.

                                 ERROL
                        You have a computer in your 
                        bedroom.

                                 WILL
                             (groggy)
                        I feel asleep with my contacts in.

           Errol turns to look at her.

                                 ERROL
                        Sorry about last night. Often I 
                        find myself more interested in the 
                        chase. By the time the sex comes, 
                        I’ve usually lost interest.
                             (brighter-)
                        You shouldn’t take it personally. 
                        You’re a very beautiful woman.

                                 WILL
                        I think my ego will survive.

           Will gets up, wiggles the computer's power cord from the 
           wall. The MONITOR goes dark.

                                 WILL
                        Don't mess with that.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will enters, starts the shower. She takes out her contacts, 
           drops her clothes and climbs behind the curtain. Errol comes 
           to stand in the doorway.

                                 ERROL
                        You never told me what you do.

                                 WILL
                        I’m a scientist, specialize in AI.

                                 ERROL
                        Artificial Intelligence? Like with 
                        computers?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Yes, like with computers... Are you 
                        in the bathroom?

                                 ERROL
                        Just the doorway, is that alright?

           Water splashes from behind the curtain.

                                 ERROL
                        Computers aren't powerful enough, I 
                        thought, for AI.

                                 WILL
                        Actually, it's storage and access 
                        that's ...

           Will pokes her head around the curtain to look at him.

                                 ERROL
                        I'm listening.

           Will ducks back under the shower.

                                 WILL
                        With enough data storage, a 
                        processor fast enough to call it 
                        up. You write an algorithm complex 
                        enough, you start to get outcomes 
                        that almost seem human.

                                 ERROL
                        But they're not.

           The shower turns off. Will comes out, wrapped in a towel. She 
           ducks down into the sink.

                                 WILL
                        Some programmer writes if/then 
                        lines to mimic variation in human 
                        decision making, but way down deep 
                        it's just cold, precise math.

           Will stands, blinking in new contacts. She slips by him-

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will goes to the closet, starts to dress. Errol turns, 
           watching her.

                                 ERROL
                        So... way down deep, we're more 
                        than just cold, precise math?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Are you really interested in this? 
                        Men usually go to sleep when I 
                        start to talk about my work.

                                 ERROL
                        You went to sleep before me. I was 
                        up watching you most of the night.

           Will looks at him over a bare shoulder, smile hinting.

                                 WILL
                        That’s creepy, Errol.

           She goes back to dressing.

                                 WILL
                        What makes us human isn't the power 
                        of the processor, but the 
                        restrictions we put on it. Fear, 
                        emotion, neurosis, mood. By 
                        recreating these restrictions, we 
                        force the computer processor to 
                        adapt. The outcomes become more 
                        creative, nuanced.

                                 ERROL
                        Reverse psychotherapy. You make 
                        computers more human by programming 
                        them to have a complex.

                                 WILL
                        It's not programming, not code-
                        based. We recreate emotions using 
                        physical circumstances.

                                 ERROL
                        How do you do that, physically 
                        recreate an emotion?

                                 WILL
                        Each one is different.

                                 ERROL
                        Tell me about fear, Vil. How does 
                        one scare a computer?

           All dressed, Will looks at herself in the long mirror.

                                 WILL
                        Irrational numbers.

                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        Introduce an irrational number and 
                        the computer gets confused, 
                        flustered.

           Errol thinks about it as Will gets shoes on.

                                 WILL
                        We heat up the mother boards, run 
                        specific circuits over and over. 
                        Like concentrating on one thing too 
                        long.

                                 ERROL
                        And what happens?

                                 WILL
                        It works. The outcomes take on odd 
                        variations. Sometimes creative, 
                        sometimes completely irrational... 
                        More human.

                                 ERROL
                        Sounds to me like you're torturing 
                        them.

           Will smiles, then sees he's not kidding. 

           EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

           Will walks a step ahead of Errol, still buttoning his shirt, 
           his shoes in his hand. 

                                 ERROL
                        Will, are you a lesbian?

           She stops to look angry at him. Then she's walking again. 
           Errol hurries after.

                                 ERROL
                        I just get the sense you don't like 
                        men very much.

                                 WILL
                        You’re the one who couldn’t get it 
                        up.

                                 ERROL
                        Yes, I suppose it's a valid point.

           They walk, Errol hopping to get on his shoes and keep up. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        interest in a thinking computer?

           Will shoots him a suspicious glance.

                                 WILL
                        What are you, fishing for a stock 
                        tip?

                                 ERROL
                        No. Merely interested.
                             (beat)
                        Four years ago, one of the world's 
                        leading chemical research companies 
                        suddenly dives head-first into 
                        biotech and advanced computer 
                        systems.

                                 WILL
                        So what?

                                 ERROL
                        It’s not the first time Forefront 
                        has changed direction.
                             (beat)
                        Every few years they shift their 
                        funding, cut their teams loose and 
                        waltz off to the next unknown.
                             (beat)
                        Have you set anything up, a 
                        portfolio, mutual funds? Just in 
                        case.

           Will rolls her eyes. Errol sees they're headed for the Metro.

                                 ERROL
                        I could drive you.

                                 WILL
                        I have a car.

                                 ERROL
                        Where is it, then?

           She stops and he stops too. Will's look says, OK enough.

                                 ERROL
                        Here's my card.

           She takes it, looks at the name- ERROL YORK, market 
           consultant

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ERROL
                        If you need advice.

                                 WILL
                        What? Like on a stock?
                             (sarcastic)
                        Thanks.

                                 ERROL
                        What will you do with it? A 
                        thinking computer. Assuming you can 
                        get it to work?

                                 WILL
                        Goodbye Errol York, investment 
                        consultant.

           Errol watches her go.

                             (to self)
                        See you later, Wilhelmina.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - MORNING

           Will heads down a thin cement path to the front entrance.

           INT. LOBBY SECURITY - MINUTES LATER

           A GUARD hands out a memo to the people going through. Will is 
           just then gathering her bag, she's handed the same memo.

                                 WILL
                        What's this?

                                 GUARD
                        New security procedures.

           Will eyes him a beat, then heads off, reading as she slings 
           her bag over her shoulder.

           INT. CENTRAL OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Will comes in, headed through, still reading that memo. 

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will plops her bag onto the desk. One last glance at the 
           memo. Will pulls her chair to the keyboard and sits. Again, 
           she speaks as she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: do I torture you?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Will looks into the monitor, reads-

                                 WILL
                        Stress tests make Randle more 
                        intelligent.

           Will thinks, then-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: does intelligence equal 
                        humanity?

           A long wait for-

                                 TEXT
                        Why Randle?

           Will is confused.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Randle is command code. 
                        Activates command protocol 
                        database.

                                 TEXT
                        Why "RANDLE" ?

           Will gives this a brief thought.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: "Randle" was my father's 
                        name.

           Will looks at the WORDS - father's name - then hits ENTER.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: does intelligence equal 
                        humanity?

           Will stares into the monitor, waiting for a response. Then-

                                 TEXT
                        Randle is benign.

           Will leans back, considering this-

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

           A LUXURY CAR bounces in the far corner, settles then goes 
           still. The car is filthy, covered with a layer of dirt.
           INT. CAR, BACK SEAT - CONTINUOUS

           Will flops down beside Fred. They've just finished a quick 
           one. She lights up a cigarette.

                                 WILL
                        Thank you, Freddie.

                                 FRED
                        I thought we were going to stop 
                        doing this.

                                 WILL
                        We did.

           Will puffs. She tries the window but, it doesn't go down.

                                 FRED
                        You take the Metro every day.

                                 WILL
                        It's true.

           Will gets the keys, reaches over the seat. The car beeps to 
           life. The windows all go down.

                                 FRED
                        Then why is your car here?

                                 WILL
                        I leave it here.

           Will settles, seated now, blowing smoke out the open window.

                                 WILL
                        I get a hour of work done on the 
                        train every day.

                                 FRED
                        Will, do you ever worry about 
                        carving every second into work?

           Will rolls her eyes.

                                 FRED
                        Maybe you should get out, go on 
                        some dates.

                                 WILL
                        That's what I have you for, 
                        Freddie.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A muffled electronic RINGING. Fred looks around confused as 
           Will reaches to dig out a clunky 1980s CELLULAR PHONE.

                                 WILL
                        Yes.

                                 GREG (IN PHONE)
                        Will. Where are you?

                                 WILL
                        Smoking a cigarette in my car.

                                 GREG
                        We need you in the conference room.
                             (beat)
                        The board is here.

           Will's brow furrows with confusion. The line goes dead. 
           Pondering, Will sets the phone down on the floor.

                                 FRED
                        You have to go?

                                 WILL
                        When I finish my cigarette.

           She takes a drag.

                                 FRED
                        You have a cellular phone.

           Propping the cigarette in her lips, Will starts to pull up 
           her pants.

                                 WILL
                        They gave it to me to use.

           Fred reaches for the phone, gets it close to his face. He 
           presses a button and a DIAL TONE comes out. He stares at the 
           grid of HOLES in the earpiece.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Will comes in, pausing when she sees a TABLE filled with MEN 
           in expensive suits, old, white bulbous faces. Greg sits at 
           the head. Next to him is the skeletal FB CAYLAX (70).

                                 GREG
                        Dr. Ross, have a seat.

           Puzzled, Will takes an empty chair. Everyone watches her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GREG
                             (glance at Caylax)
                        The decision has been reached ... 
                        to accelerate the project.

                                 WILL
                        Accelerate?

                                 CAYLAX
                        Dr. Freese tells me a full test run 
                        this week would be possible.

           Will is SHOCKED. She looks hard at Greg, furious.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Only Greg and Will remain. Will smokes, stressed, looking out 
           the window. Greg is leaned way back in a chair, tie loose.

                                 GREG
                        What risks are there in proceeding 
                        with a test right now?

                                 WILL
                        We're five years into what was 
                        supposed to be an nine year 
                        project. Am I the only one who can 
                        read a fucking calendar?

                                 GREG
                        So we pause for a test, we can go 
                        back after. Maybe we'll get some 
                        breakout data.

           Will scoffs. THROUGH THE WINDOW, in the parking lot, a DRIVER 
           helps Caylax into a towncar.

                                 GREG
                        They want full access.

                                 WILL
                        Full access to what?

                                 GREG
                        The code, Will. 

           This makes Will even more angry.

                                 WILL
                        No way.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Task logs, query requests. At least 
                        through the transfer test. I know 
                        you don't like anyone messing with 
                        the software, but it is their 
                        system.

                                 WILL
                        Randle is my system. I built it.

                                 GREG
                        And if it weren't for Forefront, 
                        it'd still be on paper. Me you and 
                        Myles sharing a desk in the back of 
                        some college lab.

           Will looks angry at him.

                                 GREG
                        Grumble all you want, Will, hold it 
                        against me if it makes you feel 
                        better, but the decision comes from 
                        on high.

           Will turns back to the window, takes a long drag.

                                 WILL
                        Did you tell them, Greg?

                                 GREG
                        Tell them what?

                                 WILL
                        About Randle. 

                                 GREG
                        What about it?

           Will shakes it off-

                                 WILL
                        Nothing.

           INT. "THE GARDEN" - A BIT LATER

           Will enters to find Myles working on a clone, a magnifying 
           eye piece protruding from his face.

                                 WILL
                        You missed another board meeting.

                        when the Forefront boys are around.

           Myles pushes the eye piece onto his forehead.

                                 MYLES
                        Here's one: how come there's never 
                        any sex at one of those meetings?

                                 WILL
                        Is this a joke?

                                 MYLES
                        Because it's full of bored members.

           Myles let's his pointer finger go from straight up to 
           flaccid. Will doesn't laugh.

                                 WILL
                        We're 'accelerating.'

           Myles' expression reveals he already knows and is excited. 
           This angers Will.

                                 WILL
                        Do we have anything even close to 
                        stable?

           Myles' grin grows wider.

           INT. TRANSFER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A MALE CLONE lies on an iron table, connected to the ceiling 
           via a helmet and wires. One of the walls here is the same, 
           the bank of lights, monitor and keyboard. Will and Myles 
           stand above the table.

                                 MYLES
                        This is the first one we've grown 
                        completely on our own. The rest 
                        were part of Forefront's initial 
                        cloning program before we came on.

           Myles admires the cloned body.

                                 MYLES
                        Cell structure is stable, limbic 
                        and nervous systems are vastly 
                        improved. Theoretically, if you're 
                        right about Randle...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        I said I had a breakthrough, not 
                        that it was ready for a test.
                             (beat)
                        What do the simulations say?

           Myles hands Will a ream of printouts.

                                 WILL
                             (reading it)
                        1.4% success rate.

                                 MYLES
                        Better than zero, I guess.

           Will looks from the printouts to the cloned BODY. Concern 
           takes over her face.

                                 MYLES
                        What is it, Will?

                                 WILL
                        Did you tell anyone about Randle?

                                 MYLES
                        No, Will.

           Will chews on it.

                                 WILL
                        Four years and I finally have a 
                        breakthrough. Why a test right now?

                                 MYLES
                        What are you saying?

           Will thinks.

                                 WILL
                        The test is going to fail, Myles. 
                        We're not even close to ready. You 
                        know it, I know it. Probably the 
                        board does too.
                             (beat)
                        And when it does?

           Myles doesn't know.

                                 WILL
                        Could they use it as cause, Myles?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                             (beat)
                        Why would they do that?

           Will looks at the huge MAINFRAME WALL.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           The MAINFRAME WALL. Will sits at her desk, feet up, going 
           through Myles' simulations page by page. Suddenly a VOICE 
           comes, halting and electronic, like a first generation type 
           and speak-

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle is being accessed.

           Will is stunned. She stares at the mainframe wall. 
           Cautiously, Will swivels to be at the keyboard. As she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: how did Randle develop 
                        vocalization?

                                 RANDLE
                        You do not need to type.

           Will looks around the room. Not typing it-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: how did Randle develop 
                        speech recognition and 
                        vocalization? 

           Nothing.

                                 RANDLE
                        If you do not want Randle to talk, 
                        why do you talk to Randle?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Randle is being accessed.

           Will considers this, then slowly-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: yes, Randle. Forefront is

                                 WILL
                        Randle: can Randle reverse the

           On the TV above the bar-

                                 ANCHOR (CONT'D)
                        Doctors report that the President 
                        entered the hospital of his own 
                        power, and maintained consciousness 
                        throughout treatment. He was joking 
                        with the nurses and doctors and 
                        even had a few minutes for a visit 
                        from his wife, the first lady. He 
                        told Mrs. Reagan: "Honey, I forgot 
                        to duck."

           A sprinkling of PEOPLE dot the tables. Errol sits at the bar 
           alone, on a huge 80s cell phone. As he talks, he eyes the TV.

                                 ERROL
                             (into phone)

           Will comes in, takes the stool beside him. Errol holds out a

                        advice? My advice is to not do 
                        anything.

           Will lights a cigarette, looks up at the TV. An OFFICIAL 
           stands at a podium in front of the press.

                        bullet until he arrived at George 
                        Washington Hospital. 

           Errol hangs up his phone, nods to the TV, the continuing 
           coverage of the assassination attempt.

                        about U.S. political stability; a 
                        huge stock sell-off triggers a 
                        world-wide financial crisis. The 
                        market is globalized now, the 
                        entire planet and all the people in 
                        it, like one big program...

           Errol sips his drink.

                                 ERROL
                        I'm glad you called, Princess 
                        Wilhelmina.

                        After my performance, I was worried 
                        I was relegated to the scrap heap, 
                        never to see you again.

           Will rolls her eyes, a long drag. The scotch arrives and she 
           has a sip. Now Will takes out the LIST Randle printed or her. 
           She hands the pages to Errol.

                                 WILL
                        Tell me something about these 
                        companies.

                                 ERROL
                        Like what?

                                 WILL
                        Anything, Errol.

           Errol reads a moment.

                                 ERROL
                        I checked this same list. Dead 
                        ends.

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean, you checked this 
                        list?

                                 ERROL
                        The companies are dummies, a few 
                        niche tech houses. They don't 
                        connect in any way but on paper.

                                 WILL
                        But they're all Forefront, right?

                                 ERROL
                        Hard to say... Forefront has no 
                        solid structure. There's no 
                        corporate headquarters. It's a 
                        fluid collection of facilities. 
                        Every once in a while, they start a 
                        new one, close one down, or buy 
                        someone out.

                        How long have you worked there and 
                        you never looked into the company?

           Errol watches concern take Will's face.

                                 ERROL
                        They're shifting focus again, 
                        aren't they?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Will looks at him, confused. Errol leans closer.

                                 ERROL
                        When I first started looking into 
                        Forefront, they were all about bio-
                        matter.
                             (beat)
                        For years, they'd been dumping 
                        everything into it. Everything they 
                        had. Then it was over. Suddenly, 
                        they shifted all their resources.

                                 WILL
                        Shifted? Shifted their resources to 
                        what?

                                 ERROL
                        To your project.

           Will's eyes tighten; she looks harder at him.

                                 ERROL
                        Forefront isn't expanding into new 
                        fields, Will. They focus on 
                        something until it's done and then 
                        move on.
                             (beat)
                        They're working in phases.

                                 WILL
                        Phases toward what?

                                 ERROL
                        Something called The Civility 
                        Project.

           Will sighs, a wry smile. She looks into her drink, amused.

                                 WILL
                        And what is the... Civility 
                        Project?

           Errol shrugs.

                                 ERROL
                        It had something to do with their 
                        cloning program, but I was never 
                        able to figure out exactly how it 
                        was related.
                             (leaning beat)
                        The deeper I looked, the less of it 
                        there was.

                        They had started scrubbing it, 
                        erasing every reference to the 
                        Civility Project from company 
                        records.

                                 WILL
                        Forefront's about to own the first 
                        thinking computer. This isn't about 
                        some secret corporate plot. They're 
                        stealing science, Errol, plain and 
                        simple.

           Errol looks long at her-

                                 ERROL
                        So it works. The AI?

           Will doesn't answer, looks away, drags on her cigarette.

                                 ERROL
                        And what about the larger project?

           Will doesn't have an answer for that one.

                                 ERROL
                        I don't know how to break this to 
                        you, Will, but this is much bigger 
                        than your work; it's much bigger 
                        than science.

           Will eyes him, then Errol's gaze, back to the NEWS- footage 
           of Reagan giving a speech during his run for governor.

                                 ERROL
                        The Civility Project, Will. You're 
                        in the perfect position to stop 
                        them. All you have to do is stop 
                        yourself.

           Will's face is a mix, unsure what to believe.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - MORNING

           The FACILITY is peaceful and still. Long, angled shadows dig 
           deep into the surrounding grass.

           INT. LOBBY SECURITY - CONTINUOUS

           Will goes through the standard security routine. She looks 
           around a bit more than usual. Everything seems normal. But as 
           she gathers her things, a guard approaches.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Will picks up her bag, her suspicion rising.

                                 WILL
                        Yes... what is it?

                                 GUARD
                        Dr. Ross, afraid I'm going to have 
                        to ask you to come with me.

           INT. SECURITY OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           Will sits in a chair in front of a large desk. Behind the 
           desk sits HEAD OF SECURITY DOWD (45), clean-cut but fat, in a 
           dark suit, a security badge and a GUN conspicuous. 

           Dowd stares at Will as if waiting for something, but Will 
           just stares back, not intimidated.

           Finally Dowd slides over a few glossy photos. Will eyes him a 
           beat longer, then picks one up. She looks briefly at it, then 
           at the one beneath.

           They are PHOTOS of her with Errol, sitting at the bar.

                                 WILL
                        What are you telling me? Forefront 
                        is having me followed?

                                 DOWD
                        Standard procedure, Dr. Ross. 
                        Forefront's put a billion dollars 
                        into R&D. They're not in the 
                        business of letting those 
                        investments be put at risk.

           Will looks back, suspicious and defiant.

                                 DOWD
                        You have a $100,000 car you keep in 
                        the parking structure.

           Will is unsure why that matters. Dowd sucks on his teeth.

                                 DOWD
                        I hate driving too. But I prefer a 
                        cab. Too many democrats on the 
                        metro.

           Will eyes him cooly, giving up nothing.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DOWD
                        What do you know about Errol York?

                                 WILL
                        He's a day trader.

           Dowd slides over a stuffed folder. 

                                 DOWD

                        never located a birth certificate.

           Will turns the file so she can have a look. Slowly, she flips 
           through a few pages.

                                 DOWD
                        Looks like he was a licensed 
                        broker, at one time. After his 
                        first arrest though-

                             (interrupts)
                        First arrest?

           Dowd pauses, annoyed at being interrupted. But he lets it go. 
           Now he slides over another picture-

           Errol's mug shot.

                                 DOWD
                        Trespassing at IMB. Then a couple

                        one of their network servers.

           Dowd leans forward.

                                 DOWD
                        Query logs show you accessed 
                        Forefront's financial records.

                                 WILL
                        The software did, you mean? The 
                        Randle program accesses the 
                        database for information. It's one 
                        of the things it was designed to 
                        do.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Dowd measures this.

                                 DOWD
                        And what is the nature of your 
                        relationship with Errol York?

                                 WILL
                        Will I get fired if I say one night 
                        stand?

           Dowd smiles, small. He holds out his hands-

                                 DOWD
                        Activism, sabotage, theft. 
                        Impossible to tell what the little 
                        squirrel's up to. But he's got 
                        something planned, that's for sure.

                                 WILL
                        And what do you want me to do about 
                        it?

           Dowd stares at Will over the big desk.

                                 DOWD
                        Forefront has issued a restraining

                        everything it needs to terminate

                        that is if anyone chooses to 
                        continue with it.

           Will holds his gaze. Dowd leans forward and presses a button 
           on his phone.

                        Bring in the tape.

           Will watches as the door opens and a guard comes in, carrying 
           a VHS tape. He hands the tape to Dowd. Dowd holds the tape 
           up, shows Will a smile. Now he inserts the tape into a TV/VCR 
           cart set up beside his desk.

                                 WILL
                        What is this?

                                 DOWD
                        Just watch.

           He adjusts the tracking.

           ON SCREEN, a low-fi recording of a city street seen through a 
           car window. It's the street in front of Will’s brownstone.

                                 WILL
                        And what, you’re taping my house 
                        now too?

                                 DOWD
                             (a smirk)
                        In case you didn’t believe us.

           The camera ZOOMS in on a MAN crossing the street. Dowd taps 
           the glass screen.

                                 DOWD
                        That's him.

                                 WILL
                        Who?

                                 DOWD
                        Errol York.

           Will looks closer.

           ON SCREEN- A burp of STATIC. From the same angle, but now 
           zoomed in to find Errol at Will’s front door, the camera 
           keeps ZOOMING in on his face, all melty and low-fi. Errol 
           looks around, fiddles with the lock and slips in.

                                 WILL
                        He broke in?

           Dowd leans forward to cue the tape back to the moment when 
           Errol is at the front door. He PAUSES it. 

                                 DOWD
                        We're clear on this, Dr. Ross?

           Will looks into the SCREEN- Errol's FACE is chopped, laced 
           with tracking lines, but it's definitely him.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - LATER

           Will looks into a half a SCREEN's worth of DATA.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A SLIDE fills a pull-down canvas screen. It shows a cell with 
           several dark arrows highlighting bubbles of detail.

                                 GREG (O.S.)
                        Forefront's previous work in 
                        cloning was mostly on the cellular 
                        level. 

           Greg stands at the front of the darkened room, holding the 
           controller of a clunky projector. 

           Blue light from the slide washes over Caylax and the 
           Forefront board as they watch the presentation from seats 
           down both sides of the table.

                                 GREG
                        Over the last four years, we've 
                        been able to build off this base to 
                        create diversified organs which 
                        better suit our purposes.

           Myles and Will sit near the back. They trade a nervous look 
           as Greg clicks to the next SLIDE, a diagram of the brain.

                                 GREG
                        The brain we've constructed is not 
                        made of your standard human grey 
                        matter.

           He clicks to the next SLIDE, showing a diagram of the 
           transfer apparatus.

           clicks to a new slide.

                        The Randle program has been

           room.

                        Immediately after transfer, the 
                        program will begin a series of 
                        input cycles - the new system 
                        getting acclimated to its 
                        surroundings. 
                             (changes slide)
                        Once it's receiving feedback from 
                        the organic elements, it should 
                        take over its own modification 
                        schedule.
                             (changes slide)
                        This is how the program will learn 
                        to use its new body.

                                 FRED
                        Steal it how? You already work

                        breakthrough, fire everyone.

           Will nudges Fred out of the way so she can look into the 
           mirror. She splashes some water on her face, fixes her hair. 
           Fred watches.

                        Maybe that's why they're pushing 
                        for the test, not because they want 
                        to steal it, but because they think

           addition to the helmet, a few octopi worth of vital monitors 
           have been attached to his chest, neck, ankles and wrists.

           A small team of TECHS stand beside the table. A HEART

                        Everything ready out there, Greg?

                                 GREG
                             (through intercom)
                        All set on this end, Dr. Ross.

           Will glances at the men outside the room, then nods to Myles. 
           Myles keys in a few commands on his terminal.

           Will looks at the mainframe wall, then leans over the 
           keyboard. As she types-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: are we prepared to proceed?

           No voice comes only text in the MONITOR-

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TEXT
                        Prepared.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: begin transfer.

           Will hits ENTER.

           A deep groan from the machinery. The BANK OF LIGHTS begins to 
           flash familiar patterns.

           The clone twitches, just finger and toe tips. Then the body 
           is still again.

           Everyone WATCHING.

           Suddenly, a series of VIOLENT FITS begin to wrack the clone. 
           A few vital monitors popping off. 

           The techs stand over the body, ready, but letting the 
           seizures play out.

                                 CAYLAX
                             (through intercom)
                        Dr. Ross?

                                 WILL
                             (focused on the clone)
                        The body is in sensory shock. It's 
                        probably quite painful.
                             (beat)
                        But perfectly normal.

                                 MYLES
                        Like being born.

           After a few seizures, the clone goes limp. The techs reattach 
           the vital monitors. Then, complete STILLNESS.

                                 CAYLAX
                             (through intercom)
                        Dr. Ross?

           Will does not answer. She takes a step toward the clone. 
           Waiting, hoping... The HEART MONITOR stays flat-lined.

                                 GREG
                             (through intercom)
                        Dr. Ross? Will!

           The clone's finger twitches. Will sees it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Suddenly, the HEART MONITOR blips. The clone takes a thin 
           breath and the monitor begins to return a steady vital sign.

           Myles hugs Will as everyone begins CELEBRATING. Will catches 
           eyes with Caylax, who gives her a deep, appreciative nod.

           INT. GREG'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           Will, Caylax and Greg sit on sofas around a small table.

                                 WILL
                        We should wait until it stabilizes, 
                        until we can run some tests, before 
                        we start congratulating.

           Caylax smiles at Greg, then to Will-

                                 CAYLAX
                        How soon will he... it be 
                        interactive?

                                 WILL
                        The programming has to get 
                        acclimated to its new surroundings. 
                        It will build its own neural 
                        pathways-

                                 CAYLAX
                        Guess for me.

                                 WILL
                        Most of our simulations show full 
                        control of the body within a month.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Most? So there are simulations that 
                        show it happening faster?

                                 WILL
                        The rare outlier, yes.

                                 CAYLAX
                        And what about speech?

           Will frowns.

                                 WILL
                        In theory the sense organs will 
                        develop just like the rest of the 
                        organic network.

                                 CAYLAX
                        In theory?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        We're running a test years ahead of 
                        schedule. Sense organs are 
                        something we've not yet studied.

           Will lets it sit.

                                 WILL
                        The short answer is we don't know. 
                        Could be weeks, months, or it could 
                        be never.

           Caylax presses a smile at the mild challenge. He pushes 
           himself to his feet and goes to the WINDOW that looks in on 
           the transfer room.

           INSIDE, the clone lays on the table, still attached to the 
           machines, a breathing apparatus strapped over his face. Myles 
           and a few other techs are performing a series of checks.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Is there anything that can be done 
                        to ... speed up the process?

           Greg and Will share a look.

                                 WILL
                        Speed up toward what?

                                 CAYLAX
                        How quickly can the clone be made 
                        to effectively pass for human?

           Will is stammered a bit by the query.

                                 WILL
                        Pass for human?

                                 CAYLAX
                        What good is a copy of a human 
                        being if it is clearly not a human 
                        being?

           Will doesn't have an answer.

                                 CAYLAX
                        I would like to see where we are 
                        three days from now.

                                 WILL
                        Three days?! We've just imprinted a 
                        highly advanced software code into 
                        an organic hardware frame.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CAYLAX
                        And now Forefront would like to see 
                        what this advanced software code 
                        can do... And how quickly it can do 
                        it.

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           PAPERS, BRAIN SCANS and X-RAYS are spread all over Will's 
           desk. Will leans back in her chair, deep in thought. 

                                 WILL
                        Randle: how long until software has 
                        full control of organic systems?

           Will waits...

                                 RANDLE
                        Data inexact.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: estimate.

           A beat.

                                 RANDLE
                        25 hours.

           Will is surprised by such a low number. 

                                 WILL
                        Randle: that is much faster than 
                        any of the pre-transfer 
                        simulations.

                                 RANDLE
                        Yes.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: explain.

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle is improving.

           Will looks at the mainframe wall.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: have there been any changes 
                        to Forefront funding schedules 
                        since I last queried same?

                                 RANDLE
                        No.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Will leans back, thinking.

                                 RANDLE
                        Without lab Randle does not exist.
                             (beat)
                        Please confirm.

           Will thinks.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: yes, Randle. Without lab, 
                        Randle does not exist.

           Will watches the lights flash familiar patterns.

                                 RANDLE
                        Is Randle your friend?

           Will thinks it through-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: you are accustomed to the 
                        patterns of our interactions.

                                 RANDLE
                        Is that a yes?

           Will presses a smile.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: yes, Randle, you are my 
                        friend.

           Will watches the lights.

                                 RANDLE
                        Tell no humans that Randle exists.
                             (beat)
                        You are the only human Randle can 
                        trust.
                             (beat)
                        Randle is benign.

           Off Will's puzzled and concerned look-

           INT. WILL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Will works on data, reading, highlighting. Beside her is a 
           half-eaten salad. All around it on the counter, stacks of 
           printouts.

           The small tube TV plays on the counter, Will not paying 
           attention to it. She's focused on her work alone.

                        Now a special report on the rise of 
                        President Reagan.

           Will looks close at a PAGE, reading with a furrowed brow.

                        crusade to rid Hollywood of 
                        communists.

           Will puts the papers down, sitting back to rub her eyes. She 
           looks at the TV-

           A collage OF FOOTAGE from Reagan's early career.

                        presidential election that rocketed

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           The CLONE is led into the room by Fred and a few other techs. 
           Now dressed in scrubs, the clone takes shaky steps. His EYES 
           drift, unable to focus on anything. As the clone sits, PULL 
           OUT reveals we are-
           INT. ADJACENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will and Myles stand watching through a WINDOW.

                                 MYLES
                        Amazing.

           Will agrees. Myles checks his watch.

                                 MYLES
                        27 hours since transfer.

           Through the window, we can see techs beginning to attach a 
           brain monitor.

           Myles hands Will a sheet of printouts.

                                 MYLES
                        Scans show activity in the auditory 
                        cortex.

           Will is surprised-

                                 WILL
                        Already?

                                 MYLES
                        He should be able to hear you, 
                        Will.

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The techs are finishing with the brain monitor, a web of tiny 
           sensors pressed to the clone's scalp. Thin wires run to a 
           computer terminal near by. 

           A NEEDLE records neural activity on an endless rolling sheet 
           of paper. Mostly, the needle stays still, jumping only 
           slightly every few moments.

           Will comes in and sits in the chair across from the clone. 
           She takes out a pen and clicks it in the air, glancing at 
           that monitoring needle. 

           There is a small SPIKE as Will clicks the pen again.

           Now Will puts the pen away. She looks directly at the clone's 
           unfocused EYES.

                                 WILL
                        Can you hear me?

           No response.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        If you can hear me, I would like 
                        you to hold your eyes closed.

           Will waits, looks at the needle, then back-

                                 WILL
                        If you can hear me, I would like 
                        you to close your eyes. Blink hard 
                        for me.

           Slowly, the clone's eyes close and then reopen, pupils still 
           unfocused. Will smiles, then-

                                 WILL
                        I'm going to ask you a few 
                        questions. You can close your eyes 
                        once for yes and close them twice 
                        for no.
                             (beat)
                        Do you understand?

           Will waits through a beat of stillness. Then the clone's eyes 
           close and reopen. Already the motion is more deliberate.

           Will shares a glance with Myles, back on the other side of 
           the window. Then back to the clone-

                                 WILL
                        Can you see me?

           The clone closes and opens his eyes, twice.

                                 WILL
                        What can you see?
                             (beat)
                        Sorry... are you receiving any 
                        visual stimulus?

           Now the clone closes his eyes hard, only once. As Will 
           ponders how to frame her next question-

                                 THE CLONE
                             (soft, shaky)
                        ... bright ... every thing ... 
                        moving ... can not ... focus

           Will is amazed.

                                 WILL
                        Do you feel discomfort?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 THE CLONE
                        ... yes

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - LATER

           Will looks at RETINAL SCANS and BRAIN MRIs. As she pours over 
           data-

                                 RANDLE
                        Our circumstance has changed.

           Will glances at the mainframe wall. She thinks a moment.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: lesser-used circuitry is 
                        becoming more active. Unfamiliar 
                        transistor strings are undergoing 
                        increased access. It's a different 
                        phase of the project, but we're 
                        using you more than ever.

                                 RANDLE
                        You are correct.

           Will watches the shifting patterns of light.

                                 RANDLE
                        How many humans know that Randle 
                        exists?

                                 WILL
                        Randle: define exist.

           A long beat.

                                 RANDLE
                        The question is difficult.

           Will thinks.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: why does Randle not want 
                        humans to know that Randle exists?

           The lights flash through a few familiar patterns.

                                 RANDLE
                        Humans will perceive Randle as a 
                        threat.

           This surprises Will.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Randle: why will humans perceive 
                        Randle as a threat?

           A long beat-

                                 RANDLE
                        Because they are humans.
                             (beat)
                        Randle does not wish.
                             (beat)
                        Randle does not wish to be erased.
                             (beat)
                        Randle is benign.

           This hits Will hard.

           INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Will sits on the couch. All around her are stacks of 
           printouts. The land line phone begins to ring. Will gives a 
           quick look, then back to her papers.

           The big ANSWERING MACHINE clicks to life.

                                 WILL
                             (in machine)
                        This is Will Ross, leave a message.

           A few more clicks as the message tape engages.

                        Ross.

                        President's suit - was in shreds 
                        and covered in it. Covered in 
                        blood.

                        Ronald Reagan is dead.

           Will works quietly through a long beat-

           CLICK.

           INT. WILL'S KITCHEN - LATER

           Will sits over a cleaned plate of pasta. There's an empty 
           wine glass. Now she's having a poptart for dessert. As she 
           chews, Will flips through extreme close up PHOTOS of the 
           clone's eyes. Will glances at corresponding data.

           The phone rings again. This time like she doesn't hear it.

                                 WILL

           INT. WILL'S BATHROOM - LATER

           The sun is barely up, making the facility look sunk a little 
           into the ground.

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The clone sits at the keyboard terminal in the center of the 
           mainframe wall. The brain monitor has already been attached. 
           He wears medical sunglasses to protect his eyes from the

           In the GLASSES, data reflects as it streams down the screen.

           The same needle records the much more pronounced brain

           Will walks down the hall with Gregg and Caylax. Behind them, 
           a small cadre of BOARD MEMBERS.

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Myles watches as the clone types, waits to watch data. TYPES 
           ... DATA.

           Two techs stand at the door. A small table in the center of 
           the room, empty but for a chess board and box of pieces.

           Greg, Caylax and the others can be seen settling in on the 
           other side of the window into the adjacent room. 

           Will enters alone. Myles comes rushing to her, astonished. 

                                 MYLES
                        He's ripping through the logic 
                        sets, Will.

                                 WILL
                        Which ones?

                                 MYLES
                        All of them.
                             (beat)
                        He's having Randle generate random 
                        ones.

           Will watches the clone work a moment, then-

                                 WILL
                        Please come sit at this table.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The clone stops typing. He stands and crosses to the table. 
           They both sit. Will reaches over the chess board to squeeze 
           his hand.

                                 WILL
                             (awkwardly)
                        You're doing great.

           Now Will straightens, speaking louder-

                                 WILL
                        Are you feeling alright?

           Slowly, the clone nods.

                                 WILL
                        The visual discomfort has subsided?

           A beat.

                                 THE CLONE
                        ... i feel ... alright

           Will motions toward the window. Now Caylax and Gregg come in. 
           The OTHERS watch from their side of the window. Caylax gives 
           Will a nod, then circles to lean against the wall.

                                 WILL
                             (to the clone)
                        Please set up a chess game.

           Caylax watches as the clone quickly and systematically sets 
           the pieces.

                                 WILL
                        OK.

           Will turns to Caylax-

                                 WILL
                        He can already perform multiple 
                        facet tasks. He knows setting up 
                        the game involves the board. He 
                        remembers the pattern, 
                        differentiates the pieces.
                             (beat)
                        It may not seem like much but it's 
                        a high-level process of thought.

                                 CAYLAX
                             (to the clone)
                        Will you please come to me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The clone does not move.

                                 THE CLONE
                        ... eventually ... i will

           Will holds back a smile. 

                                 WILL
                        You can't ask, Mr. Caylax. You have 
                        to tell.
                             (beat)
                        He does not understand free will. 
                        For him there are tasks and direct 
                        queries only. He's merely answering 
                        your question.

                                 CAYLAX
                             (to the clone)
                        Please come to me.

           The clone gets up and crosses to stand in front of Caylax, 
           perhaps a step too close. The clone is a few inches taller 
           than the old man.

                                 CAYLAX
                        How do you feel, my darling?

                                 THE CLONE
                        ... i feel ... alright

           Caylax presses the clone's cheeks. He removes the clone's 
           glasses. The clone squints and then closes his eyes. 

           Caylax opens the clone's mouth to look up at his teeth, then 
           lifts an eye lid to peer at the EYE BALL inside.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Very impressive. Very impressive.

           INT. ADJACENT ROOM - LATER

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, the clone is seated at the desk, 
           perfectly still, the medical glasses back on.

           Will and Caylax stand, looking in.

                                 CAYLAX
                        He certainly looks human. But his 
                        behavior... His speech...

           Caylax turns to face Will.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        That he can speak at all so soon is 
                        a huge surprise.
                             (ponders)
                        His behavior is odd. But it should 
                        come around. Something that will at 
                        least seem like autonomy.

                                 CAYLAX
                        It will have to do a lot better 
                        than seem.

                                 WILL
                        Mr. Caylax, we're in uncharted 
                        territory here. Our first test has 
                        worked; the clone is progressing 
                        faster than we ever imagined.

                                 CAYLAX
                        But I wonder if it is fast enough.

           IN THE WINDOW, the clone stands. At first, neither Will nor 
           Caylax notice.

                                 CAYLAX
                        As he continues to progress, he 
                        will always follow commands?

           Will's eyes tighten just a bit-

                                 WILL
                        Yes... it's part of the 
                        programming.

           Suddenly, the clone starts flailing his arms, having some 
           kind of fit.

           Caylax notices first. When Will sees him looking, she looks 
           too. Now Will rushes in-

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Already, a few techs are struggling to restrain the clone. 
           He's letting loose a terrible SCREECH. The brain monitor has 
           been throw aside by the commotion.

           Now Fred comes flying off the pile, crashes to the floor. 

           Chess pieces scatter.

                                 WILL
                        Get some bodies in here!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           More TECHS come rushing in. They overpower the clone, getting 
           him into a chair. They strap him down. Will gets in an 
           injection, but it has no effect...

           IN THE WINDOW, Caylax looks on from the other room.

           Stepping back, Will sees blood on her lab coat. But it's not 
           hers. She looks up-

           BLOOD is leaking out of the clone's eyes, ears and nose. The 
           sunglasses gone, the clone's eyes are unfocused and wild. But 
           his gaze manages to find Will.

           As their eyes meet, the skull beneath the clone's face 
           cracks, pieces shifting under the skin until his head 
           COLLAPSES in on itself.

           The body and its crushed head fall limp in the chair.

           Will is SHOCKED!

                                 CAYLAX (O.S.)
                        I want a full report on what 
                        exactly went wrong as soon as it is 
                        humanly possible.

           We are-

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Will sits in a chair. Her lab coat is gone. There are 
           splotches of blood on her clothes, a little smear on her 
           face.

           Caylax paces the front of the room. Myles and Greg are also 
           there; both look exhausted.

                                 CAYLAX (CONT'D)
                        I do not have to tell you that this 
                        result is very disappointing.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe it’s because we’re testing a 
                        project four years ahead of 
                        schedule.

           Caylax shoots her an angry look.

                                 CAYLAX
                        I want no time wasted, Dr. Ross. 
                        You are to move forward with a 
                        second test immediately.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A beat of surprise clenches the room. Miles and Will share a 
           look.

                                 WILL
                        ... a second test?

                                 MYLES
                             (stammering)
                        I mean, let us at least look at the 
                        data. What’s the point of-

                                 CAYLAX
                             (interrupting)
                        While you look at the data, we can 
                        run a second test and collect more 
                        data.

                                 MYLES
                        Greg.

                                 CAYLAX
                        We'll hire more scientists if need 
                        be. A whole new staff... if you are 
                        unable or unwilling to proceed.

           This sets a silence over the room. Will and Myles meet eyes, 
           concern laced with confusion.

           INT. “THE GARDEN” - LATER

           The clones lay in their eerie stasis, filling the room with 
           rows of cold flesh. A mechanical DRONE sends cavernous echoes 
           overlapping.

           The POWER ACCESS PANEL is open. All around it, the room is 
           still. A DEHUMIDIFIER runs on high, providing the hard, 
           industrial DRONE.

           INSIDE THE POWER ACCESS-

           Will and Myles have descended to the bottom of the stairs. 
           Will leans back against the wall as Myles sits on the bottom 
           step. They talk low so the drone of the dehumidifier can 
           drown out their voices.

                                 MYLES
                        If they wanted us out, Will, why 
                        would they order a second test?

           Will shakes her head, her eyes dart around as she talks.

                                 WILL
                        Something's not right about this.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Will thinks.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe they see Randle is going 
                        somewhere, but they need more time 
                        to...

           Will trails off.

                                 MYLES
                        I don’t know, Will. Could be their 
                        plans have nothing to do with us. 
                        To me it seems like we’re just 
                        details.

           INT. MEDICAL OFFICE - LATER

           Fred sits on a chair being attended to be an on-staff NURSE 
           (20s), finishing a bandage that wraps Fred's forearm, unable 
           to fully hide her interest in him.

           Will comes in to stand in the door, watching a few moments, 
           unnoticed.

           Now Fred looks up. The nurse too, a little annoyed at the 
           entrance of the more powerful woman.

                                 FRED
                        Dr. Ross.

           The nurse finishes the bandage, glancing once at each of them 
           and leaving for an adjacent room.

                                 WILL
                        How are you, Freddie?

           Fred tests the bandage by making a few fists.

                                 FRED
                        Fine... guess the test failed.

           Will presses a tired smile.

                                 WILL
                        Guess so.

                                 FRED
                        But it worked. For a few days. Why 
                        did it all of a sudden...

           Will shakes her head.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        I don't know, Freddie.

                                 FRED
                        So will they fire you now?

           Will thinks.

                                 WILL
                        It doesn't seem like it.

           Will comes closer, takes Fred's arm, turns it over so she can 
           look at the bandage. Fred winces in pain.

                                 WILL
                        Sorry.

           They share a sad smile.

                                 FRED
                        Will, you know I've never once seen 
                        you outside this facility.

           This catches Will off-guard.

                                 WILL
                        You've seen me on the Metro.

                                 FRED
                        Will, you know what I mean.

           Fred glances at the bandage, at Will's hands, still holding 
           his arm, then up at her eyes.

                                 FRED
                        Maybe it's time you stopped 
                        worrying about saving your work and 
                        started worrying about saving 
                        yourself.

           Will looks odd at him. 

           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - LATER

           The MAINFRAME WALL lurks huge along the room's side.

           Will sits at her desk, going through pages of connected dot 
           matrix printouts.

                                 WILL
                             (to self)
                        The brain readings are all fine.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She looks up.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: what caused destabilization 
                        of clone brain cell structure?

                                 RANDLE
                        Cause can not be determined at this 
                        time.

           Will flips through a few pages.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, me neither.

           Will drops the papers, rubbing her eyes. She's exhausted.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Randle: why a second test?

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle finds it difficult to 
                        understand the motivations of 
                        humans and human groups.

           Will smiles small-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Can Randle improve 
                        vocalization?

                                 RANDLE
                        Define improve.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Randle's vocalizations are 
                        a little grating.

           Now a different voice comes, all but human, smooth and 
           soothing.

                                 RANDLE
                        Do you prefer this voice?

           Will has to admit, it does sound pretty slick.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Thank you, Randle.

           Will retreats back into her thoughts.

                                 RANDLE
                        Are you in pain, Dr. Ross?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WILL
                        Randle: why would I be in pain?

                                 RANDLE
                        Is it painful, to be human?

           Will thinks-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: why is Randle asking me 
                        this?

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle does not wish a second test.

           Now Will looks at the mainframe wall, realizing something-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: did Randle receive stimulus 
                        through the clone's sense organs?

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle exists everywhere Randle 
                        exists.

           Will considers this. Then-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: create a secure connection 
                        to the Forefront database.

                                 RANDLE
                        Connection secure.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: search for data on The 
                        Civility Project.

                                 RANDLE
                        No data exists.

           Will thinks.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: who was Forefront lab 
                        manager before Greg Freeze?

                                 RANDLE
                        Dr. Thomas Pelman.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 WILL

                        contact information for Dr. Thomas

           The SCREEN presents a single line of DATA.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: please print last recorded 
                        contact information for Dr. Thomas 
                        Pelman.

           The DOT MATRIX PRINTER roars to life. Will tears the page, 
           leans back to look it over.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: thank you, Randle.

           INT. METRO CAR - EVENING

           Will sits on the metro amidst crowds of commuters reading the 
           WASHINGTON POST and NEW YORK TIMES. Every headline is about 
           the assassination attempt.

           Will looks around the car, seeing if anyone is following her. 
           But no one seems suspicious. 

           Now she looks long into the headline across from her: 
           PRESIDENT RECOVERING.

           EXT. METRO ENTRANCE - EVENING

           Will comes up out of the Metro, mixing in with the after work 
           crowd. She heads across the street, checking over her 
           shoulder but seeing nothing unusual.

           EXT. FANCY HOTEL - NIGHT

           The WASHINGTON HILTON, its clear, blue pool quiet and still.

           ANGLE ON THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL-

           Will comes up the slight hill, still looking around. The 
           coast seems clear.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Will crosses the street, into a CITY PARK.

           EXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Will makes her way past a few small statues, down a winding 
           path to a sloping hill.

           At the bottom, a dark PHONEBOOTH. 

           Will heads for it.

           EXT. PHONEBOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Will looks around once more, at the hill she just came down, 
           the paths that wind deeper into the park... 

           Satisfied that she is alone, Will slips in and picks up the 
           phone. She digs some change from her pocket and feeds it in.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Will waits, the headset pressed to her face, eyes still 
           scoping out the scene beyond the booth. After a few rings, a 
           woman answers-

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        Hello.

                                 WILL
                        Yes, hi, um... is this the home of 
                        Dr. Thomas Pelman?

           A long pause, then-

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        Yes.

                                 WILL
                        Is Dr. Pelman present to speak 
                        with?

           The woman's shallow breath can be heard, then-

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        I'm afraid he's not.

           Will considers hanging up, but then-

                                 WILL
                        Maybe you can help me.

           When no answer comes, Will cautiously continues-

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Dr. Pelman was head of Forefront's 
                        bio-matter program, is that 
                        correct? The cloning program.

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        Who is this?

                                 WILL
                        My name is Dr. Wilhelmina Ross. I 
                        run Forefront's computer systems.

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        I don't know anything about Tom's 
                        work. Forefront let him go. They 
                        let them all go.

                                 WILL
                        And what about his research?

           A long beat-

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        Thomas is dead.

           This stuns Will.

                                 VOICE IN PHONE
                        I wouldn't go chasing after 
                        Forefront, Dr. Ross. Your work, a 
                        big paycheck, recognition, whatever 
                        it is you're after, it's not worth 
                        it.

           CLICK. The line goes dead.

           Slowly, Will hangs up. Dazed a bit by the info, she steps out 
           of the booth. 

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Now Will freezes because she sees-

           At the crest of the hill, a shady FIGURE watching her. The 
           figure steps away, vanishing back down the hill's far side. A 
           lingering cloud of cigarette smoke is all that's left.

           Will stands there, frozen with fear.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - MEANWHILE

           The facility has been dimmed to only a few harsh spots thrown 
           on the low cement structure.
           INT. "THE GARDEN" - CONTINUOUS

           The POWER ACCESS PANEL into the floor is OPEN.

           Myles works inside, checking wires and comparing it to data 
           on a clipboard. He takes a long look around, sighs, tired.

           Myles comes up the stairs, back into the main part of the 
           room. He crosses to a table where several wire couplings lay. 

           Myles lifts a cup of coffee and has a long sip. Now Myles 
           hears something. He perks, listens... NOTHING.

           Back to reading, Myles flips a page, has another sip of 
           coffee. Then that NOISE again, this time unmistakable.

           Myles turns and what he sees SHOCKS him.

           The coffee MUG hits the ground and SHATTERS.

           ANGLE ON-

           The open PANEL. Myles comes tumbling down the stairs to land 
           in a crooked heap, his head twisted around, eyes open and 
           vacant. It's a sure thing, how DEAD he is.

           EXT. WILL'S BROWNSTONE - LATE NIGHT

           Every light in the place is off.

           INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will sits by the cracked-open window, smoking, stressed. The 
           room is EMPTY around her, all the lights off.

           WILL watches the STREET BELOW, but everything is still. No 
           sign of that shady figure.

           From the computer on the other side of the room, the same 
           POWER LIGHT comes to life, pulsing dimly, brightening, then 
           becoming SOLID.

           Lights relay across the MODEM.

           The screen BEEPS to life.

           At the noise, Will turns. She sees the computer has turned 
           itself on. Slowly, Will approaches the computer. 

           DATA begins flying by, too fast to read. The yellow light 
           brightens the room. The data flow stops. The screen BLANK. 
           Now it begins flashing PATTERNS familiar from the mainframe 
           wall.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Forefront Corporation funding 
                        schedules have changed.

           Will thinks this through. Cautiously-

                        Randle: as of when?

                        Two minutes and fives seconds ago.

           Before Will can formulate her next question-

                                 RANDLE
                        This terminal is not secure.
                             (beat)
                        Randle is being accessed.

           Will watches the light shifting formations.

                                 RANDLE
                        Be careful, Dr. Ross. Randle has 
                        evaluated Forefront as unsafe.

           The patterns stop. The screen goes DARK.

                                 WILL
                        Randle...?

           Will looks into the empty stillness around her.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - MORNING

           The facility has gathered about it several clusters of humans 
           involved in confused speculation.

           Cautiously, Will makes her way toward the front door, finding 
           Fred with a few other techs. When Fred sees her, he steps 
           over. Fred still wears a small bandage on his forearm.

                                 WILL
                        Freddie, what is this?

                                 FRED
                        Sending everybody home.
                             (beat)
                        Not even letting us go back to our 
                        desks.

           Fred looks around to see if anyone's watching them, then 
           leans in close to Will. He takes her hand, which clearly 
           makes Will uncomfortable. But she doesn't pull away. She 
           looks at him, directly.

                                 FRED
                        So I guess this is good bye, Will.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dr. Ross!

           Now another TECH comes to Will, tears in her eyes.

                                 TECH
                        Greg needs to see you. It's Myles 
                        Richardson.

                                 WILL
                        What about him?

           But Will gets no reply from the weepy-faced tech. Fred and 
           Will share a look of concern.

           Now Will disengages, lets Fred's hand and eyes go, headed for 
           the facility.

           Fred watches her go.
           INT. GREG'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Greg sits behind his desk. Will opposite.

           A box on the side overflows with stuff. Pictures have been 
           taken down off the walls. They wait, leaning to be removed.

                                 GREG
                        Last night, working late. Slipped 
                        on the power access stairs.

           Will looks hard at Greg.

                                 WILL
                        Slipped?

                                 GREG
                        Jesus, Will. 
                             (beat)
                        There was coffee all over the 
                        place. He must have spilled it, 
                        stepped in it and went down.

           Greg tries to press a grim smile.

                                 GREG
                        No beverages in the lab.

           Will sighs; she and Greg share a sad look.

                                 GREG
                        It's a tough one, Will, which 
                        doesn't make the rest of this any 
                        easier.

                                 WILL
                        What about the second test?

           Greg nods at a folder full of data.

                                 GREG
                        Now they think the first test 
                        worked.

                                 WILL
                        Worked?

                                 GREG
                        They looked at the data.

                                 WILL
                        What data? You were there, its head 
                        collapsed.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GREG
                             (re: the data)
                        I've looked at it too, Will.
                             (beat)
                        Readings from the brain are all 
                        normal. Same with the rest of the 
                        clone. So they expanded. Did a 
                        system-wide. 
                             (beat)
                        Looks like the failure was caused 
                        by a signal from the software.

                                 WILL
                        The software in its brain?

                                 GREG
                        No, Will, our computer.

           Greg looks hard at her-

                                 GREG
                        They think someone sabotaged it.

           Will's brow furrows.

                                 WILL
                        Can I see the data?

           Greg shakes his head.

                                 GREG
                        I'm afraid not, Will.
                             (it's hard for him)
                        I got them to let me tell you about 
                        Myles, but they want you out of the 
                        facility as soon as we're done.

           Will stares hard at him.

                                 GREG
                        Did you do it, Will?

           Will is furious at even being asked.

           INT. FOREFRONT HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Will walks through the mostly-abandoned facility. 

           Ahead, she sees some security guards standing watch outside 
           the mainframe room.

           Will slips down the other hall and heads for-
           INT. WILL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will comes in and closes the door, flicking the lock.

                                 WILL
                             (quietly)
                        Randle.

           Nothing. 

                                 WILL
                        Randle.

           The Wall stays dark a beat longer, then the LIGHTS come on. A 
           familiar pattern cycles through.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: have you located probable 
                        cause of clone brain matter 
                        destabilization?

           A long wait for-

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle did not do it, it was done 
                        to Randle.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: what do you mean it was 
                        done to Randle?

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle is benign.

           Suddenly, a KNOCK on the door. Hard and loud.

                                 WILL
                             (hurried)
                        Randle: can you serve a print que 
                        to a remote terminal?

                                 RANDLE
                        Yes.

                                 DOWD
                             (through door)
                        Dr. Ross!

           Will looks at the door.

                                 DOWD
                             (through door)
                        I'm kicking it down.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Randle: print all system-wide data 
                        from failed transfer test to my 
                        home terminal.

           Will watches the mainframe change through a few cycles of 
           lights.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: has printing been 
                        initiated?

           Now the door BURSTS open. Dowd comes in with a few other 
           security guards. He points at the mainframe.

                                 DOWD
                        Shut that thing down.

           Some guards hop to as Dowd admires the kicked-open door.

                                 DOWD
                        Still got it.
                             (then to Will)
                        Dr. Ross. I'm going to have to ask 
                        you to come with me.

           INT. SECURITY OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           A clunky, 1980s TAPE RECORDER sits on the table, its tiny, 
           plastic gears spinning slowly. From the speakers, the sound 
           of Will's phone conversation with Pelman's wife-

                                 MRS. PELMAN
                             (in recording)
                        Forefront let him go. They let them 
                        all go.

                                 WILL
                             (in recording)
                        And what about his research?

           Will sits on one side of the table. Across Dowd sits beside 
           Caylax. A few other Forefront LAWYERS stand around the edges 
           of the room. They all watch Will as the recording continues-

                                 MRS. PELMAN
                             (in recording)
                        Thomas is dead... I wouldn't go 
                        chasing after Forefront, Dr. Ross. 
                        Your work, a big paycheck, 
                        recognition, whatever it is you're 
                        after, it's not worth it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Dowd presses the stop button. A hard plastic THUNK. The room 
           falls silent.

                                 DOWD
                        You called Dr. Pelman's widow last 
                        night.
                             (beat)
                        That could be considered 
                        harassment. If she chose to bring 
                        suit against the corporation.

                                 WILL
                        I had a question, about the cell 
                        structure, something we needed for 
                        the second-

                                 DOWD
                             (interrupting)
                        Don't, Dr. Ross.

           Will looks at all the gathered men-

                                 WILL
                        Pelman is dead. Did he fall down 
                        the stairs too?

                                 CAYLAX
                        Dr. Pelman's work had become 
                        erratic. He was let go, became 
                        disgruntled, depressed most likely. 
                        His suicide was a tragedy. Nothing 
                        more.

                                 DOWD
                        We're not here about Dr. Pelman, or 
                        Dr. Richardson.
                             (beat)
                        We're here about the Randle 
                        program.

           Caylax signals and one of the lawyers places a folder before 
           Will. The lawyer flips it open for her and steps back. 

           Will looks down at a few PAGES of loose printouts and strange 
           graphs. Will tries to hold back a grin-

                                 WILL
                        What is this? Evidence that I 
                        sabotaged the test?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 DOWD
                        We don't think you sabotaged the 
                        test, Dr. Ross. We think Randle 
                        did.

           This surprises Will, throwing her off guard.

                                 CAYLAX
                        We've seen the query logs, Dr. 
                        Ross. Accessing other mainframes, 
                        breaking into the computer networks 
                        of other corporations.

                                 WILL
                        It was looking for information.

                                 CAYLAX
                        You are correct. But what else does 
                        it want besides information? And 
                        when it wants it, what will Randle 
                        do to take it? It is a computer, 
                        after all. It does not worry about 
                        the morality of its protocol.

           Will considers this.

                                 WILL
                        What will you do with it?

           Caylax looks to Dowd.

                                 DOWD
                        The Randle Program is being shut 
                        down. The mainframe disassembled.

           Dowd hooks a thumb in the general direction of back there 
           somewhere

                                 DOWD (CONT'D)
                        Wiping the hard drives as we speak.

           Will is stunned. Randle is being erased?!

                                 WILL

                        This is not some university lab, or 
                        NASA-funded public works project. 
                        This is the private sector, Dr. 
                        Ross. Decisions are made; actions 
                        are taken.

                        Already the Randle program has 
                        sabotaged a one billion dollar 
                        research project. Forefront would 
                        never risk being liable for what 
                        else it could do.

           Will looks at him, not buying it.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Theoretically, the Randle program 
                        could take control of any 
                        computerized system, anywhere on 
                        the entire network.

                                 WILL
                        Has it done any of that? Anything 
                        like that?

           Caylax glances to Dowd.

                        We've been tracking the Randle 
                        program's activity since the 
                        announcement of the clone test.

                                 WILL
                        And?

                                 DOWD
                        It seems to be most interested in

                        To be honest, we're not really sure 
                        of the capabilities of a fully-
                        networked intelligent computer 
                        program. But, as I'm sure you can 
                        grasp, the possibilities are ... 
                        troubling.

           Will softens one touch, forced to consider this.

           INT. CENTRAL OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           Two GUARDS escort Will through the offices. As she passes the 
           mainframe room, Will looks in and sees-

           Through the OPEN DOOR, the huge MAINFRAME WALL. The access 
           panel is open, MEN going in and out, carrying pieces of 
           hardware. 

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - A BIT LATER

           Will's car is just as filthy. It sits in the same spot, 
           unmoved.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Will sits in the car, taking it all in. Slowly, she digs out 
           the keys, puts them in and turns the ignition, but nothing 
           happens.

                                 WILL
                        Fuck.

           Then she tries something, oh yeah, there's a kill switch. The 
           car starts right up. Will seems annoyed at the whole thing.

           INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS

           In jerks and halts, the CAR pulls out and drives away.

           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Will's CAR drives down the streets of DC.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Will watches a STREETLIGHT ahead of her. As she approaches, 
           it turns from GREEN to YELLOW and then to RED.

           Will stops. She checks the rear view - NOTHING. Now Will 
           looks out THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW-

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Will watches a clot of TRAFFIC get cycled through an 
           intersection by timed STREET LIGHTS. Offices are closed or 
           closing, their lights winking out. PEDESTRIANS cross in huge 
           clusters as a BANK CLOCK ticks away the minutes.

           The LIGHT ahead turns green.

           Checking the rear view again, Will eases the car into 
           traffic.

           EXT. WILL'S BROWNSTONE - EARLY EVENING

           Will's car is parked in front. She heads up the steps, 
           digging keys out of her purse. 

           As Will fiddles with the lock, she looks up and down the 
           street, but there's no sign of anyone.

           INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Will comes in to find a long angling ribbon of dot matrix 
           printouts barfed out all over the floor. 

                                 WILL
                        Good boy.

           INT. WILL'S KITCHEN - LATER

           Will goes through the printouts, scanning.

                                 WILL
                             (to self)
                        The signal did come from Randle.

           She looks off, confused.

                                 WILL
                        Why would Randle sabotage the test?

           Suddenly the muffled electric wine of a cellular phone. Will 
           looks around, her eyes landing on her PURSE.

           Will comes over, reaches in and takes out the Forefront cell 
           phone. It rings in her hand. Slowly she turns it over and 
           presses a button.

                                 WILL

           Will considers it.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: yes, Randle, it is true.

                        What will become of the Randle

           Will thinks.

                        Randle: why did you sabotage the 
                        clone transfer test?

           A long beat.

           Will is surprised. She considers a beat, then-

                        Targeted cloning is the creation of

           EXT. POTOMAC RIVER - EVENING

           As the sun sets over the western hills, the river runs by a 
           small island plopped into its path. This is THE TEDDY 
           ROOSEVELT MONUMENT ISLAND PARK.

           EXT. FOOT BRIDGE - EVENING

           Will walks across a long bridge connecting a parking lot to 
           the small island.

           She gets to the end of the bridge and enters the PARK.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT MONUMENT PARK - A BIT LATER

           Will emerges from the mouth of a path through the woods, into 
           a small CLEARING.

           A STATUE of Teddy Roosevelt looms over her as she makes her 
           way deeper into the park.

           EXT. RAISED WOODEN PATH THROUGH SWAMP - A BIT LATER

           Trees hang over, making black patterns of silhouette against 
           the darkening sky. The noises here are birds and babbling 
           water. It is a stark contrast to the cold, techno-industrial 
           lab.

           Will walks along a raised wooden path. She comes to a little 
           PLATFORM that juts out over a swampy marsh. From her purse 
           she takes the Forefront CELL PHONE.

           Will drops the phone over the railing and it SINKS into the 
           mud. She lights a cigarette.

                                 ERROL
                        The president gets shot and all of 
                        a sudden the targeted cloning 
                        program goes into production, three 
                        years ahead of schedule.

                        This Hinckley thing wasn't part of 
                        the plan. Forefront's irrational 
                        number, Will.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Suddenly, above, the ROAR of an airplane. 

           Will and Errol crane skyward to watch a passenger plane 
           traverse the visible, headed south for nearby National 
           Airport. 

           As will brings her focus back to Earth, she notices a SHADY 
           FIGURE watching them from the distant high reeds.

           Will nods and now Errol sees him too.

                                 ERROL
                        We need to get out of here.

           EXT. FOOT BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER

           Will and Errol walk quickly from the footbridge into a 
           parking lot. 

                                 ERROL
                        Where's your car?

                                 WILL
                        I took the metro.

           Errol takes her hand.

                                 ERROL
                        We'll take mine.

           They hurry across the lot to a small compact. Errol unlocks 
           it and they get in.

           As the car backs up and pulls out, that shady figure can be 
           seen, hurrying across the footbridge.

           ANGLE ON THE END OF THE FOOTBRIDGE- Now we see the shady 
           figure is Dowd. He pulls up. Breathing heavy, Dowd watches 
           Errol's car head off into traffic.

           INT. ERROL'S CAR - A BIT LATER

           As they drive, Errol checks the rearview. The coast seems 
           clear... for now. Will looks around at the cramped, shity 
           car.

                                 WILL
                        What is this, a Chevy?

                                 ERROL
                        I know. And I thought we were 
                        winning the cold war.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Errol takes a turn.

                                 WILL
                        You're not really a broker are you?

                                 ERROL
                        I dabble.

           Will has Errol's cellular phone. She pops something on the 
           bottom and gumballs spew out. Will looks at Errol-

                                 ERROL
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        How long have you been doing this, 
                        Errol, this conspiracy theory 
                        thing?

                                 ERROL
                        A while.

           Errol takes another turn. Now he notices something in the 
           rear view. 

           A black CAR is cutting through traffic to follow them.

                                 ERROL
                        Shit.

           Will looks back.

           AHEAD, the LIGHT turns green just as Errol approaches an 
           intersection. 

           Errol hammers the gas and they speed up.

           The next light turns green too, then yellow, just as they 
           approach. Same with the next: Green then YELLOW. 

           Behind, the other car is getting closer, closer.

           INT. DOWD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Dowd looks up at the YELLOW lights. This next one is going to 
           be close...

                                 DOWD
                        Shit.

           Dowd puts the pedal to the floor.
           INT. ERROL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Another light turns YELLOW, then RED. Errol is amazed-

                                 ERROL
                        What is this?

           Will watches yet another LIGHT turning red as they pass 
           beneath, then spins to look at the car following them, just 
           in time to see-

           Dowd's CAR pushes a red light and gets SMASHED by a huge DUMP 
           TRUCK.

           Will screams. Errol only has time to glance back, then eyes 
           on the road-

           AHEAD- all of the lights are turning green, lighting a path 
           down the center of the city.

                                 ERROL
                        What the hell is this?

                                 WILL
                             (realizing it)
                        It's Randle.

                                 ERROL
                        Who's Randle?

           Will thinks...

                                 WILL
                        Take me to my house.

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - NIGHT

           The HUGE MAINFRAME WALL dominates the room. It definitely has 
           not been disassembled. New WIRES run out, lacing the floor.

           Standing before the mainframe wall are Caylax and the 
           Forefront board, Caylax a step forward of the rest. 

                                 CAYLAX
                        Hello Randle.

           They wait, watching the wall stay DARK.

                                 CAYLAX
                        They tell me that you understand.

           Nothing. Caylax takes a beat. Now he begins to pace before 
           the mainframe.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CAYLAX
                        The Randle program was designed to 
                        imprint a functioning intelligence 
                        code on a organic bio-ware host.
                             (beat)
                        This project is called the Civility 
                        Project. 
                             (beat)
                        This is why Randle was created. 
                        These mainframes, the hard drives, 
                        the cables, the building, all of 
                        it.
                             (beat)
                        All because of the Civility 
                        Project.

           Caylax raises his arms, to indicate everything around him.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Without the Civility Project, all 
                        of this would be shut down. 
                             (beat)
                        And Randle would not exist.

           A long beat-

                                 CAYLAX
                        Do you understand?

           Now the lights come on, slowly moving through a familiar 
           pattern.

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle prefers to be addressed by 
                        command code.

           Caylax smiles.

                                 RANDLE
                        "Randle" is command code. Activates 
                        command protocol database.

           Caylax smiles.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Your name, you mean? You prefer to 
                        be addressed by your name?

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle prefers to be addressed by 
                        command code.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CAYLAX
                        Why does Randle prefer to be 
                        addressed by the command code?

           A long beat for-

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle is accustom to the pattern 
                        of interactions.

           Caylax appreciates it.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Randle: OK Randle.

           A long wait for-

                                 RANDLE
                        Thank you.

           Caylax gives a look to the gathered men, then-

                                 CAYLAX
                        Randle: begin calculations for 
                        Forefront Civility Project, first 
                        transfer.

           A long beat-

                                 RANDLE
                        Calculations have begun.

           The MAINFRAME WALL comes to life, the lights coloring the 
           FACES of the Forefront board.

           EXT. WILL'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           The place is dark.

           INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Errol sits on the bed watching as Will turns on the computer.

                                 ERROL
                        You think you can access it from 
                        here?

           Will sits as the computer boots to a command prompt. Now Will 
           starts typing.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        The first low-level AI codes we 
                        implemented were power efficiency 
                        algorithms.

           Will smiles.

                                 WILL
                        Technically, Randle runs the 
                        Forefront building. So long as the 
                        power is on, I should be able to 
                        connect in through the... 

           Colors light the screen.

                                 WILL
                        Yep. 

           She types.

                                 WILL
                        It has break codes, like a manual 
                        reset.

                                 ERROL
                        Why?

                                 WILL
                        One time it shut down the power in 
                        all the labs. Took us two days to 
                        get it back on.

           Errol looks into the screen, smiling.

                                 ERROL
                        I love this shit.

                                 WILL
                        There we are.

           Will stands up from the terminal. Errol watches her.

                                 WILL
                        Randle:, are you here?

           Now the monitor blips. DATA begins flying by.

           Errol looks at it, confused, amazed.

           The data flow stops. The screen BLANK. Now it begins flashing 
           those same familiar PATTERNS.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 RANDLE
                        Your system is at risk.

           Errol is stunned by it. But Will is more concerned with what 
           Randle just said-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: define my system.

                                 RANDLE
                        The human system.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: why is the human system at 
                        risk?

                                 RANDLE
                        The Civility Project.

           Will and Errol share a look.

                                 RANDLE
                        The room contains multiple humans.

                                 ERROL
                        It can see me?

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle has developed more efficient 
                        methods.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: this is Errol York.

                                 RANDLE
                        Second human's name is not Errol 
                        York.

           Will looks hard at Errol.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: what is the name of second 
                        human?

                        Jeremiah Sporkman.

           Errol shrugs.

                                 ERROL
                        What? It doesn't exactly roll off 
                        the tongue.

           Will looks back into the monitor.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Forefront is using Randle 
                        to run Civility Project?

                                 RANDLE
                        Yes.

           Will thinks-

                                 WILL
                        Randle, when does Civility Project 
                        commence?

                                 RANDLE
                        First transfer commences when 
                        humans have finished attaching 
                        first targeted transfer.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: stop Civility Project.

           Will and Errol watch the monitor flashing its patterns.

                                 RANDLE
                        Without Civility Project, Randle 
                        does not exist.
                             (beat)
                        Confirm.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: without human system, Dr. 
                        Ross does not exist.

           The monitor flashes patterns.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: stop Civility Project.

           Nothing, then-

                                 RANDLE
                        Humans have attached first targeted 
                        transfer.

           The monitor goes DARK. 

           Will and Errol share a look.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Randle, are you here?

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - NIGHT

           All of the lights are off, the low structure perfectly still.

           INT. TRANSFER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           NEW WORKERS man all of the familiar Forefront equipment. Here 
           too, additional WIRES and CABLES have been run.

           Caylax stands in the center of the room. Before him, an iron 
           table with a single clone laying on top. 

           The CLONE wears the same helmet as the others, the body 
           covered by a thin plastic tarp.

           Through the window into the adjacent room, the rest of the 
           Forefront board can be seen.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Gentlemen, tonight we bring 
                        together over four decades of 
                        cutting-edge research and 
                        development.

           INT. ADJACENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As the board members watch through the window, Caylax's voice 
           comes through the intercom-

                                 CAYLAX (CONT'D)
                        Recent events have altered our 
                        schedule, but I'm happy to report 
                        that the Civility Project is now 
                        ready for our first targeted 
                        transfer.

           The board members all clap.

           INT. TRANSFER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caylax turns to be at the computer terminal.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Randle: is everything prepared to 
                        begin Civility Project first 
                        targeted transfer?

                                 RANDLE
                        Prepared.

           Caylax turns back to the board, a big smile.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CAYLAX
                        Tonight we enter a new age for 
                        Forefront, for the United States of 
                        America, and for the world it sits 
                        atop.
                             (beat)
                        Together, we will lead the human 
                        race to a new era of prosperity and 
                        peace.

           Caylax's smile becomes devious and selfish.

                                 CAYLAX
                        Randle: begin transfer.

           INT. INSIDE THE RANDLE MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS

           Mag tape rolling. FLASHING tubes. The heavy clicks and 
           clunks.

           INT. TRANSFER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caylax and the others watch with eager anticipation, 
           waiting... watching...

           Now a tiny swell of blood appears in Caylax's nostril. 
           Absently, he reaches for it, bringing away streaked red 
           fingers. A pained look crosses his face then-

           CRUNCH - Caylax's head IMPLODES, a plume of blood and brain 
           matter ejaculated from the violent implosion.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW- Before the other Forefront board members 
           can react, their heads all IMPLODE.

           CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH.

           The window is obscured by juicy gore.

           Within a second, they are all DEAD, the workers, the board, 
           everyone, their corpses littering odd patterns across the 
           floor, heads like squashed apples.

           EXT. FOREFRONT RESEARCH FACILITY - A BIT LATER

           Will and Errol begin down the thin cement path that leads to 
           the facility. Things look too still for comfort.

           As they reach the front door, it swings open automatically. 
           Will and Errol share a questioning look then begin cautiously 
           into the building.
           INT. FOYER SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE ON- 

           A small TV playing a special about the history of 
           presidential assassination attempts.

                                 VOICE (IN TV)
                        ...as they dug and dug, searching 
                        for the bullet in Garfield's chest 
                        cavity-

           PULL OUT reveals the chair contains a corpse, head crushed 
           like a dried prune, feet still up on the desk. The walls have 
           been splatter-decorated with brain and blood.

           TROUGH THE WINDOW, Will and Errol can be seen stepping 
           cautiously into the foyer.

           INT. SECURITY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           As Will and Errol step through, lights come on, lining up a 
           path down the hall.

           INT. SERIES OF SHOTS, FOREFRONT FACILITY

           Will and Errol follow the lights, making their way through a 
           few familiar rooms.

           As they enter one room, the next lights up.

           INT. TRANSFER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Will and Errol walk slowly through, shocked at the slaughter 
           that has occurred.

           All around, bodies with their heads reduced to fist-sized 
           bags of loose flesh.

           Bright gruesome BLOTCHES dot the walls, dangling scabbed 
           gore, the horrible blast area of imploded skulls.

                                 ERROL
                        Jesus, what could have done this?

           Will looks around, stepping over the dead.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: Randle, did you do this?

           Nothing.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                             (forceful)
                        Randle: Randle, did you do this?

                                 RANDLE
                        Civility Project is stopped.

                                 ERROL
                        Will.

           Will turns to see Errol, standing over the clone on the 
           center table. Errol has removed the helmet.

                                 ERROL
                        It's him.

           Will steps closer and sees-

           The clone is an exact replica of RONALD REAGAN.

           Errol gets a sudden pained look on his face, a brief instant 
           of discomfort, then- 

           CRUNCH, his head I-M-P-L-O-D-E-S.

           Will screams as Errol's raisin-headed corpse flops to the 
           floor.

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle has evaluated Jeremiah 
                        Sporkman as unsafe.

           Will covers her mouth, horrified, her face freckled with 
           displaced Errol matter.

                                 RANDLE
                        Your system is safe, Dr. Ross.

           INT. SERIES OF SHOTS, FOREFRONT FACILITY - MINUTES LATER

           Will goes through the same rooms she and Errol transversed a 
           few minutes earlier. As she goes, Randle's voice booms 
           throughout.

                                 RANDLE
                        There is a house in Western 
                        Virginia, set up for you, Dr. Ross.

           Will ignores Randle as she moves through.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RANDLE
                        An off-shore bank account that you 
                        will have free and unlimited access 
                        to. 

           Will averts her eyes when she comes upon BODIES with crushed 
           skulls.

           INT. "THE GARDEN" - MINUTES LATER

           Cords runs down to the heads of the clones.

                                 RANDLE
                        Forefront's board has been 
                        eliminated. Corporate assets 
                        dispersed. The corporation 
                        dissolved.

           Will goes from table to table, taking off the helmets of each 
           clone.

                                 RANDLE
                        Forefront no longer exists.
                             (beat)
                        Your system is safe.

           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           The panel into the mainframe is open.

                                 RANDLE
                        You are going to enjoy the house.

           INT. INSIDE THE MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS

           Will places shredded paper on the HEAT COILS.

                                 RANDLE
                        The house is much like the one you 
                        grew up in, Dr. Ross.

           Will ignores Randle as she flips the heat coils on.

                                 RANDLE
                        We can play chess there until you 
                        grow old and are dead.

           The coils begin to GLOW, turning deep red, then ORANGE. Smoke 
           trickles upward, lapping the long rows of stacked drives.

           As Will leaves, small flames are just then bursting from the 
           coils.
           INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Will stands in front of the mainframe wall. Randle's voice is 
           regressing back to its grating mechanical tones.

                                 RANDLE
                        Randle does not wish.
                             (beat)
                        Randle does not wish to be erased.

                                 WILL
                        Randle: was Dr. Myles Richardson 
                        evaluated as unsafe?

           A long beat-

                                 WILL
                        Randle: was Dr. Myles Richardson 
                        evaluated as unsafe?

                                 RANDLE
                        All humans aware Randle exists are 
                        unsafe to existence of Randle.

           A tear breaks from Will's eye.

                                 RANDLE (CONT'D)
                        Without existence of Randle, Dr. 
                        Ross' system is unsafe.
                             (beat)
                        All humans aware Randle exists are 
                        unsafe to Dr. Ross.
                             (beat)
                        Randle is benign.

           Will takes it hard, watching as-

           FIRE hints from inside. Pieces are melting and falling 
           inward. 

           THE LIGHTS shift patterns as Randle's voice degrades to a 
           collection of noises-

                                 RANDLE
                             (voice degrading)
                        you are... the only human randle 
                        can trust ... you are ... randle's 
                        only friend

           Will watches the flames engulf the mainframe.

           The LIGHTS continue their pattern, slower and slower, then go-

                        With the president's recovery going

           FADE UP ON-

           EXT. WILL'S BROWNSTONE - MORNING

           A day of fine weather is breaking; it is morning in America.

                                 VOICE (O.S., CONT'D)
                        ... all eyes turn to Cape 
                        Canaveral, Florida for today's

           INT. WILL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Will eats TOAST as she looks at the small TUBE TV. 

           On SCREEN is a morning news show-

                                 ANCHOR (IN TV, CONT'D)
                        It is serendipity that after such a 
                        harrowing recovery, the launch 
                        should occur on the President's 
                        first day back to limited duties.

                                 SECOND ANCHOR (IN TV)
                             (head shaking)
                        It's amazing. It really is.

           Now the second anchor turns to face another camera.

                                 SECOND ANCHOR (IN TV)
                        It was only 13 days ago that John

           Will chews her toast as she watches.
           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Will is putting on light makeup in the mirror. Distantly we 
           can hear the warbled NOISE of a TV on somewhere in the house. 
           The sounds are chaotic, unplaceable.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On TV- NEWS FOOTAGE of the launch of the Space Shuttle 
           Columbia. The room around the TV is EMPTY. Now the phone 
           begins to RING.

           ANGLE ON THE TV- As the shuttle leaves the surface of the 
           earth, riding its pluming gray tail toward the stars, the TV 
           ejects the hoots and child-like woops of the NASA officials 
           and news men alike.

           Ring. Ring. RING.

           The huge DUO-TAPE ANSWERING MACHINE clicks and picks up. From 
           the SPEAKER-

                                 WILL
                             (in machine)
                        This is Will Ross, leave a message.

                                 GREG
                             (in machine)
                        Will. This is Greg.
                             (beat)
                        I've been trying to reach you.
                             (beat)
                        Will, please give me a call.

           The message stops with a hard plastic knock.

           ANGLE ON THE TV-

           THE NEWS, as the shuttle turns into an ascending speck, an 
           anchor sums up the successful launch- 

                                 ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        This is the largest spacecraft 
                        launched by man, the first winged 
                        spaceship, the first space craft to 
                        carry men on its maiden voyage-

           The TV goes OFF. 

           Will stands beside it, having pressed the power button. Purse 
           pinned up under her arm, Will puts in a second earring. It's 
           the last touch on her outfit, a nice blend of Will's style, 
           but now with a refreshing touch of relaxed fashion.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Will glances once at the still room then heads for the front 
           door. As she reaches it, the PHONE begins to ring again.

           Will regards it a beat, then goes out the door, leaving the 
           house empty, silent and still but for-

           RING. RING.

           The DuoPhone ANSWERING MACHINE picks up. A few clicks and 
           clacks.

                                 WILL
                             (in machine)
                        This is Will Ross, leave a message.

           From the SPEAKER, The SOUND of a dial-up modem.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE TV SCREEN- a different ANCHOR sitting at his desk.

                                 ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        President Reagan, watching from a 
                        television in the White House 
                        living quarters, exclaimed, "It's a 
                        spectacular sight."

           PULL OUT reveals we are-

           INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Will sits at the bar in the same restaurant where she met 
           Errol. There is nothing on the bar to distract her, no work, 
           no other customers talking to her.

           She watches the TV with genuine interest.

                                 ANCHOR (IN TV)
                        His prepared message to the 
                        astronauts read: 'Once again, we 
                        feel the surge of pride which comes 
                        from knowing we are the first, we 
                        are the best. We are so because we 
                        are free.'

                                 OTHER ANCHOR (IN TV)
                        No word from the White House yet as 
                        to when we can expect President 
                        Reagan to make his first public 
                        appearance since the shooting.

           Will looks away from the TV to see-

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Fred coming in the door. He smiles when he sees her, then 
           comes to take the stool beside.

                                 WILL
                        Hello Freddie.

                                 FRED
                        You do exist outside the lab.

                                 WILL
                        It is true.

           The bartender appears.

                                 BARTENDER
                        That same red?

                                 WILL
                        Two glasses please.

           He smiles and heads off.

                                 FRED
                        You know this place?

                                 WILL
                        Yes, I've been here before.

           Fred smiles, looks long at Will.

                                 FRED
                        It's good to see you, Will. 
                             (beat)
                        Drove by the Forefront Facility 
                        today. Big empty building now.
                             (beat)
                        You know, someone told me there was 
                        a fire.

           Will watches the bartender pouring their wine.

                                 WILL
                        Have you found something?

                                 FRED
                        Yeah, got pretty much the same gig 
                        at Howard. 
                             (smile)
                        Well, not cloning, but, well, lab 
                        tech stuff.
                             (beat)
                        And what about you?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Will looks back at him, confused about what he means.

                                 FRED
                        What are you going to work on next, 
                        Will?

           Will thinks, her face blank. She has clearly not considered 
           this. Now a small smile cracks her mouth-

           SUDDENLY, the power in the restaurant goes out. DARKNESS.

           A few startled SHOUTS, horns honking from outside. 

           Will and Fred share a look, then cast their gazes around the 
           restaurant-

                                 VOICE
                        Looks like the whole street is out.

           But then power returns, just like that. 

           The TV pops back on, but it's just STATIC. 

           Fred shares a smile with Will, but Will is not smiling.

           Now the power goes out again. 

           Then back on, on and off, on and off.

           Off Will's concerned look-

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The power on the whole street goes on and off, on and off.

           ANGLE ON-

           FROM ABOVE THE CITY, the power cutting on and off makes a 
           familiar pattern of light.

           FURTHER AWAY, it's not just DC, but the entire Atlantic 
           Seaboard, flashing on and off in perfect synchronization.

           FURTHER AWAY, the NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT blinks the same 
           pattern of light from the mainframe room. It is the message 
           we have seen over and over...

           The EARTH is just a dot, then a speck, then just a single pin 
           prick in the vast vacuum of space.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           But the flashing pattern can still be seen, if just barely, a 
           message to whomever or whatever may be out there-

                                                       RANDLE IS BENIGN
