                                AUTHOR'S NOTE:

           French idioms, curse words, drug references, and slanderous 
           remarks about notable people are all drawn from Tchaikovsky’s 
           letters.

           Tchaikovsky's love affairs and the mystery surrounding his 
           tragic death are factual.  All characters are real.

           Wherever possible, dialog is drawn from Tchaikovsky’s own 
           words.  This is - as far as history may divine - a true 
           story.
           “Talent is that which a man possesses.  Genius is that which 
           possesses a man.”

                                  - Isaac Stern

           “Love, love, love – that is the soul of genius!”

                        It begins pianissimo.

           THE SYMPHONY PATHÉTIQUE – Tchaikovsky’s masterpiece - opens 
           the first haunting bassoon notes of the Adagio...

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. TCHAIKOVSKY HOUSE – BEDROOM DAY         VOTKINSK, 1854

           Young PYOTR ILLYICH TCHAIKOVSKY (13) huddles in bed with his 
           dying MOTHER.

           Her frail body WRACKED WITH FEVER CHILLS.  Pyotr tightens the 
           blankets around her with the frail grip of his hug.

           Her body convulses, SHAKING THE ENTIRE BED.  And then she 
           lies still.

           Pyotr’s boyish face is frozen in a rictus of fear and grief.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (V.O.)

                        Listen...

           FADE OUT.

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT – DAY
                                                         WINTER, 1893

           Pyotr’s aged face, now rigid in death.

           A transparent shroud covers Tchaikovsky’s corpse up to the 
           neck.  DR. LEV BERTENSON disinfects the body, dabbing the 
           lips and nostrils with carbolic solution.

           MOURNERS file through the apartment, paying respects.

           EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK, the legendary conductor, cuts a striking 
           figure in a black over-frock cloak.  He speaks fervently to 
           the young virtuoso, SERGEI RACHMANINOFF.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        How can this be?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Arsenic.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Rimski-Korsakov said cholera.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Rubbish.  You’ll excuse me, sir.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Why do you say arsenic?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        The city edict - it’s illegal to 
                        let a body with cholera lie in 
                        state.  Yet look how his nephew 
                        Vladimir kisses his face.

           Tchaikovsky’s young nephew, VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (22), kneels 
           beside the body.  Vladimir tenderly kisses Tchaikovsky, 
           lingering over his face.

           Eduard Nápravník watches, shuddering.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Appalling.

           Tchaikovsky’s younger brother, MODÉST, pats Vladimir 
           Davydov’s arm, pulling the young man from the room.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        This was not cholera.  This was 
                        murder.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                             (whispered)
                        Lower your voice.

           Composer NICOLAI RIMSKY-KORSAKOV and critic VLADIMIR STASOV 
           shuffle past, nodding their heads respectfully.  They cross 
           themselves and join composers CÉSAR CUI and ALEXANDER 
           SCRIABIN by the locked grand piano.

           Eduard Nápravník continues in hushed tones.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Arsenic?
                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Doctor Bertenson admits the 
                        symptoms are indistinguishable from 
                        cholera.

           Sergei Rachmaninoff stands six-and-a-half feet tall.  At age 
           twenty, he is already revered as one of the best pianists in 
           the world.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        Nobody gets cholera and dies in two 
                        days.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        But a murder?  Why would anyone do 
                        such a thing?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                             (fierce whisper)
                        You know damned well why!  Every 
                        person in this room is relieved 
                        Tchaikovsky is dead.  We have 
                        avoided a scandal.

           Eduard Nápravník looks weak enough to faint.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        My God.  What have we done?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        We.

           Rachmaninoff spits.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        Tchaikovsky is dead.  Russia has 
                        lost its greatest voice.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (V.O.)
                             (Softly)
                        Listen...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALL OF NOBLES – ST. PETERSBURG

           Eduard Nápravník rehearses the ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC 
           ORCHESTRA before an empty audience.  He lowers his baton and 
           the MELANCHOLY OPENING OF TCHAIKOVSKY’S SYMPHONY PATHÉTIQUE 
           CEASES.

           Musicians rest their instruments on their knees.
           Lithe and dashing, Nápravník sports a trim mestophalian beard 
           and wild tangles of hair.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Bassoons, play me the first two 
                        measures.

           Alone, the BASSOONS purl the OPENING LAMENT.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        What do you hear?

           The musicians eye Nápravník.  Some with reverence, some with 
           fear for the famous conductor.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Listen closer...

           With a flick of the baton, the bassoons again SIGH THE 
           OPENING MELODY.  This time even softer.

           And again, Nápravník eyes the orchestra expectantly.

           Nervous musicians stare back in dumb silence.  Nápravník 
           sighs and strokes his chin.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Tchaikovsky finished the Pathétique 
                        days before his death.  We are to 
                        premiere it as his memorial.

           Nápravník is a foreigner from Bohemia.  He has worked for 
           years to mask his clipped Czech accent.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        To honor Tchaikovsky’s work, we 
                        must plumb every measure for 
                        meaning until we unravel its 
                        deepest mysteries.  Now tell me: 
                        what do you hear in the opening 
                        melody?

           The FIRST VIOLINIST timidly raises his bow hand.

                                 FIRST VIOLINIST
                        The “cross-motif.”

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Bravo.  The E to the G, the F-sharp 
                        to the A.  Bach’s crucifix.

           Nápravník’s finger connects the four opening notes on the 
           score, TRACING A CRUCIFIX...
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Tchaikovsky used the cross-motif in 
                        Romeo and Juliet.  It signifies 
                        star-crossed lovers.  This symphony 
                        is about a tragic love.

           Nápravník sets down his baton.  From the height of his 
           rostrum, he can speak softly and still be heard by all 80 
           musicians.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Tchaikovsky’s greatest masterpieces 
                        tell of star-crossed lovers kept 
                        apart by the rules of society.  In 
                        Swan Lake, a swan cannot fall in 
                        love with a hunter.  In Eugene 
                        Onegin, Onegin cannot love a 
                        married woman.  In Romeo and 
                        Juliet, a Capula can not fall in 
                        love with a Montague.  And in 
                        Tchaikovsky’s life, a man can not 
                        fall in love with a...

           Nápravník falls silent.  His eyes flit to Tchaikovsky’s 
           dedication on the cover of the score.  In Tchaikovsky’s own 
           hand:

                                 “FOR VLADIMIR DAVYDOV.”

           The FLAUTISTS below his dais shift uncomfortably in their 
           wooden seats.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Play it once more.  And this time, 
                        with your whole hearts, listen...

           Nápravník lifts his hands in the air.  The musicians raise 
           their instruments.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        We start...  From the beginning.

           The bassoons take their prep breath.

           Napravnik uses no baton, but simply gestures with his 
           fingertips, beckoning music to spring forth into this world.  

           THE BASSOONS WHISPER THE ADAGIO.  The violas swell in 
           lamentation, fading away in a plaintive cry.
           AND THE SYMPHONY BEGINS...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TCHAIKOVSKY’S FUNERAL - KAZAN CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Hundreds of roman columns, sprawling and immense, line the 
           Basilica.  TOLLING CATHEDRAL BELLS call St. Petersburg to 
           mourn.

           8,000 RUSSIANS crowd into the 6,000 capacity church.  TEN 
           TIMES THAT NUMBER clog the grey and rainy streets outside.  A 
           veritable sea of double-breasted wool blazers, wide cravats, 
           and stove pipe top hats.

                                                       MUSIC CONTINUES:

           INT. KAZAN CATHEDRAL - SAME

           A BISHOP IN BLACK CASSOCKS with a silver klobuk chained 
           around his neck, raises his ornate crosier to lead the 
           benediction.

           TSAR ALEXANDER III himself stands with his ROYAL FAMILY in 
           the front pew of the nave.  PYOTR ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY LIES IN 
           STATE, his open casket before the alter.

           In a side pew, Eduard Nápravník carries on a whispered 
           conversation with Rachmaninoff.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        No tears?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I have not cried since I was 
                        fourteen.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Is it true there will be a fourth 
                        movement to the Symphony 
                        Pathétique?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The saddest adagio.  As if Pyotr 
                        was knowingly writing his own 
                        requiem.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                             (pointedly)
                        And how could Pyotr have known he 
                        was dying?
           Eduard Nápravník shakes his head.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are quite attached to this idea 
                        of murder.  You’ve fallen in love 
                        with it and wish to marry it and 
                        raise a family together in the 
                        countryside.

           Rachmaninoff gestures to a GROUP OF DISTINGUISHED MEN in a 
           front pew.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Look at the Belyayev Circle.  
                        Stasov, Glazunov, Rimsky-Korsakov.  
                        Those are not the faces of 
                        mourners.

           The “Belyayev Circle” rise to greet the composer CÉSAR CUI, 
           smiling and shaking hands as they admit him into their pew.  
           A fraternity of eminent Russian composers and critics.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        They are not burying a man, they 
                        are burying a scandal.

           Rachmaninoff now gestures to a distant pew where Vladimir 
           Davydov sits alone.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        And what of Tchaikovsky’s nephew...  
                        Is that the face of a man with 
                        clear conscience?

           Eduard carefully glances in Davydov’s direction.  The young 
           man’s face streaked with tears.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        They say he is a courtesan and a 
                        morphine addict.  If there is a 
                        dark underbelly to our great 
                        composer, Davydov is its 
                        bellybutton.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Sergei, what is all this besides 
                        gossip?

           Rachmaninoff slips a scrap of paper into Eduard’s palm.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Are we now passing notes like 
                        school children?
                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        This is the address for 
                        Tchaikovsky’s physician, Lev 
                        Bertenson.  See if he can look you 
                        in the eye and tell you it is not 
                        arsenic poisoning.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Why should I confront the man?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Because I am just a student, and 
                        you are the famous Nápravník!

           Eduard shakes his head.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        Listen.  They call you the “great 
                        detective” because you research a 
                        score for months before you conduct 
                        it.  Now what is more important: 
                        solving a music score or a man’s 
                        murder?

           Eduard hands Rachmaninoff back the doctor’s address.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I cannot believe Tchaikovsky was 
                        murdered.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Good.

           Rachmaninoff stuffs the scrap of paper into Eduard’s waist 
           coat.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        Prove me wrong.

           Eduard focusses on the somber mass, the choir in their black 
           vestments suddenly OVERPOWERING WITH THEIR MOURNFUL KEEN.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. HALL OF NOBLES - DAY

           The Russian Orthodox mass blends into the TROMBONE CHORAL OF 
           TCHAIKOVSKY’S 6TH SYMPHONY.  Eduard again silences the 
           philharmonic orchestra with a FLICK OF HIS HANDS.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Does anyone recognize this melody?
           Several hands go up.  Nápravník nods to a red-headed TROMBONE 
           PLAYER.

                                 TROMBONE PLAYER
                        The Russian Orthodox Mass for the 
                        Dead.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        And what are the words sung to this 
                        melody?

                                 TROMBONE PLAYER
                        “And may his soul rest with the 
                        souls of all the saints.”

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Excellent.

                                 TROMBONE PLAYER
                        Maestro, is Tchaikovsky’s symphony 
                        a requiem?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I do not yet know.  Mozart said 
                        that music is not in the notes, but 
                        in the silence between...

           Eduard Nápravník shuts his eyes.  And in that silence, the 
           orchestra truly begins to listen.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        ...I believe Tchaikovsky reveals 
                        his secrets through his music.  And 
                        if we listen, truly listen, we will 
                        hear his very soul.

           Eduard lifts his baton.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        We continue.

           The trombones breath the doleful Mass for the Dead.  Each 
           plangent note as plaintive as a stifled sob.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TCHAIKOVSKY’S FUNERAL - KAZAN CATHEDRAL - DAY

           Vladimir Stasov, in a fur-lined cloak, gathers with the 
           members of his Belyayev Circle shaking hands with NOBLEMEN as 
           they exit the cathedral.
           Stasov spots Eduard and Rachmaninoff.  His unctuous smile 
           instantly melds into a mask of concerned gravitas.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Monsieur Nápravník, my most sincere 
                        condolences.  Such a tragic loss 
                        for Russian music.

           Stasov’s circle closes around Eduard.  Stasov lowers his 
           voice.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV (CONT’D)
                        We have decided.  You shall 
                        premiere Tchaikovsky's final 
                        symphony in two days time.

           Eduard blanches.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        That is quite impossible, monsieur.  
                        I spend months researching a score!  
                        Why, to do Tchaikovsky any possible 
                        justice -

           Stasov takes Eduard by the shoulder.  His icy hand marbled 
           with veins.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        The time is now, Monsieur 
                        Nápravník.  The city thirsts for 
                        this premiere, awaiting the tap of 
                        your baton.  I am confident you 
                        will find it quite within your 
                        powers.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        But why so soon?

           Stasov gestures to the swarming crowd of mourners exiting the 
           cathedral.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        "There is a tide in the affairs of 
                        men, which, taken at the flood..."

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        But two days, Monsieur Stasov?

           Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov furrows his brows, his small mouth 
           nearly undetectable in his tangle of beard.
                                 NIKOLAI RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        All Russia tolls its bells for 
                        Tchaikovsky.  This is the precise 
                        moment to promote national culture.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Is it not best we remember Pyotr 
                        through his music?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Two days...

           Stasov spots Tchaikovsky’s brother Modést hurrying from the 
           cathedral.  Stasov thrusts out his hand.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Such a tragic loss for Russian 
                        music.

           Modést stares at the critic’s outstretched hand and does not 
           shake it.

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY
                        You spent your entire career 
                        attacking my brother’s music.  Now 
                        he is dead and you feign 
                        bereavement.

           Stasov is shocked.  Modést addresses Stasov’s clique.

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        You are all hypocrites.  His blood 
                        be on your hands.

           Modést turns, leaving a row of shocked faces in his wake.  
           Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov clasps his hands together 
           beseechingly.

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        Modést is beside himself with 
                        grief.  We must excuse him.

           Vladimir Stasov’s pointed grey beard reaches all the way to 
           his belt.  His cold eyes gleam behind webbed lids.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Neither Modést nor his more 
                        talented brother would ever join 
                        our circle.

           Rachmaninoff smiles placidly.
                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        And can you blame them?  After all 
                        your scheming?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        If you mean I’ve used the circle to 
                        influence my fellow critics or sway 
                        public opinion...  Well, my young 
                        impresario, you flatter me to think 
                        me so powerful.

           Eduard Nápravník diffuses Stasov with a conciliating smile.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Please forgive young Rachmaninoff.  
                        His hands can reach an octave-and-a-
                        half.  But his mouth can fit an 
                        entire piano.

           Stasov’s expression is dark.  He surveys Rachmaninoff through 
           grey, hooded eyes.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Everything I have done, I have done 
                        for the good of Russia.

           With a sweep of his cloak, Stasov turns his back and greets 
           several aged NOBLEMEN leaving the cathedral.

           Eduard sighs with relief and ushers Rachmaninoff toward the 
           front gates.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        All of the talent God gave you for 
                        music, he took from your talent for 
                        social grace.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Never mind all that.  There goes 
                        our friend Davydov.

           Rachmaninoff points out a young soldier hurrying across the 
           street.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        He is certainly in a rush to leave 
                        his uncle’s funeral...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. NEVSKY PROSPEKT ROAD - RACHMANINOFF

           cuts through the carriage-packed traffic of Nevsky Street 
           with no regard for personal safety.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                             (shouting)
                        Monsieur Davydov!  A moment of your 
                        time!

           Eduard Nápravník jogs after Rachmaninoff.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are determined to embarrass me 
                        today.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        It is the simple pleasures that 
                        make life worthwhile.

           Rachmaninoff and Nápravník catch up to Vladimir Davydov on 
           the small stone bridge over the Fontanka River.  Vladimir 
           turns to face his pursuers.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Monsieur Rachmaninoff.  Maestro 
                        Nápravník.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        My condolences on your loss.

           Vladimir Davydov bows curtly.  He wears the uniform of the 
           Preobrazhensky Regiment - THE TSAR’S GUARD.  Navy blue frock 
           with polished brass buttons, crossed by a white sash.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        I am sorry to delay you.  I believe 
                        you know something of the 
                        circumstances of Tchaikovsky’s 
                        death.

           Vladimir Davydov is ghastly pale, his eyes red-rimmed from 
           sleeplessness and tears.  He looks on the verge of fainting.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I was with him until the bitter 
                        end.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Can you tell us anything out of the 
                        ordinary about his death?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I beg your pardon.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Do you suspect foul play, Monsieur?

           Vladimir takes a step backward.  His eyes darting from 
           Rachmaninoff to Nápravník.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        What are you accusing me of?

           Eduard takes Vladimir gently by the elbow.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        My dear Davydov, we are not 
                        accusing you of anything - 

           Vladimir twists away from Eduard’s grip and rests his hand on 
           the gilded pommel of his saber.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I do not know what you mean nor 
                        what you intend.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                             (astonished)
                        Are you threatening me?

           VLADIMIR DRAWS HIS SWORD AN INCH FROM THE SCABBARD, showing 
           tempered steel.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Are you?

           Vladimir’s piercing gaze searches Nápravník’s face for any 
           sign of aggression.  

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Tchaikovsky is not yet in the 
                        ground.  This is neither the time 
                        nor the place.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Then if you will excuse me...

           VLADIMIR SLAMS HIS SABER HOME INTO ITS SHEATH.  He merges 
           into the bustling traffic of Nevsky Prospekt.

           Eduard watches him leave, amazed.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Well, you were right, 
                        Rachmaninoff...

           Eduard shakes out his jacket and adjusts his sleeves, 
           checking to make sure his cuff links still face outward.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        That was worthwhile.

           Rachmaninoff stares after Vladimir Davydov, bemused.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        I must return to class.  Will you 
                        begin your research now, Maestro?

           Eduard uncrumples Doctor Lev Bertenson’s address from his 
           coat pocket.  His eyes now lit by a fire of curiosity.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I believe I shall, Rachmaninoff.  
                        Time is short and there is a 
                        symphony to conduct.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DR. LEV BERTENSON’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Eduard Nápravník finds the address scrawled on Rachmaninoff’s 
           scrap of paper.  Eduard spots DOCTOR LEV BERTENSON, a short 
           man with oiled hair and a paintbrush mustache, scurrying down 
           his front steps.

           Eduard doffs his top hat and announces himself with a bow.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Dr. Bertenson.  I am Eduard 
                        Nápravník, conductor of the St. 
                        Petersburg Philharmonic.  I wonder 
                        if I might abuse your time for just 
                        a moment.

           Dr. Bertenson switches his black medical bag to his left hand 
           while using his right to unlatch his front gate.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        I am hurrying to a house call.  How 
                        may I help you, sir?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I have the honor of conducting 
                        Tchaikovsky’s last symphony less 
                        than 48 hours from now.  And I 
                        require your assistance for my 
                        research.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        You are not with any of the 
                        newspapers?
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You do not know me by reputation?

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        Of course I do.  But journalists 
                        have circled me like vultures since 
                        this horrible business began.

           Dr. Bertenson locks his front gate behind him.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        It is understandable the 
                        journalists have questions.  Such a 
                        mysterious death...

           Dr. Bertenson bustles down Lomonosova Ploshchad, trying to 
           flag down a passing carriage.  Eduard keeps pace.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        It was cholera.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Mais, bien sûr.  Yet you told my 
                        friend Rachmaninoff that arsenic 
                        poisoning is nearly 
                        indistinguishable from cholera.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        I do not see how this line of 
                        questioning will help you with your 
                        symphony, Monsieur Nápravník.

           Dr. Bertenson waves his arm frantically to flag down a coach, 
           but none will stop.  He tramps onward, Eduard dogging his 
           heels.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Is it possible to test a body for 
                        arsenic?

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        Of course.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        And did you?

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        I was not requested to.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Can it still be done?
                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        Dear God, no.
                             (Crossing himself)
                        Tchaikovsky is in the grave!

           A passing coach spots Dr. Bertenson and SQUEAKS TO A HALT, 
           HORSES BRAYING.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Then why was Tchaikovsky rushed to 
                        burial without this test?

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        The symptoms of cholera are very 
                        similar to arsenic.  But 
                        Tchaikovsky showed none of the 
                        tells of poisoning – no leukonychia 
                        in the fingernails, no hair loss, 
                        no convulsions.

           Dr. Bertenson swings opens the carriage door but Eduard stays 
           him with a hand.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You have not answered my question, 
                        monsieur.  Why was Tchaikovsky 
                        rushed to be buried?

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        The man had cholera for God’s sake 
                        – the body was a health risk!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Yet he was left in an open casket?  
                        During a cholera epidemic?

           Dr. Bertenson has no retort.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        I just watched a thousand healthy 
                        men wait in line to kiss his 
                        choleric hand!

           Dr. Bertenson stares hard at the ground.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        A man of Tchaikovsky’s personage – 
                        and no autopsy!  No examination of 
                        his body?

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        I must go.

           Eduard Nápravník clutches the doctor’s arm.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Tell me.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        Orders were handed down.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        From who!

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        The Imperial Family.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Who, Konstantine?  He is 
                        Tchaikovsky’s most ardent 
                        supporter.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        From the royal house.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The royal house loves Tchaikovsky!

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                             (thundering)
                        It was from the Tsar himself!

           Eduard is stunned silent.  He releases Dr. Bertenson’s arm.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON (CONT’D)
                        The Tsar wants no scandal over 
                        Tchaikovsky’s death.  I am a good 
                        doctor.  Tchaikovsky’s death is 
                        like cholera for my professional 
                        reputation!

           Dr. Bertenson draws up his posture indignantly.

                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON (CONT’D)
                        Now if you will excuse me, I cannot 
                        allow my reputation to erode any 
                        further by your idle speculations.  
                        The man is dead!  We cannot change 
                        that!

           Dr. Bertenson climbs into the waiting stagecoach and SLAMS 
           THE DOOR.  Eduard calls to him through the open window.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Dr. Bertenson!  Do you believe 
                        Tchaikovsky was murdered?

           Dr. Bertenson reads Eduard’s earnest expression and softens.
                                 DOCTOR BERTENSON
                        There is no way to know if it was 
                        arsenic.  But I believe 
                        Tchaikovsky’s death was most 
                        unnatural.

           Dr. Bertenson RAPS ON THE ROOF OF THE CARRIAGE and it RATTLES 
           AWAY WITH A CLATTER OF HOOVES.

           Eduard tightens his cloak to ward off the cold.  His keen 
           eyes alive with thought...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT - DUSK

           MONTAGE

           Eduard crosses the squalid slums of SENNAYA PLOSHCHAD, made 
           famous by Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment.

           His collar turned high, Eduard searches bordellos crowded 
           with GYPSY PICK-POCKETS and KNIFE-SCARRED MORPHINE PEDDLERS.

           Eduard scours alleyways where CHILD BEGGARS shiver in rags.  
           ONE-LEGGED SOLDIERS wretch in the gutters, hanging drunkenly 
           on SYPHILITIC WHORES.

           END MONTAGE AS...

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN - NIGHT

           Eduard plunges through a beaded curtain doorway and into the 
           smoke-filled lounge.  A BLIND GYPSY strums a zither while two 
           MEN IN RUMPLED SUITS dance a tango in a corner.

           The brawny PROPRIETOR, with shaved head and handlebar 
           mustache, muscles in on Eduard.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        If you’re the police, I’ve already 
                        paid this month.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I am looking for a fair-haired 
                        soldier.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        There’s a brothel next door, queer.
           JUNKIES peek their heads from curtained alcoves.  And in the 
           darkness, Eduard spots his quarry...  Vladimir Davydov - 
           flopped on a mattress in a haze of opium.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Out of my way.

           Eduard shoves his way past the Proprietor and grabs young 
           Vladimir by the shirt collar - YANKING HIM TO HIS FEET.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        You have no business in a place 
                        like this.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Get off me.

           Vladimir FLOUNDERS FOR HIS SWORD but finds his scabbard is 
           empty.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        We must talk.  I am getting you out 
                        of here.  And you will tell me how 
                        Tchaikovsky died.

           The Proprietor GRABS NÁPRAVNÍK AND HURLS HIM ACROSS A TABLE, 
           SMASHING HIM INTO A WALL.

           Indignant with rage, Nápravník pulls himself to his feet. He 
           dusts himself off and unruffles his waistcoat.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s name was that for?

           The Proprietor cocks a finger at Vladimir.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        That kid hasn’t paid for his 
                        morphine.  You don’t yank my 
                        customers out of here until they’re 
                        paid up.

           Eduard Nápravník glares at Vladimir.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Well, pay the man!

           Vladimir Davydov shrugs, stifling a grin.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I have not a kopek.
           Scowling, Eduard opens his billfold, crumples up a ruble 
           note, and throws it disdainfully on the sawdust-covered 
           floor.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        We are leaving.

           Eduard grabs Vladimir by the arm and attempts to PULL HIM OUT 
           TO THE STREET.

           VLADIMIR TUGS HIS ARM FREE.  The Proprietor and his customers 
           watch the spectacle.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I am not leaving with you.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You disgrace his memory here!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr came to Sennaya Ploshchad 
                        more than I.  Yet you revere him.

           Eduard is incredulous.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Why would Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 
                        set foot in this festering slum?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                             (Smiling)
                        Male brothels.

           EDUARD BACKHANDS VLADIMIR ACROSS THE FACE.

           Men silently gather in the foyer, watching Eduard Nápravník 
           in silent anger.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        You did not know?  Tchaikovsky had 
                        dozens of men - from Petersburg to 
                        Klin.

           Again, EDUARD SMACKS VLADIMIR, who only laughs drunkenly.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        He attended orgies.  He slept with 
                        his own footman.  Why, the great 
                        composer once took a negro man in 
                        Paris!

           EDUARD SLAPS VLADIMIR A THIRD TIME.  Vladimir makes no move 
           to defend himself.  Behind him, muscular men glower at 
           Nápravník.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        You think you know Tchaikovsky, but 
                        you know nothing.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I know he is a genius!  That is all 
                        I need know!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Really?

           Vladimir stares Eduard down contemptuously.  High on 
           morphine, his balance wavers and his eyes struggle to focus.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        So why come here?  What questions 
                        have you to ask me?  What answers 
                        will you listen to?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I am to conduct Tchaikovsky’s 
                        Symphony Pathétique.

           Vladimir’s eyes flicker to alertness.  He takes a step back 
           before finding his balance.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr’s requiem.

           Eduard slowly nods.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        My work as a conductor is to 
                        research each piece to its very 
                        bones.  If I am to serve 
                        Tchaikovsky, I must know all.  And 
                        if it is his requiem, as you say, 
                        then I must know everything about 
                        the man, and about his death.

           Vladimir looks Eduard in the eyes, taking his measure.  At 
           last he speaks.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pay the Proprietor another five 
                        rubles.  And follow me inside...

           Eduard reluctantly plucks another ruble note from his wallet 
           and follows Vladimir deeper into the den...
           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

           Vladimir sits cross-legged, crumbling BLACK TAR HEROIN onto 
           the ceramic bowl of his water pipe.  He heats the heroin with 
           lit coals, watching the dark clumps liquify.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You have smoked all these hours 
                        since the funeral?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Since he died, really.

           Fringed tapestries mask the mildewed walls.  Canopies drape 
           across bunk beds where broken men recline among satin pillows 
           and dream.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Do you not work?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV 
                        I am rich.

           Eduard gestures to Vladimir’s disheveled uniform.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are a Preobrazhensky Guard.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I am retiring.

           Vladimir clamps the hose grommet in his fist and draws air 
           through the mouth tip.  Languid smoke bubbles through the 
           saddle, filling his lungs.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        If you are so rich, why am I paying 
                        for your morphine?

           Vladimir lets two silver snakes of smoke escape his nostrils.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        My ship has not come in quite yet.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are stoned out of your senses.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Tchaikovsky willed me everything.  
                        His estate.  The royalties and 
                        copyrights for all his musical 
                        works.  I am set for life.
           Eduard’s face contorts in shock.  Vladimir spreads his arms 
           out comfortably on the divan.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        It is my reward.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Reward for what?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        ...For killing him.

           Vladimir offers a sad smile.  Eduard’s mouth opens and closes 
           in piscine amazement.

           Vladimir drags again on his pipe, speaking around an elegant 
           procession of smoke rings.  

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        You must promise me, Monsieur 
                        Nápravník, that you will conduct 
                        the symphony with every fiber of 
                        your being.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I do.

           Vladimir draws again, filling his lungs, waving Eduard to sit 
           amongst the cushions.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Come now.  What do you wish to 
                        know?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        How did Tchaikovsky write the 
                        Pathétique?  And how did you kill 
                        him?

           Eduard Nápravník’s eyes follow the spiraling purple smoke 
           upwards.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I shall tell you.  We start, from 
                        the beginning...

                                                               FADE IN:

           The sounds of a PACKED AUDIENCE MURMURING WITH 
           ANTICIPATION...
           INT. CARNEGIE HALL, NEW YORK – BACKSTAGE
                                                           MAY 5, 1891

           STAGEHANDS batten the fly system to the spreader plates.  
           TUXEDOED MUSICIANS thread their way among the tangles of 
           hoisting cables...and file onto stage to ENTHUSIASTIC 
           APPLAUSE.

           PYOTR ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY stands in the wings.  A sensitive 
           face hiding behind a trim beard.  His haunted eyes a window 
           to his very soul.

           Tchaikovsky is greeted by ANDREW CARNEGIE himself, an arm 
           around his daughter MARGARET.  Carnegie charms with a lilting 
           Scottish brogue and bear paw handshake.

                                 ANDREW CARNEGIE
                        Mr. Tchaikovsky, this is my 
                        daughter, Margaret Carnegie.  She 
                        is most eager to meet you.

                                 MARGARET CARNEGIE
                             (overwhelmed)
                        Is it really you?

           Tchaikovsky is attentive and soft-spoken.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Am I really me?

           The great composer considers the question carefully.

           Behind him, the FIRST VIOLINIST finishes tuning to A440 and 
           marches on stage to A FRESH WAVE OF APPLAUSE.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Are you asking me if I am really 
                        myself?

                                 MARGARET CARNEGIE
                        I suppose I am.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Yes.  I think that I am me.  Unless 
                        I am someone else mistaking me for 
                        myself.  Which would be quite 
                        embarrassing.  For me, if not for 
                        myself.

           Margaret smiles uncertainly.  She holds out Tchaikovsky’s 
           photo, clipped from the New York Herald, which he dutifully 
           autographs.

           From the stage, the First Violinist plays his A string, 
           followed by the OPEN FIFTHS OF THE ORCHESTRA TUNING.
           Andrew Carnegie sets a paw on Tchaikovsky’s shoulder.

                                 ANDREW CARNEGIE
                        My God, you are shaking.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Just a little trembling I get 
                        before performances.

                                 MARGARET
                        Can we get you anything?  A water 
                        perhaps?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Boiled water?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m not sure there’s time.

           INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - SAME

           FORMER PRESIDENT GROVER CLEVELAND addresses the packed 
           concert hall.

                                 GROVER CLEVELAND
                        Ladies and gentleman, here to 
                        conduct the inaugural concert of 
                        New York’s brand new Carnegie 
                        Hall...  Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

           INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE

           Tchaikovsky hears his name announced to WILD APPLAUSE.

                                 ANDREW CARNEGIE
                        Mr. Tchaikovsky, I believe you are 
                        needed on stage.

           Tchaikovsky smooths his brow, taking short, unsteady breaths.  
           His long, delicate fingers adjust his white bow tie and brush 
           out the woolen tails of his tuxedo.

                                 MARGARET
                        Don’t you think you’d better go on 
                        stage, Mr. Tchaikovsky?

           Tchaikovsky takes a deep breath.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Well, I don’t see why not.
           INT. CARNEGIE HALL – CONTINUOUS

           THE AUDIENCE ERUPTS IN THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE as Tchaikovsky 
           crosses the stage and steps lightly onto the conductor’s 
           rostrum.  He performs an elegant bow as he takes up his 
           baton.

           Tchaikovsky turns his tails to the audience and faces the NEW 
           YORK PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA.  Yet still the AUDIENCE CHEERS 
           AND WHISTLES WILDLY.

           Tchaikovsky is obliged to turn and bow once more...

           And then yet again.

           Tchaikovsky turns to the First Violinist and shrugs.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I have not even done anything yet.

           Tchaikovsky clutches the baton in his fist in his usual 
           fashion.  With a quick flick of his wrist, the Orchestra 
           plunges into the opening chords of Tchaikovsky’s famous 
           Festival Coronation March.

           Tchaikovsky’s visage melts from fear to bliss.  The 
           TRIUMPHANT MUSIC CONTINUES AS...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN – DAY

           Tchaikovsky, terrified of crowds, is pressed among the 
           tumult.  He forces his way up Broadway, a wide avenue clogged 
           with horse drawn carriages, railways, and trams.

           Broadway is flanked with two, three, and even four story 
           buildings.

           Tchaikovsky’s hotel soars all the way to nine stories.  He 
           marvels at it, jaw agape, as HANDLERS STEER HIM INSIDE.

           INT. THE GRAND HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           The lobby is packed with AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS CLAMORING FOR 
           TCHAIKOVSKY’S ATTENTION.  The composer is ushered through the 
           swarming crowd and pressed into the lift.
           INT. THE GRAND HOTEL - LIFT – CONTINUOUS

           Tchaikovsky’s face blanches as the DEAFENING LIFT raises his 
           body to the ninth floor, while leaving his stomach on the 
           first.

           A PORTER takes Tchaikovsky’s luggage and leads him to his 
           room.

           INT. THE GRAND HOTEL – SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Tchaikovsky shuts his hotel room door, pressing his forehead 
           to it.  Alone at last.  He claws the cravat from his throat 
           and GASPS FOR AIR.

           Tchaikovsky covers his face in his delicate hands and 
           collapses into violent sobs.  The composer sinks all the way 
           down to the carpeted floor before spotting the polished shoes 
           of the waiting porter.

           The embarrassed porter holds out one gloved hand for a tip.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Forgive me!  I thought I was alone.

                                 PORTER
                        Is everything to your satisfaction, 
                        sir?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Yes, magnificent.  Just...a touch 
                        of homesickness.

           Tchaikovsky wipes his eyes and pulls himself together.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Have you any candles for the room?  
                        I must get actual work done 
                        tonight.

                                 PORTER
                        No candles here, sir.  Gas and 
                        electrical lamps only.

           The Porter SWITCHES ON A LAMP.  Pyotr gapes at the 
           innovation.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Marvelous.  How about water - I 
                        must wash my hands.  And I am 
                        dreadfully thirsty.
           The Porter leads Tchaikovsky to the lavatory to show him the 
           water tap.  Tchaikovsky is even more amazed.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Is it boiled?

                                 PORTER
                        Cold on the left, hot on the right.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Yes, but is it boiled?  For 
                        cleanliness?

                                 PORTER
                             (confused)
                        Water comes out clean, sir.  This 
                        is America.

           Tchaikovsky smiles propitiatingly.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        If you could send up a pot of 
                        boiled water, I should be extremely 
                        grateful.

                                 PORTER
                        As you like it, sir.

           Tchaikovsky gestures to a PILE OF BOXES ON THE ROLL-TOP DESK.  
           They are bursting with thousands of envelopes and cut-out 
           photos of Tchaikovsky.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        And what is all this, I wonder?

                                 PORTER
                        People wanting your autograph, sir.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        But this will take me all night.  I 
                        have pressing work...

                                 PORTER
                        Price of being popular.
                             (Doffing his cap)
                        Just ring the front desk on the 
                        intercom if you need anything.

           The Porter ducks out, shutting the door.  Tchaikovsky stares 
           after him bemused.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        What the devil is an intercom?

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN - DUSK

           Eduard watches Vladimir’s wan face, stippled with the 
           flickering shadows of the brazier’s flame.  Vladimir uses 
           metal tongs to transfer fresh coals to the bowl of his water 
           pipe.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        It was in New York the idea for the 
                        Symphony Pathétique hit him.  To 
                        write something for himself.  
                        Without the murder there can be no 
                        Pathétique and without the 
                        Pathétique there can be no 
                        murder...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAND HOTEL - SUITE – NIGHT

           Pen and ink blotter in hand, Tchaikovsky sips vodka and 
           labors over a score.  15 spent cigarettes clog his ashtray.

           Tchaikovsky clutches his head.  At nightmare pitch, VIOLINS 
           TURN TO DEVILISH SQUEALS, CELLOS GRATE LIKE SANDPAPER – his 
           music turning to satanic madness in his mind.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (O.S.)

                        Arts in France...

           Tchaikovsky TEARS UP HIS SCORE.  In feverish torment, HE 
           HURLS IT INTO THE TRASH CAN AND STOMPS ON IT WITH HIS FOOT.

           The composer hefts up a box of autographs, hauls open a 
           window, and HURTLES THE BOX INTO THE VOID.
           Tchaikovsky watches hundreds of pictures of himself 
           fluttering aimlessly in the wind.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        This is what happens when you 
                        become a national treasure: you do 
                        nothing for yourself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PARIS OPERA BALLET - DAY

           Tchaikovsky stoops over the lid of a grand piano, jotting 
           notes in a score.  Legendary choreographer MARIUS PETIPA 
           performs a tendu in the ballet mirrors.

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        Common time, 120 beats per minute! 
                        Four measures so the Sugar Plum 
                        Fairy can cross to center stage en 
                        pointe without breaking her pretty 
                        neck.  Comprendre?

           Petipa has strong French accent.  What he lacks in height he 
           makes up for in volume.

                                 MARIUS PETIPA (CONT’D)
                        Eight measures of melody and repeat 
                        to the bridge.  Comprendre?  Four 
                        measure bridge and recapitulate.  
                        Four measures of coda and repeat.

           Tchaikovsky’s pen struggles to keep pace with the prancing 
           Frenchman.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Why twelve measures in the middle?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        I have the most marvelous idea for 
                        a battement glissé et degage to an 
                        arabesque en plie – and the whole 
                        thing is done en pointe!  I must 
                        have 12 measures!

           Petipa dances the choreography that plays in his mind.  He 
           spins and faces Tchaikovsky, beaming.

                                 MARIUS PETIPA (CONT’D)
                        I am amazing.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Unbelievable, I agree.  You are 
                        giving me the tempo and measures.  
                        Have you decided my instruments for 
                        me as well?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        The Sugar Plum Fairy is the sound 
                        of tiny droplets of water.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        And what instrument is that?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        Droplets of water – as from a 
                        fountain!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        A harpsichord?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        -No.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Piccolo?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        - God, no!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        A harp?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        La vache!  Absolutely not.  The 
                        Sugar Plum Fairy – she is cascading 
                        drops of water from melting icicles 
                        into a rushing stream.

           Tchaikovsky runs a tired hand through his hair.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        A ballet about an enchanted 
                        Nutcracker?  Are we quite insane?

                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        You may be insane, my friend.  I, 
                        am a genius.

           Petipa winks.  Tchaikovsky notes his score...

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        “Tiny droplets of water.”
                                 MARIUS PETIPA
                        We were brilliant in Sleeping 
                        Beauty.  The audience will love 
                        your score – I know it!  They will 
                        demand your orchestra play on the 
                        stage and the dancers perform in 
                        the pit!  Comprendre?

           Eduard is perched on the edge of an unmade bunk bed.  
           Vladimir reclines on a divan, watching smoke gather and 
           dissipate with the delicate drafts of the den.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        - he was touring, he was taking 
                        orders from Marius Petipa.  When 
                        are you going to tell me of the 
                        symphony I am to conduct?  When are 
                        you going to tell me of

                        Patience is passion tempered, my 
                        dear Nápravník.  I must set the 
                        table before you eat your meal.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        And I must get back to rehearsal.  
                        Nearly 24 hours before I am to 
                        conduct!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Take some of this, first.

           Vladimir casually offers Eduard the opium pipe.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are mad.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You wish to know Tchaikovsky.  To 
                        know his music.

           Eduard throws on his overcoat and top hat, moving for the 
           door.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I trust you will still be here when 
                        I return.

           Vladimir, pale with a sheen of sweat, sucks indolently on the 
           stem of the pipe.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        The second movement of the 
                        Pathétique is joy.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Joy?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Joie de vivre.  Tchaikovsky was 
                        drunk each and every night.  
                        Touring the world, alone, for 
                        years.  And then I met him in 
                        Paris.  And for a brief time in our 
                        lives, we knew true happiness.

           Vladimir extends the opium pipe for Eduard.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        I want you to taste joy.  So you 
                        may conduct with honesty.

           Eduard looks at the palatinate smoke curling from the pipe.  
           Half curious, half incredulous...

           INT. HALL OF NOBLES – NIGHT

           Eduard Nápravník RAPS HIS BATON for silence.  Musicians’ 
           faces flicker in the candlelight of their music stands.

           A FLAUTIST timidly raises his hand.

                                 FLAUTIST
                        Maestro Nápravník, how are we to 
                        play an entire movement in 5/4 
                        time?  It is not possible!

           Several musicians VOICE THEIR AGREEMENT.

                                 FIRST VIOLIN
                        I have never seen 5/4 time before 
                        in my life!  How on earth are we 
                        supposed to count it?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You think you’ve got problems.  How 
                        on earth am I supposed to conduct 
                        it?

           Eduard winks.  The First Violin eyes him suspiciously.  The 
           great conductor seems oddly giddy.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Think of 5/4 as a triplet and a 
                        duplet.

           Eduard counts them in and the strings launch into the 
           CHARMING MELODY OF THE SECOND MOVEMENT.  After eight 
           measures, he silences them with a flat sweep of his hand.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Cellos, why do you think 
                        Tchaikovsky gave you the melody?  
                        Why not those prima dona violins, 
                        who get all the attention?

           A timorous CELLIST raises his bow hand.

                                 CELLIST
                        Tchaikovsky did not want a soprano 
                        voice.  He wanted a tenor.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Precisely!  The cello resembles a 
                        male voice.  Cellos alone from the 
                        top.

           The cellos start the movement over, but Nápravník again 
           silences them after the eighth measure.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Cellos, what do you see in the 
                        eighth measure?

                                 CELLIST
                        An octave glissando to ten staccato 
                        eighth notes.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Yes, but what does it signify?  
                        Does Tchaikovsky just have a 
                        vendetta against cellists?

           The cellists are stumped.  Eduard’s balance is unsteady, but 
           his eyes are brimming with humor.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        The eighth notes are a gale of 
                        laughter.

           To demonstrate, Eduard Nápravník bursts into a FULL BELLY 
           LAUGH.  The cellos watch him, perplexed.

           Eduard laughs again.  This time breaking each concussion of 
           laughter into a distinct eighth note.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha....

           The orchestra is astonished.  Tchaikovsky’s glissando mimics 
           pure laughter.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Cellos from the anacrusis to 
                        measure eight.

           The cellists now try the music Nápravník’s way.  And sure 
           enough, the melody is now a male voice singing and exploding 
           into laughter.

           Eduard beams triumphantly.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        The second movement is joy.  Play 
                        it with laughter in your hearts.

           Eduard launches the orchestra from the top of the movement.  
           THE JOYFUL MUSIC COMMENCES AS:

                                                                CUT TO:

           PARIS - MUSIC MONTAGE
             *Tchaikovsky greets Vladimir Davydov at the Gare du Nord in   
              Paris.  Vladimir leaps off the train, throws down his 
              bags, and EMBRACES TCHAIKOVSKY.

             *They glide through Paris in an open carriage.  The 
              cello laughter in the music timing with VLADIMIR’S
              PEELS OF LAUGHTER.

             *They careen past the bustling street markets along the Rue 
              de Maubeuge.  Clattering through Belle Époque Montmartre, 
              and past the Moulin Rouge.

             *The carriage sails through the artist’s quarter of the 
              18th arrondissement, with its winding alleys and view of 
              the basilica.  Arriving at 14 Rue Richepanse.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL EDEN MONTMARTRE – DAY

           Vladimir and Tchaikovsky unlock their hotel room and squeeze 
           inside with their luggage.  And – to their embarrassment – 
           there are not two beds in the little room...only one.

           The two men pause, uncertain where to plant their bags.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Are you sure you did not arrange 
                        this, Pyotr?  I have heard of your 
                        reputation.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Excuse me?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Do not be so prudish.  We are in 
                        Paris.

           Pyotr swallows the wrong way and has a coughing fit.  He 
           rushes into the lavatory and draws a cup of boiled water from 
           a teapot, drinking it as it steams.

           Pyotr then sets to work scrubbing his hands raw.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        I had an extremely long journey.  
                        So I shall have the bed.  And you 
                        may work at that desk.

           Vladimir flops down on the feather mattress.

           Tchaikovsky emerges from the sale de bains drying his hands 
           on a towel.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        And where shall I sleep?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You must not sleep.  You must write 
                        your ballet, tout de suite.

           Vladimir and Tchaikovsky, like all upper class Russians since 
           Catherine the Great, color their speech with French.

           Tchaikovsky moans, his hand on his brow.  He opens his valise 
           and scatters staff paper out on the bed.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        My powers decline.  I repeat 
                        myself.  If I can only serve du 
                        réchauffé at my musical banquets I 
                        must stop composing.  Lest my 
                        listeners perish from malnutrition.

           Vladimir sorts through Tchaikovsky’s sheet music, examining 
           the frantic scribblings.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        These aren’t “reheated leftovers,” 
                        they are succulent friandises.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        The Nutcracker will be much worse 
                        than The Sleeping Beauty.  How can 
                        I write?  Every week I am sent off 
                        to another country to conduct 
                        another dozen concerts.

           Vladimir stretches out on his back.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Yes, it must be a terrible burden 
                        to be worshipped by millions.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I shall tell you a maddening fact 
                        about commissions – they set the 
                        premiere date before I even write a 
                        note.  As soon as I take their 
                        money I am left no choice but to 
                        write what they tell me!

           Tchaikovsky paces the tiny room in agitation, working himself 
           into a high dudgeon.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        And Marius Petipa with his “tiny 
                        water droplets” - that certified 
                        lunatic!  Lecturing me on the 
                        distinction between marcato and 
                        tenuto, on the placement of each 
                        godforsaken accent!  And the water 
                        droplets – good God – the water 
                        droplets!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You can write anything.  You are 
                        Tchaikovsky.

           Vladimir pats the bed for Pyotr to sit down.  Tchaikovsky 
           sits gingerly at the very edge of the bed.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        What are you laboring over right 
                        now?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I need a melody for the 
                        Nutcracker’s Grande Pas de Deux...

           Tchaikovsky reads from his notes, imitating Marius Petipa’s 
           exuberant accent.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        ...It must be “stately, heavenly, 
                        and transcendent!”

           Vladimir smiles mischievously.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I will wager you cannot write a 
                        “transcendent” melody off a G Major 
                        scale.

           Tchaikovsky laughs.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        All eight notes of a scale?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Yes.  Just a plain, ordinary scale.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Going up or down?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Either.

           Tchaikovsky considers.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        And if I win the bet?

           Vladimir, reclining on one elbow, cocks an eyebrow.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        If it pleases me, I may let you 
                        share my bed.  Lest you hurt your 
                        old back sleeping on that couch.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Is the scale major or minor?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                             (Shrugging)
                        Je m'en fiche.

           Tchaikovsky’s grin widens.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Then I shall do both.  Major and 
                        minor.  An entire Pas de Deux.  All 
                        descending scales.

           Vladimir scoops up a handful of fresh staff paper from the 
           bed and thrusts the pages at Tchaikovsky.

                                 VLADIMIR
                        Talk is cheap.  Show me.

                                                               FADE IN:

           MUSIC MONTAGE - THE GRAND PAS DE DEUX

           Tchaikovsky’s pen traces curving brush strokes on a score.

           HEAVENLY ARPEGGIOS GLISSANDO ACROSS HARP STRINGS.

           And the melody - in all its glorious simplicity - is a 
           descending G Major scale.  Transcendent beauty.

           As evening falls, all Paris glitters outside the hotel window 
           like rubies, sapphires, and diamonds.

           Slanted yellow light catches glowing bits of dust in the air 
           – lighting up like stars.

           Tchaikovsky finishes his score and lies down on the bed with 
           Vladimir.  He timidly stretches out his hand and Vladimir 
           takes it.
           Pyotr settles his head onto Vladimir’s neck.  Vladimir’s arm 
           wrapped around his shoulder.  Pyotr closes his eyes.  The 
           music intoxicating.  Pyotr lifts his lips to be kissed --

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (V.O.)
                        -- Did you come to Paris to seduce 
                        Pyotr? --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN - NIGHT

           Vladimir reclines on his side, snapped from his reverie.  He 
           unscrews the mouth tip from the water pipe and boils more low 
           grade heroin on the lid of a samovar.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr was my uncle.  I’d known him 
                        since I was born.  Are you quite 
                        disgusted?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I find the whole affair an 
                        abomination.  Utter depravity.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Our kind are freaks, helplessly 
                        compelled to a sinful act.  It is a 
                        vice all of us wish to be cured of.

           Vladimir sucks the heroin vapors through the mouth tip.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe in reincarnation, 
                        Eduard?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Certainly not.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I thought as much.

           Vladimir tilts the samovar lid in a circle, “chasing the 
           dragon” as the golden liquid boils off the foil.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        I read that our souls choose who to 
                        inhabit in each lifetime.  So that 
                        we meet each other over the 
                        generations.  Growing and learning 
                        together.  I believe that Pyotr and 
                        I were lovers, in various forms, 
                        for a thousand years...
           Eduard looks at Vladimir with a mixture of fascination and 
           disgust.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        The problem is that in this life, 
                        we both came back as male.

           Eduard’s expression shifts from disdain to pity.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Je te vois venir avec tes gros 
                        sabots.  Now tell me about his 
                        Symphony.

           But Vladimir is nodding off from his high.  Eduard rises to 
           his feet.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Shall I take you home?

           Vladimir shakes his head.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I cannot go back there.  Not since 
                        that night...

           Eduard nods.  Vladimir’s eyes slide shut.  The pipe slips 
           from his hands, but he keeps speaking.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        You loved Tchaikovsky.

           Eduard scoffs, pulling on his cloak.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I possess profound respect for the 
                        man.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You loved him.  It is alright.  We 
                        all loved him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREETS OF ST. PETERSBURG – NIGHT

           Eduard strides purposefully through the Admiraltesky 
           District, his head swimming with thought.  A snow flurry 
           renders the city lights majestic.  The Neva River freezing 
           over a few weeks early this year.

           Eduard huffs past the Music Conservatory with students 
           filling the raucous taverns along Teyatralnaya Ploshchad.
           Rachmaninoff hails Eduard, jogging across the street to join 
           him.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Maestro Nápravník, you are later 
                        than I expected.  Any progress?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The nephew Davydov claims to be 
                        responsible for Tchaikovsky’s 
                        death, although I do not yet see 
                        how.

           Rachmaninoff falls into step with Eduard.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Does he have motive, means, and 
                        opportunity?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        A motive like no other.  He claims 
                        to be the sole heir to 
                        Tchaikovsky’s estate.  A small 
                        fortune.

           Rachmaninoff whistles.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        We can check on that, easy enough.  
                        I know Tchaikovsky’s lawyer, 
                        Monsieur Lev Kupernik.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You certainly are well connected.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        I went to the academy with 
                        Kupernik’s young wife.  Tchaikovsky 
                        was our harmony teacher.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Can we visit Monsieur Kupernik at 
                        this hour?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Of course, he is always haunting 
                        Prokhodimets where I earn my 
                        spending money.  Lawyers are like 
                        vampires – they don’t require 
                        sleep.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. PROKHODIMETS - NIGHT

           LEV KUPERNIK removes his stick pin and loosens his ascot.  He 
           gleefully SMACKS A RHYTHM on the lid of the upright piano.

           BAR PATRONS in the cramped tavern laugh and drink as 
           Rachmaninoff and Nápravník pound out a duet - the 2ND LIZST 
           HUNGARIAN RHAPSODY.

           Kupernik wipes tears from his eyes as Rachmaninoff and 
           Nápravník HAM IT UP...  Making elaborate octave crosses over 
           and around each other, deliberately getting their arms 
           tangled up.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Monsieur Kupernik, is Vladimir 
                        Davydov really set to inherit 
                        Tchaikovsky’s entire estate?

           Kupernik swigs from his beer stein.

                                 LEV KUPERNIK
                        I cannot break a client’s 
                        confidence – even for you two 
                        distinguished lunatics.  But I will 
                        tell you Vladimir is not the sole 
                        recipient.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Really?

                                 LEV KUPERNIK
                        Tchaikovsky’s wife, for instance, 
                        is going to make out considerably.

           Eduard and Rachmaninoff exchange an incredulous look.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Tchaikovsky has a wife?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I have known Pyotr our entire adult 
                        lives.  He never once mentioned a 
                        wife!

                                 LEV KUPERNIK
                        They married in secret.  Pyotr gave 
                        her the bare minimum while he was 
                        alive.  But she will benefit 
                        enormously now that he is dead.

           Eduard Nápravník leans forward eagerly on his piano bench.  A 
           new suspect.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Monsieur Kupernik, where can I find 
                        this woman?  You must have an 
                        address in your files?  

                                 LEV KUPERNIK
                        I’ve already said far more than is 
                        prudent.

           Rachmaninoff stands up.  So tall he must stoop to avoid the 
           heavy oak crossbeams of the low tavern ceiling.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Monsieur Kupernik, have you read 
                        the newspapers?  There is foul play 
                        in Pyotr’s death.

                                 LEV KUPERNIK
                        I do not believe in conspiracies.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Name me the last time a member of 
                        the upper class died of cholera!  
                        It is unheard of these days!

           Kupernik considers the truth of this.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        We must learn of anyone who stood 
                        to benefit from Tchaikovsky’s 
                        death.  Please, Monsieur Kupernik, 
                        it is important we honor 
                        Tchaikovsky.

           Lev Kupernik gulps down his beer and jots an address on a 
           scrap of paper.

                                 LEV KUPERNIK
                        I am going to the lavatory for 
                        exactly three minutes.

           Kupernik places the scrap of paper on the lid of the piano.

                                 LEV KUPERNIK (CONT’D)
                        I hope not to set eyes on you two 
                        troglodytes for a long time.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                             (bowing his head)
                        Thank you, Monsieur.

           Lev Kupernik shakes his head, chuckling.  Inebriated, he 
           snakes his way on wobbly legs toward the lavatory.
           Rachmaninoff snatches up the scrap of paper.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Tchaikovsky’s wife is “Antonina 
                        Ivanovna Milyukova.”

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        She sounds lovely.  Is there an 
                        address?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        The Charitable Home at Udel'naia.
                             (considering)
                        Have you ever heard of it?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Yes, in fact, I have.

           Eduard rises to his feet, his expression bemused.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        It is an insane asylum.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UDEL’NAIA HOME FOR THE MENTALLY DISTURBED - DAY

           Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Rachmaninoff sit uncomfortably in 
           two wooden chairs, dandling teacups.  LUNATICS SCREAM AND 
           RAGE from the distant corners of the asylum.

           ANTONINA IVANOVNA MILYUKOVA holds court in her tastefully 
           decorated room.  She wears a high-necked afternoon dress with 
           puffed elbow-length sleeves and a faded linen sash.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Can you describe your marriage to 
                        Tchaikovsky, Mademoiselle 
                        Milyukova?

           Antonina’s posture is rigid and imperious.

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA
                        Sometimes I think he married just 
                        to please his acquaintances.  He 
                        proposed on our second meeting and 
                        we married in front of a single 
                        witness.  By the time we reached 
                        Moscow for our honeymoon, Pyotr 
                        could not stop crying.  He drank 
                        incessantly and took Valeriana so 
                        that he slept all the time.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA (CONT'D)
                        After a few weeks, Pyotr had a 
                        nervous breakdown and his brother 
                        Modést took him back to St. 
                        Petersburg.  And that was it.

           Antonina leans forward conspiratorially.  In her arms, she 
           cradles a porcelain doll, swaddled in baby clothes.

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA (CONT’D)
                             (whispered)
                        If you ask me, he was a little 
                        crazy.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Did Pyotr ever speak to you of 
                        his...affliction?

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA
                        You mean the men?

           Eduard nods, his cheeks flushed.

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA (CONT’D)
                        Pyotr told me before we married he 
                        could only offer me “brotherly 
                        love.”  Of course I had no idea 
                        what that meant.  But, I soon saw 
                        what Pyotr’s idea of brotherly love 
                        was...

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Can you think of anyone who might 
                        harbor ill-will toward Pyotr?  
                        Anyone who might profit by his 
                        passing?

           Antonina sighs and shakes her head.

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA
                        His affliction ran deep.  There 
                        were many lovers.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Was Pyotr – forgive me – was he 
                        ever with another woman?

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA
                        He was never even with me.  And I 
                        was his wife.

           Eduard has flushed red again.  He takes a long sip from his

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA (CONT’D)
                        You must talk to his brother 
                        Modést.  He shares Pyotr’s 
                        affliction.  Can you imagine?  Two 
                        in one family.  Three if you count 
                        the nephew.

           Eduard’s glance roves to Antonina’s collection of porcelain 
           baby dolls, lining the shelves on lace doilies.  Dozens of 
           glass eyes staring blankly.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Just one more question, 
                        Mademoiselle Milyukova.
                        Forgive me, but your hospital file 
                        says you’ve birthed children by 
                        three other men.  All given to 
                        orphanages.  Surely, this was 
                        grounds for Tchaikovsky to divorce 
                        you?

           Antonina Milyukova’s hand flutters to her chest.  She fumbles 
           absently with the tarnished beads of her necklace.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                             (gently)
                        Why do you suppose Tchaikovsky 
                        never divorced you?  Why was he so 
                        generous to you in his will?  Was 
                        it because he was afraid of what 
                        you might reveal about him?

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA
                        I know what you are thinking.  He 
                        did not want to be haunted by a 
                        scandal, “avoir des casseroles au 
                        cul,” he used to say.

           Antonina is not well-educated.  Her French accent is clunky 
           and affected.

           She tightens her shawl, her chin thrust upward in pride.

                                 ANTONINA MILYUKOVA (CONT’D)
                        But the truth is, Pyotr still loves 
                        me.  The greatest composer in all 
                        Russia...loves only me.

           Antonina’s tear-filled eyes turn to gaze out the window.  She 
           clutches tightly at the porcelain baby.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. UDEL’NAIA HOME FOR THE MENTALLY DISTURBED - DAY

           Nápravník and Rachmaninoff stride across the manicured 
           grounds of the asylum.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The asylum guards insist Antonina 
                        has not left the grounds in years.  
                        She is profiting from Tchaikovsky’s 
                        death.  But I do not see her as a 
                        murderer.

           Rachmaninoff leafs through the PETERSBURG GAZETTE.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        The Gazette claims Tchaikovsky died 
                        of cholera.  Drank a glass of 
                        unboiled water at Restaurant 
                        Leiner.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Now I have heard everything!  The 
                        most exclusive restaurant in Russia 
                        serving unboiled water during a 
                        cholera scare?

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Don’t yell at me, I am on your 
                        side.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Every time I saw Tchaikovsky he was 
                        either washing his hands or wishing 
                        he was washing his hands.  It was a 
                        wonder he had any time to compose.

           Rachmaninoff reads from a second paper, SON OF THE 
           FATHERLAND.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        “If Restaurant Leiner served 
                        unboiled water, they violated the 
                        city-wide decree.  Their entire 
                        business can be shut down.”

           Eduard takes the paper from Rachmaninoff.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The Fatherland does not buy it any 
                        more than we do.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Are you going to talk to Modést?
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Modést is the last person who wants 
                        to see me.  First I must return to 
                        Vladimir, our confessed murderer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN – DAY

           Eduard lays packages of food out on Vladimir’s divan.  
           Vladimir wakes, stretches, and greets Eduard with a smile.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        My confessor has arrived!  And he 
                        has brought me kasha and blinchiki 
                        with sour cream and sugar!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        And eggs for your strength.  And 
                        tea to clear your head.

           Vladimir brings food to his lips, but with morphine in his 
           system, discovers he has little appetite.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Will you not share my breakfast?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Breakfast for you, lunch for me.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Never mind that.  This may be your 
                        one opportunity to break bread with 
                        a murderer.

           Eduard eyes Vladimir seriously.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I conduct the symphony this very 
                        night.  If you have something to 
                        tell me, tell me now.

           Vladimir nibbles a bit of kasha, but the food has no flavor 
           for him.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        The second movement - you rehearsed 
                        it joyfully?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You opened my eyes.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Joy, I am afraid, was all I had to 
                        teach Pyotr.  In Paris we were 
                        free.  Free to stop caring what 
                        others think and to be ourselves...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARIS - DAY

           Tchaikovsky and Vladimir stroll past PAINTERS and STREET 
           MUSICIANS along the cobbled promenades of the Quais de la 
           Seine.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Petipa can take his Mouse King and 
                        his Waltzing Flowers and his 
                        “tinkling water droplets” and stick 
                        them in his ear.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        If this is your mood on vacation, 
                        I’d hate to see you at work.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I am on vacation from the 
                        Nutcracker.  If I want to toil at 
                        superficial crap I will work on my 
                        own symphony.

           Vladimir tosses bits of bread for the ducks and admires les 
           bateaux mouche drifting lazily along the great river.  He 
           points to the nearest bridge.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Le Rue de Bruxelles - the home of 
                        Émile Zola.  Shall we have a look?

           Tchaikovsky clucks his tongue.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Zola is just Gaboriau, spiced with 
                        obscenities.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You are in a fine temper.

           Tchaikovsky clutches a hand on his heart, thickens his voice 
           with gravitas, and parodies Zola.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Il mangeait toujours...Puis 
                        l'estomac bourré, la face écarlate, 
                        l'oeil hagard, il se leva et 
                        sortit...

           Tchaikovsky bows with a flourish.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        I have just described my breakfast.

           Vladimir tosses the remainder of his bread crumbs at 
           Tchaikovsky.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Truth is, my symphony is just as 
                        meaningless as The Nutcracker.  I 
                        want to be a great chef but all I 
                        cook are pancakes.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You have something great in you 
                        yet.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Vladimir, I am washed up.

           Vladimir spots an inviting storefront and pulls Tchaikovsky 
           into...

           INT. MUSTEL PIANO SHOWROOM - DAY

           The floor is chockablock with pianos, all sizes and shapes.  
           AUGUST MUSTEL approaches, wearing an apron caked in sawdust.

                                 AUGUST MUSTEL
                        Bienvenue, je suis Monsieur Mustel! 
                        Et qui dois-je le plaisir de 
                        rencontrer?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I am Vladimir.  And this is Pyotr 
                        Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

           Mustel turns white, as if seeing an angel.  Tchaikovsky is 
           mortally embarrassed.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Thank you, Vladimir.
                                 AUGUST MUSTEL
                        GOD IN HEAVEN - IT IS AN HONOR!
                        Please, Monsieur Tchaikovsky, would 
                        you like to try my pianos?  Any at 
                        all?

           Tchaikovsky shyly begs off, with a sweep of his hands.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I always scrub my hands before I 
                        touch a piano.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Come, Pyotr.  Go crazy.

           MUSTEL BUZZES AROUND HIS SHOP IN A FRENZY, sweeping the dust 
           covers off the pianos, revealing his prized merchandise.

                                 AUGUST MUSTEL
                        Try my Harmoniums - I build the 
                        best in Europe!

           Mustel’s pianos are first rate.  Tchaikovsky cannot resist.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Ah.  The Bösendorfer...

           Tchaikovsky sits down at the world class BÖSENDORFER GRAND 
           PIANO.  Mustel raises the lid and props the lock bar.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        ...Bright tone. Perfect for Mozart.

           Tchaikovsky launches into the Mozart Piano Concerto in D 
           minor.  Then embellishes, STRIKING ACCIDENTALS ALL OVER THE 
           KEYBOARD to Vladimir’s delight.

           Outside on the street, a CROWD GATHERS.

           In childlike delight, Tchaikovsky leaps to another priceless 
           piano.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        But you have been holding out on 
                        me, Monsieur Mustel.  For here is a 
                        Bluthner!  Touch it and you hear 
                        Chopin singing -

           Pyotr plays a lick of the Revolutionary Étude – with its 
           brilliant left hand runs -

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        - you hear Schumann laughing -
           He fires off the dazzling arpeggios of the Schumann  
           Papillons –

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        - Or hear Brahms farting through 
                        his fingertips.

           Tchaikovsky crinkles up his face like a brute and plays the 
           ponderous eight finger chords of the Brahms’ F minor Piano 
           Sonata.

           Outside, THE CROWD OF ONLOOKERS GROWS LARGER.  TCHAIKOVSKY IS 
           A VIRTUOSO.

                                 AUGUSTE MUSTEL
                        - My new Harmonium is built like a 
                        glockenspiel, with steel resonators 
                        and a single sustain -

           But Tchaikovsky, with the flair of a matador, SWEEPS THE DUST 
           COVER OFF ANOTHER PIANO.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Vladimir, you must accompany me.  
                        They have a Steinway “Model C” from 
                        America.

           Vladimir sits down at a Bechstein and rolls out the 
           triumphant chords of Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto.

           Reverently, Tchaikovsky opens the fall board on the 9’2” 
           Steinway Concert Grand, his fingers poised for attack.  And 
           then – to the growing crowd’s delight – HE WHIPS OUT AN 
           ELECTRIFYING CADENZA.

           Tchaikovsky’s eyes meet Vladimir’s, sparkling with pleasure.  
           GAPING TOURISTS NOW LINE THE PROMENADE.

                                 AUGUSTE MUSTEL
                        Monsieur Tchaikovsky, I have built 
                        a new Harmonium – a new instrument.  
                        It is called the Celesta.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        The “Celesta?”  And is it truly 
                        “heavenly?”

                                 AUGUSTE MUSTEL
                        Heavenly?  Monsieur, it is like 
                        tinkling droplets of water!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        “Tinkling droplets of water?”
           Tchaikovsky stops playing immediately.  His eyes burn with 
           intensity.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Show me at once.

           Mustel gleefully leads Tchaikovsky through the clutter of 
           instruments to his little wooden harmonium.

           Tchaikovsky loosens his shirt cuffs and tries a simple 
           cadence on the upper register.  EACH ETHEREAL NOTE OF THE 
           CELESTA IS LIKE MUSIC FROM A FAIRY TALE.

           Tchaikovsky is enchanted.

           Outside, the crowd bends forward, listening.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Vladimir, it is a gift from 
                        heaven...

           Vladimir watches intently.

           And very quietly, Tchaikovsky begins singing pizzicato bass 
           notes to himself, IMITATING A PLUCKED CONTRABASS...

           His fingers LIGHTLY KISS THE KEYS OF THE CELESTA, conjuring a 
           tune, ever haunting, familiar, and enchanting...

           ...Like tinkling droplets of water.

           The crowd listens in hushed awe.  Tchaikovsky’s eyes sparkle 
           in delight.

           Tchaikovsky has finally solved THE DANCE OF THE SUGAR PLUM 
           FAIRY.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. MARIINSKY THEATRE – ST. PETERSBURG – NIGHT

           Italian Grand Dame ANTOINETTA DELL’ERA dances The Sugar Plum 
           Fairy, twirling en pointe.  In white tights and pink tutu, 
           Dell’Era floats weightlessly from toe to toe.

           THE PACKED CROWD IS RAPT WITH ATTENTION – in the palm of 
           Dell’Era’s hand.  She is supported by the IMPERIAL RUSSIAN 
           BALLET - the best ballet company in the world.
           INT. MARIINSKY THEATRE - TSAR’S BOX

           Every inch of TSAR ALEXANDER III’s balcony box is gilded in 
           ornately carved gold, framed with plush red velvet curtains.  
           The Tsar and his SIX CHILDREN watch the ballet, mesmerized...

           Below them, the crème de la crème of RUSSIAN SOCIETY fill the 
           orchestra seats; ladies with silk fans, peacock feather hats, 
           and mink fur coats...

           INT. MARIISNKY THEATRE - BALCONY

           Tchaikovsky sits in an opposite balcony with Vladimir 
           Davydov.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                             (whispered)
                        It is a masterpiece.

           In the darkness, Vladimir takes Tchaikovsky’s hand and 
           squeezes.  Overwhelmed with happiness, Tchaikovsky turns and 
           KISSES VLADIMIR.

           Vladimir is astonished but smiles radiantly.  More happy than 
           he will ever be again...

           INT. MARIINSKY THEATRE - ORCHESTRA SEATS

           The cold, pale eyes of Vladimir Stasov emerge from behind 
           opera glasses.  His mouth twisted in a scowl behind his 
           pointed grey beard.

           Stasov nudges Alexander Glazunov and together they stare 
           contemptuously upward at Tchaikovsky and Vladimir.

                                 ALEXANDER GLAZUNOV
                             (whispered)
                        Tchaikovsky is parading his 
                        deviance before all St. Petersburg.  
                        He thinks he is untouchable.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        He has become untameable.  Russia 
                        cannot afford another scandal.

           INT. MARIINSKY THEATRE - CAPTIVATED AUDIENCE

           As the Sugar Plum Fairy sticks the finish of her final 
           Fouetté en tournant, the CROWD ERUPTS IN FRENZIED APPLAUSE.
           Only Stasov, Glazunov, and the members of the Belyayev circle 
           do not clap.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN – DAY

           Vladimir’s eyes flicker in the hazy gloom of the opium den.  
           In his black cloak, Eduard is almost invisible.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Can you feel Tchaikovsky’s joy?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I hear it in your voice.

           Vladimir Davydov moves closer to Eduard, peering intently 
           into his eyes.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        But can you feel it – really feel 
                        it!  Pyotr said these are the 
                        “finest adornments in an artist’s 
                        life.”  The moments that make it 
                        worth “living and laboring.”  To be 
                        loved and understood!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I understand all that.

           VLADIMIR GRABS EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK BY THE SHOULDERS.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        But I need you to feel everything 
                        Pyotr felt!  How can you express 
                        emotion on the stage when you never 
                        express it in real life?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Unhand me!

           Vladimir releases Eduard.  Vladimir plops down on the floor 
           and busies himself with packing a new pipe.

           He unwraps a clump of black heroin from its foil package.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr told me you are an orphan.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        He told you what?
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        It is nothing to be ashamed of.  
                        Pyotr’s mother died when he was 13. 
                        His father nearly died the same 
                        month.  From then on, Pyotr lived 
                        in a boarding school.

           Vladimir sucks on the stem of the pipe to get the smoke 
           BUBBLING THROUGH THE WATER BOWL.

           Eduard watches him; his jaw muscles clenching and 
           unclenching.  Finally, he speaks.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I was orphaned at fourteen.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Do you see why Pyotr felt you could 
                        understand him?  Why you alone 
                        could conduct his work?

           Eduard Nápravník nods.  Vladimir releases a plume of 
           violaceous smoke and relaxes into the cushions.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how Pyotr feels when a 
                        work is rejected by critics?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Yes, believe me.  I conducted many 
                        of his works that fell flat on 
                        their faces.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Well the audience loved The 
                        Nutcracker.  Antonietta Dell'Era 
                        took five curtain calls.

           Vladimir watches the diaphanous smoke undulate on unseen 
           eddies of air.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        But the critics excoriated 
                        Tchaikovsky.  They buried the 
                        Nutcracker so that it will be 
                        forgotten by history and never 
                        played again...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TCHAIKOVSKY APARTMENT – ST. PETERSBURG – NIGHT

           Modést Tchaikovsky helps Vladimir Davydov carry his luggage 
           to the front door.  Vladimir is dressed in the formal regalia 
           of his Army Regiment.

                                 MODÉST
                        Write us letters incessantly.  I 
                        expect updates every minute you are 
                        away.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I promise.

           Tchaikovsky tosses a copy of the PETERSBURG GAZETTE onto the 
           table, pours himself a fresh vodka from a tumbler, and raves.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        The critics accept the works I 
                        don’t care about and destroy the 
                        works I love!  The 1812 overture is 
                        nothing but bombastic noise and it 
                        is my biggest success.

           Vodka swishes out of Tchaikovsky’s glass and onto the 
           Oriental rug.

                                 MODÉST
                             (to Vladimir)
                        It is lucky you are leaving.  He 
                        does this every time he premieres a 
                        new work.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Meanwhile the Queen of Spades - 
                        which I composed in a 44 day fit of 
                        passion - is all but forgotten.

                                 MODÉST
                        Here we go...

           Tchaikovsky is already refilling his vodka, spilling more 
           before it gets to his mouth.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I dedicated my First Violin 
                        Concerto to that virtuosic coward, 
                        Leopold Auer.  And he refused to 
                        play it!  It took four years to be 
                        performed!  And then “legendary 
                        critic” Eduard Hanslick utterly 
                        shat upon it.
                                 MODÉST
                        Pyotr, wouldn’t you like to bid 
                        goodbye to Vladimir, before he 
                        rejoins his regiment?

           Tchaikovsky does not hear, but begins a recitation of Eduard 
           Hanslick’s review...

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        “The violin is no longer played. It 
                        is yanked about, torn asunder, and 
                        beaten black and blue...”

           Vladimir turns to Modést with concern in his voice.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        What is he doing?

                                 MODÉST
                        Pyotr commits all of his bad 
                        reviews to memory.  He has a real 
                        genius for self-pity.

           Tchaikovsky spreads his arms and addresses the walls, the 
           ceiling, the fireplace...

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        “...the soloist martyrs himself as 
                        well as his listeners.  The finale 
                        is odorously Russian.  We see wild 
                        and vulgar faces, we hear curses, 
                        we smell bad brandy. Friedrich 
                        Vischer once asserted there are 
                        paintings that ‘stink to the eye.’  
                        Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto 
                        brings us the horrid realization 
                        there is music that stinks to the 
                        ear.”

           Modést goads Tchaikovsky.

                                 MODÉST
                        Johannes Brahms told you to your 
                        face the Violin Concerto stunk.

           Modést has hit the mark.  Tchaikovsky’s face contorts in 
           anger.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        That scoundrel Brahms.  What a 
                        giftless swine!  How is this 
                        conceited mediocrity regarded as a 
                        genius?  Compared to him, Raff is a 
                        giant, not to mention Rubinstein.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT'D)
                        Brahms is a chaotic and utterly 
                        empty wasteland.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I think his Rhapsodies are divine.

           Tchaikovsky flops down on the sofa.  He exhales a plume of 
           cigarette smoke through his nostrils and crosses his legs 
           urbanely.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Brahms is a shit.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Bach lived and died in obscurity 
                        and now is revered like a saint.  
                        You never know, Pyotr.  Someday, 
                        your First Violin Concerto may 
                        become the most popular violin 
                        concerto in the world.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        They have buried it.  Along with 
                        The Nutcracker.  And they will bury 
                        my Symphony as well.

           In a sudden fury, Tchaikovsky rushes to his roll top desk, 
           picks up the score of the Symphony Pathétique, and RACES FOR 
           THE FIREPLACE.

           Modést and Vladimir move to stop him, but TCHAIKOVSKY 
           OVERPOWERS THEM, TOSSING HIS SYMPHONY INTO THE FLAMES.

           Vladimir cries out in anguish, reaching for the score with 
           bare hands.  But Tchaikovsky DASHES HIS VODKA INTO THE BLAZE.

           THE 6TH SYMPHONY EXPLODES IN FLAMES.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You maniac!  You fool!

           Tchaikovsky hands Vladimir his empty vodka glass.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Get me another drink.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        No!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        À boire ou je tue le chien!

           Vladimir takes the glass and HURLS IT INTO THE FIREPLACE.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You raving idiot!  You worked for 
                        months on that!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        It is mine to destroy.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Not in a moment of asinine 
                        drunkenness.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Why don’t you go on and leave 
                        already!  Go and join your foolish 
                        army regiment!

           Tchaikovsky sees the pain in Vladimir’s eyes and cools off.  
           He sets a hand on the mantelpiece and stares into the fire.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        The symphony had no heart.  I was 
                        writing for the sake of writing.  
                        Like the weaker children of Sparta 
                        it must be thrown off a cliff.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        It was probably as much a work of 
                        genius as the first five.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        It was drops of ink on paper.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        So rewrite it - don’t burn it in a 
                        fire.  Honestly, you are the 
                        stupidest genius I have ever known.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I am dried up.  I ought not to 
                        write symphonic music anymore.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        What do you want to write?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I want to write something 
                        unimpeachably great.  Something 
                        from my soul!

           Tchaikovsky’s eyes search Vladimir’s, imploringly.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        I want to write something honest.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Then write about us.

           Vladimir and Modést pick up their coats and luggage and leave 
           the apartment.

           Tchaikovsky ponders Vladimir’s words, thunderstruck.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Write about us...

           Tchaikovsky’s eyes widen in wonder.  An epiphany slowly 
           spreading from his heart to his mind.

           And he is lit by a new fire... 

           ...REVELATION.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TCHAIKOVSKY’S APARTMENT – DAY

           Tchaikovsky is composing - PEN FLYING ACROSS THE PAGE.  His 
           face transfigured with passion and fury.  A MAN POSSESSED.

                   TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
           “My dear Vladimir, the idea of 
           a new symphony came to me.  
           It is completely saturated with 
           myself.  The progress is going 
           so intensely, the first movement 
           is ready in less than four days...”

           Tchaikovsky’s pen races from his score to a fresh sheet of 
           paper where he writes LETTER AFTER LETTER TO VLADIMIR.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
                        “My emotions rise in crescendo.  
                        You cannot imagine my feelings of 
                        bliss now that I am convinced the 
                        time is not gone forever; that I 
                        can still work!”

           Tchaikovsky pounds chords on his 82 key grand piano.  He wets 
           his pen and makes adjustments to his score.

                                             TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
                                     “I am writing to you with a 
                                     voluptuous pleasure.  The thought 
                                     that this paper is going to be in 
                                     your hands fills me with joy and 
                                     brings tears to my eyes...”
           Tchaikovsky sits rigid at his desk, fingers pressed to his 
           temples, listening to the MUSIC FLOODING HIS MIND.  TEARS 
           ROLL DOWN HIS CHEEKS.

                     TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
           “The anguish and distress which cannot
           be expressed in words, I can express 
           in my symphony!  I shall not feel 
           depression any more...”

           Tchaikovsky wrings his cramped and ink-stained hands, soaking 
           them in a bowl of hot water.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        “I see you in my dreams looking 
                        sad.  This adds a feeling of 
                        compassion to my love for you and 
                        makes me love you even more.  Oh 
                        God!  How I want to see you this 
                        very minute...”

           Tchaikovsky watches the growing red light of dawn.  His hands 
           shake with nervous exhaustion.

           HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF HANDWRITTEN SYMPHONIC MUSIC LIE 
           SCATTERED ABOUT HIS APARTMENT.

                          TCHAIKOVSKY (Overlapping V.O.)
                  “- I embrace you my idol!”
                              “- I embrace you to suffocation!”
                                      “- I embrace you with mad tenderness.”

           Tchaikovsky signs the cover of the Symphony Pathétique...

                          “...For Vladimir Davydov.”

           Guttered candle light dances in Tchaikovsky’s eyes.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        You have freed me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - MOSKOVSKY VOKZAL RAILROAD STATION – DAY

           In uniform, Vladimir Davydov deboards the train.  He is 
           surprised to find Tchaikovsky waiting there in his jacket, 
           waistcoat, and umbrella.

           Tchaikovsky moves to embrace him, but Vladimir is stiff and 
           cold.  Vladimir’s ARMY COMRADES, released on furlough, clap 
           him on the back as they exit the train.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                         Not here, you old fool.

           Tchaikovsky takes Vladimir’s arm and steers him into the 
           BUSTLING CROWDS of Nevsky Prospect road.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        What do you have to say for 
                        yourself?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Me?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        You don’t answer a single one of my 
                        letters.  God forgive me – all I 
                        wanted was a few words from you.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I don’t suppose you’ve ever served 
                        in the army, but they tend to keep 
                        you well occupied.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Don’t you know how I worry about 
                        you?  How I think about you?

           Vladimir gestures at Tchaikovsky to keep his voice down.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        If you do not want to write, at 
                        least spit on a piece of paper, put 
                        it in an envelope, and send it to 
                        me!

           PASSERSBY eye Tchaikovsky oddly.  He has no idea he is 
           shouting.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I thought you only cared for your 
                        symphony.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Our symphony!  It consumes me.  
                        I’ve already finished two 
                        movements.

           Tchaikovsky’s eyes burn feverishly.  His skin is pale from 
           working around the clock.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        It is the best thing I have ever 
                        written or ever shall write.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        I love it as I have never loved any 
                        of my musical children.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        That is good.  Very good.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Oh Vladimir, if you can not kiss me 
                        in public at least hold me.

           TCHAIKOVSKY GRIPS VLADIMIR INTO A HUG THAT VLADIMIR RETURNS.  
           Tchaikovsky’s fingers run through Vladimir’s close-cropped 
           scalp.  They press their foreheads tightly together.

           ...AND VLADIMIR STASOV INTERRUPTS THEM.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Monsieur Tchaikovsky, I thought 
                        that was you.

           Stasov glares with sharp eyes over his hooked nose.  His 
           woolen grey beard dipping all the way to his belt. 

           Tchaikovsky breaks apart from Davydov with a start.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Monsieur Stasov, I was just helping 
                        my dear nephew.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Helping him how?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                             (lamely)
                        Helping...welcome him back to St. 
                        Petersburg.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Well, if you give all visitors to 
                        St. Petersburg such a warm welcome, 
                        it may help our tourism.

           Tchaikovsky and Davydov smile uncomfortably.  Stasov takes 
           Tchaikovsky by the elbow.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV (CONT’D)
                        Monsieur Davydov, you will not mind 
                        if I share a quick word with Pyotr?

           Davydov bows low.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Mais, bien sûr.
           Stasov pulls Tchaikovsky to one side and hisses at him 
           through clenched teeth.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        What nonsense are you playing at, 
                        Tchaikovsky?  Don’t you know the 
                        eyes of the world watch you?  You 
                        do not belong to him, you belong to 
                        Russia!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        My personal life should not concern 
                        you - 

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Russian culture is finally claiming 
                        its rightful place.  And you would 
                        throw it all away for your 
                        infantile vices!  You must quit 
                        this insanity or I shall write a 
                        letter to the Tsar and take care of 
                        your vices once and for all.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        You would imprison me?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Exile.  Somewhere your sordid 
                        scandals cannot tarnish our 
                        national image.  You are lucky it 
                        was I, who spotted you.  And not a 
                        member of the Imperial Family.

           Stasov releases Tchaikovsky’s arm from his grip.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV (CONT’D)
                        Pull yourself together.  You are a 
                        man, Tchaikovsky.  Act like it.

           Stasov turns and merges into the crowd.  Pyotr looks after 
           him, defeated.

           Davydov joins Pyotr at his side, placing a tentative hand on 
           his shoulder.  Pyotr shakes him off.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I must go home and write.

           Tchaikovsky unbuttons his sleeves and scrubs his hands all 
           the way up to his elbows.  He scours the skin until it shines 
           red.

           In complete silence Pytor sits at his immaculate oak top 
           desk.  He places a clean sheet of staff paper - just so.  
           Arranges his ink well – just so.

           Tchaikovsky dips the pen’s nib in his ink well and rolls it 
           in blotting paper.

           Everything is ready.

           The composer takes a deep breath and closes his eyes...

           THE THIRD MOVEMENT EXPLODES INTO LIFE --

              Frenetic triplets set a blistering pace for the Allegro 
              Molto Vivace;

                    Pizzicatos hot-potato across the string section;

                          CLARINETS announce a melody and are answered 
                          by the HORNS.

           Beneath Tchaikovsky’s hand, the SCORE TAKES SHAPE.

               BEAUTIFUL SYMMETRIES EMERGE:

                  Black smudges of 32nd-notes scatter throughout the 
                  woodwinds;

                         interlocking brackets of triplets splinter   
                         throughout the horns...

           Tchaikovsky is gripped with intense concentration; his face a 
           mask of revelatory ecstasy -

           INT. EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK’S STUDY – SAME

           Eduard Nápravník studies the score of the third movement, 
           juggling the instruments in his mind, STRUGGLING TO BALANCE 
           THE CLASHING PARTS -
           INT. HALL OF NOBLES – SAME

           Eduard rehearses the PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA.

                 FORTY BOW ARMS ROW IN SYNCH --

                        FORTY WOODWINDS AND HORNS BLAST THE THEME --

           Eduard Nápravník WHIPS HIS BATON, building the Fortissimo-
           issimo-issimo climax of syncopated triplets.  THE HORNS 
           DELIBERATELY OFF BEAT FROM THE STRINGS.

           Eduard urges them mercilessly faster until the orchestra runs 
           in synch like the interlocking gears of a Swiss watch -

           INT. TCHAIKOVSKY’S APARTMENT – SAME

           The composer’s mind a blur with mathematics, his hand 
           struggling to keep pace with the DAZZLING SPEED OF HIS  
           THOUGHTS -

           INTERCUT WITH ORCHESTRA

           - SWEATING MUSICIANS labor over their instruments:

                - TRUMPETERS’ CHEEKS BULGING, veins standing out in 
                  their necks -

                       - BRASS PLAYERS chests heaving in and out -

                              - The titanic CRASH OF THE CYMBALS -

           Everyone hitting the SHATTERING CLIMAX OF THE THIRD MOVEMENT 
           and GASPING FOR BREATH.  

           - Tchaikovsky slumps in his chair, exhilarated and exhausted.

           - The orchestra, quivering bows in the air, let the final 
           note REVERBERATE ACROSS THE PANELLED OAK WALLS OF THE CONCERT 
           HALL.

           Eduard Nápravník’s shirt cuffs are billowed out of his 
           trousers. He leans on his music stand, panting.  Hair matted 
           to his forehead.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Good.

           Eduard flips through his score, back to the beginning of the 
           movement.  Then TAPS HIS BATON on his music stand.

                        Now, again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARIINSKY THEATER – ST. PETERSBURG – NIGHT

           The cast of Tchaikovsky’s IOLANTHE take their curtain calls 
           to ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE.  Tchaikovsky and Vladimir Davydov 
           quietly attempt an early exit from the opera.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                             (Whispered)
                        We should not even be here. Stasov, 
                        Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov, the 
                        whole Belyayev Circle will see us.  
                        You should not parade me around in 
                        public like this.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        We are almost out of the theater.  
                        No one will ever know we were here.

           Darting up an exit aisle, they are halted by an armed COURIER 
           OF THE TSAR.

                                 TSAR’S COURIER
                        Monsieur Tchaikovsky.  The Tsar 
                        requests your presence in his royal 
                        box.

           Tchaikovsky hesitates.

                                 TSAR’S COURIER (CONT’D)
                        ...At once.

           Sweat blooms on Tchaikovsky’s brow.  Vladimir turns white.  
           They follow the courier up a flight of steps.  Vladimir 
           surreptitiously gripping Tchaikovsky’s hand.

           Tchaikovsky straightens his bow tie and smooths the lapels of 
           his evening coat.

           INT. THE TSAR’S BOX – MARIINSKY THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Tchaikovsky and Vladimir enter the Tsar’s opulent private box 
           and bow low.  All of Russian Society watches from the 
           orchestra seats to see who the Tsar has favored with his 
           attention.

           TSAR ALEXANDER III is a barrel-chested man over six feet 
           tall.  Bald as a cue ball and sporting a thick tangled beard.
                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III
                        Monsieur Tchaikovsky.  
                        Congratulations on your opera, 
                        Iolanthe.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Thank you, your excellency.

           A sebaceous cyst dominates the left side of the Tsar’s nose, 
           drawing attention away from his stony, unflinching eyes.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III
                        Who is this man that accompanies 
                        you everywhere?

           Tchaikovsky bows to acknowledge the other members of the 
           royal family.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Your Excellency, allow me to 
                        introduce my dear nephew, Vladimir 
                        Davydov.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III
                        You...

           Tsar Alexander stares hard at Davydov, his jaw clenched.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III (CONT’D)
                        It is unforgivable...

           The Tsar’s expression grows dark.  He raises a finger to 
           point at Davydov and jabs it repeatedly in the air.

           Tchaikovsky is ashen with fear.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III (CONT’D)
                        It is a sin against the state!

           Tsar Alexander GRIPS VLADIMIR’S SHOULDERS and shakes him 
           affectionately.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III (CONT’D)
                        ...For a member of my own royal 
                        guard to appear at the opera out of 
                        uniform!

           Tsar Alexander laughs heartily.  VLADIMIR DAVYDOV CLICKS HIS 
           HEELS AND BOWS LOW.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III (CONT’D)
                        Why aren’t you wearing the dress 
                        uniform of your regiment?
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I wanted to preserve my incognito, 
                        your Excellency.

           The Tsar throws back his head and roars with laughter, 
           clapping Davydov hard on the back.

           Over the balcony, Tchaikovsky notices Vladimir Stasov and 
           Rimsky-Korsakov glaring up at him from the orchestra seats.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III
                        It is hard to keep your incognito 
                        when standing next to a great 
                        Russian composer.

           The Tsar CLAPS HIS HAND HARD onto Tchaikovsky’s shoulder.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III (CONT’D)
                        I brought you up here because I 
                        wished you to meet my issue.

           The Tsar gestures broadly to his six children.

                                 TSAR ALEXANDER III (CONT’D)
                        Children, here stands the greatest 
                        living composer.  Of course, 
                        besides Johannes Brahms.

           Tchaikovsky stiffens, about to riposte, but Vladimir deftly 
           checks him with a severe look.

           Tchaikovsky forces a smile and bows once more.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (V.O.)
                        -- I am running out of time, 
                        Vladimir --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN – DAY

           Vladimir’s eyes are aglow with his memories.  Eduard stands 
           up to anxiously pace the room.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The symphony premiere is this 
                        evening.  So let us cut to the 
                        chase.  You must tell me of Pyotr’s 
                        death!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Were you bullied in the orphanage?
           Eduard is so stunned he stops pacing to stare at Vladimir.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        What does that have to do with 
                        anything?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        You bury your emotions deep down. 
                        Protecting yourself.  The only 
                        feelings you express are impatience 
                        and anger.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I am not interested in getting a 
                        condescending lecture from a 
                        morphine addict.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Are you a conformist, Eduard?  Are 
                        you afraid of people deviating from 
                        your idea of normal?  Do you strive 
                        to fit in?  When the school kids 
                        bullied you, did you tell them you 
                        were not an orphan?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                             (quietly)
                        That is enough, Davydov.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Are you so terrified of being 
                        different, you’ve practiced your 
                        Russian accent so people don’t even 
                        know you are a Czech?

           Eduard snaps.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Enough!  You say you killed 
                        Tchaikovsky.  So tell me once and 
                        for all...  How did you do it!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Very well.

           For once, Vladimir lowers the morphine pipe to the ground.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        If you can stomach it, it happens 
                        in an intimate moment.  Pyotr and I 
                        were lying on the verge of sleep.  
                        I know you are squeamish with 
                        emotions.  Will you indulge me?  
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Do continue.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RUSSIAN SKY - NIGHT

           Ten thousand stars twinkle in the firmament.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
                        You are not at all like an empty 
                        suitcase.  There is so much in you 
                        that is good.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (V.O.)
                        I have lived my whole life being 
                        someone other than myself.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
                        There are worse fates.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (V.O.)
                        Name one.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (V.O.)
                        Vladimir, you believe in things I 
                        have given up on.  I am the empty 
                        suitcase.  And you are filling me 
                        up again.

                                                                REVEAL:

           EXT. ROOFTOP – TCHAIKOVSKY APARTMENT – NIGHT

           Tchaikovsky and Vladimir lie on a blanket on the slanted 
           slate roof of their St. Petersburg apartment building.  An 
           empty bottle of wine at their side.

           Together, they are alone in the middle of the city.  They 
           share a kiss.  Vladimir gazing up at the stars.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        In Queen of Spades, Herman and Liza 
                        both commit suicide.

           Tchaikovsky absently twirls a lock of Vladimir’s hair around 
           his pinkie finger.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        In Romeo and Juliet, they commit 
                        suicide.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        In Swan Lake, the two lovers dive 
                        into the lake and drown.

           Tchaikovsky says nothing.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        All your greatest works.  Why must 
                        the lovers always die?

           Tchaikovsky smiles at Vladimir, his eyes brimming with 
           affection and great sadness.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Is it not, somehow, more beautiful 
                        that way?

           Vladimir takes Pyotr’s hand.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I will not leave you, Pyotr.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I know.

           Tchaikovsky kisses Vladimir on the forehead.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                             (Again)
                        I know.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I love you.  And the lovers need 
                        not always die.

           Tchaikovsky says nothing.  But only smiles sadly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN – DAY

           Vladimir’s pale face lies still against the cushions.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        ...And this is how I killed him.  
                        By making him believe we could be 
                        together.  Giving us this 
                        ridiculous hope.  Cavorting around 
                        St. Petersburg like the world could 
                        not stop us.  Surely, no one could 
                        topple the greatest composer in the 
                        world?  But I did.  Just me.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I do not understand you.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr killed himself, you idiot.  
                        It was a suicide.

           Eduard looks at the spent water pipe, the crumbs of morphine.  
           And the addicts dreaming in their adjacent bunks.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You have lost your mind on 
                        morphine.  The doctors do not 
                        believe Pyotr died from arsenic 
                        poisoning.  He was seen drinking 
                        unboiled water at Restaurant 
                        Leiner.

           Eduard rises to his feet, growing angry.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        And even if he did kill himself - 
                        you have not given me any motive.  
                        Why would Pyotr do such a thing?  
                        It is a sin against God!

           Vladimir fumbles with his handkerchief, dabbing his eyes.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Does my crying make you 
                        uncomfortable?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Nothing you have said makes any 
                        sense to me!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        It is my crying that makes you 
                        angry.  All emotion makes you 
                        uncomfortable.  That is why you 
                        need music – so your feelings can 
                        find safe expression.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I’ve wasted enough time in this 
                        morass.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Full of morphine and I can still 
                        cry like a baby.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are not at all a killer, 
                        Vladimir.  You are as gentle a soul 
                        as I have ever known.

           Eduard snatches his pocket watch from his waistcoat, checking 
           the hour.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        But you have wasted my bloody time.

           Eduard sweeps out of the room, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HERMITAGE THEATRE - DAY

           The beautiful century-old theater is built in the classical 
           style.  From the rear of the auditorium, Modést Tchaikovsky 
           watches a rehearsal of his play “The Prejudices.”

           Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Rachmaninoff sit down in the row 
           behind Modést.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        So the great librettist has written 
                        a play.  It must be liberating to 
                        write a libretto unencumbered by a 
                        score.

                                 MODÉST
                        They say the best writer is a good 
                        editor.  So I am not even going to 
                        favor you with a retort.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Do you have time for a break, 
                        Modést?

           Modést says nothing, but continues to watch his play.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        I am holding my last rehearsal for 
                        the 6th Symphony before the 
                        premiere tonight.  I want you to 
                        hear it.  It is important.

           After a moment, Modést reluctantly nods.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. STAGECOACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Modést, Eduard, and Rachmaninoff rock gently back and forth 
           as the hired cab rumbles over cobblestone.

                                 MODÉST
                        That you should conduct the 
                        Pathétique!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        It was Tchaikovsky’s dying wish.

                                 MODÉST
                        You of all people!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I conducted his First Piano 
                        Concerto after Rubinstein called it 
                        unplayable.  I premiered his 1812 
                        Overture!  I premiered five of his 
                        operas.  No one is a greater 
                        champion of Pyotr’s music than I!

                                 MODÉST
                        You championed Pyotr’s music.  But 
                        you never championed Pyotr.

           Modést glares at Eduard until Eduard breaks his gaze, 
           throwing his hands in the air and shaking his head.

                                 MODÉST
                        What is it you need from me?

           Rachmaninoff comes straight to the point.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        We suspect Pyotr’s death was not 
                        natural.  We want you to help us 
                        arrive at the truth.

           Modést slowly nods.

                                 RACHMANINOFF (CONT’D)
                        You shared an apartment with Pyotr 
                        and Vladimir in the final days.  
                        Did you notice anything unusual in 
                        Pyotr’s behavior?

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Everything was always unusual in 
                        Pyotr’s behavior.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Antonina Ivanovna Milyukova said 
                        you know all Tchaikovsky’s secrets.  
                        Is there anything you know that can 
                        help us.

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Do you want to know who killed him?

           Eduard and Rachmaninoff exchange glances.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Can you tell us that?

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY
                        That one is easy.  You should know. 
                        You were both there.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY
                        The Belyayev Circle.  Two weeks 
                        ago.  That was when Pyotr was 
                        killed.

           Eduard’s brow creases.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The court of honor?

           Modést nods his head wearily.

                                 MODÉST TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Of course, you fools.  What else?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ST. PETERSBURG CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC – DAY

           Eduard Nápravník, Alexander Glazunov, and the prominent 
           members of the Belyayev Circle gather in Vladimir Stasov’s 
           private study.  Rimsky-Korsakov gestures for everyone to sit.

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        Vladimir Stasov composed a letter 
                        to the Tsar complaining of Pyotr 
                        Tchaikovsky’s...tendencies.

           Stasov nods gravely, stroking his wiry beard.  Modést 
           Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninoff listen with rigid 
           attention.
                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV (CONT’D)
                        I was able to convince Monsieur 
                        Stasov not to send the letter yet, 
                        but to convene all of you first.  
                        Tchaikovsky will be here any 
                        moment.  And we will have the 
                        chance to confront him ourselves... 
                        Regarding his assignations.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        His what?

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        His dalliances.

           Stasov dominates the room from his imposing oak desk, like a 
           judge overseeing a trial from his bench.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Our noble Tsar conferred the Order 
                        of St. Vladimir on Tchaikovsky, 
                        granting him hereditary nobility 
                        and an annual pension of 3,000 
                        rubles.  This makes Tchaikovsky the 
                        first full time composer in Russian 
                        history.  And therefore a symbol.

           Stasov rises to his feet.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV (CONT’D)
                        And yet he cavorts with his 
                        concubine in the streets, and 
                        flaunts his deviance to the Tsar’s 
                        face!

           Alexander Glazunov grumbles his agreement.

                                 ALEXANDER GLAZUNOV
                        Tchaikovsky has become a clown.  
                        And will disgrace Russian music if 
                        word of his indulgences continues 
                        to spread.  The newspapers of 
                        Europe would love nothing more than 
                        to discredit the greatest of 
                        Russian composers.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        He is being a fool.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        You once said Mussorgsky was kind 
                        of an idiot.  Are there any Russian 
                        composers you don’t think are 
                        fools?
                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        I never said Modést Mussorgsky was 
                        “kind of an idiot.”  I said he was 
                        a complete idiot.

           Rachmaninoff smiles.  A vein pulses in his temple, but he 
           maintains his composure.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Both Beethoven and Handel had 
                        prison records by the time they 
                        were Tchaikovsky’s age.  Bach was a 
                        pugilist.  Schumann tried to drown 
                        himself in the Rhine.  Von Weber 
                        was literally thrown out of Germany 
                        and banned for life!  Compared to 
                        most great composers, Tchaikovsky 
                        is a saint.  Who cares what he does 
                        behind closed doors?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Tchaikovsky is not doing it behind 
                        closed doors – that is exactly my 
                        point!

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Prince Alexey Vasilyevich shares 
                        Tchaikovsky’s deviance.  He openly 
                        lives with another man.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Yes, and he is royalty!

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        What of Julius Caesar?  What of 
                        Socrates and Plato?  Are they 
                        deviants?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        I do not care what those perverts 
                        did to Greek boys 2,000 years ago.  
                        I care about Russian honor as we 
                        claim our place at the center of 
                        European culture!

           THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky steps into 
           the room.  He looks around at his colleagues, bewildered.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Gentlemen.  What is this?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Your court of honor.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Rimsky-Korsakov, why have you 
                        summoned me here?

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        Pyotr, please, calm yourself.  Take 
                        a seat.

           Tchaikovsky reluctantly sits next to his brother Modést, who 
           pats his knee.

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV (CONT’D)
                        We are gathered today as your 
                        friends, Pyotr.  To say your 
                        relationship with Vladimir Davydov 
                        must end.

           Tchaikovsky’s mouth moves, but it takes a moment for him to 
           find his voice.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        You have decided this?

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        It is what is best.  All of us 
                        devote our lives promoting the 
                        dignity of Russian music.  And you 
                        have brought Russian music to the 
                        world.  These great achievements 
                        must not be undermined by frivolous 
                        scandal.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Frivolous scandal?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        He is your nephew, for God’s sake!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Are you worried about incest?  Is 
                        that what alarms you?  Are you 
                        worried my nephew and I will 
                        somehow mate and produce a deformed 
                        baby?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        He is young, Pyotr!  
                        Impressionable!

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        He is older than your wife, when 
                        you married her.

           Eduard Nápravník speaks up for the first time.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        It is scandalous, Pyotr.  Surely, 
                        you can see that.  Why should your 
                        tabloid life become your legacy, 
                        rather than your music!

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        Tchaikovsky, you must break it off 
                        with your nephew immediately.  And 
                        have no more indecent relations.  
                        Forever.

                                 MODÉST
                        And if Pyotr does not comply?

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        You know the official sentence for 
                        this crime.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Siberia?

                                 ALEXANDER GLAZUNOV
                        Many have been sent who would not 
                        reform their deviance.  Siberia’s 
                        prisons are filled with perverts.  
                        You should feel quite at home.

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        Pyotr, you are very lucky it was we 
                        who confronted you, rather than the 
                        Tsar.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        You travel abroad more than any 
                        Moscow diplomat.  You are Russia’s 
                        true ambassador – our most famous 
                        citizen.  Russia’s national honor 
                        is at stake.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I never chose to be this way.  And 
                        I never asked to be a symbol.  I 
                        did not even choose to make music.  
                        Music chose me!

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV
                        This was never about your music!  
                        This is about Russia claiming its 
                        throne before the world.  Tolstoy, 
                        Doestoyevsky, Gogol, Chekov, 
                        Turgenev, Pushkin – we have authors 
                        to rival Europe.  Our ballet is 
                        world class!

                        Our composers lead the progress of 
                        music – Scriabin, Mossorgsky, 
                        Glinka, Borodin, and Tchaikovsky!

           Stasov lets the echo of his final words die away.

                                 VLADIMIR STASOV (CONT’D)
                        We have a duty to our homeland.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I did not choose to love Vladimir

                        But you may choose to end it.

           Tchaikovsky sits silently, hands clasping his knees.

                        We will take it to a vote.  Those 
                        who feel Monsieur Tchaikovsky must 
                        end all deviant behavior, 
                        particularly with his nephew, lest 
                        he be faced with exile in Siberia,

           TITLE CARD:       THE FOURTH MOVEMENT

           EXT. MOSCOW RIVER – NIGHT

           A young Pyotr Tchaikovsky, newly married, sprints out of his 
           cottage.  His wife, Antonina, SHOUTS AFTER HIM.

           Young Pyotr dashes into the freezing river.  PLUNGING ALL THE 
           WAY UP TO HIS NECK.

           His body CONVULSING WITH THE FRIGID WATER - HIS LUNGS 
           SEIZING.  His mouth twisted, STRUGGLING TO SCREAM.

           FADE IN:
           INT. HALL OF NOBLES – DAY

           Eduard Nápravník stands quietly before the orchestra.  His 
           face pale and worn.

                        The final movement.

           Modést and Rachmaninoff watch the final rehearsal from the 
           audience.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Adagio Lamentoso, a slow lament.  
                        Everything will come together now.

           The violinists rest their instruments upright on their knees, 
           hands gently cradling the fragile necks.

           A cellist scores his resin with a knife and strokes the 
           hardened sap across his bow.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        You will hear the return of the 
                        trombone Mass for the Dead.  You 
                        will hear the return of the theme 
                        of the star-crossed lovers.  And 
                        you will hear the very last notes 
                        written by the greatest composer in 
                        Russian history.

           Eduard lifts his hands and the musicians raise their 
           instruments.

                        Let us begin the end.

           VIOLINS WAIL IN LAMENTATION.  The lowest strings tremble with 
           ominous portent.

           And the final movement begins...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TCHAIKOVSKY APARTMENT – DAY

           Tchaikovsky works feverishly at his desk, sipping vodka from 
           a half-empty bottle.  Ashtray clogged with spent cigarettes.

           Vladimir Davydov enters, cheeks rosy from the cold, and 
           shrugs off his wool overcoat.  He looks to Modést who sips 
           whiskey, legs folded on the sofa.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr is still working?

                                 MODÉST
                        He has not spoken a word for 
                        hours...  It’s been bliss.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        But we must conceive a plan.  We 
                        cannot allow Pyotr to be shipped 
                        off to Siberia!

                                 MODÉST
                        Pyotr refuses to discuss it.  He 
                        wants only to work.

           Vladimir crosses to Pyotr at his desk.  He sets a hand on the 
           composer’s shoulder.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        What are you writing, Pyotr?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        The final movement of my symphony.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        But you already have all three 
                        movements.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        This symphony will have a fourth.

           Tchaikovsky takes a swallow of vodka and smiles.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        This is the best and most sincere 
                        of all my works.  You will see.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        I looked at your crazy symphony.

           Vladimir picks up the score of the first movement.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        Here, at the Adagio Mosso, you have 
                        a bassoon decrescendo to PPP.  And 
                        then PPPP, and then PPPPP and then 
                        PPPPPP.

           Vladimir counts all six P’s out on his fingers.
                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, great composer, how is a 
                        bassoon supposed to play pianissimo-
                        issimo-issimo-issimo-issimo?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                             (smiling)
                        With a bass clarinet.

           Modést pipes up from the sofa.

                                 MODÉST
                        Pyotr, you are a madman.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        If enough people call me a madman, 
                        a few will mistake me for a genius.

           Tchaikovsky winks, eyes twinkling with good humor.

           He lifts up his score and waves it in the air, letting the 
           ink dry.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr, we must leave this city.  Or 
                        contrive a plan.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        On my word of honor, I have never 
                        felt such happiness as in knowing I 
                        am really the creator of this work.

           Vladimir takes Tchaikovsky in his arms, trying to hold him.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr, you must listen to reason -

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        What am I to do!  If I am sent to 
                        Siberia I will be apart from you.  
                        If I stay here, I must be apart 
                        from you.  If I go abroad, my 
                        reputation will track me to the 
                        ends of the earth!

           Tchaikovsky shakes himself free.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        I choose to be with you right now.  
                        If only for these moments!

           There is a fire in Tchaikovsky’s eyes.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Nothing they can do to me is 
                        important.  All that matters is my 
                        music!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                             (plaintively)
                        They will ruin you.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I say they can do nothing to me! 
                        They cannot hurt me.  They cannot 
                        disparage me.  They cannot kill me.  
                        For my symphony is written...

           Tchaikovsky downs the remainder of his vodka.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        And now I am immortal.

           Tchaikovsky’s eyes sparkle with something verging on madness.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALL OF NOBLES – DAY

           Eduard sits with Modést and Rachmaninoff in the front row of 
           the empty audience.  His orchestra on break.

                                 MODÉST
                        You must play it softer!  The 
                        fourth movement is but one 
                        decrescendo.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Signifying what?

                                 MODÉST
                        A good man dying.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You say the Belyayev circle killed 
                        Pyotr.  Do you mean he was driven 
                        to suicide?

           Both men are out of their chairs.

                                 MODÉST
                             (growling)
                        Must I spell out everything for 
                        you?
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Yes!  Contracting Asiatic Cholera 
                        from a glass of water - how is that 
                        a suicide?

                                 MODÉST
                        Our mother died when Pyotr was 13!  
                        Her lungs failed.  Pyotr sat with 
                        her in bed.  He lost his voice 
                        shouting, begging her to breath.  
                        She died in his arms.

           Modést continues, his voice shaking.

                                 MODÉST
                        Tchaikovsky had an eidetic memory!  
                        He recalled that moment in every 
                        detail, every day for the rest of 
                        his life.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Why do you tell us this?

                                 MODÉST
                        Because that was the day Pyotr 
                        became a composer.

           Modést steadies himself against the back of a chair.

                                 MODÉST
                        Pyotr showed no great talent until 
                        that moment.  And the day she 
                        passed away, he wrote his first 
                        composition.  A waltz, in her 
                        honor.  Grief unlocked Pyotr’s 
                        genius.

           UNIFORMED USHERS enter the hall and begin lighting the wall 
           sconces for the evening premiere.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Modést, how did your and Pyotr’s 
                        mother die?

                                 MODÉST
                        You do not know?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        No.

                                 MODÉST
                        Asiatic Cholera.

           Eduard and Rachmaninoff are stunned.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The same disease that killed Pyotr?

                                 MODÉST
                             (nodding)
                        It is no coincidence.  She drank a 
                        glass of unboiled water.  The same 
                        as Pyotr.

           Modést chuckles bitterly.

                                 MODÉST
                        Pyotr had a poet’s heart.  He would 
                        choose a poet’s death.

           Eduard is speechless.  Rachmaninoff shakes his head.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        ...Explains why Pyotr spent his 
                        life scrubbing his hands and 
                        boiling his water.

                                 MODÉST
                        Our mother’s death was the 
                        formative moment of his life...  
                        And also of his death.

           Eduard runs his hands through his hair, thoughts racing.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        My God, I understand now.  I 
                        understand Vladimir Davydov’s 
                        guilt.  It was a suicide.

           Eduard paces in a circle.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Oh Vladimir, poor Vladimir.

           Modést is suddenly alarmed.

                                 MODÉST
                        Why, where is Vladimir?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Festering in some opium den.

           Modést grabs Eduard’s shoulders.

                                 MODÉST
                        What?  You can not leave the boy 
                        there!  He is intent on killing 
                        himself - to return to Pyotr!
           Modést is already flinging on his coat.

                                 MODÉST (CONT’D)
                        I feared he might try something.  
                        Where is this opium den?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I do not know a name or an address.  
                        I can only find it by feel.

                                 MODÉST
                        Take me there at once.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        But Monsieur Nápravník’s premiere 
                        is tonight!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Sergei, we must.  The boy could be 
                        dying.

                                 RACHMANINOFF
                        Then I come with you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREETS OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT

           The trio perch in a GALLOPING TROIKA, SKITTERING THROUGH THE 
           CROWDED STREETS.  Pedestrians leap out of the way of the 
           SPEEDING CARRIAGE.

           INT. TROIKA - MOVING

           Modést clutches his top hat to prevent it blowing off.

                                 MODÉST
                        How can I repay you for helping me?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Write us your best librettos.

           Modést looks from Eduard Nápravník to Sergei Rachmaninoff.

                                 MODÉST
                        Write librettos...  For both of 
                        you?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Yes.
                                 MODÉST
                        And I shall.  With pleasure.

           BELLS JINGLE ON THE HARNESSES OF THE GALLOPING BLACK 
           COURSERS.  Their steaming breath shimmering in the wintery 
           Russian night.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN – NIGHT

           Eduard, Modést, and Rachmaninoff LEAP FROM THE CARRIAGE 
           BEFORE IT GRINDS TO A HALT.

           The three men leave the horses frothing and stamping on the 
           cobbled street.

           INT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN – CONTINUOUS

           STONED MEN WITH BLOODSHOT EYES FILL THE MAIN ROOM, CROWDING 
           AROUND A BODY.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Where is Vladimir!  Let us through 
                        at once!

           Eduard, Modést, and Rachmaninoff shove their way through the 
           crowd to reach the unconscious body on the ground.  And sure 
           enough, it is Vladimir.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Vladimir, what have you done?

           Eduard rolls up his sleeves, lifting young Vladimir’s head 
           off the ground.  The eyes show only their whites.  Froth 
           congealing on the blueing lips.

           Eduard turns to the shaved-headed Proprietor.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Have you given him an emetic?

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        He’s done plenty of vomiting 
                        already if that’s what you mean.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Coffee, please.  We need to keep 
                        him awake.
                                 PROPRIETOR
                        I’m not his bloody doctor and this 
                        is no bleedin’ hospital.  I got a 
                        business to run.  Pay me his debts 
                        and get him outta here.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You will sell him enough dope to 
                        kill himself, so long as you can 
                        collect a profit.

           The Proprietor grabs Eduard by the collar, hauling him to his 
           feet.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        I’m a tavern keeper – this is my 
                        business.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You are not a tavern keeper, you 
                        are an undertaker!

           Eduard Nápravník shoves the proprietor off of him.  The 
           Proprietor hauls off and DECKS EDUARD ON THE CHIN, sending 
           the conductor sprawling across the filth-strewn floor.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        I didn’t pay for his dope.  You 
                        did!

           Before Eduard can pick himself up, Rachmaninoff enters the 
           fray.  Unusually tall and with massive fists, RACHMANINOFF 
           ROUNDHOUSES THE PROPRIETOR.

           Every drug-addled man in the opium den SETS ON RACHMANINOFF 
           LIKE A PACK OF WILD DOGS.  RACHMANINOFF TRADES PUNCHES WITH 
           HALF A DOZEN MEN.

           MODÉST GRABS EDUARD AND TOGETHER THEY DRAG VLADIMIR’S LIMP 
           BODY FROM THE OPIUM DEN.

           EXT. TOCHKA OPIUM DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Modést and Eduard hoist Vladimir into the waiting Troika.  
           Eduard Nápravník barks at the bewildered Troika driver.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        To the Hall of Honor with all 
                        haste.  I have a symphony to 
                        conduct!

           Rachmaninoff backs out of the melee, fists flying, and LEAPS 
           ONTO THE TROIKA AS IT TAKES FLIGHT.
           INT. TROIKA - MOVING

           Eduard cradles Vladimir’s lolling head in his hands.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Wake up, Vladimir.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                             (murmuring)
                        I can’t...  I can’t...

           EDUARD SHAKES HIM VIOLENTLY.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You must attend the concert.  Pyotr 
                        would have wanted you there.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Let me sleep...

           Eduard Nápravník SLAPS VLADIMIR’S FACE, keeping him awake.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV (CONT’D)
                        Every time you see me, you feel 
                        compelled to smack me...

           But Vladimir cannot keep his eyes open.  The whites of his 
           eyes roll back in his head.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        You disgraced him in life, now you 
                        disgrace him in death!

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        It is my fault he died.  He died 
                        for me!

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Get up, you fool.  You are not 
                        doing him any favors by killing 
                        yourself.

           Vladimir’s eyes flutter open at last.  He looks at Eduard 
           with infinite sadness in his eyes.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr’s really gone.  We will never 
                        see him again.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        It is not your fault, Vladimir!  It 
                        was his choice, not yours.
           Eduard softens, comforting Vladimir with the gentle pressure 
           of his hands.

                        You are the only one of us who made 
                        him truly happy.  How can that ever 
                        be wrong?

           EXT. HALL OF HONOR - NIGHT

           A MASSIVE CROWD queues up at the front box office, waiting 
           for the main doors to open.

           INT. HALL OF HONOR - SAME

           Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Rachmaninoff BURST THROUGH THE 
           SIDE DOORS, supporting Vladimir between them.  Modést 
           Tchaikovsky hurries along beside them.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        We will take him to my dressing 
                        room.

           USHERS IN ROYAL LIVERY prop open the main doors to the 
           concert hall.  GAFFERS light the colossal crystal chandeliers 
           with extendable gaffing poles.

           In the side corridors, ORCHESTRAL MUSICIANS nervously adjust 
           their tuxedoes and tune their instruments.  They stare in 
           shock as Eduard Nápravník strides past... his face bruised 
           and Vladimir’s vomit staining his lapels.

           INT. GREEN ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

           Modést feeds Vladimir a cup of coffee, walking him around the 
           room in circles.

           Rachmaninoff helps Eduard into his tail suit.
                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        It was a suicide.  And I believe I 
                        know what drove him to it.

           Eduard rapidly threads his collar studs, shirt studs, and a 
           pair of gold-mounted opal cuff links.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        Vladimir and Modést.  You must tell 
                        me everything that happened from 
                        the moment Pyotr left the court of 
                        honor...  To the moment Tchaikovsky 
                        departed this world.

           INT. RESTAURANT LEINER – DAY

           Tchaikovsky stares across the white tablecloth at Modést and 
           Vladimir.  Tears welling in his eyes.

                                 MODÉST
                        You are not eating anything.

                                 TCHAIKOVSY
                        Not hungry.

           Stasov and Glasunov saw into their steaks at a nearby table.  
           Tchaikovsky catches them glaring.

                                 MODÉST
                        You always get depressed when you 
                        finish a great work.  You are just 
                        tired.

           Tchaikovsky does not answer.  He stares back at Stasov, who 
           looks away in disgust.  Finally, Tchaikovsky sighs.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        This will never end.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        What will never end?

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I have travelled three continents.   
                        There is no place in this world for 
                        us.

           Tchaikovsky stands up abruptly and leaves the table.  He 
           turns and walks into...
           INT. RESTAURANT LEINER – KITCHEN - SAME

           Tchaikovsky strides past CHEFS and DISHWASHERS.  He finds 
           himself a fresh glass by a sink, and DRAWS WATER FROM THE 
           TAP.

           Tchaikovsky stares at the glass of water.  Bubbles fizzing to 
           the surface to greet the air.

           PYOTR TURNS THE GLASS TO HIS LIPS AND GUZZLES THE WATER LIKE 
           HE IS DYING OF THIRST.

           Pyotr finishes the glass and draws another.

           SEVERAL COOKS STARE AT TCHAIKOVSKY, STUNNED.  A CHEF rushes 
           for Tchaikovsky, BABBLING IN FRENCH, WRESTLING THE GLASS FROM 
           HIS GRIP.

           Tchaikovsky leans against a counter and LAUGHS, his chin 
           dripping with water.  He wipes his lips with the back of his 
           hand.

           Pyotr cannot stop laughing.

           THE SOMBER TONES OF THE SYMPHONY’S FINAL ADAGIO BUILD IN 
           INTENSITY.

           Modést and Vladimir hover anxiously by Tchaikovsky’s bedside.  
           Dr. Lev Bertenson checks Tchaikovsky’s icy wrists and the 
           swelling in his throat.

           TCHAIKOVSKY SHIVERS VIOLENTLY, his head and extremities 
           turning dark blue.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I believe this is death.

                                 LEV BERTENSON
                        His temperature is plummeting.

                        You must inject him with musk, 
                        camphor...

                                 LEV BERTENSON
                        I have tried all that.
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Leave us now, Doctor.  You can do 
                        no good.  I shall never recover.

           Dr. Bertenson leads Modést and Vladimir to the hallway.  He 
           shakes his head and speaks in low tones.

                                 LEV BERTENSON
                        Asiatic cholera in its algid stage.  
                        His kidneys are already failing.  
                        All we can do is keep him 
                        comfortable.

           Tchaikovsky appears more relaxed now.  Vladimir pats sweat 
           from Pyotr’s forehead.

           Eduard Nápravník sits uncomfortably on a wooden chair by 
           Tchaikovsky’s bedside.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Have you reviewed the new symphony 
                        I sent you?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I studied it all day.

                        And what do you think?

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        It is not Russian enough for the 
                        Belyayev Circle; it is not European 
                        enough for the French.  It is an 
                        enigma.  Unlike anything I am aware 
                        of.

           Tchaikovsky’s eyes twinkle.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Eduard, I want you to conduct the 
                        Symphony Pathétique.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        Pyotr, why do you choose me to 
                        conduct all your works?
                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Because you are not Russian.  
                        Because you are an outsider, like 
                        me.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        The symphony has a program to it, 
                        that I do not yet understand.

           Tchaikovsky reads the hesitation in Eduard’s face.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Understand the Pathétique, and you 
                        will understand me at last.  
                        Conduct it with all your heart, 
                        Eduard.

           Tchaikovsky reaches out to clutch Eduard’s hand with 
           surprising strength.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Upon our friendship.  Promise me.

           Eduard swallows his doubts.  He nods his assent.

           Vladimir kneels by Tchaikovsky’s bedside.  The two men 
           whisper intensely, their faces almost touching.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Why did you do it, Pyotr?  We could 
                        have gone away together.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        Where?  Where on this earth can I

                        Listen, Vladimir.  I have planned 
                        our escape.  We will have the last 
                        laugh!

                        I have written us into my symphony.  
                        I have told our story, for all who 
                        care to listen.

                        I wanted to make great music and I 
                        wanted a great love, but you cannot 
                        have both in one life.  There is 
                        not enough space for that much joy - 
                        this world will not allow it.  So I 
                        wrote you into my music.

                        only immortality you and I may 
                        share.

           In the dark of night, Tchaikovsky strips off his shirt and 
           casts it aside.  Tears running down his cheeks, HE WALKS 
           STRAIGHT INTO THE FREEZING MOSCOW RIVER.

           Pyotr splashes cold water onto his chest.  He drinks the 
           water.  He rubs it into his hair.  He walks deeper and deeper 
           into the current.

           TCHAIKOVSKY’S BODY CONVULSES WITH THE FREEZING COLD.  He 
           stares up at the impassive curtain of night, HIS FACE 
           CLENCHED IN A MASK OF MISERY.

           A silent scream.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HALL OF HONOR – GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

           Eduard folds his starched white handkerchief into a pocket 
           square.  Then eases it into his breast pocket and spruces the 
           corners.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        To drown himself?

                                 MODÉST
                        No.  To kill himself with 
                        pneumonia.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        What on earth for?

                                 MODÉST
                        So he will appear to die from 
                        sickness, Eduard.  To spare our 
                        family’s honor.  So we are not 
                        tainted with the sin of divorce or 
                        suicide.

           Eduard turns to Vladimir in astonishment.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        This is what he has done?  Killed 
                        himself, using cholera?  To spare 
                        his honor?

                                 MODÉST
                        To spare our honor.  To spare your 
                        honor.  To spare us all from 
                        knowing he killed himself.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Pyotr must have known he would not 
                        fool Modést.  Or me.  But he 
                        thought he could fool all of you.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        But why?

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        Because Pyotr and I could not be 
                        together.  Because you voted in 
                        your court of honor.  Because we 
                        could never be ourselves.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        I did not know, my God I did not 
                        know.  I did not understand...
           Eduard’s breathing comes in fast and thick.  The dam that 
           holds back his emotions finally begins to rupture and burst.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        That he would choose death, rather 
                        than be apart from you.

           THE ADAGIO STRENGTHENS AND BUILDS.  THE THEME OF THE STAR-
           CROSSED LOVERS RETURNS, BUT IN A HEART-RENDING MINOR KEY.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. ST. PETERSBURG CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC – DAY

           Tchaikovsky’s friends, the Belyayev Circle, vote in the court 
           of honor.

                                 RIMSKY-KORSAKOV
                        We will take it to a vote.  Those 
                        who feel Monsieur Tchaikovsky must 
                        end all deviant behavior, 
                        particularly with his nephew, lest 
                        he be faced with exile in Siberia, 
                        please indicate your vote by 
                        raising your hand...

           Terrified, Tchaikovsky watches as Vladimir Stasov raises his 
           hand...

           Followed by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov...

           And then Alexander Glazunov...

           Rachmaninoff does not raise his hand.  Nor does Modést.  The 
           vote falls to Eduard Nápravník.

           And...

           Eduard raises his hand.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        For your music, Pyotr.  For your 
                        legacy.  And for Russia.

           The vote has turned against Tchaikovsky.  The composer is 
           doomed...

           Eduard sees the devastation in Tchaikovsky’s eyes...

           EDUARD HAS KILLED HIM.

                                                         CROSS FADE TO:
           INT. HALL OF HONOR – GREEN ROOM – NIGHT

           THE TROMBONES CALL BACK THE MASS FOR THE DEAD.

           Eduard wrings his hands, covering his head in despair.  His 
           Czech accent now emerging to curl the tips of his words...

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK
                        God help me!  I thought it was just 
                        some perversion, some thoughtless 
                        vice.  I did not know two men can 
                        love that deeply.  So much they 
                        would die for each other.

           The strength goes out of Eduard’s legs.  He drops to his 
           knees before Vladimir Davydov.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        You and Pyotr!  I did not know, God 
                        forgive me, I did not know.

           Eduard clasps Vladimir’s boots, the cuffs of his pant legs.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        It was I!

           Eduard looks up into Vladimir’s eyes.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        I broke his heart.  I broke your 
                        heart, too.

           Vladimir Davydov’s eyes fill with tears.

                                 EDUARD NÁPRAVNÍK (CONT’D)
                        I killed Tchaikovsky.

           Vladimir and Modést pull Eduard gently to his feet, steadying 
           him, straightening the white bow tie of Eduard’s tuxedo.

           Vladimir holds Eduard’s shoulders.  Gently he guides Eduard 
           out of the green room and toward the stage.

                                 VLADIMIR DAVYDOV
                        And tonight, you shall make 
                        Tchaikovsky live forever.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TCHAIKOVSY APARTMENT – NIGHT                1893

           Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky lies on his deathbed.  Vladimir and 
           Modést at his side, holding his hands.
           THE RHYTHMIC BASS STRINGS OF THE DYING ADAGIO match the 
           slowing beat of the composer’s heart.

           A look of peace illuminates Tchaikovsky’s face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOSCOW COTTAGE – NIGHT

           A younger Tchaikovsky shivers violently, rescued from the 
           Moscow river.  Modést wraps Pyotr in towels and throws more 
           wood on the fire.

                                 MODÉST
                        You wanted to marry to avoid a 
                        scandal, and now your marriage is 
                        the scandal.

           Tchaikovsky smiles weakly and Modést shakes his head.

                                 MODÉST (CONT’D)
                        Pyotr, you are a wonder of nature.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY
                        I did make a mess of things.

           Modést sits down and presses a warm cup of tea into 
           Tchaikovsky’s hands.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Only now, after the disaster of my 
                        marriage, do I finally begin to 
                        see.  There is nothing more 
                        fruitless than trying to be 
                        something you are not.

           Pyotr sips his tea and smiles up at his brother.

                                 TCHAIKOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        This is who I am.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TCHAIKOVSKY APARTMENT – NIGHT

           The great composer lies still on his deathbed.  
           Beautification written across his features.

           For a moment, a look of AWESOME REALIZATION LIGHTS UP HIS 
           FACE.
           TCHAIKOVSKY’S FINGERS TIGHTEN AROUND VLADIMIR’S FINGERS.  And 
           the soul departs Tchaikovsky’s body.  

           Pyotr’s eyes remain open and peaceful.  And he is still.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALL OF NOBLES - NIGHT                      1893

           Eduard Napravnik conducts the final movement of Tchaikovsky’s 
           Symphony Pathétique.  THE PACKED AUDIENCE IS TRANSFIXED.

           Familiar faces fill the crowd.  Vladimir Stasov.  Nicolai 
           Rimsky-Korsakov.  Sergei Rachmaninoff, sitting between Modést 
           Tchaikovsky and Vladimir Davydov.

           The basses pluck the syncopated beat on the lowest string, A 
           DYING HEARTBEAT.  Each tenor note of the cellos is 
           successively lower, quieter, SIGHING LIKE A DYING MAN’S LAST 
           BREATH.

           The few remaining strings decrescendo to the faintest 
           whisper...

                        Soon it is just down to basses and cellos, dying 
                        away in smorzando...

                                  Now only three basses remain.  
                                  Pianissimo-issimo...

                                              One last pluck of the 
                                              second basses.

                                                       A final  
                                                       heartbeat.

           And then silence.
           Eduard Nápravník lowers the baton, hands at his sides.  He 
           stands motionless.  Head bowed.

           The audience is STUNNED SILENT.  Overpowered, they do not 
           clap.

           Eduard shuts his eyes tight.

           He is crying.

           TITLE CARD:  Vladimir Davydov struggled with drug addiction 
           and committed suicide at 34.

           TITLE CARD:  For generations, Soviet censorship suppressed 
           Tchaikovsky’s letters referencing his homosexuality and his 
           love affair with Vladimir.

           TITLE CARD:  Today, the Symphony Pathétique is considered 
           among Tchaikovsky’s greatest works.

                                 THE END
