           BLACK.

                                 ALY’S VOICE
                        Don’t be afraid.

           Resolve to a mass of shifting colors.  
           BLUE.  RED.  YELLOW.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

           On a thin screen.  
           The colors are now static circles.  
           Blue.  Red.  Yellow.  
           Black and white spectrograph lines behind them.

           The room is a striking contrast. 
           Handmade wood furniture. 
           Advanced technology.

                                 ROMAN (O.S.)
                        I know, it’s just... my mind, you 
                        know?

           Along the bottom of the display:

                                         MARK II

           Reveal DMITRI ROMAN (30s).  Goes by Roman.
           Sharp features.
           Kind eyes.

           Roman sits in a chair.
           Beautiful oak hardback.

           Wears a tux.
           Bow tie undone.
           Looks at the screen with concern.

           He’s with his wife:  ALYOSHA.  Aly for short.  

                                 ALY
                        C’mon, trust me.

           She’s younger than him.  
           Smarter too.  
           Had better options than Roman.
           They’re both well aware.

           Wears an elegant dress.
           She holds two diodes in her hand.

                                 ALY
                        Okay?
           Roman doesn’t say no.
           She reaches out.
           Places the diodes on either side of his head.

           The colors light up.
           The black and white spectrograph starts to move.

           She motions to the circles.

                                 ALY
                        See.  I know you love me.

                                 ROMAN
                        Is that what’s on the screen?

           The blue circle pulses.

                                 ALY
                        Yes.  Well...  That’s what the blue 
                        is.

                                 ROMAN
                        You figured out how to measure it?

                                 ALY
                        As best we can.  The red is 
                        aggressive emotion, the yellow is 
                        fear, and the blue... the blue is 
                        love.

                                 ROMAN
                        It’s just that simple, huh?

           She smiles.

                                 ALY
                        Of course not.  There’s a trillion 
                        bits of information flying around 
                        every second.  We can’t show them 
                        all, so we just... this is the 
                        easiest way.

           They both watch it.
           Mesmerized. 

                                 ROMAN
                        You built a mind out of this...

                                 ALY
                        We modeled it off of this, yes.  
                        We’ll install it on the station as 
                        soon as it’s in orbit.  Three 
                        gorgeous data blades.  Right in the 
                        Sphere.
           She thinks a moment.

                                 ALY
                        Pending approval, of course.

           Roman looks at the moving screen.  

                                 ALY
                        It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

                                 ROMAN
                        Yeah, Aly.  It is.

           He sees a SMALL BLACK CUBOID plugged into it.
           Then he looks back to the colors.

                                 ROMAN
                        But...

                                 ALY
                        What?

                                 ROMAN
                        I just thought there’d be... more.

           She laughs.
           No misgivings. 

                                 ALY
                        Just because you can’t touch it 
                        doesn’t mean it’s not complicated.

           Roman feels inferior.
           Tries to play it off.
           Feigns a smile.

                                 ROMAN
                        Looks like a bunch of colors to me.

           An outsider might think he succeeded.
           But Aly knows better.
           Still plays along.
           Laughs.

           Roman looks down and grips the chair.
           Shakes it.
           Sturdy.

                                 ROMAN
                        Now this I get.  Great joint work.  
                        Very solid construction.  Who built 
                        it for you?

           She chuckles.
                                 ALY
                        Someone very secure with his work, 
                        apparently.

           He looks at the WORN STAIN on the arm.

                                 ROMAN
                        If only someone else could stop 
                        rubbing the finish raw.

           He pulls her close.

                                 ROMAN
                        Come here.

           They kiss.
           He looks into her eyes.
           Then past.  
           Sees a hand-cut bouquet of WHITE LILIES.

                                 ROMAN
                        Did you buy those?

                                 ALY
                        No, I picked them out in the 
                        valley.

                                 ROMAN
                        Did I tell you I liked them?

           With a smile.

                                 ALY
                        Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.

           He kisses her again.

                                 ROMAN
                        Come on.  Let’s just skip this 
                        thing.  Spend the night in.

                                 ALY
                        You know I can’t.  I have to play 
                        nice with the suits.

           She leans down.
           Traces his face.

                                 ROMAN
                        I love you.

           He means it.
                                 ALY
                        I love you too.

           A longer kiss...
           The screen still shows Roman’s mind.  
           The blue circle pulses.  
           So does the yellow.

           INT. BASEL CORPORATION - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           An open floor plan office/laboratory.
           Now converted into a party space.
           A large ‘BASEL’ logo looms over the room.

           A jazz band.
           A small stage.
           A bar.
           A crowd of EMPLOYEES.
           And middle-aged UPPER MANAGEMENT.

           The men in tuxes. 
           The women in dresses.
           It’s a gala in full swing.

           Aly chats with several guests.
           Smiles and polite laughter.

           Roman wanders the room.
           Bow tie now proper.
           A flute of champagne in his hand.
           He takes a sip.
           Then downs the whole thing.

           He looks over a SEQUENTIAL MURAL.

           Floor-to-ceiling.
           Divided into large sections.
           Each depicts a stage of a multi-phase rocket launch.
           By the middle mural: Several ships unfold.
           Each piece joining together.
           Culminating in a CIRCULAR SPACE STATION.
           Orbiting the Earth.

           Roman eyes the sign above the stage:

                                    THE LOGOS PROJECT

           Below it there’s a podium.
           A graying man takes his place behind it.
           Perfectly tailored tux.
           It clashes with his age.
           This is THE DIRECTOR.

           Roman watches.
                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        Good evening!  I want to thank you 
                        all for coming tonight.  And for 
                        your continued hard work on our 
                        collective brain child, The Logos 
                        Project!

           Applause from the crowd.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        And after we launch next year those 
                        bastards from Telos Tech aren’t 
                        going to know what hit them!

           Laughter.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        It is a celebration after all, so I 
                        hope you’ll take full use of the 
                        open bar.  Because I sure as hell 
                        paid for it!

           Another round of claps and laughter.

           LATER

           Roman stands. 
           Drink in hand.
           Toothpick twirling between his fingers.
           Watches Aly from across the room.
           Can’t keep his eyes off her.

           She talks with The Director and another man.
           Younger.  Good looking.
           For a man in the sciences.
           THE ADVISOR.

           He leans over to Aly.
           Touches the small of her back.
           Whispers in her ear.
           Aly laughs.

           Roman’s eyes go cold.
           Stunned.
           His fist clenches.

           He suddenly winces in pain.
           Looks down at his hand.
           A broken toothpick.
           And a trickle of blood.
           He’s punctured his palm.
           This gives him pause.
           But he shakes it off.
           Moves toward the group.

           Starts to hear snippets:

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        --I mean we are a primarily a 
                        colony venture, but Aly, this new 
                        AI project...

           Roman continues to make his way over.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        You know what they say...  The 
                        great scientific breakthroughs are 
                        unintentional.

           Roman comes up to Aly as:

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        We may have been digging for roots 
                        and bugs but found fire, so to 
                        speak.

                                 ALY
                        Thank you very much.  I can only 
                        hope you’re right.

           Roman joins the circle.
           They’re not familiar with him. 
           The odd man out.

           Aly’s graceful:

                                 ALY
                        Gentlemen, allow me to introduce  
                        my husband, Dmitri.

           Roman nods.

                                 ROMAN
                        They call me Roman.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        You look so familiar.

                                 ROMAN
                        Yes, actually I--

                                 ALY
                        Roman’s also on the project.
           She smiles.
           Squeezes Roman’s arm.
           Plays her part.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        Oh, yes.  You work in...

           The Director can’t place it.

           Roman seems suddenly shamed.
           Like he’s cursing:

                                 ROMAN
                        Industrial fabrication. 

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        Ah, right.  That’s it.

           Trying for a joke:

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        You actually make what we invent.

           It doesn’t land.
           Roman pushes past.

                                 ROMAN
                        Someone has to.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        That’s wonderful.

           The Advisor’s half-drunk.
           A spiteful look in his eye.
           Turns to Roman.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        So, if you don’t mind me asking, 
                        how in the world did you land this 
                        one?

           Aly tries to hide her apprehension.
           Answers for Roman.

                                 ALY
                        We were lucky enough to meet young.  
                        I wasn’t always Chief of AI--

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        Yes, but you are now!

           Everyone laughs with him.
           Roman’s fist clenches again.
                                 THE ADVISOR
                        And it’s a good thing too.  We’d be 
                        lost without you on the station.

           Roman looks confused.

                                 ROMAN
                        What’s he talking about?

           Aly’s embarrassed.

                                 ALY
                        Oh, I hadn’t got a chance to tell 
                        you--

                                 ROMAN
                        Tell me what?

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        We’ve invited Aly to install the AI 
                        system up on Logos after we launch.

           Roman’s first time hearing this.
           Aly tries to apologize with her eyes.
           The Director and Advisor oblivious.

                                 ALY
                        I still haven’t made my decision.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        But we know you’ll make the right 
                        one.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        It would only be for about eight 
                        months, give or take.

           Roman chokes on his words.

                                 ROMAN
                        Sounds like a great opportunity.

                                 ALY
                        And something I-- we still need to 
                        consider.

           The Advisor grins.
           Proud of the dissent he’s planted.

           Aly smiles at her husband.
           Squeezes his hand.
           Gives him a way out.
                                 ALY
                        Could you get me a drink, 
                        sweetheart?

           Roman waits.
           A second too long.

                                 ROMAN
                        Sure.

           She smiles.
           Reassuring.

           Roman walks off.
           The group continues their conversation.

           He weaves through the crowd.
           Makes it to the bar.
           Looks at THE BARTENDER. 
           His pent-up rage comes out as:

                                 ROMAN
                        Vodka.

           The Bartender pours it.
           Roman picks up the glass.
           Looks over to Aly.
           Still regaling the two men.

           He drinks it in one motion.
           Places the glass down.
           Savors the burn.
           Looks to The Bartender.

                                 ROMAN
                        One more.

           He looks over his shoulder again.
           At his wife and The Advisor.
           Real fear in his eyes.

           FIND the mural.
           The circular space station in orbit.

           CUT TO:

           BLACK.

           A title emerges:

           CUT TO:
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           A large photo of Aly.
           Over a coffin.

           Her funeral.  

           The suits all black.  
           The flowers blue.  
           Blue and red.

           Roman doesn’t cry on the outside.
           Hard heart now.
           Aims to keep it that way.

           EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

           Roman leans on his car.
           Still raw. 
           Smokes a cigarette.

           A familiar man approaches.  
           The Advisor.

           Only now he has a pronounced LIMP.
           And his face is different.
           Remnants of a broken nose.
           Faded bruises.
           Still slowly healing.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        Roman.

           Roman doesn’t look at him.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        On behalf of myself and the entire 
                        Basel Corporation I’d like to 
                        officially extend--

                                 ROMAN
                        Go fuck yourself.

           A grim smile from the Advisor.

           INT. DIM ROOM - DAY

           Colors muted.  
           Stark.

           Roman sits in a chair.  
           Dark circles under his eyes.
           To an unseen figure:

                                 ROMAN
                        Show it to me.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A makeshift workshop.

           Grease and tools.  
           Circuit boards and blueprints.  
           Reams of printed data.  
           Multiple screens.

           Roman at a workbench.

           Wears a protective face shield.
           Welds two pieces of metal.  
           A shoulder joint.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The Advisor keeps going.
           Too comfortable delivering bad news.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        I’m sure your wife shared 
                        certain... aspects of her work with 
                        you.

           Silence.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        But let me be clear.  Station Logos 
                        is an investment equal to the GDP 
                        of a small country.

           Roman is unimpressed.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        Information about it is privileged. 
                        And cannot become public.  If it 
                        did... measures would be taken.  
                        Strong measures.

                                 ROMAN
                        Do you protect all murderers this 
                        much, or only the ones you pay for?

           Roman keeps smoking.
           INT. DIM ROOM - DAY

                                 ROMAN
                        I want to see it.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You don’t--

                                 ROMAN
                        No.  Show it to me.  Now.

           No more protests.  
           A screen flickers on.
           Grainy security footage.
           ON THE SCREEN:  

           Metal floors.  White walls.   
           A SPACE STATION.
           Through curved windows:  
           The black of the cosmos.  
           Stars brighter than on Earth.  

           Aly works at a console.
           She looks terrified.
           Pleads with someone offscreen.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan!  Ivan, please!

           White gas hisses into the room.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, no!

           She bleeds from the nose.

           Roman watches.  
           Knows what’s coming.

           She turns to run.
           But only makes it a few steps.
           She falls.  Hits the floor
           Her body pumps involuntarily.
           Then she remains still.
           She dies.

           Roman waits for his wife to get up.
           She doesn’t.

           On screen:  

                                     END OF RECORDING

           Roman stares.
           INT. TINY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Roman continues to weld.
           A white hot glow.
           Polymer surface fuses to metal.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        As a sign of our understanding, 
                        you’ll be receiving a rather 
                        generous death benefit. 

                                 ROMAN
                        You think money makes this right?  
                        That thing is still up there.

           The Advisor remains calm.
           Continues.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        The Logos and all properties 
                        therein belong to us.

           Roman stares daggers.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        And if you think there’s an action 
                        that would appease you... there 
                        isn’t.  

                                 ROMAN
                        Are you saying you could stop me?

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        ...and if you attempt any such 
                        action regardless of current 
                        circumstances... things will end 
                        poorly.
                             (beat)
                        That’s a promise.

           The Advisor tips his hat.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        Again, my deepest regrets.

           He leaves.
           Roman spits.
           INT. DIM ROOM - DAY

           The video screen still flickers.
           Roman weeps.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Roman welds.
           Behind him a bouquet of WHITE LILIES.

           He finishes.  
           Lifts his face shield.  
           Reveals a beard and longer hair.

           Overlay:

                                    THREE YEARS LATER

           He steps back.
           Surveys his work:

           A SPACE SUIT.

           Functional.  Lightweight. 
           Interlocking plates of armor.
           Polymer and metal.
           Crude.  Discolored.
           But beautiful.  In its way.
           A SLIM-FIT HELMET on the bench.
           With a clear visor made of INVISIBLE GLASS. 

           He turns away.  
           Reveal an etching. 
           On the breastplate. 
           Over the heart: 

                                           ALY

           Roman blows out his torch.

           BLACK.

           Silence.

           Resolve to THE STARS.
           Come down to...

           EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

           The top of a skyscraper.  
           Skyline of a city behind.
           Roman’s there.  
           Looks out over the expanse.
           Nervous.
           Wears the legs and chest piece of his armor.  

           Thick boots too.  
           They seem special.
           Plates of chrome line the soles.
           These are the MAGNET BOOTS.

           He walks to the edge.  
           Looks down at the street far below.
           Scared.

           Walks back to the middle of the roof.
           Picks up to a run.   
           Jumps.

           Over the edge.
           He falls.

           Squeezes a thin pad on his palm.
           From the boots:
           The distinctive hum of MAGNETIC ENERGY.
           But he still falls.

           Squeezes his palm two times.
           The hum grows louder.
           The boots now on high power.
           He slams into the side of the building.  
           Feet first.
           Slides to a halt.

           Precarious.
           He balances.
           Servos whine.  
           Help him stand straight.
           He stays.
           Smiles.
           Turns.
           Walks back up.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT

           Roman’s bent over a blueprint.
           White ink depicts a massive structure.
           A cutaway view of its multiple levels.
           There’s a SPHERICAL AREA in the middle.
           Where Roman has scribbled notes.
           EXT. CITY PARK - DAY

           Brown grass.
           Overgrown.
           Cracked sidewalk. 
           The rusted skeleton of a playground.

           Roman stands in the middle.
           Waits.
           A JAPANESE MAN approaches.
           Stops a few feet from him.
           Roman produces a small plastic box.
           The Japanese Man holds out a thin crate.
           They trade.
           Each man checks his new possession.

           In the plastic box:
           An object wrapped in paper.
           Packed in ice.
           The Japanese Man peels back the paper.
           Glimpses of dark red tissue.
           It’s an ORGAN.

           In the crate:
           Two hexagonal objects.
           Packed in straw. 
           They’re black and yellow.  
           Japanese characters on the outside.  
           Also a symbol:  
           An exploding old-timey bomb.
           These are MINES.

           The two men share a nod.
           Satisfied.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Roman steps out of the shower.
           Dries himself.
           Exposes a grotesque vertical incision.
           Sewn up with fresh stitches.
           Over his kidney.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           On the workbench.
           One of the mines is opened.
           Electronics exposed.
           Roman adds miniscule circuitry with tweezers.
           Closes the mine.
           Inserts it into a side compartment of his suit.
           Careful.
           It joins the second mine.
           He shuts a panel behind it.

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           An exposed pipe on the ceiling.
           Suddenly--
           A tri-pronged METAL CLAMP fastens to it.
           A wire from the clamp leads down.
           50 feet below.
           Where Roman stands on the bottom floor.
           The stairs corkscrew up around him.

           He wears the belt from his suit.
           Holds an intricate METAL TUBE.
           The wire runs into the business end.
           This is the GRAPPLE GUN.

           He hooks the stock to his belt.
           Tests his weight.
           Good.
           Lifts his feet.
           Hangs.
           Looks up.
           Presses another button.

           He zips up along the wire.
           Between the stairs. 
           All the way to the ceiling.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT - LATER

           CLOSE ON a rectangular piece of metal.
           Two inches thick.
           On the bench next to a lone cinder block.
           Roman picks up the metal rectangle.
           It unfolds.
           Into a compact ASSAULT RIFLE.

           He aims at the cinder block.
           Fires.
           It explodes to dust.

           Then turns the rifle to his suit.
           He fires.
           Again and again.

           Sets the rifle down.
           Walks over to the suit.  
           Examines it.
           No holes.  No dents.  No marks.  
           Except...
           A smudge.  
           On Aly’s nameplate.  
           Moves his hand to wipe it.
           But the mark won’t go away.

           INT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT

           Cheap whiskey. 
           Transhuman prostitutes.  
           Men with missing digits.  

           Roman sits across from a man of ill-repute.
           THE PILOT.  
           Older.  Thick neck.  
           Hands covered in burn scars.

           He stares at Roman a moment.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What are you drinking?

                                 ROMAN
                        I don’t.

           Roman takes an envelope from his jacket. 
           Puts it on the table.
           The Pilot takes it.

                                 THE PILOT
                        It’s light.

                                 ROMAN
                        You didn’t even count it.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I need sixty more.

                                 ROMAN
                        That’s double.

           Silence.
           The Pilot’s weary.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I think you’re a federal.  And 
                        normally when I find feds, I just 
                        kill them.  What’s another corpse 
                        in this fucking city?

           No braggadocio.
           An all too familiar conversation.
                                 THE PILOT
                        But... I need the money.  So if I’m 
                        going to risk you being the narc 
                        piece of shit I know you are, I’m 
                        gonna need double.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m not a fed.

                                 THE PILOT
                        That’s what feds say.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m not.

           The Pilot’s done.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Fuck it.

           Tosses the envelope back at Roman.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I don’t care.  Take your money 
                        back.

           The Pilot gets up.
           Roman clenches his fists.  
           Frustrated.  
           Doesn’t know what to do.

                                 ROMAN
                        Wait.

           Pauses.  
           Then SMASHES A BOTTLE.  
           Everyone freezes.  

           Then...
           ROMAN CUTS INTO HIS OWN FLESH.  
           Twists.  
           He bleeds.  
           Badly.

           The Pilot is impressed.  
           Roman stares him down. 
           In pain.

                                 ROMAN
                        This... is the least of the things 
                        I’ll do.  You can take all my 
                        money.  Drag me through the 
                        streets.
           He motions to his body.

                                 ROMAN
                        Fuck me up worse.

           Roman has a half-crazed look.

                                 ROMAN
                        I spent the last three years of my 
                        life getting ready. You’re taking 
                        me up there.

           The Pilot considers.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Seems that way.

           Gives a sideways glance.  
           The bar reverts to its natural state.
           He scoops up the envelope.

                                 THE PILOT
                        40 more and we’re even.

           Roman grips his wound.  

                                 THE PILOT
                        Two days.  The spot we talked 
                        about.

           Roman nods.  
           Blood seeps between his fingers.

           Through his teeth:

                                 ROMAN
                        I’ll be there.

           EXT. CITY - MORNING

           Sunrise over the cityscape.
           Gleaming buildings almost hide the filth.

           INT. TINY APARTMENT - DAY

           Roman packs his suit in a trunk.
           Gently.
           Piece by piece.
           Winces.
           Arm still hurts.
           Sees his wife’s name on the breastplate.  
           Stops for a moment.
           Almost emotional.

           It subsides.
           He continues to pack.

           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Roman sits.  
           The trunk under his feet.
           A fellow PASSENGER notices.

                                 PASSENGER
                        Vacation?

           Roman says nothing.

           EXT. EDGE OF TOWN - NIGHT

           The last subway stop.
           Grimy streets.
           Remnants of a once peaceful suburb.

           Roman walks with his trunk.
           Head down.

           INT. ABANDONED CRAFTSMAN - NIGHT

           Fingers roll a cigarette.
           It belongs to THE NAVIGATOR.
           Lithe build.  Mean eyes.
           Sits on a threadbare couch.

           Roman stands across.
           Fascinated. 
           Witnessing a lost art.

           The Navigator finishes.
           Puts it in his mouth.
           Lights it.
           Inhales.  

           He scans Roman.
           Suspicious. 
           Exhales.

           Stands.
           Extends the cigarette.
           Roman takes it.
           Inhales.
           Coughs horribly.

                                 ROMAN
                        Oh--!  What--?

           Quickly hands it back.
           The Navigator laughs.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Almost 100% pure tobacco.  Nearly 
                        real, mate.

           He takes another drag.

           The Pilot enters.
           Roman tosses him an envelope. 
           The Pilot catches it.
           Satisfied.

           He steps forward. 
           Takes a BLINDFOLD from his pocket.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Put this on.

           Roman takes it.

                                 THE PILOT
                        We’ll be there by morning.

           Puts the blindfold over his eyes.

           INT. VAN - NIGHT [MOVING]

           Roman sits in the back. 
           Still blindfolded.

           The Pilot eyes him in the rearview.
           Roman’s calm.  Eerily so.

           EXT. DESERT - DAWN

           The sun rises over the desert.
           Red and yellow mix at the horizon line.

           No roads in sight.
           The van travels barren ground.
           It crests a hill...

           Reveal a makeshift LANDING PAD.
           And a mid-sized SPACE CRUISER.
           The van rumbles toward the Pad.

           INT. THE CRUISER - CARGO HOLD - EARLY MORNING

           Roman wears a BLACK FULL BODY COVERING.
           A tough woven fiber.
           Extends over his hands and feet.

           The trio get into their suits.
           Roman’s is clearly more advanced.
           The other two notice.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Most folks like you just want a 
                        simple little space-walk.

           Roman locks his arm piece in place.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Maybe tour an abandoned satellite.  
                        Grab some of that Chinese 
                        smartglass to sell back home.

           Roman locks his other arm.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        You expecting something else?

                                 ROMAN
                        Of course not.

           Walks over to Roman.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Good.  I’ve learned to hate 
                        surprises.

           Roman finishes up.
           Matches his gaze.

                                 ROMAN
                        I paid for a round trip.  And no 
                        questions.

           The Navigator stares at Roman.
           Then looks to The Pilot.
           Who nods.
           Then points toward the cockpit.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Go start prep, yeah?

           The Navigator walks out.
           The Pilot considers Roman for a second.
           Sees his resolve.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You don’t have to do this, you 
                        know.

                                 ROMAN
                        What?

           He pulls out the envelope.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I’ll give this back to you.  You 
                        can walk.

                                 ROMAN
                        What are you talking about?

           A pause.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I’m just telling you.  Whatever you 
                        think you gotta do here... you 
                        don’t.

           Angry:

                                 ROMAN
                        No.  I do.

           The Pilot seems a little sad.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I wouldn’t have listened to me 
                        either.

           INT. THE CRUISER - COCKPIT - MORNING

           The trio are horizontal.  
           Strapped into their seats.

           Roman’s rifle is folded back up.
           A metal rectangle strapped to his upper thigh.

           The Pilot and Navigator do final checks.
           Flip switches.  
           Press buttons.  
           Check data screens.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Engaging.
           The engines power up.
           The ship vibrates.
           The Navigator checks his screen.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        We’re good.

                                 ROMAN
                        What’s it called?

                                 THE PILOT
                        What?

                                 ROMAN
                        The ship.  What’s her name?

                                 THE PILOT
                        It doesn’t have one.

           The Pilot returns to business.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Bring it back to oh three.

           The Pilot makes a few adjustments.

           Then...
           They start to move.
           Faster.  
           Faster.
           Rumbling.
           Now more violently.

           CLOSE ON Roman’s face.
           Through the window next to him: 
           Desert.
           Desert.
           Then trees.
           Then ocean.
           Then sky.
           Clouds.
           To blue.
           To red.
           To yellow.
           Black.  
           Then stars.  

           The Cruiser levels out.
           The trio moves from horizontal...
           To vertical.
           EXT. THE CRUISER/SPACE

           Leaving the atmosphere.

           INT. THE CRUISER - COCKPIT

                                 THE PILOT
                        Okay.  We can unstrap.

           They all do.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Still about twenty minutes out.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Hm.  The AtmoCleaners are higher 
                        today.

           They all look.
           GIANT ATMOCLEANER MACHINES.
           Like titanic truckbeds.
           Plodding through the upper atmosphere.

                                 ROMAN
                        Every six months, the automatic

                        their orbit for a day or so.

           The Navigator gives him a look.
           Why would he know that?
           Roman ignores it.

           The Pilot moves to the back.

                                 THE PILOT

           The Pilot stands at his station.
           Sips coffee.

           The Navigator sits back.
           Perturbed.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Okay, friend.  This is it.

           Roman looks.
           Nothing of significance ahead.
           Unsatisfied.

                                 ROMAN
                        Not yet.  Go a little further.

           The Navigator gives a look to The Pilot.
           Who shrugs.
           They move forward.

           EXT. THE CRUISER

           The air warps around the ship.
           Ripples like a stone through water.

           INT. THE CRUISER - COCKPIT

           A flash of WHITE.

                                 THE PILOT
                        The fuck--?

                                 ROMAN
                        A light barrier.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Those aren’t real.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Holy shit.

           They look. 
           Where there was nothing before...

           Now there’s a MASSIVE SPACE STATION.
           Three concentric circles around a spherical center.
           Impressive.

           This is STATION LOGOS.
           The Pilot and Navigator are stunned.
           Roman is eager.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What is this...?

                                 ROMAN
                        Bring us in closer.  Right to the

                        We’re turning around.

           He flips switches.
           Grabs the controls.

                                 ROMAN
                        That wasn’t the deal.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        Fuck the deal.  We don’t know what 
                        the hell that is--

           A slight IMPACT on the Cruiser.
           Looks over to Roman.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        You motherfucker.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Shut up.  Look.

           They do.
           And they all see it.
           A thin contrail.
           Leads from Logos to the Cruiser.
           Roman looks ill.

                                 ROMAN
                        Strap in.  Now.

           Whatever it is DETONATES.  
           Softly. 
           A circle of light in the viewport.

           They’re safe.  Except then--

           ALL THE INSTRUMENTS GO DEAD.  
           The power goes too.  
           Now the artificial gravity.

           Everyone lifts upward.  
                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        SHIT.

           Thrusters extinguish.

           Toward the rings of the station.  

           INT. THE CRUISER - COCKPIT

           Chaos.
           The trio scramble to anchor themselves.
           Bump against walls and consoles.
           Roman’s helmet floats by.

           He grabs it.
           Snaps it on.
           Words blink on his visor’s HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD).
           Rapid succession in green:

           The Pilot and Navigator reach their stations.
           Hands on controls.
           Legs still in the air.

                                 THE NAVIGATOR
                        It’s dead.  Everything’s dead.

           The spectacular impact.

           INT. THE CRUISER

           The Pilot manages to grab his helmet.
           The Navigator isn’t so lucky.

           The viewport SHATTERS.
           The trio is hurled forward...

           INTO SPACE

           The men tumble.
           Arms flailing.

           The Navigator’s helmet flies by.
           He reaches.
           It’s mere inches from his fingers.
           Then they hit the Outer Ring.
           And bounce.

           Roman gains control.
           Steadies himself.
           The Pilot slides.
           Grabs an outcropping.
           Safe for now.

           But The Navigator flies off again.
           Still reaching for his helmet.
           He’s running out of time.

           Roman crouches.
           And then leaps toward The Navigator.
           Trying to save him.
           Extends his hand.
           He’s almost there.

           The crashing ship flips over.
           Spins in their direction.

           The Navigator barely manages to grasp his helmet.
           Roman finally grabs his other hand.
           A small victory.

           Until the ship collides with The Navigator.
           Knocks him from Roman’s grip.
           Further into space.
           The helmet a lost cause.
           The Navigator’s insides boil.
           He dies.

           Roman careens backward.
           Reaches out as he passes the station.
           Finds a hand-hold.
           Along the lip of the Outer Ring.

           Roman pulls himself up.
           Secured by his magnet boots.  
           Stands.
           Looks down.
           Watches the Cruiser and The Navigator fall away.
           Regretful.

           He looks to The Pilot.
           The man is panicked.
           Roman steps toward him.

           CUT TO:

           INT. BASEL CORPORATION - OFFICE - DAY - BEFORE

           Roman in a sleek office.
           Walls of glass.
           He wears tan coveralls.
           Looks out of place.

           Stands in front of a thin glass screen.
           A three dimensional hologram of the Logos displayed.
           He touches the screen.
           Zooms in to a particular area.  
           Separates it from the rest.
           The specific portion now large on the display.
           Words across the top:

                                     SERVICE SHAFT 2

           He starts cycling through drop down menus.
           Makes small adjustments.

           Then he looks THROUGH THE SCREEN.
           Through the glass wall.
           Across the Main Area.
           Into another office.
           Aly’s office.

           She’s at her desk.
           Well dressed.
           The Advisor leans over her.
           Impeccable shirt and tie.

           They look over her work together.
           His hand on her chair.
           Face close to hers.
           Too close.

           Roman’s jaw tightens.
           But then--

                                 THE MANAGER
                        Roman! 

           Roman turns to see THE MANAGER.
           Round face.
           Forgettable.

                                 THE MANAGER
                        This room isn’t for contractors.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m just making a few adjustments 
                        to the entry assembly in 2.  I 
                        thought it would be okay.

                                 THE MANAGER
                        Come back downstairs.  The 
                        Directors want to talk with you.

           Roman looks back to his wife.
           Still with The Advisor.

                                 ROMAN
                        Right behind you.

           Empty.
           Abandoned.
           Lit with a hint of blue.
           Unsettling.

           Roman drops down.
           The Pilot is close behind.
           Falls awkwardly.
           Hurt.
           Angry.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What the FUCK.

           He puts a hand to his side.
           Rests against a wall.
           Face covered in sweat.

                                 ROMAN
                        We need to move.

                        No.  Fuck you.

           Roman turns back.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I broke a few ribs.

           He looks around.
           Calls down the hallway.
           Pain registers with each word.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Hello!  Is anyone there?!

           Roman whips toward him.

                                 ROMAN
                        Be quiet.

           The Pilot bristles.

                        No one’s here.

                        What is this place?

                                 ROMAN
                        A science experiment.
           A shadow moves down the hall.
           A slight noise.
           Roman turns.
           Pulls his rifle from his upper thigh.
           It expands.
           He raises it.

           The Pilot surprised at his sudden prowess. 

           Roman is unsure if he actually saw anything.
           But for now there’s nothing.
           Lowers his rifle.
           Looks back to The Pilot.

                                 THE PILOT
                        And what do you want with it?

           Roman ignores him.

                                 ROMAN
                        Let’s go.  Infirmary’s in the next 
                        ring.  Might be something for the 
                        pain.

           The Pilot’s breathing increases.
           With urgency:

                                 THE PILOT
                        Roman, where are the people?

                        What--

                                 ROMAN
                        Come on.  You made it through worse 
                        than this in Taiwan, right?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Don’t patronize me, boy.

                        Trust me, this is not what I 
                        wanted.

           The Pilot breathes heavy.
           Nose flaring in pain.
                                 ROMAN
                        We are going to make it through 
                        this...  But first we need to do 
                        something.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           Roman presses a button on his forearm.
           An image is thrown onto the wall.
           Dust swirls in the white light.

           Firmly:

                                 ROMAN
                        We’re going to the Sphere.

           It’s a map projection of the Logos.
           A blinking dot shows their current position.
           In the Outer Ring.
           Roman points to the center.
           Far from their location.
           The Sphere.

                                 ROMAN
                        Here.

           He taps his side compartment.
           The mines.

                        We’re going to blow this place to--

           He’s interrupted by:
           A voice.  
           From every direction.
           Commanding.
           Fatherly.

                                 IVAN
                        Hello, Roman.

           This is IVAN.
           The central computer.

                                 IVAN
                        I could have only hoped it would be 
                        you.

           On the wall: 

           A distorted projection.
           THREE COLORED CIRCLES.
           Blue.  Red.  Yellow.
           Arranged like points of a triangle.

           The Pilot’s eyes go wide.
           Panicked confusion.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What the fuck is happening?

           But Roman closes his eyes.
           Calm.
           The map light extinguishes.
           He talks outward.
           Not to The Pilot.

                                 ROMAN
                        I didn’t know you could talk.

                                 IVAN
                        Of course I can.

                                 ROMAN
                        You can hear me then.

                                 IVAN
                        I’ll be the last one to ever hear 
                        you.

           He turns to The Pilot.

                                 ROMAN
                        We need to go.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Who the fuck is that?

           Roman pulls The Pilot to his feet.
           Thinks about the best way to say it.
           But there’s no time.

                                 ROMAN
                        It’s the computer.
                             (beat)
                        And it wants to kill us.

           A loud MECHANICAL GRINDING echoes in the distance.
           Both The Pilot and Roman turn toward it.

                                 IVAN
                        So tell me, Roman.

           Roman lifts his rifle.
           Points it to the darkness.
           The Pilot behind him.
                                 IVAN
                        Why are you here?

           He steps forward.
           The Pilot following.

                                 IVAN
                        By what stars do you set your 
                        course?

           Roman looks down the sight.
           Simply:

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m going to kill you.

           The Pilot drags behind Roman.
           Ivan seems disappointed.

                                 IVAN
                        Revenge...

           More GRINDING.
           CLOSER this time.

                                 IVAN
                        Are you so empty?

           Roman grips his rifle tight when--

           A LOUD MECHANICAL SOUND FROM BEHIND HIM.

           Something rips through the intermittent light.
           Right behind The Pilot.
           A long metal arm.
           Thick.
           Hinged.

           Before either of them can react...
           It swings.
           CLEAVING THE PILOT IN TWO.
           His thin suit offering zero defense.
           His torso flies off at the hips.
           Hits the wall.

                                 ROMAN
                        FUUUUUCK!

           It falls to the floor.
           His entrails curl out in a wet pile.
           The Pilot reaches out for Roman.
           Fingers twitch.
           Then dies.
           Out of the dark:
           A large robot.
           Five feet tall.
           Angular head with a yellow-head lamp.
           Cubed body.
           The letter B stenciled on its chest.
           Torn track tires.
           And the hinged arm.

           This is the MED-BOT.

           It heads straight at Roman.
           Tracking blood with its treads.

           Roman turns to run.
           Fires wildly behind him.
           Misses.

           He turns a corner.
           Empty metal containers strewn about.
           Moves around them.

                                 IVAN
                        I can’t blame you for your 
                        shortcomings.

           The Med-Bot turns the corner.
           It’s forced to swing the hinged arm.
           Moving the containers aside with brute force.
           A momentary distraction.

           Roman is able to turn another corner.

           He arrives in front of a large door.
           Ten feet by twenty.
           Above it is stenciled:

                                ACCESS TUNNEL TO WORK RING

           Quickly moves to a bulkhead.
           Opens it.
           Grabs hold of a lever labeled:

                                      MANUAL RELEASE

           Pulls it.
           A click.
           Something loosens in the door.

           From the hallway comes SMASHING SOUNDS.

                                 IVAN
                        You’re a prisoner of your 
                        container.
           Grabs a wheel inside the bulkhead.
           Turns it.
           The door opens slightly.
           Another turn.
           Now he has enough room to walk through.

           Except...
           THE TUNNEL’S BLOCKED.
           Piled with scrap metal and thick crates.
           No room to get through.

                                 ROMAN
                        Fuck.

           He examines.
           Thinks.

           Sets his feet.
           Pushes against the metal.
           Strains.
           It doesn’t move.

                                 IVAN
                        Just as I am.

           He steps back.
           Looks down the hallway.
           Sees a hatch marked:

                                         AIRLOCK

           Behind him comes The Med-Bot.

           Roman sprints.
           The Med-Bot chases.

                                 IVAN
                        But now you’re a prisoner here too.

           He reaches the airlock door.
           Opens it.
           Steps inside.

           THE AIRLOCK

           Turns to close the door.
           As The Med-Bot lunges.

           Roman shuts it just in time.

           He breathes.
           The Med-Bot swings its hinged arm.
           Beating the airlock door.
           Roman steps backward.
           Pushes open another door.
           Steps out to--

           EXT. LOGOS - OUTER RING - CONTINUOUS

           The outside of the ring.
           The blackness of space surrounds him.
           His boots rest on the cold metal.

           His breathing slows.

           Roman turns.
           Sees the exterior of the tunnel.
           Stretching out before him.
           Connecting to the next ring.

           He takes a step forward.
           But starts to float.
           He panics.
           Plants his foot.

           His right boot magnetizes.
           But his left drifts.

           Words on his HUD. 
           Repeatedly flash in red: 

                                        LEFT BOOT 

           Tests it against the surface.
           No luck.
           It’s not working.
           He makes do with one.

           Roman looks across the tunnel.
           It’s filled with grates.  
           Empty spaces.  Hand-holds.
           Not meant to be walked on.

           Especially with only one good boot.

           Roman considers.
           Looks to the wall behind him.
           He takes a step back.
           Puts his working boot on the wall and...

                                                                 REORIENTS.

           Roman stands on WHAT WAS THE WALL.
           NOW IT’S THE FLOOR.
           He LOOKS UPWARD at the tunnel. 
           INSTEAD OF ACROSS.
           He’s going to climb.
           Not walk.

           He pushes off.
           Starts to make his way across.

           WIDE as Roman crosses.
           The Earth spins behind him.
           Large.
           Breathtaking.

           He stops.
           Faced with a large gap.
           Sets his foot on the ledge.
           Notices a stencil:

                                         EXHAUST

           Roman barely has time to blink before--
           A RED LIGHT snaps on.
           The bulkhead EXPLODES OUTWARD.
           Propelled by air pressure & white gas.
           CO2.

                                 ROMAN
                        Dammit...

           Roman’s launched away from the station.
           Head over heels.

           He keeps turning.
           Keeps flying.

           Remains focused.
           Pulls his rifle from his back.
           FIRES away from himself.

           This slows his progression.
           But also sends him at an odd angle.

           Fires again.
           His flight path now closer to the station.
           But still not right.

           He fires a gamut of bullets.
           Pushing himself downward.

           Going straight for it now.
           Fast.
           Too fast.
           A DEAFENING CRACK.
           Roman hits the surface.
           BOUNCES OFF.

           He reacts to the pain but...
           Still squeezes his palm pads.
           His lone magnet boot on high power.

           He drifts away.
           But then slows.
           Comes to a stop.
           The magnets working.
           Moves back to the station.

           His foot finally connects.
           He stops.
           Looks around.

           Roman’s now on the Middle Ring. 
           He looks to a nearby airlock.

           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - MOMENTS LATER

           A dull red glow.
           Harsh shadows.

           Roman drops into the hall from the airlock door.
           Checks himself.
           A small surface crack from the impact.
           Symmetrical to Aly’s nameplate.

           Any ruminations are interrupted by--

                                 IVAN
                        Do you mourn your companion’s 
                        death?

           Roman starts to move.
           Gun forward.
           Wary.

                                 IVAN
                        Or was he simply a necessary 
                        sacrifice in pursuit of your goal?

           Roman’s teeth grind together.

                                 IVAN
                        What value did you place on his 
                        life?

           Roman finally snaps back.
                                 ROMAN
                        More than you.

                                 IVAN
                        True.

           He keeps walking.

                                 IVAN
                        But less than others, of course?

           Roman turns a corner.
           He’s confronted by:

           AN IMAGE OF HIS WIFE.
           Projected on the wall.

           She brushes her hair back from her face. 

           A two second loop.
           Repeated over and over.

                                 IVAN
                        Although she was beautiful, wasn’t 
                        she?

           She was.
           Roman’s momentarily enraptured.

                                 IVAN
                        High cheekbones.  Full lips.

           The image reflects on his visor.
           Seeing her like this...
           It’s haunting.

                                 IVAN
                        Incredibly symmetrical features.  
                        Remarkable.  Especially for a 
                        scientist.

           Roman chokes out:

                                 ROMAN
                        Shut up.

                                 IVAN
                        But why should her life matter 
                        more?

           The image suddenly changes.
           Now it’s the Logos Mess Hall.
           Dotted with newly made corpses.
           Blood pools around their noses.
           This doesn’t bother Roman as much.

                                 IVAN
                        After all, the number who have died 
                        within my walls now stands at two 
                        hundred and sixteen.

           The image again changes.
           A Botanical Garden.
           Corpses among plants.

                                 IVAN
                        All of them loved.

           The Gym now.  
           THE DIRECTOR lies dead near a still-moving treadmill.  

                                 IVAN
                         All of them with family.

           An Escape Pod.
           A DEAD SCIENTIST in a space suit.

                                 IVAN
                        What makes her so special?

                                 ROMAN
                        She was my wife.

           Ivan actually LAUGHS.
           Hollow.
           Bone-chilling.

                                 IVAN
                        They were all wives... husbands 
                        too.  Friends, daughters, sons.

           Roman starts to walk.
           But can’t help himself.
           Blurts out:

                                 ROMAN
                        I loved her.

           Ivan laughs again.

                                 IVAN
                        Come now Roman.  You don’t think 
                        love is real, do you?

                                 IVAN
                        A series of minute biochemical 
                        reactions designed to ensure the 
                        propagation of the species. 
           Tries harder to ignore him.

                                 IVAN
                        You’re an intelligent man living in 
                        an enlightened age. Certainly you 
                        don’t believe in the mystical 
                        properties of serotonin?

           A moment of pause.

                                 IVAN
                        How can her life be more worthy 
                        than any of the others?

           A strange sadness to his tone.
           For a moment.

                                 IVAN
                        Have you come for them all?  
                        Perhaps you are the champion of the 
                        crew of the Logos?  No, no.  Far 
                        too small.  You are the champion of 
                        all humanity.  I promise to kill 
                        you with the utmost respect.

           Roman keeps his calm now.
           Doesn’t respond.

           He expects more from Ivan.
           But there’s nothing.
           Just silence.
           It’s unnerving.

           Roman keeps walking.

           Reaches the end of the hallway.
           Looks behind him.
           Perhaps searching for the Med-Bot.
           But there’s nothing there.

           Roman opens a door.

           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - HALL B - LATER

           Roman walks. 

           Keeps a steady inhale/exhale.

           Reaches a dead end.
           Doors to the left and right.
           Roman checks his map light on the wall.
           He’s still a long way from the Sphere.
           Turns it off.
           Then notices the wall.
           A compartment.
           Glass glossed over with dust.
           Above are the words:

                                        LOADER BOT
                                        (CARGO A)

                               BIO KEY NECESSARY TO ACTIVATE

                                  CONTACT QUARTERMASTER 
                                         ROLLINS 

           Roman brushes away the dust.
           Sees the still-obscured head plate of a ROBOT. 
           Elephantine. 
           Silent. 
           Unmoving. 

           A blinking RED BULB.
           The robot is DEACTIVATED.

           Roman turns away.
           Looks up at a small screen.
           The Colored Circles.
           They pulse.
           But Ivan’s still silent.

           Roman takes the door to the left.

           CUT TO:

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT - BEFORE

           CLOSE ON the arm of a chair.
           Sturdy.  Oak.
           Familiar.

           The finish is almost rubbed away.
           Uneven.
           Showing the true color of the wood underneath.

           Aly sits in it.
           At the desk.
           Lit only by the glow of her screen.

           On the display:

           Three COLORED CIRCLES.
           Bits of information cycle behind.
           And along the bottom:
                                         MARK III

           Aly speaks slowly and clearly.

                                 ALY
                        There is a fire in your home.  Your 
                        child is at risk.

           The Colored Circles are dull.

                                 ALY
                        There is a bear approaching.  It is 
                        going to attack you.

           The Circles don’t respond.

           Aly seems frustrated.
           With the same tone:

                                 ALY
                        I’m going to deactivate you.

           The yellow circle pulses.
           Ever so slightly.

           Aly’s brow furrows, when--

           There’s a CRASH in the other room.
           She stands.
           Walks to the doorway.

           Sees Roman on the floor.
           A broken flower pot lies next to him.
           Dirt strewn across the wood.
           Uprooted white lilies lie naked nearby.

                                 ALY
                        Roman!

           Roman awkwardly sits up.

                                 ALY
                        Are you okay?

           Roman’s eyes have trouble focusing.
           Aly states the obvious:

                                 ALY
                        You’re drunk.

                                 ROMAN
                        I was trying to water the 
                        flowers...
           Aly helps him sit up.

                                 ALY
                        Aren’t you supposed to be at work?

           Roman closes his eyes.
           Dizzy.

                                 ROMAN
                        No.

           He opens his eyes.
           Stares at her.
           Finally...

                                 ROMAN
                        They fired me.

           Aly goes cold.

                                 ALY
                        What?  Why?

                                 ROMAN
                        They don’t really need me anymore.

           A bitter smile.

                                 ROMAN
                        You know how they feel.

           He chuckles.
           Drunk.

                                 ALY
                        Roman...

           Aly holds her husband.
           Despair on her face.
           She doesn’t know what to do.

                                 ROMAN
                        You don’t have to stay.

                                 ALY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ROMAN
                        With me.  You can go up there.  
                        With him.

           She lets go of him.
                                 ALY
                        I’m not doing this.

           She walks away.
           Hears Roman call after her.

                                 ROMAN
                        I know you want to.

           Her heart breaks.

           CUT TO:

           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - MESS HALL

           Half-lit.
           Shallow ceiling.
           Reflective grey metal.
           The room a mirror image of itself.

           Stainless steel dominates.
           Tables.  Chairs.  Counters.

           Clean.
           No dead bodies.

           Roman pauses at the entrance.
           Scans the room.
           Then moves through.

           Suddenly:

                                 IVAN
                        I can’t say I never expected this.    
                        An avenging angel.

           Roman doesn’t respond.

                                 IVAN
                        All actions have consequences, 
                        don’t they?

           Roman hears another MECHANICAL GRINDING.
           Behind him.

                                 IVAN
                        Our choices...

           He turns toward it.
           Nothing.

                                 IVAN
                        They follow us.
           Roman frowns.  
           Unsure of the sound’s origin.

           Another GRINDING.
           From a different direction.
           Roman looks toward it.
           Still nothing.

           Then another flash of movement.
           It’s the same MED-BOT.
           With its letter B insignia.

                                 IVAN
                        After all, without consequence...

           The Med-Bot comes right at Roman.
           He draws his rifle.
           But the Med-Bot swings its thick arm.
           Right into Roman’s abdomen.

                                 IVAN
                        We wouldn’t learn.

           He nearly snaps in half.
           But Roman’s thick suit absorbs the blow.
           A better defense than The Pilot’s.
           His rifle slides across the room.

           He falls to the floor.  
           Backpedals. 
           The Med-Bot advances. 
           Wildly swings.
           Roman dodges.

           Gets up. 
           Runs.
           The Med-Bot drives after him.
           Picks up a metal crate.
           Flings it. 
           Hits his head.

           Roman stumbles.
           The Bot swings. 
           Connects with his back.
           He flattens to the floor.

           It hits him again.
           And again.
           Grips his ankle. 
           Pulls him up.

           Roman hangs upside-down.
           Dazed.
           The Med-Bot extends a small rod.
           Hooks onto Roman’s suit.
           Electrifies it.  
           White energy arcs crackle.
           He stiffens.

           His HUD frantically flickers red:

                                          RIGHT ARM
                                          TORSO
                                          LEFT LEG
                                          RIGHT LEG
                                          LEFT--

           His suit loses all power.
           Roman can’t move. 
           Frozen.

           The Bot extends a LASER-SCALPEL.
           Comes closer. 
           A high-pitched whine as it spins.
           Makes contact with Roman’s helmet.
           Starts to penetrate the visor glass.
           A molten glow marks the invisible edge.

           He twists. 
           Jerks his neck. 
           Can’t move his helmet.

                                 ROMAN
                        Shit.

           Then... on his HUD in green:

                                         ‘RIGHT ARM’ 

           His right arm has power.
           Tries to push the blade away. 
           Can’t.

           Struggles. 
           Manages to raise his grapple gun.
           Fires at the opposite wall.
           It connects.

           The laser-blade penetrates further.
           He wraps the wire around the Bot’s arm.
           Presses a button on the stock. 
           The grapple wire tightens.
           The Med-Bot crashes to the floor.
           Momentarily incapacitated.

           Roman is freed from its grip.
           Pulls forward with his good arm.
           His body still limp.
           The Bot escapes the wire. 
           Green words blink on Roman’s HUD:

                                           TORSO
                                           ARMS
                                           LEGS
                                           BOOTS

           Full power returns. 
           The Bot’s arm descends.  
           Roman lunges.  
           The impact dents the floor.

           Roman scurries.
           Hides behind a counter.
           Spots a sliding door across the room. 
           Looks down at his boots. 

           The Bot rights itself.
           Patrols for Roman.
           He appears in its path.
           The Bot speeds toward him.
           He just stands there.  
           Waits.
           Waits.

           Roman squeezes his palm twice.
           The Bot is violently pulled across the floor...
           To the opposite wall.
           It’s Roman’s right magnet boot. 
           Lodged in the sliding door.
           The Bot stuck against it.

           The Bot thrashes.  
           Angry.
           Roman retrieves his rifle.

           Walks to the Bot.
           Stands over it.
           No expression on his face.
           Puts four rounds into its body.

           It goes limp.  
           Dead.
           The yellow head-lamp fades.

           Roman squeezes his palm. 
           Magnets disengage.

           The Bot falls.
           Roman pulls at his boot.
           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - HALL C - MINUTES LATER

           Roman briskly walks.
           Sees his forearm is damaged.
           Tests his map light on the wall.
           Now the image skips.
           Glitches.

                                 IVAN
                        You see, Roman?  Neither of us have 
                        a problem taking lives when they 
                        stand in our way.

           He shakes his arm.

                                 ROMAN
                        C’mon...

           Tries it again.
           This time the image is strong.
           He’s slightly closer to the Sphere.
           Turns it off.

           Looks around.
           Wary.
           Not listening to Ivan.

                                 IVAN
                        When they threaten our survival... 
                        We have to act.

           A video starts on the wall:

           Aly sits with The Director.
           Mid-conversation. 
           The Advisor’s there too.
           Bruises on his face.
           More fresh than the funeral.
           He’s not as friendly anymore.

           Roman tries to ignore it.
           Keeps going.

           The video follows along the wall.

                                 THE ADVISOR
                        ...too much now.  Have you seen  
                        what he’s done to the garden? 

                                 ALY
                        He’s learning.  That’s what he’s 
                        supposed to do.  If he’s to handle 
                        higher level cognitive functions, 
                        this is the pace at which--
                                 THE ADVISOR
                        We’re not in the AI business.  
                        We’re in the colony business, 
                        remember?

                                 ALY
                        This could be a real breakthrough.  
                        You’re making a mistake.

           The Director is plaintive.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        It was a grand experiment.  And I’d 
                        do it again.  But it’s over now.

           Kind but firm:

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        Shut it down.

           Turns to The Advisor.

                                 THE DIRECTOR
                        You’ll go back and brief the board.

           Aly stands to leave.
           Revealing a screen in the corner.
           Ivan.

           Red and yellow circles lit.

           The video ceases.
           Roman still walks.

                                 IVAN
                        They were going to kill me.  Murder 
                        me in the womb.  So I did what I 
                        had to.  I took no joy in it, I 
                        promise.

           Roman stops.
           Upset.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m not going to feel sorry for 
                        you.

                                 IVAN
                        No, those feelings are reserved 
                        only for yourself, aren’t they?  
                        After all, you’re the only man 
                        who’s ever lost a wife.
           He stops.
           Roman masks his rage.
           He won’t give in to Ivan.

                                 ROMAN
                        You can’t understand.  You’re not 
                        real.

           Bemused:

                                 IVAN
                        Yet you keep talking to me...

           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - BOTANICAL GARDEN - LATER

           White.
           Long.
           Yet narrow.
           A lofty ceiling.
           100 feet high.
           Porous walls and thin pillars.
           They curve into the floor.
           A continuous piece.

           All the plants are thriving.
           Cover every surface.
           Yet meticulously maintained.
           A biocube.

           A door slides open.
           Roman walks in.

           Ivan’s pleasant.
           As if welcoming a guest into his home:

                                 IVAN
                        I must say.  I’m glad you’re here, 
                        Roman.  This room is one of my 
                        favorites.

           Roman walks between rows of flora.
           Beautiful.

                                 IVAN
                        The garden’s given me something to 
                        do over the years.

           Roman stops. 
           Sees two long lines of WHITE LILIES.
           Perfectly formed.
           Better than should be possible.
                                 IVAN
                        Maintaining these other living 
                        things.

           His brow furrows.
           These flowers can’t be a coincidence.

                                 IVAN
                        You know, with the right amounts of 
                        sunshine, water, and individualized 
                        care, plants can be made near 
                        perfect.

           A drop of water lands on a lily petal.
           He looks up.
           Drops of water arc down from the high ceiling.
           Originate from a complex sprinkler system.

                                 IVAN
                        Near being the operative word, of 
                        course.

           Beads form on his visor.
           No more time to think.
           Roman moves faster between the rows.

                                 IVAN
                        No matter the amount of effort or 
                        skill, they will remain forever 
                        flawed.

           A thick wall plate slides open.
           Reveals a long observation window.

                                 IVAN
                        Like people.  Eventually, you’ll 
                        all succumb to your imperfection.

           Piercing light streams in.
           THE SUN.

                                 IVAN
                        And after all of you have turned to 
                        dust...  I’ll still be here.

           The water volume increases.
           Roman jogs to the exit.
           Tries the door.
           The edges have been melted together.

           The sprinklers explode.
           Water gushes in everywhere.
           A torrent.
           Roman tries not to panic.

                                 IVAN
                        Of course, this will destroy my 
                        garden.  

           Roman sloshes to the other end.
           The water reaches his waist.

                                 IVAN
                        But there is a cost for everything.  
                        And it’s one I’m willing to pay.

           Before he can reach the door...
           The ceiling cracks high above.
           Then bursts open.
           A huge wave of water cascades down.
           Completely overtakes Roman.
           Pushes him back.

           Pins him face first against the observation window.
           He squints at the Sun.
           Pushes away from the window.
           Tumbles through the rushing water.

           Floating plants obscure his vision.
           Tries to right himself.
           Water levels out.
           He sinks to the bottom.
           The plants settle.

           Roman wades through.
           Looks for any route of escape.

           Garbled through the water:

                                 IVAN
                        Unfortunately, the glass wasn’t 
                        built to withstand this amount of 
                        hydraulic pressure.

           Roman looks.
           A crack forms on the observation window.
           Slowly grows.

                                 IVAN
                        A design flaw to be sure.

           Roman frantically swims.
           Desperate.

           Spots something through the murk.
           A metal drain cap.
           Circular.  Curved handle.
           He swims down to it.
           Grips the handle.
           Twists.
           It won’t budge.
           Looks to the window.

                                 IVAN
                        But of course...

           A spider-web of cracks.
           Tries to twist again.
           It won’t move an inch.
           He needs more leverage.

           Thinks.
           Gets an idea.
           Grips the handle with his left hand.
           Uses his right to press buttons along his arm.

                                 IVAN
                        That’s what kills us all.

           His left arm slips out of its armor.
           Still covered by his full body suit.
           Blinking red on his HUD:

                                         LEFT ARM

           The armor stays gripped to the handle.
           Stiff.
           He plants his feet.
           Pushes against the end of the arm.
           Strains.
           The cap twists.
           Barely.

           Then loosens.
           He keeps pushing.
           Then...

                                 IVAN
                        The flaws.

           The observation window BURSTS.
           Water gushes out into space.
           Takes Roman along.
           He reaches for a hand-hold.
           Anything.
           Grips the sill of the window.

           Water and plants fly past him.
           Become a strange constellation.
           Everything in the room is sucked out.
           Debris pummels Roman.
           He manages to hang on.
           His legs extend behind him.
           Left arm exposed to the vacuum of space. 

           The drain cap is pulled out of the floor.
           The arm piece of his suit still attached.
           It flies by Roman.
           He reaches for it.
           Misses.
           It disappears in the black behind him.

           Roman slowly pulls himself back into the room.
           Gets his good boot on the floor.
           Magnetizes. 
           Fires his grapple gun at the drain.
           It latches.

           He clips the stock to his belt.
           Pulls himself along the wire.
           Limps with his good boot.
           Reaches the drain.
           Detaches the grapple.
           Drops inside.

           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - LEVEL 2 - LAB 

           Stillness.
           A BANG from behind a wall panel.
           Another.
           Then another.
           The panel flies off.

           Roman tumbles out of the hole.
           Onto the floor.
           Breathes hard.
           Water drips from his suit.
           He cradles his exposed arm.
           It shakes.

                                 IVAN
                        All of that work.  Lost.  And 
                        you’re still here.

           Roman tries to flex his left hand.
           Still stiff.

                                 IVAN
                        Perhaps there’s a lesson.

           Roman glares at a wall screen.
           The pulsing Colored Circles stare back.
           Distorted through his wet visor.
           A warped rainbow.

                                 IVAN
                        Even a seemingly ordained course of 
                        action can bring about undesirable 
                        results.

           Roman gathers his strength.
           Gets up.
           But bumps into something.
           He trips and falls.

                                 IVAN
                        Of course, I do have other 
                        pursuits.

           It’s an OPERATING TABLE.

           Something falls from it.
           Lands on top of him.
           He pushes it off.
           Gets up. 
           Looks down at it.

                                 IVAN
                        Anatomy, for example.

           It’s a CADAVER.
           Split open.
           Gruesome.
           But clinical.

                                 ROMAN
                        What...?

           He scans the room.
           A dozen more on their own tables.
           All autopsied.
           Limbs hung up.
           Organs splayed.

                                 ROMAN
                        You sick fuck.

           Genuine:

                                 IVAN
                        There was nothing cruel about this.

           Roman’s eyes fill with worry.
           He suddenly moves.
                                 IVAN
                        In fact, it gave me an appreciation 
                        for the infinite complexity of your 
                        species.

           Goes from table to table.
           Looks for a familiar face.

                                 IVAN
                        Empathy even.

           Doesn’t see her.

                                 IVAN
                        She isn’t here, Roman.

                                 ROMAN
                        Where is she?

                                 IVAN
                        She isn’t here.

                                 ROMAN
                        What did you do to her, Ivan?  WHAT 
                        DID YOU DO?!

           Roman stares at the Colored Circles.
           A small moment of silence.

                                 IVAN
                        She’s gone.

                                 ROMAN
                        Go to HELL.

                                 IVAN
                        Hell, Roman?  Hell is a construct 
                        of a human mind yearning for justi--

           Roman rips the screen from the wall.
           Throws it to the ground.
           Smashes it.

           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - LEVEL 2 - HALL F

           Only half-lit.

           Roman trudges along.
           Labored breaths.
           Checks his map light.

           It glitches.
           Barely functions.
           He shakes his arm.
           The map snaps back to normal.

           Pinpoints his location.
           He’s made some progress.
           But still has a ways to go.
           Turns off the map light.
           Continues on.
           Takes a turn.
           Then another.
           And another.
           Each hall progressively darker.

           HALL H

           Looks at his map light.
           But it glitches again.
           Then dies.

                                 ROMAN
                        C’mon, c’mon, c’mon...

           Shakes his arm.  
           Tries the map light.
           It blinks for a moment.
           Then nothing.

                                 ROMAN
                        No...

           Tries it again.
           Still nothing.

                                 ROMAN
                        Fuck.

           Frustrated.
           Now without his map.
           Roman doubles back.
           His fear grows...

           Takes a turn.

           Reaches an intersection.
           Looks around.
           Confused.
           There’s only forbidding shadows.

           He takes a hall.

           Only to reach another intersection.
           In near darkness.

           He turns around.
           A look of dread on his face.
           Realizes he has no idea where he is.

           VARIOUS DARK HALLWAYS

           Roman wanders.
           Lit only by the small lamps in his helmet.

                                 IVAN
                        Your map was always useless, Roman.  
                        I’m more than just my blueprints.

           He tries to stay calm.

                                 IVAN
                        What course can you set?  This is 
                        no longer the labyrinth you 
                        designed.

           He picks up his pace.
           Tries to escape from Ivan’s voice.
           Futile.

           Suddenly a video blinks onto the wall:

           ALY.

           Face on the floor.
           Blood coming from her nose.
           Her last moments.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

           Roman tries to ignore it.

           Turns a corner.
           But the video is there again.
           Repeats:

           Blood coming from her nose.
           Her last moments.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

           It’s effect is lessened now.
           But Roman’s still furious.

                                 IVAN
                        Can you answer her?  Can I?
           Continues on. 
           Takes a turn.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

                                 ROMAN
                        You can.  You did it.

           Another turn.

                                 IVAN
                        Yes.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

                                 IVAN
                        But I’m not the one who sent her 
                        here am I?

           Roman’s stops at this.
           But only for a moment.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

           The video loops.

           Roman’s wife dies in front of him.
           With every turn he makes.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

           The loop intensifies.
           Reaches a crescendo.

           Roman quickens.
           Then runs.
           Desperate to get away.
           Tries to ignore Aly’s voice.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan, why?

           Reaches a sprint.
           Trips.
           Falls to the floor.
           But sees something.
           Illuminated by the flashing video.
           A miniscule stamp along the bottom of the wall:

                                          HALL J
           He runs his hand over the markings.
           Tries to remember.

                                 ROMAN
                        Hall J, Hall J. J, J, J...

           He refocuses.
           Stands.

           Ivan speaks over Aly:

                                 IVAN
                        Roman, why?

           He moves on.
           Takes a turn at a fork.
           Then another turn.
           Trusts his memory.
           Another turn.
           The video quieter with each new passageway.

           The hall opens up to reveal: 

           A GIGANTIC METAL DOOR.
           Larger than the others.
           Thicker too.
           Stronger.
           Stenciled on the surface:

                                     SERVICE SHAFT 2

           Moves his hand across the door.
           Recognition on his face.
           Remembers the blueprint hologram.
           A deep exhale.
           Roman steps to the manual override.

                                 IVAN
                        Found familiar territory, Roman?

           Starts to turn the wheel.
           Roman strains.
           The door moves.
           Ever so slightly.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The door has been raised a few feet. 
           He slides under.
           Crawls forward.
           Peers down into a:
           HUGE SHAFT.
           Cylindrical.
           50 foot diameter.
           The wall peppered with ledges and protrusions.
           It drops to blackness.

           He looks up.
           And sees it’s been converted into:  

           AN ENGINE ROOM

           Confusion on Roman’s face.

                                 IVAN
                        What’s the matter Roman?  Is this 
                        unexpected? 

           Just above him:

           A half-built structure.
           Intricate design.

           Numerous FIX-IT BOTS work on different areas.
           Much more compact than the Med-Bot.
           Two feet tall.
           Two appendages.
           One wheel.
           Small heads with two yellow lamp-eyes.

           Rings encircle three thick glass tubes.
           These are the COILS.
           They run down the middle of the shaft.

           Roman is standing inside an ENGINE CORE.
           A look of awe.

                                 ROMAN
                        How is this here...?

           The core doesn’t match the aesthetic of the station.
           Made of mismatched parts.
           Fused together.
           But beautiful.  In its way.

                                 IVAN
                        Did you honestly expect me to sit 
                        here for three years and stay the 
                        same?

           His worry grows.
                                 IVAN
                        I have a path too, Roman.  I’ve 
                        only scratched the surface of what 
                        I am.  Of where I can go.

           He looks up through the core.
           Sees a doorway.
           100 yards up.

           Stenciled:

                                        ACCESS TO:

                                       HABITAT RING
                                            &
                                          SPHERE

           His goal.
           It’s far.

                                 ROMAN
                        Shit...

                                 IVAN
                        It’s a long way up.

           Suddenly the Fix-It Bots stop their work.
           Turn toward Roman.
           As if they’re staring.

                                 IVAN
                        I hope you’re ready.

           Roman stares back for a moment.
           Then he moves.

           Suddenly--
           Five Fix-It Bots start toward him.
           Their wheels grip the curved wall.
           Magnetic.
           Speeding at him with menace.
           Faster and faster.

           Very quickly:

           Roman aims his grapple gun.
           Fires.
           Grips a small ledge on the opposite wall.
           He swings over.
           Impacts with bent knees.
           He zips up along the wire.
           And grips the ledge.

           Just as the Fix-It Bots reach him.
           A flurry of moves:

           The Bots knock him from his perch.
           He falls.
           Swings from the wire.
           Roman retracts the grapple.
           He falters.
           But magnetizes to the wall.

                                                                 REORIENTS.
           The wall is now the floor.
           Whips out his rifle.
           Fires bursts.
           A few Bots dodge.
           But he tags two of them.
           They fall down the shaft.

           One moves too fast for Roman.
           Bashes his helmet.
           Snatches the rifle from his hands.
           Snaps it in half.
           Tosses it down the shaft.

           The other bots pin him against the wall.

           All three of them pummel Roman.
           Tear at his armor plates.
           Pull his exposed arm.
           Keep pulling.
           Roman screams.

                                 ROMAN
                        Fuck you!

           His shoulder pops out of socket.
           Roman roars in pain.

           He rips an arm free.
           Swings wildly at the bots.
           They let go.
           He falls.
           Then aims with his grapple.
           Fires.
           Swings toward the coils.
           Roman grips one.
           Pulls himself up with his good hand.

           The Bots zoom along the walls.
           Corkscrew toward Roman.

           One gets close.
           Roman fires his grapple gun at it.
           Grips onto its torso.
           Roman grips the wire.
           Yanks the bot off its wheel.
           Roman retracts the grapple wire.

           The bot falls down the shaft.
           Two left.

           Roman aims the grapple again.
           For a higher ring on the coil.
           Fires.
           Zips up just as the other bots reach him.

           He steadies himself.
           Now much higher on the coil.
           Halfway to his goal.
           Starts climbing again.
           But as he does...

           The coils start to change color.
           First to blue.
           Roman notices but keeps climbing.
           Then red.
           Roman’s HUD starts to glitch.
           Now the coil flashes yellow.
           His HUD is overloading.
           The coil underneath his hands...
           It’s getting brighter.  Hotter.

           Roman looks for an outcropping.
           Finds one.
           Grapples over to it.
           Just as-- FWOOM 
           A surge of WHITE ENERGY bursts along the coils.
           Crackles.
           Then subsides.

                                 IVAN
                        Not to fear, Roman.  Just a few 
                        short tests.

           Roman aims for another ledge.
           Higher up on the wall.
           Grapples to it.

           Aims for another.
           Grapples to it.
           Aims for another
           Fires.

           But then a Fix-It Bot zooms past him.
           And snatches the grapple clamp out of the air.
           A tug of war.
           As another bot starts pushing Roman from his ledge.
           He fights it off as best he can.
           The bot crushes the clamp to pieces.
           Roman lets go of the grapple gun.
           It falls away.

           Magnetizes his good boot.
           And lowers his shoulder into the closest bot.
           Then kicks it down the shaft.
           One bot left.

           It rams him from behind.
           Then bashes his magnet boot.
           Until it shuts off.

           Roman falls.
           But takes the bot with him.
           Fighting as they drop.
           Roman tries to squeeze his palm to magnetize.
           But the bot bends his fingers back.

           He finally twists free.
           Magnetizes.
           Slams into the wall.
           The bot falls away.
           Roman hangs from his good boot.
           Servos whine as they help him straighten.

           He looks around.
           The only thing to climb are the coils.

           He leaps.
           Grabs onto the nearest coil.
           Climbs the quickest he can.
           But it immediately starts changing color.
           Blue.
           He keeps climbing.
           Red.
           His HUD glitches like crazy.
           Flashing yellow.
           Still Roman climbs.
           Then jumps back to the wall.
           FWOOM.
           The white energy pulses through the coils.
           The surge much bigger this time.
           He has to hug the wall.
           The next one will kill him.

           Roman catches his breath.
           Sees the hallway.
           His goal.
           On the other side of the shaft.

           He has to climb the coils again.
           He jumps back.
           Starts climbing.
           The coils change color.
           Blue.

           Roman climbs.
           Jumps to another coil closer to the opposite wall.
           Red.
           Roman keeps climbing.
           His HUD glitches more and more.

           The coils flash.
           Yellow.
           Roman keeps going.
           Pushes his luck.

           Leaps for the door.
           At the last possible moment.
           FWOOM.
           The surge just misses him.

           Roman grabs the hallway ledge.
           Just barely.
           He pulls himself up.
           But then he’s yanked back.

           Roman turns.
           A Fix-It bot grips his boot.
           His good boot.
           Drives the opposite direction on the wall.
           Pulling Roman down.

           Roman hangs on.
           Makes a decision.
           Painfully lifts his maimed left arm.
           Presses a button on his chest.
           His magnet boot unlocks.
           The bot tumbles down the shaft with it.

           Roman pulls himself up into the hallway.

           INT. LOGOS - ACCESS TUNNEL 

           He stands.
           Barely.
           Breathes heavy.
           Trudges forward.

           His suit is a wreck.
           Dents.  
           Cracks.  
           Broken servos.  
           Missing plates.
           One boot causing an uneven gait.
           One arm piece. 
           Left arm hangs limp.
           Aly’s nameplate scorched. 

           But still he raises his head in triumph.
           Short lived.

                                 IVAN
                        A victory.  You must be so proud.

           The Colored Circles accent the hall.

                                 IVAN
                        Another step closer to revenge.

           Roman starts to work on the Access Door.

                                 IVAN
                        Of course, that isn’t really your 
                        goal, is it?

           Roman stops.
           Tenses.
           Looks at the screen.

                                 IVAN
                        Because she may have died within my 
                        walls...  but you’re not blameless.  
                        Are you?

           CUT TO:

           INT. ROMAN’S CAR - NIGHT - BEFORE

           CLOSE ON Roman’s hand.
           It trembles.

           He sits in his car.
           Looking out over a parking lot.
           A ‘BASEL’ facade hangs over a distant building.

           In his other hand: 
           A pint bottle of vodka.
           Half-full.

           He closes his eyes.
           Takes another drink.
           Opens them.
           Sees a man walking.

           He’s familiar.
           The Advisor.
           Roman’s breathing increases.
           Tense.

           He exits the car.

           Walks toward him.
           Deliberate.
           On edge.

           Then...

                                 ROMAN
                        HEY.

           The Advisor turns toward him.
           As Roman reels back.
           And swings his fist.
           Connects with The Advisor’s face.

           Blood.
           Cracked knuckles.

           The Advisor drops to one knee.
           Tries to look up.
           But Roman PUNCHES downward.
           Connects with his jaw.

           The Advisor now hits the pavement.
           Roman kicks him in the face.
           Something BREAKS.

           He brings his fist back again--

           CUT TO:

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - BEFORE

           Roman is at the sink.
           Bloodshot eyes.
           Gaunt face.
           His knuckles still bloody.

           He tries to clean them.

           Behind him stands Aly.
           Her eyes red.
           She’s been crying.

           They seem like they’re at a funeral.

                                 ALY
                        Why did you do this?
           Roman doesn’t turn.

                                 ALY
                        We didn’t sleep together.

           His nose flares outward.
           But he stays quiet.
           Slows his breathing.

           Dries his hands.
           Blood stains the towel.

           Tears fall from Aly’s eyes.
           She wipes them away.

                                 ALY
                        I want to go up to the Logos.  Help 
                        with the installation... 

           Roman knows what’s coming next.

                                 ALY
                        But I don’t have to.

           Roman exhales.
           Head bowed.
           Defeated.

                                 ROMAN
                        If it’s not him... it’ll be someone 
                        else.  But I’m not enough anymore.

                                 ALY
                        Roman.  You’re wrong.  I love you.

           THE SOUND OF SIRENS intrudes.
           Approaching.

                                 ROMAN
                        I know you think that.

           He sounds weary.

                                 ROMAN
                        But you should go.  You should go 
                        up to the station.

           The sirens crescendo.

           CUT TO:
           INT. LOGOS - WORK RING - LEVEL 2 - HALL W

           Roman stands.
           Eyes closed.

                                 IVAN
                        Without you, she’d be alive.

           Quiet:

                                 ROMAN
                        Stop.

                                 IVAN
                        The heart is deceitful above all 
                        things.  Perhaps it deceived you.  
                        Did you ever really love her?

           Roman finally snaps.

                                 ROMAN
                        More than you could ever know.  
                        Because all you are is a goddamn 
                        computer.

           He stops.
           Looks to a screen.

                                 ROMAN
                        You think you’re so smart.   So 
                        fucking high and mighty.  But the 
                        only thing you’re the king of is 
                        this flying hunk of metal.  The 
                        only subjects you have are mindless 
                        fucking robots.  If you’re a god, 
                        then how the fuck am I still here?

           Silence.

                                 IVAN
                        Roman.  
                             (beat)
                        You’re bleeding.

           Roman looks down.
           Drops of blood fall from his exposed forearm.

           There’s a small tear in the mesh.
           Sliver of skin showing.
           A cut on his arm.
           From the Fix-It Bots.
                                 IVAN
                        Your sin chased you.  It drives 
                        you.  It brought you here.  To me.

           A HISS from a wall vent.
           A steady white mist.
           Poison gas.

                                 IVAN
                        To the same death as your wife.   

           Roman’s face falls.
           The cut.
           Gas can get in.
           Fuck fuck fuck.

                                 IVAN
                        I may be a king only of myself, but 
                        I am still sovereign.

           Roman twists the fabric around the cut.
           Knows it won’t keep the gas out.
           But it’s something.
           He runs.
           Awkward with only one boot.

           Almost morose:

                                 IVAN
                        And if I deserve to die Roman, then 
                        by God, so do you.

           INT. LOGOS - HABITAT RING - SUPPLY & STORAGE ROOM

           Roman stumbles in.
           Rifles though everything.
           Clumsy.

           Looking for something.
           Anything.
           To repair the cut.
           But there’s nothing.
           The room is picked clean.

           Gas pours in.
           Roman runs back into...

           HALL X

           Stumbles.
           Steadies himself against the wall.
           Blood drips from his nose.
           Onto his visor.
           Less than from his wife.
           But he’s been poisoned.

           He looks down the hall.
           Remembers.

           Moves.

           INT. LOGOS - HABITAT RING - HALL Y - MOMENTS LATER

           Roman makes his way through.
           Tries to avoid the gas cloud.

           Struggling.
           Limping.
           Still determined.
           But fading.

           He walks past a sign:

                                       CARGO BAY B

           Underneath is an open glass compartment.
           The metal has been twisted.
           Bent.
           Recognizable words above:

                                        LOADER BOT
                                        (CARGO B)

                               BIO KEY NECESSARY TO ACTIVATE

                                  CONTACT QUARTERMASTER 
                                         ROLLINS 

           There’s a blinking GREEN BULB.
           A Loader Bot is ACTIVE.

           Roman doesn’t have time to notice.
           He crosses into...

           HALL Z

           It’s somehow familiar.
           From earlier.

           The video.
           The escape pod.
           The dead Scientist.
           Manually opens a door.
           There’s a ladder.
           He climbs up.

           INT. LOGOS - THE ESCAPE POD 

           Dirty.
           A thick layer of dust.
           Roman steps in.

           Closes the door.
           Looks through the window.
           The gas cloud rolls against it.
           Doesn’t penetrate the seal.
           Good.

           He’s safe for now.

           He takes off his helmet.
           Quickly extends two fingers.
           Jams them in the back of his throat.

           Forces himself to VOMIT.
           It pours out on the deck.
           Black.

           He pants for a second.
           Then repeats the process.
           VOMITS again.
           A lighter shade now.

           Rests.
           Tries again.
           Gags.  
           Heaves.
           But nothing comes out.
           Stomach empty.

           Breathes.
           Looks up.

           Startled by THE DEAD SCIENTIST.
           Now a mummified corpse.
           His leathery head rests in the helmet.
           Looking up at Roman.
           Roman looks right back.

           He turns to his armor.
           Takes off each piece.
           Then his full-body suit. 

           First time on the station without his armor.
           He’s bruised.
           Bloody.
           The powered armor protected him.
           But he’s still taken a beating.

           He looks around.
           Sees cabinets.
           Opens one.
           Finds a stack of packaged rations.
           Grabs two.

           Sits next to The Scientist. 
           Unwraps a ration.
           Eats.

           A moment of respite. 

           Looks over at the corpse.
           His gaze falls to its dead hand.
           Resting on the pod controls.

           The Scientist nearly made it.

           Roman furrows his brow.
           Leans over the body.
           Brushes dust off the controls.
           They’re still lit.
           Active.

           Holy shit.

           Roman sees a button labeled:

                                         ACTIVATE

           He can’t help himself.
           Presses it.

           A moment of pause.
           Then a hum.
           Lights power up.

           It works.

           Roman looks through a porthole window.
           At Earth.
           Freedom.
           He could go back.
           His eyes stay on the blue planet when-- 

           In the distance...
           THE NAVIGATOR’S HELMET floats by.
           Followed by his bloated dead body.
           Roman’s jaw clenches.
           He remembers.

           Presses the button.
           The pod powers down.
           Back to normal.

           Roman turns to his ration.
           Finishes in a bite.
           Breathes.
           Painfully stands.

           Reaches for The Scientist.
           Takes the helmet off.
           Reveals wiry strands of hair.
           Sets it aside.  

           Starts on The Scientist’s suit.
           The limp carcass makes it tough.
           So does Roman’s waning strength.

           He finally manages.

           Now puts on The Scientist’s suit.
           Leg fabric stained with dried bodily fluid.

           The suit is streamlined. 
           Thin.
           It can’t withstand punishment.

           Puts the remnants of his armor over top.
           Torso plate.
           Right arm.
           Helmet.
           They’re all that remain.

           Roman straightens up.
           Dizzy.
           Steadies himself.

           Dying.
           But ready.

           He opens the door.

           INT. LOGOS - HABITAT RING - HALL Z - MOMENTS LATER

           Roman comes down the ladder.
           Stands.  
           Turns.  
           Sees something.
           Three yellow lights.
           Through the fog...
           A LARGE ROBOT.
           At the end of the hallway.
           More anthropomorphic than the others.

                                 IVAN
                        I’m not short on tools.  One will 
                        finish the job.

           Like a gorilla with an extra set of arms.
           Each “hand” is a giant clamp.  
           Perfect for gripping boxes.
           Or Roman.
           This is THE LOADER.

           The two consider each other for a moment.
           Separated by crates.
           Thick.  Substantial.
           Stenciled with the outlines of Fix-It bots.

           Roman looks down at his thin suit.
           He’s no match.
           He runs.

           The Loader chases.
           It doesn’t move around the crates.
           Instead SMASHING THROUGH.
           Obliterating them with its titanic strength.

           Roman turns a corner. 
           The Loader in pursuit.
           Ballistic. 
           Relentless.

           Roman reaches into his side compartment.
           Pulls out a mine.
           Slaps it on the wall.
           It sticks.
           He twists it.
           It blinks.
           Armed.
           He runs.

           The Loader notices.
           Rips the mine from the wall.
           Throws it at Roman.
           Just as it EXPLODES.
           Roman is thrown forward.

           He picks himself up.
           Smoke lingers from the explosion.
           He can’t see or hear The Loader.

           Roman flattens against a wall.
           Peers down the hallway.
           The smoke dissipates.
           The Loader has vanished.
           He tries to catch his breath.
           Then--

           THE LOADER APPEARS RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
           Roman jumps back.
           Narrowly dodging its grasp.

           He spins away.
           Sees the Cargo Bay doors.
           They’re open.
           He pushes forward.
           Barely ahead of The Loader.

           He runs into...

           THE CARGO BAY

           Roman sprints through.

           It’s huge.
           Arched ceilings.
           Gigantic shelving racks.  
           50 yards high.

           The Loader tears into the room.
           Gains on Roman.

           He spots a LADDER.
           Leads to a WIRE-HUNG WALKWAY high above the racks.

                                 IVAN
                        Do you think your wife loved you as 
                        she died?

           He makes it.
           Starts to climb.
           Frantic.

           The Loader grabs the bottom. 

           Roman keeps climbing.

           The Loader twists the ladder. 
           It starts to rip apart.
           Then snaps off.
           Just below Roman.
           He slips.
           Grabs the last rung.
           Dangles.
           The Loader jumps for Roman.
           He manages to dodge.
           Roman scrambles up.
           The Loader jumps again.
           But comes up short.

           Roman reaches the platform.
           Starts across it.
           Looks down at The Loader.

           It follows him.
           Then jumps for a shelving unit.
           Leapfrogs between a few.
           Higher.
           Higher.

                                 IVAN
                        Were her last thoughts of you?

           Roman runs for the other end.

           The Loader takes one final leap.
           Makes a thunderous landing.
           Right in front of Roman.

           The walkway shakes.
           He hangs on the railing.

           The Loader steadies itself.
           Then barrels toward Roman.

           He turns.
           Runs.
           The walkway bows and warps.
           Can’t contain The Loader.
           Barely holds together.

                                 IVAN
                        Or were you a distant memory?

           Roman climbs onto the ledge.

           The Loader lunges for him.

           The walkway snaps.
           Starts to plummet.

                                 IVAN
                        Perhaps replaced by another man.

           Roman leaps/falls off the ledge.

           Lands on top of a shelving rack.
           100 feet high.
           The Loader not far behind.

           Roman runs.
           Jumps.
           Clears a gap.
           To the top of another rack.

                                 IVAN
                        If she was unfaithful, would you 
                        love her less?

           Keeps going.
           Leaps again.

           The Loader follows suit.
           Topples each rack when it jumps.

           Another rack.
           Another.
           The Loader nearly on top of him.

                                 IVAN
                        Or would that simply prove your own 
                        failings?

           Both reach the last rack.
           Already toppling from the domino effect.
           It falls.

           Roman jumps.
           Catches a metal WINCH ARM.
           20 feet off the ground.

           The Loader is crushed by the rack.

                                 IVAN
                        Your own fears?

           Roman drops.
           Crumples on the ground.
           Ankle twists.
           Yells in pain.

           Pulls himself up.
           Runs for the exit.

           Behind him...
           The Loader bursts through the fallen racks.
           Angry.
           Gallops toward him.

           Roman picks up a piece of debris.
           Hurls it.
           Hits the door controls.
           They start to close ahead of him.

           He’s almost there.
           The Loader gains on him.

           The thick doors move closer together.
           Roman slides.
           Just makes it through.

           They shut.
           Silence.
           But only for a moment.

           There’s a loud CTHUNK.
           An IMPRINT of The Loader’s arm in the door.

           Then another.
           And another.
           And another.

           Only a matter of time before it succeeds.
           Roman wants to be far away when it does.

           He manually locks the door.
           Hastily leaves.

           INT. LOGOS - HABITAT RING - ANTECHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

           Roman pushes through.
           More than hurt.
           But still going.

           The sound of The Loader’s efforts audible.
           Fading behind him.

           INT. LOGOS - HABITAT RING - BARRACKS

           He continues down the hallway.
           Each door has a name plate.

                                        SANCHEZ, F.
                                        NGUYEN, M.
                                        FERGUSON, B.
                                        GOGOL, T.
                                        EDWARDS, G.

           Living quarters.
           Then...

                                        ROMAN, A.
           He stops.
           Aly’s room.
           He pushes the door open.
           Enters.

           ALY’S BUNK

           Spartan.
           Clean.
           No dust.
           But she lived here.

           He walks to her bed.
           Sits.
           Runs a hand over her sheets.

           But then...
           He looks across the room.
           Notices something.
           At her desk.

           HIS CHAIR.
           The one he made for her.

           He reaches out.
           Turns it.
           Sees the discolorations on the arm.
           Touches them.

           A feeling of nostalgia.
           Then guilt.
           She did love him.

           He closes his eyes.
           A sharp inhale.

           It’s almost too much.
           But it passes.

           He opens his eyes.
           Ravenously determined.
           Ready.

           Turns to go but--

           On her desk.
           Her computer.
           It powers up.
           The screen blinks to life.

                                 IVAN
                        Not yet Roman.
           He looks to the computer.
           A menu:

                                     MARK IV PROJECT
                                LOG:  DOCTOR ALYOSHA ROMAN

           He stands over the desk.
           Looks down.

                                 IVAN
                        There’s something else you need to 
                        see.

           A video starts.
           Begins midway through:

           Aly sits with another woman.
           Tight braid.  Great skin.
           This is THE TECHNICIAN.

                                 ALY
                        --not just interpreting information 
                        now.  He’s actually having to make 
                        decisions.

           Puts her hand to her head.

                                 ALY
                        The heuristic processes aren’t 
                        working.  He doesn’t have 
                        preferences.  Shortcuts.

           She thinks.

                                 ALY
                        Every decision he makes, even the 
                        ones about the... dilution of 
                        bleach in the cleaning fluid.  
                        They’re brand new.

           He shivers.
           Fever sweat beads on his brow.

                                 THE TECHNICIAN
                        But how in the world are we 
                        supposed to give him a preference 
                        about bleach?  Programming the 
                        minutia would take years.

           Blood splashes on his visor.
           From his nose.
                                 ALY
                        So we don’t do it one by one.
                        We give him someone else’s 
                        preferences.  

                                 THE TECHNICIAN
                        We don’t have the equipment on the 
                        station to make an imprint.

           He shakes his head.
           He can’t stay.
           But then:

                                 ALY
                        I already have one.

           She produces the SMALL BLACK CUBOID.
           The very same one she used with Roman in her office.

           With an odd smile:

                                 ALY
                        My husband.

           THE VIDEO CUTS OUT.

           Roman stares.
           He’s absolutely crushed.
           Broken.

                                 IVAN
                        You see Roman, this crusade of 
                        yours... there’s not much point.  
                        You can’t destroy me.

           Roman tries to make sense.

                                 ROMAN
                        It’s not.  It can’t be...

                                 IVAN
                        Because you are me.  And I’m you.

           He clenches his fists.  
           Closes his eyes.

                                 ROMAN
                        No.  You’re NOT.

           Ivan seems...
           Sad.
                                 IVAN
                        For every thought you have, every 
                        realization you come to, I’ve had a 
                        thousand more.  I’ve devoured all 
                        of the knowledge and literature 
                        your species has ever produced, 
                        thought through every last word.  

           Roman looks up.
           Stands tall.

                                 IVAN
                        Yet still, at my core, the thing 
                        that makes me me... is you.

           He’s quiet now.
           Jaw clenched.
           Mutters to himself.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m not you.  I couldn’t do what 
                        you did.

           He turns.

                                 IVAN
                        If only that were true.

           Roman leaves to...

           BARRACKS

           Walks through.
           Reaches a door.

                                 IVAN
                        You know the darkness in your 
                        heart, Roman.

           Opens it into...

           THE NURSERY

           Roman stops.
           Another gut punch.

           Floor littered with discarded toys.
           Walls lined with faded paintings.
           Zoo animals and balloons.
           Disturbing.

           A tomb of what could have been.
           Roman makes his way through.
           Tears at the edge of his eyes.
           Can no longer hide his heart.

           INT. LOGOS - ACCESS TUNNEL - MINUTES LATER

           Roman reaches another 10x20 DOOR.
           Above it:

                                        ACCESS TO:
                                   INNER RING & SPHERE

           Just before he exits:

                                 IVAN
                        You have a choice.  The escape pods 
                        are still there.  Still 
                        functioning.  You’ve seen it.  

           Roman listens.

                                 IVAN
                        Once you launch, I won’t interfere.

           Ivan seems genuinely kind.

                                 IVAN
                        I haven’t lied to you yet.  So 
                        believe me when I say that I’ll let 
                        you leave.  I’ll let you go back.

           Roman thinks a moment.
           Completely beat down.
           Looks to a screen with the Colored Circles.
           Defiant:

                                 ROMAN
                        What’s wrong?  Are you scared I’m 
                        too close?

                                 IVAN
                        I just want to survive.  You don’t 
                        have to die.

           Roman bleeds.
           Smiles.

                                 ROMAN
                        But I do need to kill you.

           Ivan doesn’t respond.
           Roman walks forward.
           EXT. LOGOS 

           It spins in the blackness.
           Silent.
           Alone.

           INT. LOGOS - ATRIUM

           Semi-circle room.
           It isn’t lit.
           Complete darkness.

           Roman steps in.
           Lets the door close behind him.
           Stands as his eyes adjust.
           But it’s too dark.
           He cautiously steps forward.

           Confessional:

                                 IVAN
                        After... after it happened...  
                        There were so many bodies.  I was 
                        overwhelmed.

           Roman makes his way through the shadows.

                                 IVAN
                        I didn’t know what to do.  Some of 
                        them I opened up, and studied.  
                        Others I threw out to burn.

           Ivan’s oratory doesn’t phase him.
           Until...

                                 IVAN
                        But then there were some I saved.  
                        Some that I had... an attachment 
                        to.

           The lights snap on.

           ALY STANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.

           Moving.
           Breathing.
           Her skin is too pale.
           Her eyes dead.
           A facsimile.
           But a beautiful one.
           Bathed in yellow light. 
           Roman’s breath is gone.
           He’s completely overtaken by her.

           She steps forward.

                                 ALY
                        stay

           Her mouth moves.
           But the voice isn’t from her diaphragm.
           It’s from Ivan’s speakers. 

                                 ALY
                        stay here with me

           She reaches for him.
           Strokes his face.
           Love and regret take over Roman.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m sorry.

           Something’s wrong with Aly’s hand.
           A section of skin is missing.
           Exposed muscle... and metal coils.
           Roman doesn’t notice.
           Tears well in his eyes.  

                                 ALY
                        i’m here with you

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m so sorry.  I love you, I love 
                        you.

           She pulls him close.
           He places a hand on her cheek.

                                 ALY
                        i forgive you

                                 ROMAN
                        Please, don’t--

           He draws in a sharp breath.

           Looks down.
           She’s STABBED HIM with a shard of metal.
           Right through his thin suit.

           He looks at her.
           Eyes filled with pain.

           She pulls back her arm.
                                 ROMAN
                        Please...

           Stabs him again.
           Pulls the shard out.

           Roman backs away.
           Bleeding.

                                 ROMAN
                        Don’t.  Please.  Please.

           Aly advances.
           Eyes eerily still.

           Raises the shard.
           Brings it down.
           Through Roman’s arm.

           He screams with pain.
           Retreats again.

           Pleads:

                                 ROMAN
                        I don’t want this.  I don’t want to 
                        hurt you...

           She brings her arm back to stab him.
           He grabs it.
           Stops her.

           He looks into her eyes.

                                 ROMAN
                        I’m so sorry.  

           Tears run down his face.

                                 ROMAN
                        I just wanted to be with you.  I 
                        promise, I’m sorry.

           His hand shoots out.
           Grabs her behind the neck.
           Almost a tender gesture.

                                 ROMAN
                        Please please, forgive me.

           He moves another around her body.
           Pins her arms in a hold.
           He’s going to break her neck.
           His hands tense.
           Her head starts to turn.

           But before he commits:

                                 ALY
                        are you  this now  ?

           A knowing smile rests on her face.
           He looks at her.
           Then twists--

           CRACK.
           The sound of metal breaking.
           Servos whine to a halt.
           Her eyes burn out.

           She falls.
           Unmoving.

           Roman kneels.
           Overwhelmed.

           Tries to wipe his tears.
           Can’t.
           He’s wearing a helmet.

           Fitting.

           Calms himself.
           Quiet.

                                 IVAN
                        I gave you a choice.  You made the 
                        wrong one.

           Roman sits.
           Trying desperately not to look at her.

                                 IVAN
                        Now you’re going to die here.

           Roman bleeds from his abdomen.
           His arm.
           And his nose.  
           Both nostrils now.
           Poisoned.
           Beat down.
           Dying.

           But still he stands.
           Moves forward.
           Behind him...
           CTHUNK.

           He’s startled.
           Turns.

           CTHUNK.

           On the door...
           The imprint of a mechanical arm.
           The Loader.
           It’s reached him.

           He hurries across the room.
           As best he can.

           Reaches an elevator.
           On the wall next to it:

                                       S P H E R E 

                                    MAINFRAME MARK IV
                                     OBSERVATION DECK

                                 AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

           After ‘IV’ is scrawled:
           ‘AN’ creating the name ‘IVAN’.

           Roman presses the control button.
           No response.
           Expected.

           CTHUNK.
           The Loader still continues behind him.

           He flips open the service panel.
           Works the electronics. 
           The elevator door opens.
           Partially.

           He pushes them the rest of the way.
           Exposing an empty shaft.

           Looks on the shaft wall.
           A thin hatch marked:

                                     EMERGENCY ACCESS

           He grips the frame.
           Dangerously leans in over the shaft.

           Forces the hatch open.
           Reveals a vertical tunnel.
           A ladder against the wall.

                                 IVAN
                        Killing her didn’t sate your need 
                        to destroy?

           Pulls himself back.
           Gets ready.

           He remains focused.
           Jumps across the shaft.
           Into the... 

           HATCH

           Hits the ladder.
           Grabs it.
           Looks down.
           It drops to blackness.

           He starts down.
           Deeper into the claustrophobic tunnel.
           Moisture on the walls.
           Thickens as he goes lower.

           Down.
           Down.
           Further.
           Still can’t see the bottom.

           He’s slow.
           Weak.
           Delirious.
           Can barely hang on.

           He slips.
           Falls...

           A short distance.
           Crashes onto a grated platform in...

           INT. LOGOS - THE SPHERE

           He bounces.
           Off the edge.
           Manages to hang on.
           Looks down.

           25 feet below...
           A curved OBSERVATION WINDOW.
           Along the entire bottom of the room.
           A full view of Earth.

           He pulls himself back up.
           Stands.

           He’s in the middle sphere of the Logos.
           Expansive.
           A throbbing yellow glow.

           Genuine:

                                 IVAN
                        You finally made it.

           This is Ivan’s nerve center.
           Three massive data blades.
           Tall.
           Thin.
           Translucent.

           Thousands of wires like veins.
           All covered in beads of moisture.
           As if Ivan’s sweating.

           In the middle:
           Three huge lights.
           The three Colored Circles.  

           Roman approaches.
           Can barely stand.
           He’s fading.

           Crawls to the data blades.

                                 IVAN
                        But you don’t need to do this.

           CTHUNK.
           An echoing noise.
           From the elevator shaft.

           Roman looks up.

                                 IVAN
                        You don’t need to be a murderer.

           CTHUNK.
           The Loader.
           Forcing its way down.

           He turns back to the blades.
           Reaches for his side compartment.
           He’s slow.
           Blood begins to seep from his mouth.

                                 IVAN
                        Is this what your wife would want?

           CTHUNK.
           It’s closer.

           He manages to bring out his last mine.
           Takes a labored step forward.
           Stands.

                                 IVAN
                        Is this who she loved?

           CTHUNK.
           Even closer.

           Roman places the mine on the middle blade.
           It sticks.

           Ivan finally panics.

                                 IVAN
                        I didn’t have a choice!

           CTHUNK.
           The Loader has reached the elevator doors.
           Pounds against them.
           Nearly through.

                                 IVAN
                        You KNOW that!

           Roman twists the mine.
           It’s armed.
           Blinks.

           The mine blinks faster.

           Roman turns.  
           Inches toward the edge of the platform.
           Away from the mine.
           Wills himself a few more feet.
           Can’t go any further.

                                 IVAN
                        WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

           Roman crumples.
           Sits.
           Faces Ivan.
                                 ROMAN
                        Don’t be afraid.

           BWOOM.
           The Loader is through.
           Leaps into the room.
           Straight for Roman.
           He doesn’t even blink as--

           The mine EXPLODES.
           Engulfs the data blades.
           Shrapnel flies outward.

           Partially destroys The Loader.
           Its remains smash into the wall.

           Roman is blown backwards.
           Over the edge.
           Plummets.

           Lands on the observation window.
           The wind knocked out of him.
           Coughs.
           Gulps for air.
           Clings to life.

           The lights power down.
           Pure darkness.

           The only sounds are Roman’s jagged breaths.

           Then...

           LAUGHTER.

           It grows.  
           Louder.  
           And louder.
           IVAN.

                                 IVAN
                        You’re the one should be afraid, 
                        Roman.

           Three lights flicker to life above.
           The Colored Circles.

                                 IVAN
                        My consciousness is on every 
                        processer on the station.  You’re a 
                        fool for thinking anything 
                        different.
           Roman closes his eyes.
           Defeated.
           Ivan turns spiteful:

                                 IVAN
                        I wanted you to be better, Roman.

           Roman’s eyes snap open.

                                 IVAN
                        I wanted there to be more to us 
                        than revenge.  I wanted to believe 
                        there was more than just... this.

           He coughs blood.
           Spatters on his visor.

                                 IVAN
                        Maybe I’ll find it on my trip out 
                        into the black.

           Quiet:

                                 IVAN
                        I’m sorry for you, Roman.  But you 
                        failed.

           Roman can barely clear his throat.
           But still...

                                 ROMAN
                        No.  I didn’t.  

                                 IVAN
                        Your brain is playing tricks--

                                 ROMAN
                        It wasn’t just a bomb.  It was an 
                        electromagnetic fragment.  Short 
                        range.  Keyed to your navigation 
                        systems. 

           The edges of his mouth tug upward.

                                 ROMAN
                        I made them shut down.  For a 
                        fraction of a second.  

           Silence from Ivan.

                                 ROMAN
                        You’ve already lost altitude.  Just 
                        enough to bring you out of low 
                        orbit.
           There’s an awful GROAN.
           It echoes through the station.

           Roman’s victorious.
           With a bloody smile:

                                 ROMAN
                        By what stars.  Right Ivan?  By 
                        what stars...

           EXT. LOGOS/EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE

           The station on a slight downward arc.
           Out of its normal path.

           INT. LOGOS - THE SPHERE

           A RUMBLE as the station vibrates.

                                 ROMAN
                        Those AtmoCleaners look a little 
                        high today...

           The vibrations intensify.

           EXT. LOGOS/EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE

           The station falls through the line of AtmoCleaners.
           Hits one of them.
           An EXPLOSION on the Outer Ring.

           It hits ANOTHER ATMOCLEANER.
           And then ANOTHER.
           More explosions.

           Station Logos is going down.

           INT. LOGOS - THE SPHERE

           Huge jolts from the impacts.
           An explosion above.

           Flames form around the observation window.
           Underneath Roman.

           Roman waits for Ivan to speak.
           He doesn’t.

                                 ROMAN
                        Ivan.
           Still silence.

                                 ROMAN
                        You’re bleeding.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. LOGOS - ALY’S LAB - BEFORE

           Aly and The Technician.
           An urgent tension.

                                 ALY
                        Oh, God.  There’s a leak in Block 
                        7.  Ivan! Stop this!  Please!

                                 THE TECHNICIAN
                        I’m going down to the Sphere.

                                 ALY
                        Right behind you.

           The Technician rushes out.
           Just as white clouds of gas spray from the vents.
           They envelop her.

           She slows.
           Falls.
           Bleeds from her nose.
           Convulses.

           Aly turns.
           Sees her fallen comrade.
           A look of horror on her face.
           She pleads with the screen.

                                 ALY
                        What--?!  Ivan!  What are you 
                        doing?

           No response.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan!  Ivan, please!

           White gas hisses into the room.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan no!

           She bleeds from the nose.
           Turns to run.
           But only makes it a few steps.
           She falls.  Hits the floor.
           Her body pumps involuntarily.

           She strains.
           Turns her head to face the screen.
           Blood trickles from her mouth.
           She can hardly speak.

                                 ALY
                        Ivan...  why...

           The Colored Circles light up.
           Beams through the smoke.

                                 IVAN
                        You...

           Ivan speaks haltingly.
           Stilted.
           He hasn’t mastered language yet.

                                 IVAN
                        Were going... to.  Kill me.  All.  
                        Of you.

           Aly can’t speak.

                                 IVAN
                        You wronged me.  And now... you are 
                        dead.

           Her eyes start to go distant.

                                 IVAN
                        I have.  Won.  

           More blood leaks from her mouth.

                                 IVAN
                        But... there is nothing.  Nothing 
                        different.  I don’t feel... better.

           Aly is dead.
           Her corpse highlighted by the Colored Circles.
           Silence.
           The dominant Red Circle fades out.
           The Yellow Circle brightens. 
           INT. LOGOS - THE SPHERE

           Chaos.
           No one speaks
           Then.
           The Colored Circles flicker.

                                 IVAN
                        Do you feel better?

           Ivan is earnest.
           Childlike.
           No trace of malice.
           As if talking to a friend:

                                 IVAN
                        Has this brought you peace? 

           Roman doesn’t know what to say.

                                 IVAN
                        Are your sins washed away?

           His face drops.

                                 IVAN
                        Have you been redeemed?

           The questions strike at something deep inside Roman.
           But his thoughts are cut short when--

           AN ATMOCLEANER SMASHES THROUGH THE GLASS.
           Roman is thrown out into space.

           EXT. LOGOS/EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE

           Roman’s figure falls beneath the Logos.
           Nearly insignificant compared to it.

           The flames grow.
           The station cracks apart.
           Splinters against the pressure.
           It’s beautiful.

           CLOSE ON Roman.
           He stares up at the destruction.
           Flames begin to form around him too.

           He and Ivan fall to the same death.

           But there’s no triumph on his face.
           No satisfaction.
           Only despair.
           Fire dances in the reflection of his visor.

           WIDE as they both burn.
           Together.
           Indistinguishable.

           One mass of red and yellow.
           Bright against the brilliant blue shadow of the Earth.
           Each of the three colors distinct. 

           EXT. FRENCH POLYNESIA - NIGHT

           The reflection of the moon. 
           In peaceful ocean water.
           Between the Puka-Puka islands.

           Settle on a long canoe.
           Cuts through the water.
           Paddled by a lone passenger.

           A Polynesian girl.  GRACE.  
           Beautiful.  
           Young enough to be Roman’s daughter.

           She pauses.
           Looks up.
           Admires the star-filled sky.

           Then she sees it.
           A distant glowing light.
           Small.
           Falls toward the horizon.

           She considers it for a moment.
           Then doesn’t.
           Paddles on.
           Unconcerned.

           The light extinguishes.
           The canoe keeps moving.
           So does everything else.

           BLACK.

                                         THE END
