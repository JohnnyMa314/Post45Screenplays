           A dark green Cavalier idles roughly in front of a neglected
           three story apartment building.
                                              One of the apartment doors
           facing the street is wrapped in police tape.

           of the Detroit ghetto surrounding him.

           frequently.

                                                                  The
           He turns his attention to a nearby playground where three
           little black CHILDREN play amongst broken beer bottles,
           condom wrappers, syringes, and tin foil crack pipes.
           children run and laugh without a care in the world.

           Parker cracks a smile and rolls down his window to listen.

           unswivels the cap, and takes a quick pull of its contents,
           cringing slightly as he swallows his medication.
                                                              He turns

           Parker frowns and checks his watch.
           reaches into his glovebox, and removes a Glock 19.

                                                   He locks his car and
           As he gets out of his car, he lifts the back of his coat and
           tucks the pistol into his waistband.
           walks towards the apartment building.

           oversized clothes... hand-me-downs that don’t appear to have

           cheeks are speckled with a blizzard of dry snot.

                        In his room.
                                     I think he’s sick.
                                 PARKER
                        Why do you think that?

           Tavarus SNIFFLES and wipes his nose onto his cheek.

                        yelled it at him but he still

                        I don’t know; lets go see him.

           Parker enters.

                                                  Parker grimaces and
           The two walk through the apartment.
           lifts his arm, burying his nose in the crook of his
           elbow. The floor is littered with fast food wrappers and
           dirty clothes.

           Tavarus’ older sister, JANESSA, 10, is asleep on the
           couch. The baby, MIETA, is in the other room crying and
           wailing as if in some kind of horrible pain.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        What’s wrong with your little
                        sister?

                                 TAVARUS
                        I think she’s hungry but I don’t
                        know what to feed her.
                                               I looked
                        but I didn’t see nuthin.

           The two walk up to the open door of the master
           bedroom. Tavarus’ father, JAMES HALEY, 42, is slumped over
           on his lazyboy. Tavarus begins to lead Parker into the
           room. Parker grabs his shoulder.

                                 PARKER
                        Stay here Tavarus.

                                           He glances back at Tavarus,
           Parker walks up to James as Mieta literally SCREAMS her
           lungs out in the background.
           who stands in the doorway nervously picking at the door
           frame.

                        yesterday.

                                 PARKER
                        I see... do me a favor buddy, wake
                        your sister up and both of you get
                        dressed okay?

                                 TAVARUS
                        Okay Mr. Jode.

           He turns back to face James, who sits amidst the makings of
           a heroine escape; the burned spoon, the melted wax stub
           which used to be a candle, and the needle with the depressed
           plunger.

           Parker walks up to James, who wears sweat pants and a dirty
           tank top. His eyes stare blankly at the ceiling and a
           leather belt dangles from the chair’s armrest.

                                                 As he does he stares at
           Parker feels his neck for a pulse.
           James, a storm raging behind his eyes.

           He removes a tiny bottle of Purell from his coat pocket,
           squirts some onto his hands, and vigorously rubs them.

           He removes his Samsung and and dials 911.
                                                        It RINGS twice.

           Parker hangs up and walks into the baby’s room.
                                                             He stands
           there for a moment, frozen, as he stares at the screaming,
           scraggly-haired infant thrashing about.

           Parker reaches into her crib and gently embraces her.
                                                                   Her
           cries subside as she’s slowly lifted towards him, grasping
           his thumb with her tiny hand.

           EXT. ST. JOSEPHINE PROJECTS - DAY

           Parker, carrying a large polyester jacket, walks past police
           cars and various crime scene investigators with ID cards
           dangling from lanyards.

           He walks over to the playground, where Tavarus sits on a
           rusted swing set dangling over a mound of filth.
           wipes his cheeks.

                                 TAVARUS
                             (sniffling)

                                 PARKER
                        Hey buddy.
                                    I uh... brought you
                        this. It was your father’s and
                        I... I thought you might like to
                        have it.

           Tavarus’ eyes well up.

                                 TAVARUS
                        I don’t want it.

                                 PARKER
                        Sure?

           Tavarus nods. He glances at the jacket then immediately
           looks away, as if the mere sight of it physically hurts
                                                                 He

           slips his peacoat off.

           Tavarus, shivering, gets up out of the swing and Parker
           drapes his coat around him and buttons it at the neck.
           draped around him like a cape.

           Tavarus looks over at his father’s coat, which lies crumpled
           on the ground, and lets out an angry YELL.
                                                         He picks up a
           stick and begins beating his father’s jacket as he CRIES.

           WHOOMPH! WHOOMPH! WHOOMPH!

           Parker watches silently, shivering.
           forever, Tavarus, with nothing left, turns to face him.

           EXT. ST. JOSEPHINE PROJECTS - NIGHT

           Parker, illuminated by the pale glow of grafitti-covered
           streetlamps, walks towards his car at a brisk clip.
                                                                 His
           arms are wrapped around himself and he exhales thick plumes
           of frosty mist.

                                         One of them holds a car stereo,
           The two boys that had called him a cracker earlier appear,
           walking back the same way.
           the other a prybar.

                        Whatup cracka, we just stole your
                        stereo.

                        And you ain’t gonna do shit you
                        bitch-ass punk.

           Parker looks out at his car and sees that the passenger
           window is shattered. In the blink of an eye he pulls his
           Glock.
                                 HOODLUM #2
                        Oh shit!

           They turn and make a beeline towards a clutch of nearby pine
           trees.

                                 PARKER
                        Stop! Hey!

           Parker frantically weaves in between snow-capped pines as he
           gives chase. The boys drop Parker’s stereo as they hop a
           chain link fence. Parker, WHEEZING, reaches the fence as
           the boys dissapear past a crack den covered in gang symbols.

                                                           He gets in,
           He tucks his piece back into his waistband and picks up his
           stereo. He turns and heads back to his car.
           turns on the heat, and places his stereo atop shattered
           glass on his passenger seat.

           A torrent of freezing air rushes in as he drives off into
           the darkness, cursing the kids who broke his window.

           Parker pulls up to a small bungalow in a dimly lit
           neighborhood. He exits his vehicle clutching a large brown
           grocery bag.

           Parker slips his shoes off and carefully positions them on
           the linoleum at a ninety degree angle next to the front
           door.

           Parker, in his socks, glides across the beige carpet like a
           water lizard so as not to disturb the perfect line pattern
           left behind by the vacuum.
                                         He does not walk on the vacuum

           removes a bottle of Cutty Sark and a large tub of crumbled
           blue cheese, which he puts in the fridge.

                                                 Later, he wipes all of

           He brushes his teeth one tooth at a time then rinses and
           spits with Listerine.

           pillows so that they look just right.

           He turns around and sets his pistol and whiskey on the
           carpeted floor and he pulls out a blue sleeping bag and a
           pillow from under the bed.

                                         He slides his gun a little

                        Nothing. Just a couple punks.

           She notices the torn wires dangling out of the wiring
           harness where the stereo should be.

                        meth paranoid as hell that some
                        government person is inspecting
                        their house and talking to their
                        children. But here’s the problem,
                        I’m not going to be thinking about
                        the god-damned family jacked up on
                        angel dust, I’m going to be
                        thinking about where my stapler is
                        and where did Stu put it when he
                        was finished and all kinds of other
                        shit and I’ve been telling you
                        since you started working here that
                        I’ve got medical reasons for this
                        shit and every day you come over
                        here and ask to borrow my stuff
                        when you know damned well the
                        supply closet is right over there
                        by Allison’s desk!

           Parker, his face bright crimson, swivels back around in his
           chair.

                                 STU
                        Sorry Parker.

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah you say that every day
                        too. You’re sorry every day.

           EXT. PUSSYCAT LOUNGE - NIGHT

                                      He walks up to the bouncer,
           Parker, carrying a briefcase, walks towards the front door
           to The Pussycat Lounge.
           BLOW-POP.

                                               Black.
                                                       Built short and
                                      True to his namesake, he’s sucking
           Blow-pop is in his mid thirties.
           sturdy, like a pitbull.
           on a grape flavored Blow-pop and his tongue is stained
           purple.

                                 BLOW-POP
                        Whoa Park, what’s in the briefcase?

                                 PARKER
                                             It’s my
                        You know what it is.
                        work. It’s always my work, what
                        else could it be?
                                 BLOW-POP
                        Where’s the piece?

                                 PARKER
                        I left it in the glove box.

                                 BLOW-POP
                        You sure?

                                 PARKER
                        What do you mean am I sure of
                        course I’m sure.

                                 BLOW-POP
                                          Are you
                        Seriously Parker.
                        sure-sure?

                                 PARKER
                        I don’t have patience for this
                        right now.

                                 BLOW-POP
                        It’s just you know we can’t have
                        another incident like last month.

                                 PARKER
                        I’m well aware.

                                 BLOW-POP
                        I know it was completely justified
                        and that’s why the owner said you
                        could come back.

                                 PARKER
                        You tell me that every time I come
                        here.

                                 BLOW-POP
                        I know. The boss said I have to.

                                 PARKER
                                        It’s annoying as
                        Well you don’t.
                        shit.

                                     His lips curl into a mischievous
           Blow-Pop looks amused.
           grin.

                                 BLOW-POP
                        So when you gonna ask her out?

           Parker swallows the lump in his throat.
                                 PARKER
                        Who?

                                 BLOW-POP
                        Everybody knows man.

           A beat.

                                 PARKER
                        Fuck you Blow-pop.

           INT. PUSSYCAT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           Parker walks past throttling BOOTY MUSIC, through a plume of
           cigarette smoke, towards a corner booth as far away from the
           stripper stage as possible.

                                       He removes a bottle of Purell and
           He brushes the seat off.
           some travel tissues from his briefcase.

           He squirts down the tabletop, wipes it clean, then squirts
           and vigorously rubs Purell onto his hands.

                                                        Dahlia is
           He looks up and locks eyes with Ashley’s mother, DAHLIA
           PEREZ, 27, the stripper dancing on stage.
           gorgeous beyond belief, with soft curves and firm edges in
           all the right places.

                                               He breaks eye contact and
           She flashes him a nervous smile.
           removes stacks of paperwork from his briefcase.

           The paperwork is sorted into different stacks.
                                                            There are
           police reports, social services investigations, financial
           reports from the county, client files, and various memos.

           He pulls a small spray bottle of Febreeze out of his bag,
           sprays it onto the booth, then sits down.

           The cocktail waitress, LETICIA WILLIAMS, 22, saunters over
           wearing a Cheshire grin.

                                 LETICIA
                        You’re so funny with your spray
                        bottle baby.
                                     You come to see me?

                                 PARKER
                        Actually, I came to see you and
                        Dahlia. Leticia I need to speak
                        with you about this police report I
                        have here.
                                 LETICIA
                        Police report?

                                 PARKER
                        Yes. The report says that your
                        three-year-old was found at four in
                        the morning more than two blocks
                        away from your home.

           Leticia’s grin vanishes.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Well? Is this true?

           She defiantly clicks her tongue.

                                 LETICIA
                        Sometimes little Juantavius gets
                        out. Ain’t shit I can do about
                        that.

           Parker holds the report up.

                                 PARKER

                                 LETICIA
                        We clear.

                                 PARKER
                        Good.

           A beat.

                                 LETICIA

                                    I got other customers

                        you know.

                                 PARKER
                        I’ll have a scotch.

                        Make it a double.
                        I need to speak with her when she’s
                        finished with her set.

           INT. PUSSYCAT LOUNGE - NIGHT

           We TRACK Parker as Leticia leads him through the club to a
           private dressing room in the back.

           INT. PUSSYCAT LOUNGE STRIPPER DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the dressing room where Dahlia is freshening up.

                                 LETICIA
                             (to Dahlia)
                        He wanna to talk to you.

           Dahlia’s back is to us but her reflection stares directly at
           Parker. It blushes a bit.

                                 DAHLIA
                        Alright. Thanks L.

                                       Dahlia swivels around in her
           Leticia nods and leaves.
           makeup chair. She’s draped in a red kimono and her
           leopard-print bra and panties peek through.

           Parker GULPS as she blows her bangs aside.

                                 DAHLIA (CONT)
                        Mr. Jode. It’s nice to see you.

                                 PARKER
                                             How have
                        Likewise Mrs. Perez.
                        things been since my last visit?

           She looks down.

                                 DAHLIA
                        I... they haven’t been the
                        best. Ashley told me you drove her
                        to school this morning.
                                                I’m really
                        sorry I put you in that situa-

                                 PARKER
                                    I told her to contact

                                              Just try not
                        It’s fine.
                        me if she needs anything, and I
                        like to keep my word.
                        to let it happen again.

           She looks up and flashes a faint, fleeting smile.
                                 DAHLIA
                        It won’t.

                                 PARKER
                                           You’re very
                        She’s very bright.
                        lucky.

                                 DAHLIA
                        I know. She’s a great kid.

                                 PARKER
                        Ashley mentioned something about
                        Horatio getting out.
                                             I thought he
                        wasn’t supposed to be released for
                        a long time.

           The color drains from her face and she looks down at the
           floor again.

                                 DAHLIA

                                    I’m picking him up
                        Me too. His lawyer proved the DNA
                        evidence had been tampered with or
                        something.
                        thrown out.
                        tomorrow morning.

                                 PARKER
                        Is there anything I can do?

           She stares at him with soft, vulnerable eyes.

                                 DAHLIA
                        I don’t think so.

           EXT. PUSSYCAT LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Parker walks out the front door where Blow-pop is smoking a
           cigarette and playing a game on his phone.

                                 PARKER
                        Later Blow-pop.

                        Later Parker.
                        the car next time.

                                 PARKER
                        How many times do I have to tell
                        you I don’t have it on me.
           Blow-pop looks up from his phone as he exhales a billow of
                                               He motions with his chin
           smoke from each of his nostrils.
           towards the back of Parker’s waist with an amused
           half-smile.

                        you’re gonna carry.
                        Glock is printing through your
                        fleece?

           Parker looks down. The imprint of his pistol’s handle is
           indeed visible.

                                 PARKER
                        Whatever.

                                 BLOW-POP

                        Yeah. Whatever.

           EXT. SMALL BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

                                                 A single upstairs window
           Parker parks across the street from a modest brownstone,
           next to a large, leafless hickory.
           is illuminated and CLASSICAL MUSIC can be faintly heard.

                                        He gets out and takes a few steps
                                                                 He
           Parker turns his car off.
           so he’s standing in the middle of the quiet street.
           removes his flask, takes a large swig, then lowers it.

           He stares up at the illuminated window, his whiskey-laced
           breath condensing as it rolls off his lips.

                                                                 They
           Two curious circles peek through the window drape.
           are shimmering spectacles framed by a thin, shadowed
           visage. We will never see the man’s face clearly.

           Parker and the man stare daggers into each other.

           INT. P.V. MCNAMARA FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY

           Parker walks past a bunch of cubicles and arrives at his
           desk. He takes his coat off and places it on the back of
           his chair. Something on his desk immediately grabs his
           attention.

                                             He adjusts it then scans the
           His laptop is clearly crooked.
           room to see if he can tell who tampered with it.

                                                           In his hand
           Just then Stu walks up, his arm outstretched.
           is Parker’s stapler.
                                 STU
                        Here’s your stapler back.

           Parker stares tractor beams at him.

                                 PARKER
                                            Are you for
                        What the hell Stu?!
                        real?

                                 STU
                        Huh?

                                 PARKER
                        What the fuck did I say?

                                 STU
                        Say about what?

                                 PARKER
                        Did I or did I not say you could go
                        to the supply closet to get a new
                        stapler if you needed one?

                                 STU
                        You did?

                                 PARKER
                                     I said that!
                                                   I made
                        Yes! I did!
                        it perfectly clear!

                                 STU
                        I guess I’m sorry then.

                                 PARKER
                        You guess you’re sorry?!?

                                 STU
                        I didn’t mean it.

           Stu’s arm still dangles in front of him holding the stapler.

                                 PARKER

                                            You know
                        Look Stu. You’re not as dumb as
                        you like to let on.
                        perfectly well what you’re doing
                        and you use this whole Asperger’s
                        shroud to go around and do whatever
                        the fuck you want!

           Stu stares blankly at Parker as he gets up out of his swivel
           chair.
                                    Don’t ever touch
                                                        Do
                                        Say "Yes I
                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        I’m going to make something very
                        clear and you’d better listen very
                        carefully.
                        anything on my desk ever again!
                        you understand?
                        understand you Parker" if you
                        understand.

                                 STU
                        Yes but...

                                 PARKER
                        NO BUTS!

                                             It makes a loud "CLANK" as
                                                      Everyone in the
           Parker snatches the stapler and beams it across the room
           with a violent overhand throw.
           it bursts into pieces against the wall.
           office stares in stunned silence.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

                                                  He turns the water
           Parker stands in front of the sink.
           on. His hands trembling, he removes a few little blue pills
           from a small travel-sized pill container and tosses them
           into his mouth.

           He scoops up a handful of faucet water and swallows his
           medication. He tears some paper towel out of the machine,
           sets it on the counter, then leans over and splashes some
           water onto his face.

           His boss, DOUG MULLINS, 42, with a weak chin and limp,
           blonde hair, walks into the bathroom just as Parker is
           patting his face dry.

                                         I’ve had a hell
                                 PARKER
                        Doug, I’m sorry.
                        of a week and, well.... I’m
                        sorry. It won’t happen again.

                                 DOUG
                        Listen, Parker, you do good work
                        here and it’s clear to all of us
                        that you care a lot about what you
                        do.

                                 PARKER
                                       Like I said, this
                        Thank you sir.
                                            Now if you’ll
                        won’t happen again.
                        excuse me I’ve got a bunch of work
                        to catch up on.
           Parker starts to walk towards the door but Doug rests his
           hand on his shoulder.

                                 DOUG
                        The thing is Parker, you’re
                        expected to behave like a
                        professional.

                                 PARKER
                        Damnit Doug!
                                     How many times have I
                        asked him not to take things off my
                        desk? You know I’ve got a
                        condition I’m trying to deal with
                        and he doesn’t listen no matter how
                        many times I ask nicely!

                                 DOUG
                                               But we both

                                                  Hiring
                        I know Parker, I know.
                        know he’s got... special
                        circumstances of his own.
                        people like Stu is the result of
                        Governor Brenneman’s effort to give
                        people like him a chance at a
                        productive life.

                                 PARKER
                                             Like I said,
                        Right. I know Doug.
                        I’m sorry.

                                 DOUG
                        And I know about your deal too,
                        okay? I’m just trying to satisfy
                        both parties the best I can here.

                                 PARKER
                        Are you going to talk with him
                        too? About touching my stuff?

                                 DOUG
                        I will, but listen Parker, I know
                        first hand how this job can get
                        under people’s skin.
                                             Now I think
                        you’re getting a touch burned out
                        and when that happens we need to
                        rest or things will only get worse.

                                 PARKER
                        What are you saying?

                                 DOUG
                        I’m saying I’m going to have to
                        suspend you for two weeks for-
                                 PARKER

                        I’ll go apologize to him right now
                        alright? There’s really no need to
                        do this I can fix this.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry but my hands are tied
                        Parker, this is company
                        policy. You’re being suspended for
                        two weeks with pay for your
                        outburst. Thank god you didn’t hit
                        anyone with that stapler or I’d be
                        terminating you right now.

                                 PARKER
                        Please don’t do this to me.

                                 DOUG
                        It’s only two weeks Parker.

                        note verifying everything.
                        apologize in front of everyone.

                                 DOUG
                        Look at this as a much needed
                        vacation. I know you don’t want to
                        take time off but you’ll come back
                        re-energized and focused.
                                                  Now how
                        about we go get your things?

           Parker walks around the passenger side of his Cavalier.
           chucks his briefcase and a small cardboard box through the
           broken window.

           In the cardboard box are some travel-sized bottles of
           Purell, Lysol, Febreeze, a box of Clorox Wet Wipes, and his
           broken stapler.

           PLINK! Parker kicks his passenger door as hard as he can,
           denting it. CLANK! PLINK!
                                          CLANK!

           SPED-UP SHIT/SHOWER/SHAVE MONTAGE:

           Parker takes a shit. The toilet FLUSHES.

           Parker drinks from a bottle of Cutty Sark as he
           showers. Columns of steam billow up and engulf him.

                                           The green and yellow bottle of
           Parker, wearing a towel, wipes the condensation from his
           bathroom mirror. He shaves.
           Cutty Sark sits half-empty within arms reach.

           INT. PARKER’S CAVALIER - DAY

           Parker, wearing a tweed suit and burgundy tie, sits at a
           light. The inside of his passenger window has been
           haphazardly covered over with cardboard and duct tape.

                                              The light goes

           holding his phone with the other as wind BEATS and HOWLS

           The phone goes to voicemail.

                        living conditions.

           Parker hangs up.

           The spectacled man sits on a wood chair, staring out from

           hair is slicked back with oil.

           Benelli M3 12-gauge shotgun.

           He motions to his tweed suit, his dark red tie.

           A beat. Dahlia looks like she was caught completely off
           guard. Parker senses this.

                         Can you get her for me?

                                                        As she does
           Dahlia nods. She walks down the hallway.
           Parker stares through the sliding glass door into the
           backyard. A large figure sits smoking a cigarette on a
           painted wicker chair facing away from us.

           Parker does an about face and Ashley’s face lights
           up. Parker smiles back.

                                 PARKER
                        Hey you. Wow, look how pretty you
                        look. Can you twirl around for me
                        like a ballerina?

                        Aren’t you gorgeous.

           Parker whips around. Standing in front of him is HORATIO
           PEREZ, 36.

                                    Everything about the way he moves
           He’s tall, statuesque. A smirking light-skinned man (for
           being hispanic) with aquiline features and long, sandy brown
           hair tied into a bun.
           exudes strength and control.

                                 PARKER

           Parker blinks rapidly.

           Horatio interrupts Parker with a high-pitched LAUGH... he’s
           one of those people who laughs with their whole body.

                                 HORATIO

                                 PARKER
                        You must be Horatio.

           Horatio slithers towards him.

                        What are you doing.
                                            Back up.

                        No. It’s probably mouthwash.

           Horatio smiles ear-to-ear and turns to face Dahlia and
           Ashley. He gestures in dramatic fashion.

                                 HORATIO
                                    He says it’s probably

           Horatio smacks himself on the forehead... "stupid me".
           bursts out with his high-pitched LAUGH again, thoroughly
           amused. He winks at Parker.

                        so.

           Horatio saunters over to the kitchen table and coils onto
           one of the chairs.

           Dahlia nods and dissapears down the hallway and into the
           master bedroom. Horatio looks at Parker.

                        Put your fucking hands up!

           He relents. The gas station attendant FRANKIE, an old black
           man, comes out as Parker shakes them down.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What the hell you doin’ man?

                                 PARKER
                                           Go back

                        You gonna scare away my customers!

           Parker keeps his gun trained on them.
                                 PARKER
                                                      Now
                        You don’t have any customers!
                        go back inside!

                                 FRANKIE

                        Naw! Naw we cool Frankie!
                        for dat!

           Frankie, muttering profanities, reluctantly goes back
           inside.

                                 PARKER
                        At least one of you has half a
                        brain. Alright, step the fuck
                        back! Both of you!

           They take a few steps back.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        I want you to empty your pockets
                        and put all of your money and drugs

           He motions at one of them with his pistol.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        You first.

                        This be some bullshit right here.

           The hoodlum begins emptying his pockets on the sidewalk.

                                 PARKER
                        Flip your pockets inside out when
                        you’re done.

           He does. Parker turns his attention the other one.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Your turn.

           The boy rifles through his pockets and flips them inside
           out. Parker holds a bead and takes a step forward.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Alright back it up.

                                    On the ground in front of Parker is
           They backpedal a bit.
           two wallets, a quarter bag of weed, a vial of crack, and a
           hair pick.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        I’m guessing you were going to
                        smoke the weed and sell the
                        crack. At least I hope you weren’t
                        going to smoke the crack.

                                 HOODLUM #2
                        Naw man, we don’t smoke that shit.

           Parker pops the lid off the vial and flicks it so that the
           crack jettisons out into the snow covered lot.
           stare daggers at him.

                                                  He bends down and grabs
           Parker tosses the empty vial aside.
           the wallets. He rifles through them, removing the cash and
           the ID cards, before tossing them aside.
           He counts the cash, stuffs it into his pocket, and examines
           the ID cards. He the looks at the first boy.

                                 PARKER
                        Jamal Washington.

           He looks at the second boy.

                        Tavian Lewis.

           He puts their ID’s in his pocket.

                                 PARKER (CONT)

                        boys made the right decision.
                        bad news is that there’s only $83
                        bucks here, which isn’t nearly
                        enough to cover my window or my
                        stereo. That means I’ll have to
                        come back and see you until I have
                        enough to cover my expenses.

                                 JAMAL
                        Give our ID’s back man.

                                 PARKER
                        No. I’m holding on to those as
                        collateral.

                                 TAVIAN
                                            Aight?

                        even now so leave us the fuck
                        alone.

                                 PARKER
                        Not until I have enough to cover my
                        window. Now beat it.

           Tavian turns to go but Jamal lingers.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                             (to Jamal)

           Jamal picks up the hair pick and turns to leave.

           Parker seems pleased with how relatively smoothly the
           shakedown went and has calmed down.

           He walks up to the counter with $40 of his newly confiscated
           money. He grabs a Payday and tosses it on the counter.

           KATY PERRY or some other POPPY RADIO TRASH plays through the
           store’s P.A.

           Frankie stares at him like he’s insane.

                        Is you for real?

           Parker COUGHS. Looks at him totally
           straight-faced. Unwraps the Payday and takes a big bite.

                                 PARKER
                             (chewing)
                        Yeah. I’m outta gas.

           Parker slides the $40 over to Frankie’s side of the counter
           and turns to leave.

           Inside the confiscated baggie of weed is rolling
           paper. Parker, shivering, turns his car heater all the way
           up and rolls a joint, licking the paper methodically and
           smoothing it out with his mouth.

                                         He almost immediately seems more
           He lights the joint and holds each puff of smoke in for a
           long time before exhaling.
           relaxed.

           the Music Center and takes a hefty pull from his flask.
           cringes as he puts it back into his coat.

           He approaches the ticket window and buys a ticket from the
           TICKET CLERK, a heavyset black woman.
                                                    Parker walks inside.

           INT. ORCHESTRA HALL/MAX M. FISHER MUSIC CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           We can hear the Detroit Symphony as Parker walks into the
           concert hall.

           INT. PEREZ HOME - NIGHT

           Horatio wakes up. He had fallen asleep on the living room
           couch. He walks over to the kitchen, opens the fridge, and
           grabs the last Corona.

           We hear him close the fridge and lumber towards us.
           takes a deep breath and closes her eyes just as Horatio
           opens her door. His tall, dark silhouette fills up most of
           the doorway. Moments later the door closes.

           INT. PEREZ HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Horatio walks into the master bedroom.

                             (sotto)
                        Okay. Okay.

           He goes for his cellphone, starts dialing, then decides
           against it.

           He walks over to Dahlia’s closet and begins rummaging
           through it.

           in the foreground. In the background, the figure wearing
           the Doc Martens walks towards us.

           It appears to be a very tall woman wearing a charcoal trench
           coat with long, dark red hair.
                                             She wears sunglasses and has
           blood red lipstick on.

           The tall woman continues towards us and enters the phone
           booth.

           Horatio inspects his freshly painted nails while he
           waits. He blows on them delicately.

           It’s dark. Parker sits in the very last row of the packed
           concert hall, cloaked in shadows.
           nobody sees him.

           On stage, brass, strings, woodwind, and percussion blend
           beautifully. The rich, velvety MUSIC spills out into the
           auditorium, where everyone sits completely still, enraptured
           by pure auditory bliss.

           Everyone that is, except for Parker.

           INT. HECTOR’S TOYOTA LAND CRUISER - NIGHT

                                                                 Horatio
           The car pulls into The Pussycat Lounge parking lot.
           flips down the passenger sun-visor mirror, removes his
           sunglasses, and puckers his lips, inspecting his
           make-up. Satisfied, he flicks the sunglasses back on and
           turns to his brother HECTOR who sits in the driver’s seat.

           HECTOR, 22, looks and acts much more mature than his
           age. He’s darker-skinned than Horatio, with a shaved head
           and covered in high-gauge scars.

           He wears a fedora and there’s an ornate tattoo of the Virgin
           Mary, probably a prison tattoo, spilling out from the top of
           his hounds-tooth vest and stopping just below his Adam’s
           apple.
           Horatio turns to face Hector, who has just removed a blunt
           from his vest pocket and is busy lighting it.
                                                           Surprisingly,
           he doesn’t seem the least bit fazed by the fact that Horatio
           is in drag.

                                 HORATIO
                        Wait here.

           Parker fidgets, watching as the orchestra builds to a

           We TRACK Horatio into the back room where a topless Dahlia
           is giving a lap dance to a white, heavyset, off-duty
           COP. The cop, who is still in uniform, notices him.

           Dahlia, straddling the officer, turns and see’s

           He removes his sunglasses and slips them into his trench

           cop’s lap. She grabs her top from off the floor and

           react, Horatio removes an enormous, stainless steel Taurus
           .454 Casull Revolver from his leather clutch, nestles the
           tip of the barrel into the officer’s cheek, cocks the
           hammer, and shoots him point-blank in the face.

           The 250 grain bullet, the size of a AA battery, vaporizes
           the upper two-thirds of the officer’s head into a pink

                        Uh-huh. After I put Ashley to bed
                        I had trouble sleeping so I stayed
                        up reading one of my books and...
                        and you were in bed with me the
                        whole night, asleep.

           Horatio looks at Hector.

           INT. FEDEX STORE - DAY

           Parker walks in eating an Egg McMuffin and carrying a small
           cardboard box. He walks up to the service counter where the
           shipping CLERK, a young white kid wearing a purple visor,
           greets him.

           A wall-mounted flatscreen T.V. plays in the
           background. It’s tuned into the local news station.

                                 CLERK
                        Need help?

           Parker places the small box, its top flaps hanging open, on
           the countertop.

                                 PARKER
                             (chewing, swallows)
                        Yeah I’d like to overnight this.

           The clerk looks inside the box.

           INSERT:

                                    He’s duct-taped and super-glued it
           Parker’s old stapler.
           back together.

           The clerk looks up at Parker.

                                 CLERK
                        You want to mail this to
                        someone.

                                 PARKER
                        Yeah.

                        Uh-huh.

                                 CLERK
                        You know that shipping this
                        overnight is gonna cost at least
                        ten bucks... I mean, the person
                        you’re sending this to could buy
                        two brand new staplers for that.

                                 PARKER
                        I know but I want him to have this
                        stapler... it needs to be this one.

           A beat.
                                 CLERK

                        the cops’ll find out and-

           The clerk shakes his head and goes to type the information
           into the label generator.

                                 CLERK
                        Who’s it going to?

                        Throw that away will you.

           The clerk does.

                                 CLERK

                        The address is on that business
                        card. Turn the volume up will you?

           The clerk grabs the remote and turns it up.

           He slaps a twenty dollar bill onto the counter and flies out
           the door. The clerk yells after him.

                                 CLERK

           lot.

           INT. PARKER’S CAVALIER - DAY

           Parker dials Dahlia as he fishtails out of the parking
           lot. The phone rings a few times and she picks up.

           Dahlia hangs up. She sits on a bench inside the main lobby
           of the police department.
           looks like she hasn’t slept in a week.

                                                                   We
           A SECRETARY walks past with a steaming mug of coffee.
           TRACK her into a nearby interrogation room.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                                                  Across
           The secretary places the coffee in front of Horatio.
           from him sits DETECTIVE TONY BRIGGS, 44, lead homicide
           detective for Detroit PD.

           Briggs is black, an ox of a man with a square jaw and
           squarer shoulders. A man of silent power.

           Briggs, who already has a coffee, takes a sip from his own
           mug. Horatio gestures at his coffee.

                                 HORATIO
                             (to secretary)

                             (to secretary)
                        "Linda"... means "pretty" in
                        Spanish. Hold all my calls until
                        I’m done.

           She nods and leaves. Horatio winks at her then grabs his
           coffee and takes a protracted SLUUURRRPPP.

                                 DET. BRIGGS (CONT)
                        Let’s get down to business, shall

                        It’s atrocious.

           Horatio takes another long, loud SLUUUURRRPP.

                                 HORATIO (CONT)
                        Wow. That is absolutely rank.

           A beat. Briggs isn’t amused.

                        I wouldn’t know.

           Horatio takes another overly dramatic SLUUURRRRPPP of coffee
           and contorts his face.
                                     Det. Briggs ignores the antics.

                                 DET. BRIGGS
                        Your wife says you were home,

           Horatio’s lips curl into his trademark shit-eating grin.

                        Ever cross-dressed Horatio?

                        No?

                                 HORATIO
                        Wait... okay nevermind yes.

                                 DET. BRIGGS

           very dramatic.

                                 HORATIO
                        Wait... no.
                                    No I don’t think so.

                                               He does his best to hide
           The veins in Briggs’ neck bulge.
           his frustration.

           Briggs hangs up. He raises his coffee mug to his
           lips. Takes a sip. Lets the liquid swirl around his

           INSERT:

           A cheap "burner" cell phone has been placed in Horatio’s
           mailbox.

           He sits on the ground across from them.
           trained, he removes his flask, unscrews the cap one-handed,
           and takes a long pull, EXHALING loudly.

           They slowly, warily sit.

           Parker goes to get up.

                                 PARKER

           Parker SIGHS.

                                 PARKER
                        Alright. You know the
                        drill. Empty your pockets.

                                 TAVIAN
                        I told you we broke man.

                                      He fishes it out of his pocket and
           Parker’s Samsung RINGS.
           looks at the caller’s ID through the cracked touchscreen.

                                 PARKER
                                     You crying?

                        okay? Oh.

           He glances at the hoodlums.
                                 PARKER (CONT)
                                                  Where

                        are you? Alright wait right there.

           He turns to leave in a hurry.

           BANG! Parker whips around and fires a shot skyward.
           instant the gun goes off, the boys both cower and YELL like
           girls.

           INT. PARKER’S CAVALIER - DAY

           Parker parks in a half-deserted strip mall across from a
           Rite Aid. He parks two spots over from Dahlia’s Ford
           Ranger.

           He’s wiped most of the blood from his face and a wad of
           tissue pokes out from one of his nostrils.

           Dahlia exits her truck, walks up to his passenger door, and
           gets in.

                                 PARKER
                        Hey.

           Her face is puffy, like she’s been crying non-stop.

                                 DAHLIA
                        Hi. Oh!

                                 PARKER
                        I know. I look like shit.

                                 DAHLIA
                        What happened?

                                 PARKER
                        Nothing. Couple of punks jumped me
                        when I tried to take their money.

           A beat. Dahlia looks confused.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                             (realizing)
                                           I was trying to
                        They owe me money.
                        collect, but they jumped me.
                                 DAHLIA
                        Oh. I think I get it.

           A beat.

                                 DAHLIA (CONT)
                        Well, if it makes you feel better,
                        I’ve seen you in worse
                        shape. Several times,actually.

           A beat.

                                 PARKER
                        Thanks?

           Dahlia lowers her gaze, fiddles with her cuticle.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        So is everything-

           passionately. Kissing is accompanied by heavy petting and
           Parker crawls over to the passenger side of the car.
           is more than happy to make room.

                                                                      He
           She twists and flips her body so that she’s on top of
           him. She reaches down south and fiddles with his pants.
           does the same.

           Straddling him, she reaches down, grabs something, and
           steadies herself for-

                                 PARKER
                             (breathing heavily)
                        Wait.

                                 DAHLIA
                             (breathing heavily)
                        I don’t have AIDS. He doesn’t fuck
                        me.

           A beat.
                                 PARKER
                        Okay.

           A beat.

           Dahlia’s eyes roll back and she PURRRS.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Oh... my god.

           He EXHALES LOUDLY. As Dahlia starts to grinding up and
           down, she instinctively gropes around for something to
           ballast herself.

           EXT. PARKER’S CAVALIER - CONTINUOUS

           OVERHEAD VIEW of Parker’s Cavalier rocking back and forth
           rapidly. We hear MOANING and SEX NOISES as Dahlia’s arm
           shoots out through the makeshift cardboard window and
           latches onto the exterior B pillar.

           Parker settles back into the drivers seat and zips his pants

           slow BREATHS.

                                    We hear QUIET SOBBING.
           He fiddles with his nose-tissue for a second then fishes
           around for his flask.
                                                           Parker looks
           over at Dahlia as she buries her face in her hands and SOBS
           HARDER.

           A beat as the SOBBING continues.
                                               Parker is at a loss.

                                 PARKER
                        ... Was it that bad?

                                        Parker hands her a tissue.
                                                                   She
           She shakes her head "no".
           turns to him, a storm raging behind her eyes.

                                 DAHLIA
                                                 It was
                        Horatio killed everyone.
                        Horatio.

           Parker goes wide-eyed and ashen-faced.

                                 DAHLIA (CONT)
                        It’s only a matter of time before
                        he does something to me and Ashley.
                                 PARKER
                        Where is she now?

                                 DAHLIA
                        At school, but-

                                 PARKER
                        Buckle up!

           He jams his keys in the ignition, starts the car, and stomps
           on the gas. CHIRP-CHHIIIRRRRPPPP-SQUEAAAL!

           INT. PARKER’S CAVALIER - CONTINUOUS

           Parker throttles it down a side road and the car pitches and
           sways.

                                 PARKER
                        As soon as we get there you grab
                        her and I’ll call the cops.

                                 DAHLIA
                        If we go to the cops he’ll kill all
                        of us! He’ll die before he goes
                        back to jail!

           Parker shoots her a frenzied glance.

                                 PARKER
                        I think we’re crossing the whole
                        "He’ll-kill-us-if-he-finds-out"
                        bridge either way, don’t you?!?

                                 DAHLIA
                        He specifically said if I went to
                        the police he’d kill us both.

           A beat.

                                 PARKER

                                    There’s a whole

           GIRL playing patty-cake.

           then reaches into her backpack, which sits by her feet, and
           removes a coloring book and a box of crayons.

           Ashley stuffs her coloring book and crayons in her backpack,
           zips it up, and scampers behind Dahlia to Parker’s

           minivan with his AR15.

           PEOPLE stuck in traffic around them SCREAM and take cover.

           Duke quickly gains ground, and Hector and Company aren’t far
           behind. Parker looks at Dahlia.

                                 PARKER
                        C’mon! Faster!

                                 DAHLIA
                        We can’t!
                                 PARKER
                        You have to!

                                 DAHLIA
                        We’re trying!

           Parker, in an effort to put some pavement between him and
           his pursuers, turns and opens fire on Duke.

           BANG! BANG! BANG-BANG!
                                       BANG-BANG-BANG!

           Duke raises the AR15 to his chin and answers with a vicious
           barrage.

                                 PARKER
                        SHIT! SHIT!

           He turns and runs, taking massive strides, using every ounce
           of adrenalin. He then becomes aware of the fact that he
           doesn’t see Dahlia or Ashley up ahead.

           He turns and spots them and his heart almost jumps out of
           his chest. Dahlia and Ashley are cowering behind a car a
           few spots over from where he was shooting at Duke.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                             (cups his mouth)

                                                 He yanks Dahlia out into

                        MAMI! Don’t hurt my Mami!

           Duke turns and WHISTLES, signaling to Hector that he’s found
           them. Practically frothing at the mouth, he tosses Dahlia
           back onto the pavement, turns, and makes a beeline for
           Parker.

           Hector, Mago, and Bruja reach Dahlia and Ashley.
           we can’t hear him, we can tell by Hector’s body language
           that he’s giving Mago and Bruja an order.
           and Bruja grab Dahlia and Ashley, turn around, and head back
           towards the Land Cruiser.

           Hector takes off after Duke and Parker.

           away.

           EXT. AMBASSADOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON Parker, who’s running on fumes. He’s out of ammo
           and there’s no way he can outrun them. He makes a sharp
           turn towards the bridge’s outer support and slides across
           the hood of a car.

                                 DRIVER
                        What the hell!

           He climbs over a waist-high concrete slab, past a suspension
           cable that disappears into the sky like a giant beanstalk,
           and onto a girder which runs over a mammoth, rusted support
           beam.

           BRRROPPPP-PPPOPPP-PPPOPPP-PPOPPP!

           Duke bears down on Parker, holding a bead with his AR15.

           BROP-POP-POP-POP-POP!

                                 PARKER

           Slugs RAKE the edge of a buttress near Parker’s head and
           bits of pulverized concrete go flying.

           PARKER’S POV:
           Parker stares down into the icy, choppy water of the Detroit
           River roughly 150 below.

                        Fuck it!

           He jumps, his arms and legs flailing the whole way down
           until-

           We see Hector say something to Duke, who nods as Hector

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        What... the... fff-ffuckkk.

           Duke jumps, flies through the air, and SMASHES into the
           river like a giant canon ball.

           SPLAAASSSSSHHHHHHHH!
           A terrible look of realization racks Parker’s
           face. Treading water, he hastily unzips the backpack,
           removes the plastic-wrapped contraband, turns, and launches
           it one-handed.

           The package lands with a SPLASH about twenty five feet away
           in the direction of the shore, which is roughly 40 yards
           away.

           Duke’s head breaks surface as the water froths all around
           him. He wastes no time and immediately begins swiming
           towards Parker.

           OVERHEAD VIEW:

           Parker swims as fast as he can towards the floating package
           as Duke gives chase. Parker is a faster swimmer but upon
           reaching the package he stops, grabs it, winds up, and
           launches shoreward. Once again, it flies roughly twenty
           five feet ahead of him and SPLASHES into the river.

           Each time he stops to throw the package, Duke chips away at
           his lead. After the third time Parker reaches the package,
           he winds up and flings it, but instead of splashing into the
           water, it lands onto the litter-strewn banks of the Detroit
           River with a THUD.

                                      He turns and, using his last ounce
           Parker turns and sees Duke, who’s only about six yards
           behind him and closing.

                                                                   He
           Parker crawls ashore sopping wet and GASPING for air.
           stumbles over to the package, wraps an arm around it, and
           starts huffing it up the riverbank towards the road.

                                                Every time he looks over
           Parker, carrying the package like a football, zig zags
           through the streets and sidewalk.
           his shoulder, Duke is five feet closer.
                                                      Parker turns a
           corner and sprints through an intersection as the light
           turns green.

           Duke, smelling blood, rounds the corner and, seeing Parker
           only fifteen feet away, bolts into the street after him.

           THUNK!... WHOOMPH!

           A red Honda civic PLOWS into Duke, sweeping his legs out
           from under him. He SMASHES into the windshield and tumbles
           up and over the roof before ragdolling onto the street and
           rolling to a stop.

           Parker turns and stares as the Civic swerves and CRASHES
           into a parking meter, causing the airbag to
           deploy. Blinking rapidly, he catches his breath for a
           moment and watches slackjawed as Duke slowly begins coming
           to.

           Parker, in a wild fit, SCREAMS as he sprints back into the
           street towards Duke, who’s just resumed standing, albeit on
           very wobbly legs.

                                                            He
           Duke, waiting for the stars to settle, looks up just as
           Parker tosses the package square at his chest.
           instinctively catches it as Parker lowers his shoulder and-

           WHHUUUMMMPPP!

                                                          The package
           Parker SLAMS into him like a battering ram.
           goes flying and the men careen onto the sidewalk, SMASHING
           into it with a THUD.

           Both men squirm and roll around on the ground but Duke, who
           got the wind knocked out of him two times in rapid
           succession, is clearly in worse shape.

                                                        He monkey-crawls
           Parker sees the Spiderco a few feet away.
           over to it, grabs it, stands up, and limps over to Duke,
           who’s still rolling around MOANING.

                                              Parker pushes his arm
           Parker hunches over him as Duke reaches up and weakly grabs
           him by the scruff of his shirt.
           aside, mounts him, raises the knife high above his head, and
           snaps it down like bolt of lightning.

           CRUUNNCCHHH!
                                 DUKE
                        ARRGGGHH!

           He stabs Duke in the sternum and the knife slices through
           his costochondral cartilage, which connects the rib cage to
           the breastbone.

           Parker rips the knife back out and clamps his hand around
           Duke’s jaw as he struggles to squirm free, blood bubbling up
           from his freshly punctured lung.

           Parker raises the now glistening knife, bears down on Duke’s
           jaw to keep his head from moving, takes aim, and-

                                 DUKE (CONT)
                        AAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!

           With a swift, forceful motion, he jackhammers the blade into
           Duke’s eyesocket, puncturing his eye like a beachball.

           The faint, airy WHISTLE of his eyeball deflating directly
           precedes his horrific, earth-shattering SCREAMS as gobs of
           bright red jelly pour out of his eye and an arc of thin,
           watery blood spurts out of his tear duct like a scarlet
           geyser.

                                                               Parker,
           Parker turns to get up as Duke flails about and paws at his
           freshly mutilated eye, blood spurting everywhere.
           shivering, grabs the package and wipes the knife off on his
           shirt before folding it shut and putting it in his pocket.

           Duke’s CRIES grow more and more distant as Parker limps
           away.

           A telephone RING cuts through the soothing sound of
           CLASSICAL MUSIC. The spectacled man, always in his tuxedo,
           glides past. We RIDE his coat tails as he walks over to a
           cordless phone sitting on a kitchen couter.

           CLOSE ON the back of his head as he presses the phone to his
           ear. We hear a MUFFLED VOICE for a brief moment.

           A long beat.

           A beat, then we hear what sounds like Parker’s GARBLED VOICE
           through the phone receiver.

           The spectacled man slowly turns around and we see his face
           clearly for the very first time.

           awake by car doors SLAMMING.
           looks out his window.

           Hector’s Landcruiser.
           tell by their body language that they’re both
           CRYING. Dahlia, a terrified expression on her face, locks
           eyes with the officer.

           Sensing something just outside his periphery, he cranes his
           neck in SLOW MOTION and sees Hector, who’s just finished
           screwing a silencer onto his MP5.
           that could cut glass, lights him up.

                                    PSSHHH-PSHHH-PSSHHHH.

           The officer looks like he’s having a seizure as dozens of
           cherry-hot slugs shatter the window and burrow into him.

           Parker is. Even sitting we can tell he’s tall and sinewy,
           with prominent cheekbones and a pencil-thin mustache.
                                                                   He
           tightens his black scarf, which drapes down over his tux.
                                                             His skin
           The passenger door flies open and Parker literally dives
           in. He slams the door, tosses Horatio’s package at his
           feet, curls into a ball, and shivers violently.
           has a purplish hue.

                                          He turns the heat all the way
                                         Parker is too weak and
           Marcus inspects him for a long beat, noticing the blood
           stains and ripped clothing.
           up then exits the vehicle.
           hypothermic to notice or care.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS TRUNK - CONTINUOUS

           TRUNK SHOT:

           Marcus opens his trunk.

           MARCUS POV:

           In his trunk is a spare tire with a jack and tire iron and
           an emergency roadside kit.

           He opens the kit, which contains various flares, first aid
           items, a flashlight, water, and one of those reflective
           silver NASA space blankets.

           INT. MARCUS’ OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS - CONTINUOUS

                                               He unfolds the space
           Marcus opens the passenger door.
           blanket and drapes it around Parker, who tries saying
           something but is unable to.

                                                                      He
           He closes Parker’s door and walks around to the driver’s
           side. He gets in, puts the car in gear, and drives off.
           presses a button on the CD player and soft CLASSICAL MUSIC
           wafts into the cabin.

           EXT. MARCUS’ OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS - CONTINUOUS

           As they drive, dark clouds gallop past as day turns to
           night.

           INT. SMALL BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

                                                  A half empty bottle of
           Parker exits the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his
           waist. Marcus sits at his kitchen table meticulously
           cleaning and oiling his Benelli M3.
           brandy sits next to him.
                                 PARKER
                        Is there something I can wear?

           A beat. Marcus, polishing the shotgun’s breach, doesn’t
           take his eyes off his work.

                                 MARCUS
                        Should be.

           INT. MARCUS’ CLOSET - NIGHT

           Pitch black. The door swings open and Parker turns the
           light on.

           CLOSE ON Parker’s speechless expression.

           PARKER’S POV:

           The entire closet is filled top-to-bottom with tuxedo
           shirts, pants, and jackets.

           INT. MARCUS’ KITCHEN - NIGHT

                                                           It fits well
           Parker enters wearing one of Marcus’ tuxedos.
           given their similar height and build.
                                                    Parker sits across
           from Marcus, who’s begun feeding shells into his Benelli.

           In the middle of the table is Horatio’s package, which has
           been cut open along the middle, revealing its contents:
           compressed bundles of hundred dollar bills.

                                 PARKER
                        I had no one else to call.

           Marcus thumbs shells into his shotgun.
                                                     He doesn’t look up.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        I appreciate your help.

           Marcus grabs the bottle of brandy and takes a manly
           pull. He slides it across the table to Parker, who pushes
           it aside. Marcus shrugs and begins wiping down the barrel
           of his gun.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        You know I fantasized about killing
                        you... pretty much all the
                        time. I’d go to the symphony and
                        I’d tell myself "Today’s the
                        day. This’ll be the day I kill
                        that sorry son-of-a-bitch."
           Marcus looks up and stares at him with a detached,
           emotionless gaze.

           A beat.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Aren’t you gonna say something?

           A long beat.

                                 MARCUS
                        I smashed your head to bits with my
                        cymbals. Every time you came to
                        watch me. Popped your head like a
                        coconut.

           Another long beat.

                                                     Then, slowly, he
           A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of Marcus’
           lip. Parker’s at a loss for a moment.
           smiles and lets out a CHUCKLE at the absurdity of it all.

                                                    Cringes.
                                                             Wipes his

           mouth. Looks down into his lap for a long moment.
           looks back at Marcus, his eyes are on fire.

                                 PARKER
                        A little girl and her mother need
                        my help.

           Marcus nods. Parker stands.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Can I borrow your shotgun?

           Marcus stands, cocks the shotgun, and grabs his car keys
           from the tabletop.

                                 MARCUS
                        No.

           Marcus goes to leave.
                                    As he walks out the front door-

                                 PARKER
                        Hey! Hey wait up!

           INT. FORD CROWN VIC - NIGHT

           We stare at Horatio’s front door from inside the shot-up
           Ford Crown Vic parked across the street, the officer’s
           blood-covered body slumped in the immediate foreground.
           We PULL BACK to REVEAL Marcus reclined in the passenger
           seat, hidden from view, his shotgun lying across his chest.

           EXT. PEREZ HOME - NIGHT

                                       He walks up to the front door,
           Parker walks into frame.
           straightens his tuxedo jacket, and KNOCKS.

           Moments later the door flies open and Parker is forcefully
           pulled inside.

           INT. PEREZ HOME - CONTINUOUS

                                                            Horatio,
           Hector THROWS Parker hard against the wall and frisks
           him. Mago and Bruja, both armed, hold a bead.
           Dahlia, and Ashley sit at the kitchen table.

                                                          He shoves
           Hector finds the Spiderco knife but no gun.
           Parker into the kitchen, where Horatio motions for him to
           have a seat.

                                                           He opens a
           Parker pulls the chair out directly across from Horatio,
           who’s going through his AIDS medicine ritual.
           bottle, takes a pill out and sets it in front of him, closes
           the bottle, then moves on to the next one.

           Once all five pills are lined up in front of him, he looks
           up at Parker.

                                 HORATIO
                             (to Dahlia, doesn’t look at
                             her)
                        Go get me a glass of water whore.

           Dahlia, trembling, does as instructed.

                                 HORATIO (CONT)
                             (to Hector)
                        No weapons?

                                                                 Horatio
           Hector walks over and hands him the Spiderco knife.
           flicks it open and runs his thumb along its serrated blade.

                                 HECTOR
                        It’s Duke’s.

                                 PARKER
                        I don’t think he’ll be needing it
                        anymore.

           Dahlia sets a glass of ice water in front of Horatio.
                                 DAHLIA
                             (whisper)
                        Horatio-

                                 HORATIO
                             (to Dahlia)
                        SIT THE FUCK DOWN!

                                          He takes the other four pills,
           He swallows the first pill.
           one by one, while he converses with Parker.

                                 HORATIO
                        You came alone Eagle Scout?

                                 PARKER
                        Yes.

                                                             Mago peers

                                              They scan the area then
           Hector motions to Mago and Bruja with his chin.
           out the front window and Bruja peers into the backyard
           through the sliding glass door.
           turn and nod.

                                 HECTOR
                        Looks like it.

                                 HORATIO
                        You’re either very brave or very
                        stupid. Maybe both.

                                 PARKER
                                           You let them
                        I have your money.
                        go, right now, and I’ll take you to
                        where it is.

                                 HORATIO
                        Or I could kill them while you
                        watch. Then, afterwards, I could
                        kill you too.

           Ashley starts CRYING.

                                 DAHLIA
                             (lips quivering)
                        No te llores, corazon, todo va a
                        estar bien.

           Translation: Don’t cry sweetheart, everything is going to be
           okay.

                                 PARKER
                        I suppose you could, but you’d be
                        out a couple hundred grand.
                                                    See I
                        figure you were planning on buying
                                                    You
                                 PARKER
                        meth with that fifty grand.
                        buy bulk from a local lab, sneak it
                        into Canada, and flip it for a very
                        nice profit.

           A beat as Horatio studies Parker.

                                 PARKER (CONT)
                        Sound about right?

           Horatio smirks. He swallows the last of his medication and
           turns his attention to Ashley, who’s sniveling, trying her
           hardest to be brave. He takes her hand and she steels
           herself.

                                 HORATIO
                             (to Parker)
                        My god, just look at those eyes.

           Parker looks at Ashley, gives her an almost imperceptible
           reassuring nod.

                                                       You

                                        I mean, how could
                                 HORATIO (CONT)
                        Such beautiful green eyes... they
                        sparkle like emeralds, que no?
                        know it’s funny, nobody on either
                        side of the family has green
                        eyes. Hector here used to say all
                        the time he didn’t think she
                        belonged to me.
                        she be my daughter and have eyes
                        like that?

                                 DAHLIA
                        Horatio, you know I would never-

                                 HORATIO
                        SILENCE!

           Dahlia bites her lip as her eyes well up.

                                                        I
                                 HORATIO (CONT)
                        I never used to let it get to me,
                        you know? But the more I thought
                        about it, the more I realized it
                        would absolutely shatter my heart
                        if it turned out I’d been lied
                        to. I was there for her birth.
                        raised her as my own, I gave her
                        everything... I even sent money
                        every week when I was locked up.
                                 PARKER
                        If only all children were so lucky.

           Horatio, staring daggers at Ashley, ignores Parker and
           flicks the knife open.

                                 HORATIO
                        But now, every time I look into
                        those big green eyes, it feels like
                        I’m staring at a lie.

           A long beat. Horatio looks surprisingly choked up.

                                 PARKER
                        Horatio... please just put the

           Horatio presses the knife’s blade against Ashley’s index
           finger.

                             (to Ashley)

                        feel a thing...

                        Por favor...

           Translation: Please...

           With a flick of his wrist, Horatio slices the tip of
           Ashley’s finger open.
                                    She SCREAMS and WHIMPERS.

                                 PARKER

           Blood trickles out of the cut and pools into the middle of
           the table as Ashley grabs her hand, CRYING.

                                 HORATIO

                        myself that her and I are bound by
                        blood, like father and daughter
                        ought to be.

           Dahlia SOBS quietly. We can see the gears turning in
           Parker’s head as rivulets of sweat bead up along his brow.

           Horatio presses the blade against his own thumb and slowly
           cuts it open, watching the blood ooze out with a fascinated
           expression. He locks eyes with Ashley, who holds her finger
           and SOBS.

                                 HORATIO

           Parker goes to stand but Hector once again shoves him down
           into his chair and burrows his gun into Parker’s neck.

                                 PARKER
                        You do this and the deal is off you
                        sick motherfucker!

           Horatio looks at Parker, a detached, psychotic twinkle in
           his eye. He grabs Ashley’s delicate wrist with his bleeding
           hand and-

           KABOOOOOOM!

           A massive explosion RIPS through the living room, blowing
           the front door clean off its hinges and shattering the
           windows. Mago, who was standing in the breezeway, is blown
           to smithereens.

           Everyone else, who was in the kitchen, is spared.
           pulls his Taurus Casull from under the table and aims it at
           Parker. Dahlia, bleeding from her ears, reaches across the
           table and grabs onto Ashley’s hand as they both SOB and
           cower.

           Parker looks around, blinking excessively, trying to shake
           his head clear. He also bleeds from one of his ears.

                                 HORATIO
                             (to Hector and Bruja)
                        See what that was!

           They nod and Bruja follows Hector out the front door.

           Hector and Bruja walk out the front door and see Hector’s
           Land Cruiser engulfed in flames.

           flank, draws a bead with his Benelli and-

           BOOOOM!

           Two for one. As Marcus flanks Hector, Bruja walks out and
           into Marcus’ killbox.
                                    He squeezes the trigger and sizzling
           hot buckshot shreds through Hector and Bruja like they were
           made of Play-Doh.

           her gallbladder, small intestines, and abdominal viscera pop
           out like a jack-in-the-box.

           Horatio shoots up out of his chair, backs up against the
           wall, and aims his Casull at the front door.

                                 HORATIO
                        Hector! Bruja!

           Marcus’ silhouette glides into the open doorway, his shotgun
           raised. Realizing there’s no way to single out Horatio
           without possibly hitting Parker, Ashley, or Dahlia, he
           lowers his gun.

           Horatio draws a bead on Marcus and just as he’s about to pop
           one off Parker grabs the edge of the table and lunges at
           him, overturning it and SLAMMING into him, pancaking him
           against the wall.

           BOOOM! Horatio fires as he’s slammed into the wall.

           Marcus is hit in the shoulder and goes flying backwards,

           Dahlia and Ashley are frozen in fear.

                                 PARKER
                        RUN!
           As Parker struggles to keep Horatio pinned against the wall
           with the upturned kitchen table, Horatio snaps one of the
           table legs off and-

           WHACK!

           buckle and Horatio heaves the table off himself, sending
           both Parker and the table flying.

           WHOOOMPH!

           Parker flies clear across the kitchen, slamming into the
           wall behind him and collapsing into a heap as the table
           lands flat on top of him with a heavy THUD.

           Parker uses his legs to slowly slide up and out from behind
           table. Horatio draws a bead and Parker, staring down the
           barrel of the Casull, locks eyes with him.
                                                         Horatio cocks

                        eternity you sick, twisted-

           These happen literally a millisecond apart:

           Horatio pulls the trigger, blowing a giant hole through the
           section of table resting against Parker’s chest.
           BURSTS and SPLINTERS and Parker’s innards blast through the
           opening like mortarfire.
