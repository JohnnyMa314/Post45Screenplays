           EXT. AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

           A cold, wintry wind howls through the concrete structure.

           The expected array of vehicles.  Few spots remain available.

           INT. CAR - SAME

           ARTHUR BRENNAN, (43), sits behind the wheel of his mid-range 
           sedan.  Thousand-yard stare on his face.  His hands quiver 
           slightly. 

           He pulls up to the parking garage entrance.  Waits behind 
           another car.  The security bar raises, that car proceeds into 
           the parking garage.

           A short BEEP from the vehicle behind Arthur breaks him from 
           his contemplation.  Alerts him to move forward.  The sound 
           echoes through the charmless architecture.

           Arthur presses a button on a ticket machine.  An AUTOMATED 
           VOICE provides instructions through a speaker.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)
                        Please remember to take your ticket 
                        with you.  Payment should be made 
                        at one of our automated machines 
                        upon your return.

           Arthur takes his ticket.  The security arm raises.  

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - TOP FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Almost entirely vacant, likely due to its lack of overhead 
           cover.

           SEE Arthur’s car park in the middle of the lot.  No vehicles 
           on all sides of him.  

           INT. CAR - SAME

           He turns off his ignition.  Exits the vehicle wearing a long, 
           beige jacket.  Does not lock the doors.  Walks toward the 
           stairwell, not carrying any luggage whatsoever.

           WE SEE he has left behind his parking lot ticket.  The car 
           keys dangle from the ignition. 

           INT. AIRPORT - LATER

           Busy with holiday-season travelers.  A mosaic of 
           personalities.  
           Arthur stands in line for international travel.  A Japanese 
           family of four in front of him.  The young girl, clinging to 
           a tiny backpack, looks at Arthur.  He doesn’t even notice.

           A moment later, Arthur is called over to the ticket counter 
           by a cheery DESK AGENT.

                                 DESK AGENT
                        Hello.

           He places his passport on the ticket counter.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Arthur Brennan.

           His curtness more a sign of his detachment than rudeness.  

                                 DESK AGENT
                        Um, okay.  Where will you be 
                        traveling to, Mister Brennan?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tokyo.

           The Desk Agent has trouble locating Arthur’s information on 
           the computer.  

                                 DESK AGENT
                        Hmmm... When did you book your 
                        ticket?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Last night.

                                 DESK AGENT
                        That might be why.
                             (beat)
                        Here it is.  Would you like to book 
                        your return flight now?

           Arthur barely shakes his head “No.”  

                                 DESK AGENT (CONT’D)
                             (re: scale)
                        All right, I need your bags up 
                        here, please.

           Arthur does not respond.  

                                 DESK AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh... um, no.  I don’t have any.
                                 DESK AGENT
                        Just a carry-on.  Okay.

           No, not even that.  But Arthur doesn’t bother to correct her.

                                 DESK AGENT (CONT’D)
                        You are all set.  You’ll be leaving 
                        out of Gate 43.  Boarding begins in 
                        about an hour.

           She hands Arthur his boarding pass.  He walks off without a 
           reply.

           INT. AIRPORT - LATER

           Arthur stands in the security line, his shoes in hand.  

           He removes something from his pocket: a prescription pill 
           bottle.  He places it in the bin.  

           He then removes a small, sealed manila envelope from the 
           inside pocket of his jacket.  Places it in the bin as well.

           Walks through the metal detector.  Collects his belongings.  
           The inconvenience of airport protocol goes completely 
           unnoticed.

           INT. AIRPORT - JET BRIDGE - LATER

           Arthur stands in the line of passengers waiting to board the 
           aircraft, most of them Japanese.  

           Colorful advertisements, strategically placed on the 
           otherwise dull walls, fail to entice him.  

           Soon reaching the plane, he is greeted by a Japanese FLIGHT 
           ATTENDANT.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                             (in Japanese)
                        Welcome.
                             (then in English)
                        Welcome.

           Arthur continues past her without a word, disappearing into 
           the aircraft. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

           Night has fallen.  Well into the lengthy trip, most 
           passengers sleep. 
           But not Arthur.  His reading light turned on, he holds an 
           unflinching gaze on his left hand.  His wedding band.  It 
           glimmers under the light of the tiny bulb.  

           The FLIGHT ATTENDANT pushes a food cart down the aisle.  She 
           sees that Arthur is awake.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Care for dinner?  Chicken or 
                        traditional Japanese.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Something to drink?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.

           The Flight Attendant sees that the passengers seated next to 
           Arthur are asleep, so she continues down the aisle.  

           Arthur’s head slumps back into his seat, bathed in the small 
           wash of white light.  

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY

           Colossal buildings, seemingly built on one another’s 
           foundations.  Thousands of vehicles and bicycles choke the 
           streets.  Horns blare, advertisements flash across JumboTron
           screens.  

           Arthur, still wearing his beige jacket and same clothes from 
           the flight, crosses a busy intersection, surrounded by 
           Japanese businesspeople.  

           A stranger in a strange land. 

           INT. TRAIN - LATER

           Gliding across the tracks, the world speeds by the in-cabin 
           window in flashes of green and grey.

           In a private room, Arthur sits across from an older Japanese 
           couple.  He stares out the window.

           Just then, an arresting, faraway image materializes --

           Mt. Fuji.  
           The majestic mountain appears in the distance, looming over 
           the countryside like a hologram.  

           And though the rest of the scenery blurs past as an 
           Impressionist painting, the mountain seemingly keeps pace 
           with the speeding train.

           EXT. NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - PARKING LOT - EVENING - LATER

           A handful of cars are parked along a wood barrier.  A 
           delicate frost covers windshields, dappled by the setting 
           sun.

           Beyond the wood barrier, a lining of trees.  Familiar spruce, 
           pine, etc.  

           An old taxi appears in the distance, lumbering up the road 
           toward the parking lot.

           Its brakes squeal, even from such a gradual stop.  Seconds 
           later, Arthur exits from the backseat.  The taxi putters 
           along.

           Arthur takes a beat before proceeding into the small, dirt-
           covered parking lot.  He holds an unopened bottled water.

           He reaches the row of parked cars.  The window of the vehicle 
           nearest him is partially open.  Cold wind whistles through 
           the vehicle.  A light frost clings to the torn leather seats.

           An old, jaundiced newspaper sits on the seat of a different 
           car.

           One thing is for sure: These cars have been here for quite 
           some time.

           Undeterred, Arthur continues toward the entrance to the 
           National Park.  Down the dirt path, soon passing a large 
           wooden sign.  On it are what appear to be park rules, written 
           in Japanese. 

           Just above the sign, perched atop a wooden pole, is a small 
           CCTV camera.  

           Arthur steps into the forest, disappearing into what we will 
           soon see is akin to another dimension.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           Now past the outlying layer of more common-looking flora, 
           Arthur walks amidst tall, thin trees, mostly all of them free 
           of branches, save for their last twenty feet of growth.  
           A light fog hovers just about the ground, conspiring with the 
           trees to create a disorienting redundancy. 

           This is Aokigahara.  The Sea of Trees.

           Sticking to a well-traveled trail, Arthur treks deeper into 
           the forest.  His footfalls crunch against the volcanic rock 
           on which the forest was formed.

           Eerily free of animal calls, the void is filled with a steady 
           ring of silence, caused by the wind-blocking density of the 
           trees.  

           Arthur soon comes upon a grouping of other signs posted by 
           park officials.  Their inscriptions appear in many languages, 
           including English, offering disturbing pleas to those who 
           pass.

           “THINK CALMLY ONCE AGAIN ABOUT YOUR SIBLINGS AND YOUR 
           CHILDREN.”

           “DO NOT AGONIZE OVER PROBLEMS YOURSELF -- PLEASE SEEK 
           COUNSELING.”

           “YOUR LIFE IS A PRECIOUS GIFT FROM YOUR PARENTS.”

           Arthur is unwavering in his journey.  Proceeds past the 
           signs.

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           The sun begins to slip from sight, blocked further by the 
           canopy of overhanging trees.  

           As nightfall approaches, the temperature steadily drops, 
           evidenced by the appearance of frozen coils of vapor 
           spiraling from Arthur’s mouth.

           He suddenly notices something: a ribbon.  It stretches well 
           into the distance, haphazardly tied off on trees.  Following 
           its path with his eyes, he sees there are many others like it 
           festooned across the forest.

           Despite their variety in color and shape, these ribbons are 
           clearly not decorative.  Nevertheless, it’s apparent Arthur 
           lacks the interest in learning their true purpose.

           His progress brings him deeper into the apocalyptic woods.

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           Arthur’s feet traipse across the forest floor, by this point 
           well past the last of the colored ribbons.
           His nose and cheeks reddened by the cold, his fingertips 
           tremble.

           It’s then he encounters a truly macabre sight --  

           A decomposed human body collapsed upon itself, lying at the 
           base of a tree.  Judging by its tattered clothes and decayed 
           state, it has likely been there for quite some time.

           Unafraid and seemingly expectant of such imagery, Arthur puts 
           his head down and moves past.

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           Arthur breathes deeply, the cold air burning his lungs.

           Around him, the forest floor has taken on a different, more 
           sinister appearance.  Vines and roots spread across the 
           volcanic rock and trees like tentacles.  

           He scans the treetops, but has difficulty seeing past the 
           Gothic archways formed by interlacing branches.

           Moving in deeper, no longer on any path, he finally 
           encounters a clearing above.

           Through it, an ethereal portrait of Mt. Fuji, presiding over 
           the forest.  The moon hovers just beyond the mountaintop like 
           a white balloon in the greying sky. 

           Arthur finally stops walking.  Surveys the immediate area.  
           Everything looks the same in all directions, like an optical 
           illusion.

           This is it.  

           A steady ring of silence.  The solemn beauty of it all.

           He gently touches the trunk of a tree.  Sits down at its 
           base, leans back.  His eyes drift upward, toward the sky.  
           Clouds roll in.  

           He unscrews the cap of the prescription pill bottle.  Pours 
           one pill into his palm, then places it into his mouth.

           Sighs.  Considers.  Decides.  

           He washes it down with a sip from his bottled water, though 
           not with ease.

           Sighs again.  Makes his decision much faster this time.

           A second pill is poured onto his palm, then into his mouth.  
           More difficulty swallowing, even with a sip of water.
           The almost ritualistic process continues.  This time, he 
           drains almost all the pills onto his hand.  Some spill to the 
           ground.  He waits before taking the next pill.

           As he catches his breath, he removes the small, sealed manila 
           envelope from the inside pocket of his jacket.  

           Looks at it contemplatively.  Starts to tear it open.  As he 
           does, he hears what sounds like... like... crying?  

           Arthur stops.  Looks off into the distance, where he sees --

           Nothing.  No one.  Just an unending tableau of trees and 
           their rock-ingesting roots.

           Arthur gets back to the envelope.

           As he is again about to tear it open --

           -- he hears the sound of footsteps, coming from far behind 
           him.

           He stops once again.  Peers around the tree trunk.

           Far in the distance, further obscured by heavy brush, he sees 
           what appears to be a MAN walking aimlessly.  Crying.

           Looking closer as the Man passes by, Arthur can see that he’s 
           quite distressed.  The Man stumbles; his footing is unsure, 
           his body trembles from the cold.

           It’s obvious he is in dire need of help.

           But Arthur is not there to help anyone.  After watching the 
           Man for a moment longer, Arthur turns his back on him.  
           Closes his eyes, waits for him to walk past.

           The sound of the Man’s cries become muffled.  Turning to see 
           why, Arthur finds the Man has fallen to his knees.  Hunches 
           over.

           Try as he might, Arthur cannot shut out the sound of this 
           Man’s cries.  It’s simply too much for him to ignore.

           Momentarily abandoning his own plans, Arthur puts down the 
           manila envelope.  Places the pill bottle into his jacket 
           pocket.  

           He begins a cautious approach toward the Man, leaving the
           manila envelope behind.

           As he draws closer, Arthur gets a better look at the Man -- 
           who we will learn is named TAKUMI NAKAMRUA.  
           Japanese, appears to be in his early forties, wearing a 
           disheveled business suit.

           Takumi lumbers back to his feet.  Mumbles to himself in 
           Japanese.  His disorientation is evident.  He does not yet 
           see Arthur approaching. 

           Arthur cautiously calls out to him --

                                 ARTHUR
                        Excuse me...?  Hello...?

           Takumi stumbles deeper into the forest.

           Arthur picks up his pace.  Closes the distance between them.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hey...?  You okay?

           Takumi finally stops.  Turns to face Arthur.  Now in plain 
           sight, Takumi is in worse shape than expected.  

           His purplish lips hang slack.  His trembling, pallid hands 
           outstretched before him.

                                 TAKUMI
                             (in Japanese)
                        Please... please help me.  I beg 
                        you for your help.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know what you’re saying.  I 
                        don’t --

           Takumi switches to an accented, but easily understood, 
           English.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Please.  I beg you.

           Takumi pleadingly grabs onto Arthur’s jacket.  It’s then that 
           Arthur notices Takumi’s wrists.  Both show deep lacerations.  
           A gruesome mix of dried and fresh blood.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (startled)
                        Oh...

           Takumi sees the bottled water Arthur holds.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Water...
                                 ARTHUR
                        Water -- yeah-yeah.  Here.

           Takumi drinks it down in big, desperate gulps.  Arthur looks 
           on nervously as the bottle drains.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Wait, I need...

           Takumi takes one last sip.  Hands the bottle back to Arthur.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Are you lost?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I cannot find way out.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s that way.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Help me.  Please.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I am.  Go that way.  It will lead 
                        you out of here.

           Arthur nods.  As if to say, “Okay, we’re done here.”

           With little more thought on the matter, Arthur turns and 
           walks away, heading back in the direction from which he came.

           Takumi waits for a moment, perhaps hoping for more from 
           Arthur.  But all that is offered is additional distance 
           between them.

           Takumi takes slow, labored steps in the direction Arthur 
           pointed.

           WE STAY ON ARTHUR 

           as Takumi wanders off in the b.g.

           Arthur lets out a long, cold sigh.  Begins his short journey 
           back.

           He suddenly appears slightly confused.  Everything looks the 
           same in all directions.

           Looking left, looking right -- the manila envelope, the 
           landmark of his chosen place, is nowhere to be found. 
           There he stands, alone, neither angry nor frustrated; his 
           emotional storehouse remains bereft of such trivial emotions.  
           He is simply, and in all possible ways, lost.

           He resumes his walk.  Searches for quite some time.  Only to  
           soon realizes he is not alone after all.

           In the distance, he again sees Takumi, walking parallel to 
           him.  Takumi’s cries are bigger, louder than before.  
           Incoherent utterances in Japanese.  His hands clutched to his 
           chest.

           Arthur stops walking.  Watches Takumi.  A moment later, 
           Takumi notices Arthur.  He also stops walking.

           The two men stare at each other from across the forest.

           Arthur emits yet another sigh.  This time, a hint of 
           frustration does surface.

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           Arthur walks a few steps ahead of Takumi, who cannot keep 
           pace.

           Arthur takes a quick peek back at him.  Regards his 
           disheveled business suit.  His debilitated physical state.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Are you with anyone?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Very cold... 

           Arthur takes off his beige jacket.  Wraps it over Takumi’s 
           hunched shoulders.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.  Alright.  Here.
                             (beat)
                        Are you here with anyone?

           Takumi shakes his head “No.”

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (re: Takumi’s wrists)
                        You can’t stay like that.

           Arthur looks around again.  Still searching as they walk.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        You need to get back on the trail.
                                 TAKUMI
                        I cannot find it.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I told you -- it’s somewhere over 
                        there.  

           Arthur leads Takumi through the maze-like forest.  Tantamount 
           to navigating through an Escher drawing.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        It should be right over that hill.

           Takumi shakes his head “No”.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Then it has to be this way.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I walk that direction.  I could not 
                        find any trail.

           It’s then that something finally occurs to Arthur.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        You don’t want to leave.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I do.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You came here alone.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        Please.  I want to go home to my 
                        family.

           A beat.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Then just head this way --

           Climbing over the small hill, Arthur sees that Takumi was 
           correct -- there is no trail.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a cell phone?

                                 TAKUMI
                        It would not work even if I did.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Listen... I can’t help you.  
                                 TAKUMI
                        Please...

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s not that I don’t want to.  I 
                        just can’t.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        I have wife, a child.  Please.  Let 
                        me see them.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s not why I’m here.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I beg of you...

           Arthur thinks on this, long and hard.  Looks around the 
           forest, at the darkening sky.  

           EXT. AOIKIGAHARA - LATER

           Nightfall draws nearer.  The temperature continues to drop.

           Arthur and Takumi negotiate a patch of difficult terrain.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Careful. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        Hai.

           Takumi carefully steps over gangly roots.  Arthur studies him 
           as he does.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Did you drive yourself here?

                                 TAKUMI
                        No.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Then how will you get to the 
                        hospital?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I will.

           Arthur looks up.  Notices dark clouds rolling in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.
           They continue their trek in silence.  Their footfalls crunch 
           across the moon-like surface.

           Soon, up ahead, Arthur sees --

                                 ARTHUR
                        The trail.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Trail?  You see--?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Right there.

           Takumi looks where Arthur points.  Sees the trail.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        Oh!  Yes, I see!

           They pace closer to the trail, soon reaching it.  It 
           stretches around a raised portion of earth, out of sight.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Follow it that way.  It’ll bring 
                        you to the parking lot.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Thank you.  Thank you.

           Takumi excitedly grabs onto Arthur’s forearms.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.  You need to go.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Yes, yes.  Okay.

           Takumi starts to take off Arthur’s beige jacket.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, no -- keep it.  It’s still a 
                        good walk back.

                                 TAKUMI
                        But...

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s the trail.  Here it is.  Okay?  
                        Go.

           Arthur physically guides Takumi in the direction he needs to 
           go.  Takumi stumbles down the trail, quietly mumbling joyous 
           reflections to himself in Japanese.
           Arthur turns and walks in the opposite direction.

           A brief moment later, Arthur stops.  Taps at his pants 
           pockets, as if searching for something that he quickly 
           realizes isn’t there.

           A contemplative beat, followed by what appears to be a 
           decision not easily made.  

           Arthur turns and walks in Takumi’s direction.

           Takumi, having followed the trail around the bend, is no 
           longer in sight.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hold on...  Hello?

           Arthur rounds the corner.  Sees Takumi up ahead.  Takumi, 
           quite oddly, has stopped walking, but still stands with his 
           back facing Arthur. 

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I, um, I forgot something in my 
                        jack--

           He stops speaking upon finally noticing --

           -- the trail ends.  Both men stare, nonplussed.  

           After a beat: 

                                 TAKUMI
                             (distraught)
                        It is not right trail.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Dressed for an evening out, Arthur pumps gas into a small 
           SUV.

           He gazes wistfully at a YOUNG COUPLE, seemingly in their mid-
           twenties, as they exit the gas station.

           The YOUNG WOMAN does nothing more than drag her hand down the 
           YOUNG MAN’s back, yet it clearly bespeaks the current station 
           of their relationship; not new and exciting, but not yet 
           predictable and staid.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (sotto)
                        Shit...
           Arthur’s inattention causes him to overfill the tank.  A 
           small amount of gasoline dribbles over his hand.

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Still parked at the gas station, Arthur climbs into the 
           passenger seat, cleaning his hand with a paper towel.

           Seated in the driver’s seat, finishing her cell phone call, 
           is his wife, JOAN BRENNAN (42).  She wears her age well, 
           though streaks of grey and fairly pronounced facial creases 
           prevent her from being mistaken for a younger woman.

                                 JOAN
                             (into phone)
                        ... Yes, at the seller’s residence. 
                        ...  Eight works for me. ... 
                        Excellent.  Thank you.

           Joan ends the call.  She notices Arthur futilely attempting 
           to rid his hands of the scent of gasoline.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

                                 ARTHUR
                        The tank overflowed.

                                 JOAN
                        I think I have some of those 
                        things...

           Joan sifts through her handbag.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What things?

                                 JOAN
                        Those hand wipes.
                             (finds them)
                        Here.

           Arthur reaches out his hand for the wipe.  To his apparent 
           surprise, Joan instead takes his hand in hers and cleans it 
           for him.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Thanks.

           She smiles thinly.  Starts the car.  They pull away from the 
           gas station.
           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Joan drives.  Arthur watches the world roll by outside his 
           window.

                                 JOAN
                        I have another showing tomorrow.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (slightly impassive)
                        Yeah, I heard.  That’s great.

                                 JOAN
                        It’s not far from the college.  
                        Maybe I can drop by afterwards...?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tomorrow’s pretty busy.

                                 JOAN
                        Why, do you have office hours?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Office hours, two classes, and I’m 
                        proctoring an exam for Gil.

                                 JOAN
                        How about a quick lunch, then?  I 
                        can pick up something on my way 
                        over.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t have time.

                                 JOAN
                        Okay.  Just an idea.  Never mind.

           Joan steals a saturnine glance at Arthur, who has returned 
           his absent gaze out his window.

           She looks back to the road.  Silence but for the sound of 
           spinning tires as the highway lines feed into the fender.

           The lingering discomfort is finally broken --

                                 JOAN
                        Can you see if my lipstick is in 
                        the glove compartment?

           Arthur conducts a cursory search.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t see it.
           He closes the glove compartment.

                                 JOAN
                        Did you look good?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah.  It’s not in there.

           After a beat, Joan leans over and opens the glove 
           compartment.  Not the safest maneuver to perform while 
           driving.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (mildly frustrated)
                        Joan...

           In short time, she finds the tube of lipstick.  Shuts the 
           glove compartment.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t see it.

                                 JOAN
                        Because you didn’t look.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You watched me.

                                 JOAN
                        Forget it.

           More silence between them.  Until --

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        You did the same thing with the 
                        baking powder.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Guess we’re not forgetting it.

                                 JOAN
                        It was right there in the pantry.  
                        Right in front of your face.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Jesus Christ, Joan -- are we really 
                        going to fight about this?

                                 JOAN
                        You don’t care.

                                 ARTHUR
                        About what?
                                 JOAN
                        Your mind’s always somewhere else.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.  And what ground-breaking 
                        thought kept me from finding a tube 
                        of lipstick?

                                 JOAN
                        Go ahead, mock me.

                                 ARTHUR
                        When you’re being this ridiculous, 
                        you deserve it.

           The vehicle again falls quiet, but it is soon disrupted by 
           Joan mumbling her thoughts aloud --

                                 JOAN
                        Probably about what you can say...

                                 ARTHUR
                        What I can say--?

                                 JOAN
                        You were probably thinking up 
                        things you can say tonight to make 
                        you sound clever.  Or charming.

           Arthur is noticeably put off by this. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        If you didn’t want to come, you 
                        shouldn’t have. 

           After a ruminative beat:

                                 JOAN
                        You’re driving home.

           INT. RESTAURANT - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Laughter coming from a corner table.  A party of six, Arthur 
           and Joan being among them.  

           Also present:

           GABRIELLA LAFORTE, (37), bookishly attractive;  GIL CRAMER 
           (45); MARYANNE WESCOTT (44), and PAUL WESCOTT (48).  All are 
           colleagues of Arthur’s. 

                                 GIL
                        And here it was I thought my 
                        calculations were off.
                                 GABRIELLA
                        It at least explains why they 
                        rejected it.

           INSERT -- Joan notices that the back of Arthur’s shirt collar 
           is folded awkwardly.  Purposely avoiding his notice, she 
           fixes this. Smooths it out with a gentle brush of her 
           fingertips.

                                 GIL (O.S.)
                        That it does.

                                 GABRIELLA (O.S.)
                        Are you going to resubmit?

                                 GIL (O.S.)
                        Maybe.  We’ll see.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 PAUL
                        What about you, Arthur?

           The other members of the party are much more gregarious; 
           Arthur is somewhat reticent.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        My article?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think it has a shot with the 
                        smaller journals.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Oh, absolutely.

           Joan withdraws, diverting her eyes from her wine glass only 
           to occasionally size-up the younger and prettier Gabriella. 

                                 MARYANNE
                        Have you read it, Joan?

                                 JOAN
                             (curtly)
                        No. 

           She punctuates her statement with a healthy sip of wine.  The 
           comment creates an awkward silence. 

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.
                                 MARYANNE
                        No, it’s okay.

           Paul, attempting to ease the tension --

                                 PAUL
                        So, you seeing an uptick in home 
                        sales?

                                 JOAN
                        A bit.

           She waits a beat before getting back to what she clearly 
           would prefer to be talking about.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                             (re: Arthur)
                        I just think he should be pursuing 
                        other opportunities instead of 
                        wasting time trying to get 
                        published.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Publication in the right journal 
                        can do wonders for an adjunct’s 
                        career.

                                 JOAN
                        So can a change of profession.  

                                 ARTHUR
                             (quietly)
                        Stop it...

                                 JOAN
                        Stop what?  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Please?

                                 JOAN
                        You think it’s right your wife does 
                        all the heavy lifting so you can 
                        pretend to be an intellectual?

           Under the table, out of sight from the others, Arthur grabs 
           Joan’s hand.  She discontinues her diatribe and pulls her 
           hand away, jostling the table.

           The others look away, discomfited, unsure how to react.

           Joan finishes the last sip of her wine.  Glares at Arthur.  
                                 ARTHUR
                             (to the others)
                        Sorry.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Arthur and Joan return home.  The tension between them is 
           palpable.  

           Arthur tosses the car keys onto the table.  Places his jacket 
           on a hook.  Joan grabs it, throws it to the floor and walks 
           off.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’re unbelievable.

                                 JOAN
                        Go to hell.

           Joan passes by a small white board.  Physics equations fill 
           it.  She drags her hand across it, smudging everything into 
           incomprehensible streaks.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Good, good -- ruin my work.

                                 JOAN
                        Your work.  Get a grip, Arthur.  
                        You teach at a God damn community 
                        college.  Oh, and don’t you ever 
                        grab my hand like that again.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I didn’t grab your hand.

           Joan pours herself a full glass of port wine.

                                 JOAN
                        I know you wanted to impress your 
                        little friend.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOAN
                        Show her how in control you are.  

           Arthur shakes his head.  This is a painfully familiar 
           routine.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        It makes sense now why you’re too 
                        busy to meet me for lunch.
                                 ARTHUR
                        You can’t keep doing this.

                                 JOAN
                        Doing what?  Getting older?  
                        Uglier?

           Arthur takes a long look at his wife.  Her tears.  Her 
           sadness.  Her inelegance.   

           A beat.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You have your showing in the 
                        morning.  You should go to sleep.

           Joan does not respond at first.  She suddenly seems aware of 
           her misbehavior.

           Arthur walks upstairs.  As he does, Joan returns to 
           belligerence. 

                                 JOAN 
                        Oh, don’t worry, I’ll make sure I’m 
                        out there bright and early, and 
                        work until seven fucking o’clock.  
                        As always.

           With that, she throws the wine from her glass.  The red port 
           stains the carpet runner on the two lower stairs.

           Joan walks OFF-SCREEN as Arthur continues up the stairs. 

                                 JOAN (O.S.)
                        Because God forbid you take care of 
                        me for once.  

           He stops momentarily at the top of the stairs.  Listens to 
           her.  Closes his eyes. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. AOIKIGAHARA - EVENING

           Arthur gazes up at the trees, attempting to orient himself.  
           Cold breaths escape his lungs.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think it’s this way.

           He helps Takumi along. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        Not yet.
                                 ARTHUR
                        What?

           Takumi sits down.  Out of breath.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Not yet.

           Takumi pulls up the sleeves of Arthur’s borrowed jacket.  
           Examines his wrists.

           Arthur takes a good look at Takumi for the first time.

                                 ARTHUR
                        How long have you been here?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Two days.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Like that?

           Takumi nods “Yes.”

           A beat.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Give me your tie.

           Takumi unties his tie.  Hands it to Arthur, who uses it to 
           create a tourniquet for one of Takumi’s wrists.

           Arthur then removes his own dress shirt, leaving him only in 
           an undershirt.  He wraps it around Takumi’s other wrist.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You will freeze.

           Arthur finishes tying his tourniquet.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Come on.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Take coat.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.  Come on.

           Takumi begins taking off Arthur’s jacket.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Take coat.
                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t want the coat; I want to 
                        find the trail.

           Arthur extends his hand.  After a beat, Takumi takes it and 
           is helped back to his feet.

           The two men resume their navigation through the forest.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           Having successfully climbed atop a small, ten-foot cliff, 
           Arthur leans down to assist Takumi in his climb.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Put your foot there.  There.

           Takumi does as Arthur instructed.  After slipping once, he 
           gains purchase on a rock outcropping.  Even the smallest of 
           movements causes him great pain.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        There’s a vine you can grab onto.  
                        See it?  No, to your left.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Yes.

           Takumi takes hold of the vine. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay... give me your hand...

           Their fingertips flirt before finally making contact.  Arthur 
           pulls as Takumi climbs the rock face.

           Both men use all their strength to get Takumi up the small 
           cliff.  Clenched teeth, veins springing from their necks.

           Finally, after colossal effort, Takumi reaches the top.

           Both men lay flat on the ground, utterly exhausted.  Their 
           freezing, ghostlike breaths float upward and disappear. 

           After finally getting his wind back --

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I do not...?

           Getting to the point.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Why do you want to die?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I do not want that.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Then why are you here?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I could ask you same thing.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’d prefer you didn’t.

           Arthur leaves little room for discussion.

                                 TAKUMI
                        It was not that I wanted to die; it 
                        was I did not want to live.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What’s the difference?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I lost my job many months ago.  I 
                        try to find new job, but cannot.  
                        Not even one that pay me half as 
                        much money.

                                 ARTHUR
                        A job?  That’s why you’re doing 
                        this?

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is disgraceful.  I have family.  
                        Without job, I cannot support them.

           Arthur is noticeably put off by this.  

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                             (off Arthur’s look)
                        You do not understand my culture.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’re right, I don’t.

           Arthur climbs to his feet.  As he does, he stumbles slightly.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        What is wrong?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Nothing.  Dizzy...
           Arthur shakes it off.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on.   

           Arthur helps Takumi to his feet.  

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - NIGHT - LATER

           Darkness falls.  The overlying trees block much of the 
           moonlight.  

           Arthur rubs at his eyes, struggles to remain sure in his 
           footing.  The effects of the prescription pills taking hold.

           Both men shiver from the steadily-dropping temperature.

           Quite suddenly, Arthur stops walking.  Holds up his hand.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (hushed)
                        Wait...

           He listens.  Hears what sounds like footsteps, coming from 
           deep within the forest.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear that?

           Arthur listens closer, attempting to ascertain from where the 
           sound is coming.

           Takumi appears unconcerned.  He doesn’t even look.  Uses the 
           moment to instead catch his breath.  

           Just then --

           The NOISE is heard again.  Arthur quickly turns in its 
           direction.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Hello?  Is anybody there?

           No response.  His words vanish into the forest.

           He is met only with a continuous ring of silence.

                                 TAKUMI
                        There is no one.

           Arthur pays little attention to Takumi.  Calls out again.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Hello?  If you can hear me, we need 
                        help.

           Again, there is no response.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Listen to me.  There is no one.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What was that, then?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Yurei.

           Arthur attempts to rub life back into his heavy eyes.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Who’s Yurei?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Yurei are spirits.

           Arthur wants no part of where this conversation is heading.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        They are souls, trapped until it is 
                        their time.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Stop...

                                 TAKUMI
                        Things are not what they seem here.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Please, I’m asking you -- stop.  If 
                        we’re going to talk, I’d rather it 
                        be about directions.  

           Takumi seems to get the message.

           The two men continue walking, quite aimlessly. 

           Neither of them say a word.  Until finally --

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        It was probably an animal.

                                 TAKUMI
                        There are very few animals in 
                        Aokigahara.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Well, it was one of the few.

                                 TAKUMI
                        No bears, no deer.  Not even birds.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s a forest; there are animals in 
                        it.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Have you heard any?

           Arthur thinks on this before answering.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.

                                 TAKUMI
                        This place is what you call 
                        purgatory.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Why would I call it that?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Because you are American.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So?

                                 TAKUMI
                        You believe in God. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        You don’t understand my culture.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You are right, I don’t.

           Arthur looks at Takumi, aware the he just had his own words 
           used against him.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m a science teacher.

                                 TAKUMI
                        There are answers for this in 
                        science?

                                 ARTHUR
                        There answers for everything in 
                        science.
                                 TAKUMI
                        But not in God?

                                 ARTHUR
                        God’s more our creation than we are 
                        His.

                                 TAKUMI
                        So why end your life?

           This question stops Arthur in his tracks.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Excuse me?

                                 TAKUMI
                        If God is not waiting for you on 
                        the other side, who is?

           Arthur does not respond.  Takumi cuts to the chase.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        Why do you want to die?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m here sightseeing.

           Takumi takes the pill bottle from Arthur’s jacket pocket, 
           which Takumi still wears.  

                                 TAKUMI
                             (re: pills)
                        These are for sightseeing?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I need them to sleep.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Sleep for how long?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Look, I don’t know who the hell you 
                        are, but I stopped to help you.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You did.

                                 ARTHUR
                        So, I helped.

           Frustrated, Arthur snatches the pill bottle from Takumi’s 
           hand.  Storms off in the opposite direction.
                                 TAKUMI
                        I am sorry...

           Arthur ignores Takumi.  Forges ahead into the darkness.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        Please, I am sorry.  

           Takumi becomes a black-on-black silhouette in the b.g., 
           getting smaller with each step Arthur takes.

           Arthur sighs.  Rubs again at his weary eyes.  The girding 
           darkness cinches tighter. 

           Drowsy and cold, his arms strangle each other, folded hard 
           against his chest as he treks up a difficult, moss-covered 
           mound.

           He stumbles on an unstable cobble of rocks.  Desperately 
           grabs for anything to steady himself against.

           Grasps a thin tree branch, but his shifting weight causes  
           the branch to snap, giving way to a sheer cliff.  He hollers 
           in the darkness as he CAREENS OVER THE EDGE.

           He free-falls about ten feet before landing with great force 
           onto the ground below.  His body SNAPS through the 
           undergrowth --

           -- and a single branch SPEARS THROUGH HIS SIDE.

           Already in a state of shock, Arthur stares at the ghastly 
           sight.  A spreading stain of crimson crawls across his 
           abdomen.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh... Oh...

           Takumi hobbles to the edge of the small cliff.  It is too 
           dark for him to see Arthur clearly, but hears his cries 
           emanating from the darkness below.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Are you injured?!

                                 ARTHUR
                        I can’t move!

           Arthur attempts to dislodge himself from impalement -- but 
           the pain is excruciating.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        I will climb to you.
                                 ARTHUR
                        No.  Get out of here!

                                 TAKUMI
                        I can climb.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t want you to.  Leave me 
                        alone!

                                 TAKUMI
                        You did not leave me.

           With great trouble, Takumi slowly lowers himself down the 
           cliff side, until he drops the last foot, landing squarely.  

           He gets his first clear look at Arthur’s injury.  He examines 
           it closely, as if attempting to determine the best manner to 
           extricate Arthur’s body from the branch.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Because of a fucking job?!

           Takumi does not pay attention to Arthur.  He moves aside 
           extraneous branches.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        You have a family to go home to 
                        every day, and you decide that’s 
                        not enough?  You son of a bitch!

           Takumi moves aside Arthur’s shirt, exposing the unsightly 
           injury, seen only in a quick glimpse.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (afraid)
                        What -- what are you doing?

           Takumi drapes Arthur’s arm over his shoulders.  Wraps his own 
           weak arms across Arthur’s sternum.  Leans Arthur slightly 
           upright.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Owwww!!!  What the hell are you 
                        doing?!

                                 TAKUMI
                        You did not leave me.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What...?

                                 TAKUMI
                        On three...
                                 ARTHUR
                        No, stop...

                                 TAKUMI
                        One...

                                 ARTHUR
                        Let go of me!

                                 TAKUMI
                        Two...

                                 ARTHUR
                        No!!!!

                                 TAKUMI
                        Three!!!

           With that, Takumi lifts Arthur’s upper-body with all his 
           might, dragging him up the length of the impaling branch.  
           Arthur SCREAMS out in absolute agony as we...

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - EVENING - FLASHBACK

           The front door unlocks.  Arthur enters, dressed in work 
           attire, carrying his laptop bag.

           He begins to remove his familiar beige jacket when he notices 
           Joan splayed out on the living room couch, fully dressed in a 
           pants suit and shoes.   

           Still wearing his jacket and scarf, he quietly approaches 
           her.  Removes her shoes, gently arranges her legs in a more 
           comfortable position.

           She barely stirs.

           Arthur watches his wife with silent adoration.  As if it’s a 
           secret.

           In the b.g., coming from the kitchen, the WHISTLE of a 
           boiling tea kettle is suddenly heard, its incessant call 
           growing louder.  Destroying this moment.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER - FLASHBACK

           The tea kettle’s piercing whistle persists.  Trace amounts of 
           smoke soon begin to spread from the bottom.

           A mug, with a tea bag draped over its rim, sits near the 
           stove.
           Arthur enters the kitchen.  Swipes the kettle off the burner.  
           Turns off the stove.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - SECONDS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Joan awakens.  Rubs the sleep from her eyes as she sits up.  
           Notices her shoes have been removed and placed, with apparent 
           care, next to the couch.  A muted smile.

           Arthur returns from the kitchen.

                                 JOAN
                        Hi.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Are you okay?

           The sound of the tea kettle simmering to silence provides the 
           explanation for Arthur’s question.

                                 JOAN
                        Oh... Sorry, I must have dozed off.

           Arthur removes his scarf.  Hangs it on the coat rack.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re wearing the jacket I bought 
                        you.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (preoccupied)
                        Yeah.

                                 JOAN
                        It looks nice.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s comfortable.

                                 JOAN
                             (off his preoccupation)
                        Are you okay?

                                 ARTHUR
                        You could’ve burned down the house.

                                 JOAN
                        I said I was sorry.

           Arthur finally hangs up his jacket.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I almost stopped at the store on my 
                        way home.  If I had,...
                                 JOAN
                        The house would be in ashes right 
                        now.  Okay?  Is me telling you how 
                        right you are enough to keep this 
                        from turning into an argument?

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s not the house I was concerned 
                        about.

           Joan’s increasing exasperation is mollified by his sincerity.

           A beat.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        You’re home early.

                                 JOAN
                        Should I feel bad for that?

                                 ARTHUR
                        It was just an observation, Joan.

                                 JOAN
                        You see it all, don’t you?

           Here we go again.  Arthur sighs.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        I see you stopped at the bar.

                                 JOAN
                        I did.  Right after I sold my 
                        second house this week. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        I would say we should celebrate, 
                        but you obviously already have.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m a grown woman.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’re a cliche.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m a grown woman.

                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s an alcoholic.
                                 JOAN
                        Funny how the so-called alcoholic 
                        is the one who pays the mortgage.  
                        What’s your excuse?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Excuse for what?

                                 JOAN
                        Get a job.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I have a job.

                                 JOAN
                        A real job, not one that pays 
                        twenty grand a year.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I like what I do.

                                 JOAN
                        About as much as you like that 
                        jacket.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I told you, it’s--

                                 JOAN
                        Comfortable, I know.  That’s my 
                        point.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What’s wrong with that?

                                 JOAN
                        You don’t care anymore.

                                 ARTHUR
                        About what?

                                 JOAN
                        About anything. It’s like you 
                        settled on some lesser version of 
                        yourself.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Why can’t you just be happy for me?  

                                 JOAN
                        Because I’m too busy feeling bad 
                        for myself.
                                 ARTHUR
                        At least you admit it.

                                 JOAN
                        Admit what?  That I have a husband 
                        who continuously puts himself 
                        first, and I’m such a fool I just 
                        keep letting him do it?  Fine, I 
                        admit it.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You were the one who said I should 
                        quit NorthLab.

                                 JOAN
                        Because you hated it there.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, because you hated me there.

                                 JOAN
                        You really want to go down that 
                        road?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, but apparently you do.  As 
                        usual.

                                 JOAN
                        You quit three years ago.  I 
                        figured you’d find something else 
                        by now.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I have.

                                 JOAN
                        Please... 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t give me “please.”  I have.

                                 JOAN
                        You could be doing a hell of a lot 
                        more, and you know it.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Stop pretending this has to do with 
                        a job.

                                 JOAN
                        It has to do with you continuing to 
                        take advantage of me.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Name one time --

                                 JOAN
                        There’s been plenty.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Then picking one should be easy.

                                 JOAN
                        It’s what you do -- you take people 
                        for granted.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yet you can’t give me a single 
                        example of when I’ve done it.

                                 JOAN
                        You don’t care about anyone but 
                        yourself.  When people need you, 
                        when I need you, you always have 
                        something more important to do.
                        Or someone.

           This last remark strikes a nerve.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I knew you couldn’t do it --

                                 JOAN
                        Well...

                                 ARTHUR
                        I knew you couldn’t keep from 
                        bringing it up.

                                 JOAN
                        You make it really hard not to 
                        sometimes.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m done trying to make amends, 
                        Joan.

                                 JOAN
                        You shouldn’t be.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Well, I am.  

           Arthur marches upstairs.

                                 JOAN
                        Did you at least get my tea?
                                 ARTHUR
                        Get your own fucking tea.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Joan enters, visibly upset from her row with Arthur.  Her 
           tough veneer dropped, quiet tears stream down her cheeks.  

           She pours water from the kettle into her mug.  Steeps her tea 
           bag as her mind wanders.  She is distracted when --

           Drip... drip... drip...

           Red spots appear in her light-colored tea, dying the liquid.

           Blood.  Trickling from her nose, landing in the mug.

           She nervously pulls her hand to her nose.  A small trickle of 
           blood spills over her fingers.

           Pinching her nostrils closed, Joan tears off a sheet of paper 
           towel.  Covers her nose.  Checks the bleeding.

           It seems to be stopping, but her concern persists.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - NIGHT

           Arthur and Takumi hobble through the forest.   

           Arthur appears somewhat disoriented.  His eyes glossy, his 
           gaze unsteady.  He momentarily loses his footing, despite the 
           present landscape’s relatively easy passage.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Are you all right?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tired.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        Do you need to rest?

           Arthur snaps back to the ugly reality of their situation.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What?  Umm... no.  We need to keep 
                        going.

           It’s incredibly difficult to see through the curtain of 
           darkness that surrounds them on all sides.

           Arthur searches for a gap in the treetops above.
                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Where is it...?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Mt. Fuji?

                                 ARTHUR
                             (nodding)
                        We can use it to get our bearings.  
                        The parking lot was west of the 
                        mountain...

                                 TAKUMI
                        East.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You sure?

           A beat.

                                 TAKUMI
                        No.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (defeated)
                        I can’t see it anyway.

           Arthur shakes his head.  Blows into his hands for warmth.

           A low rumble of thunder is heard in the distance.

           Takumi suddenly begins to walk toward something he struggles 
           to see in the dark.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (confused)
                        Where are you going?

           Takumi continues walking.  Finally stops, kneels down.

           Arthur soon catches up.  Sees that Takumi stares at the 
           sprouting leaves of a flower yet to bloom.  It is just as out 
           of place growing here as it would be in a junk yard.

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is said a flower grows when a 
                        soul has crossed over from this 
                        place.

           Arthur is perplexed by what seems an impossibility.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        There’s hardly any soil...
                                 TAKUMI
                        Hai.  

           Takumi takes a beat before standing.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        We should continue.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           Arthur sees that Takumi’s condition is worsening.  The need 
           to keep him alert and awake is paramount.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        Talk to me.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Talk to you?

                                 ARTHUR
                        What’s your name?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Takumi.

                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s your whole name?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Nakamura.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Takumi Nakamura.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Hai.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tell me about your family.

                                 TAKUMI
                        My wife is Kiiroi.  She is very 
                        smart, very beautiful.  We have one 
                        child -- Fuyu.

           Arthur shakes his head.  Confusion and contempt in equal 
           measure.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (re: Takumi’s wrists)
                        And you still did that.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I regret.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Doing it?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Thinking I needed to.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Isn’t it because of a cultural 
                        thing?  Something I wouldn’t 
                        understand?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I think you understand.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Will they?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I hope so.

           Arthur takes a look back at Takumi.  Disarmed by his frailty.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m sorry I yelled at you before.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Maybe I deserve.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No... you didn’t.

           They encounter a broad swath of particularly foreboding 
           terrain.  Spindly roots strangle one another.  Branches reach 
           down like bony fingers.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 TAKUMI
                        These trees scare me.

                                 ARTHUR
                        They’re just trees.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Nothing is just anything in this 
                        place.

                                 ARTHUR
                        They’re just trees.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Are you afraid?
                                 ARTHUR
                        No.

                                 TAKUMI
                        What are you, then?

           Arthur looks around, taking in the labyrinthine surroundings.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Lost.

           The conversation has reached its least logical conclusion.

           After several more steps, Arthur realizes Takumi has stopped 
           walking.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        What is it now?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Water.

           Arthur looks around.  Does not see any water.

           Takumi climbs over a small, vine-encrusted hill, away from 
           the direction in which he and Arthur were currently 
           traveling. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey...?  

           Arthur follows Takumi up the hill.

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           Takumi and Arthur continue in this new direction.  The faint 
           sound of running water is now heard.

           They seek out the source of the sound.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Do you hear it?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I hear it.  This way?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Yes, that way.

           They soon reach a small clearing.  A narrow brook meanders 
           through a modest growth of stilt grass.  The moon’s 
           reflection floats effortlessly on its bubbling surface.
                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        It is!  

           Takumi hurries to the brook, his pain and distress supplanted 
           by his sudden elation.  He falls to his hands and knees, 
           drinks thirstily from this forest oasis.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait, wait -- how do you know it’s 
                        safe to drink?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I do not.  But would rather get 
                        sick later than die tonight.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (sotto)
                        Good point.

           With that, Arthur cups a handful of water and drinks.  He 
           then cleans his wound.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Fill up the water bottle.

           Takumi fills the empty plastic water bottle.  Caps it.

           Once hydrated, both men take a seat alongside the gently-
           flowing water.  A much-needed reprieve. 

           Arthur lowers his head. Sighs. His misty exhalation is a 
           reminder of the frigid temperature.

                                 TAKUMI
                        We should follow river downstream.  
                        It is best way to find help.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Is that an old, Japanese survival 
                        technique?

                                 TAKUMI
                        No.  I learn on Discovery Channel.  
                        “Man Vee Ess Wild.” (Man vs. Wild)

           Arthur’s lips curl into the slightest trace of a smile.  A 
           veritable tectonic shift given his emotional intractability.

           He looks up at the sky.  The vast, dripping-black universe 
           wears a diadem of stars. 

           Takumi begins singing softly in Japanese.
           Arthur keeps his meditative gaze skyward, even after Takumi 
           finishes his short song.   

           He’s broken from his rumination when his eyes flutter.  He 
           shakes his head, rushing blood back into it.  Climbs back to 
           his feet, grimacing as he does.

                                 ARTHUR
                        We need to keep going.  Come on.

           Arthur helps Takumi up.  

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           Arthur and Takumi follow alongside the watery trail, which by 
           this point has been reduced to little more than a trickle.

           As they progress further, the water slows.  And slows.

           Until it dries out entirely.

           A beat.

                                 TAKUMI
                        What do we--

           Arthur suddenly lifts his hand, cutting off Takumi.  He 
           stares at something in the distance.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What is that?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Where?

                                 ARTHUR
                             (pointing)
                        Right there.  See?

           Arthur and Takumi stare intently into the dark forest, their 
           focus both on the same general area.

                                 TAKUMI
                        No.

           There does not appear to be anything there.

           But then --

           -- a PERSON peeks out from around a tree, only to quickly 
           duck back behind it.

           Both men are startled, but are also relieved to see they are 
           not alone. 
                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey!  Hello?

           Arthur moves closer to the tree.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I saw you look out at us.  We need 
                        help, we’re lost.

           His words are met with silence.  

           Arthur edges closer to the tree, his steps growing more 
           hesitant as he draws nearer.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hello...?

           Now less than ten feet from the tree, Arthur cautiously leans 
           to the side, trying to get a look behind it.

           As he does --

           -- the person peeks out again, then slips back behind the 
           tree.  Startled, Arthur reflexively lurches backwards.  

           It’s then he notices a slow, metronomic creaking sound.

           Tracing the source of the sound to the other side of the 
           tree, he sees --

           -- a decomposed human body hanging from an inexpertly-
           constructed noose.  Its feet dangle less than two feet above 
           the earth.

           The body slowly sways back and forth, creating the appearance 
           from afar that it was peeking out from behind the tree in 
           front of it.

           Arthur recoils from the gruesome sight, but cannot keep his 
           gaze from it for long.  

                                 TAKUMI (O.S.)
                        I have seen many others like him.

           Arthur jumps a little, startled by Takumi, clearly not 
           expecting him to have followed him.

           Removing a passport from the dead person’s back pocket, 
           Arthur is puzzled by what he sees.

                                 ARTHUR
                        He’s German.
                                 TAKUMI
                        They come from many different 
                        countries.  Japan, Germany, Russia, 
                        France, ... U.S.A.

                                 ARTHUR
                        How many?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Dozens each year.  All have lost 
                        the will to live.  Some are certain 
                        of this, others change mind.

           Arthur contemplatively examines the person’s unsightly face.

                                 ARTHUR
                        And they all travel this far?

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is what was meant for them.  
                        Distance cannot change that.

           Arthur absorbs this.  Quietly affected by its resonance.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        People come to this place because 
                        they are called here.  They think 
                        it was their discovery, their idea.
                             (beat)
                        It was not.

           An uncommon breeze passes through the treetops, pushing aside 
           branches, exposing Mt. Fuji far in the distance.

           A momentary flash of beauty.

           The wind eases back to a whisper and then vanishes entirely, 
           closing the canopy of trees above and returning Arthur’s 
           attention to their ongoing predicament.  

                                 ARTHUR
                             (re: dead person)
                        Help me with his clothes.

           EXT. AOIKIGAHARA - LATER

           Arthur assists Takumi through the forest.  Both men are 
           freezing, weakened.  They wear the dead person’s clothing 
           over their own, battling the frigid temperature.

           A rumble of thunder is heard, louder than before.

           Takumi stumbles.  Arthur is quick to grab hold of him.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Stay with me. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        So cold.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I know.  Me too.

                                 TAKUMI
                        It has not been this cold.

                                 ARTHUR
                        The past two nights?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Hai.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What did you do to stay warm?

                                 TAKUMI
                        I did not stay warm.

           Takumi clutches his quivering hands to his chest.  Arthur 
           notices that Takumi is fading again.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey, hey -- keep talking to me.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I am trying.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tell me something.

                                 TAKUMI
                        What?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Anything.  Tell me why you’re 
                        wearing a suit in the middle of a 
                        forest.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I had just left job interview.  
                        Only my second in three months.  I 
                        did not get either.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        What type of work did you do?
                                 TAKUMI
                        It was work that caused much of my 
                        troubles.  I would rather talk 
                        about something else. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Fine.  You can count for all I 
                        care, just keep talking.

           A more intense rumble of thunder is heard.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I cannot think of anything to say.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tell me about that song you were 
                        singing.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I sing song?

                                 ARTHUR
                        When we were sitting near the 
                        water. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        Don’t know.  Maybe I make up.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You kept saying the line...
                             (struggling to recall)
                        “Umi no...  Kai...” 

                                 TAKUMI
                        “Umi no kaidan,” hai.  I did not 
                        make up.  It is from old fisherman 
                        song.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What does it mean?

                                 TAKUMI
                        “A staircase in the sea.”

           Arthur is only partially tuned-in.  His purpose for this idle 
           chit-chat is preventing Takumi’s health from declining 
           further.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Do you fish?

                                 TAKUMI
                        No.  But I am most happy being near 
                        the water.  
                                 ARTHUR
                        Then, that’s what you should do 
                        when you get out of here -- you 
                        should go to the water.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I would like that very much.  
                        But... will I?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Will you...?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Get out of here.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Will you?

           A beat.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know.

           A light TAPPING is heard, slow at first, then building in 
           speed and intensity.  Followed by a loud clap of thunder.

           Freezing raindrops fall from the sky.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (re: raindrops)
                        No... no-no-no...

           The sky opens up, releasing a deluge of ice-cold rain.

           Arthur and Takumi desperately search for cover, but there is 
           none to be found.  Within seconds, they are drenched, chilled 
           to the core.

           The rain falls hard, landing with the cadence of a fast-
           approaching military brigade.  Arthur and Takumi struggle to 
           communicate over the din.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Get some branches!

                                 TAKUMI
                        What?!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Branches!
           Arthur tears a leaf-covered branch from a tree.  Then another 
           and another. 

           He then places the branches above a crevice between two large 
           rocks, constructing a rudimentary shelter.

           Takumi hands Arthur a branch, then searches for another.

           The shelter is taking shape, but it’s too little too late.  
           The rain is unremitting, powerful; the feeble shelter 
           collapses under its weight.

           Arthur splashes through shallow pools of rainwater collected 
           on the near-impermeable forest floor.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        We have... to keep going...

           It’s at that moment Arthur realizes --

           Takumi’s gone. 

           He frantically scans the dark forest, fighting to see through 
           the ribbons of falling rain.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Takumi?!!  Takumi?!!

           Arthur’s screams barely crack the towering wall of rainfall.

           Hope for finding Takumi seems to be lost.  But then, from OFF-
           SCREEN --

                                 TAKUMI (O.S.)
                        Over here!

           Arthur struggles to pinpoint where Takumi is located.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Where?!

                                 TAKUMI
                        Here!  I am here!  

           Takumi leans from the entrance of a low-lying cave he’s 
           discovered, waving Arthur over.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        Hurry!  In here!

           Arthur hurries to the mouth of the precariously-constructed 
           cave.
           INT. CAVE - SECONDS LATER

           Near total darkness.  Rain drips in through spaces between 
           rocks, but the small cave nevertheless provides life-saving 
           shelter.

           Arthur and Takumi shiver uncontrollably.  Takumi collapses to 
           the ground.

           Arthur wraps his trembling arms around Takumi.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I... have... you.

           Takumi cries.  He cannot go on much longer.

                                 TAKUMI
                             (in Japanese)
                        Please... I am so cold.

                                 ARTHUR
                        We’re going... to make it...  Do 
                        you hear me?  We’re... going to 
                        get... you home.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Kiiroi!  Fuyu!

                                 ARTHUR
                        Listen to me!

                                 TAKUMI
                        I... I...

                                 ARTHUR
                        I won’t let... this happen to you. 

           Arthur buries his face into Takumi’s shoulder.  The two men 
           huddle together, bitterly cold.  Shaking uncontrollably.

           The sound of the rain then becomes overpowered by a more 
           ominous sound.  Almost a GROAN, getting louder by the second, 
           as if getting closer.

           And closer.  And closer...

           Arthur slowly raises his head, listens.  He stares at the 
           entrance of the cave, fearing what might be approaching.

           And then it happens.

           A tremendous RUSH of flash-flood rainwater enters into the 
           cave.  It nearly fills the tiny area from ground-to-ceiling 
           in a heartbeat.
           The gelid water threatens to drown them as its level 
           continues to rise by the second.

           Arthur is first to surface; his lungs burning, gasping for 
           air.  

           Takumi has yet to surface.

           Arthur drops back underwater and grabs hold of Takumi, drags 
           him to the surface -- of which even less now remains. 

           A mere five inches separates the water from the cave ceiling, 
           with that gap closing fast.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Grab onto something!!

           Arthur takes hold of an exposed root.  The water continues to 
           rush into the cave.

           Takumi reaches for a rock outcropping, but misses.  He slips 
           back underwater.

           Arthur leans from the root, reaching for Takumi, but cannot 
           lunge far enough.  

           He stretches farther... farther... 

           His chattering teeth now bearing down hard on each other, his 
           fingertips finally make contact with Takumi’s outstretched 
           hand, when --

           -- the root SNAPS.  Arthur’s head plunges under the frigid 
           water.  It’s so cold it burns.

           Still, he grabs hold of Takumi and pulls him toward the 
           surface; however, only three inches of space remain.

           Their purple lips barely have room to break the surface of 
           the water.  They futilely push against the surrounding rock 
           walls as a continuous torrent of water floods into the cave.

           The water level closes to two inches from the ceiling...

                                 ARTHUR
                        HELP!!  SOMEBODY!!

           One inch...

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        PLEASE!!!  HEL--
           Arthur’s words are cut short when the space closes entirely.  
           Fully submerged in the freezing water, Arthur and Takumi 
           flail wildly as their oxygen quickly runs out.

           Arthur screams, emitting an unsettling bouquet of bubbles.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. RADIOLOGY OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Joan lies on her back, eyes skyward, prepared to enter the 
           claustrophobic confines of a hulking M.R.I. machine.

           Arthur stands next to her, visibly concerned.  Joan’s lightly 
           trembling hand hangs off the side of the platform, clasped in 
           Arthur’s.

           The machine HUMS to life.  Joan’s eyes meet Arthur’s.  The 
           platform slowly tracks toward the mouth of the machine.  

           Arthur walks next to her as the platform conveys closer to 
           the opening, still holding her hand.  They share a warm, 
           nervous smile.  

           Her head enters... then her shoulders...

           Arthur must finally let go of her hand.  He watches as she’s 
           swallowed whole by the machine.

           INT. DOCTOR’S CONFERENCE AREA - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Joan and Arthur sit across from DR. FITZPATRICK, (55), in 
           this small room.  His desk creates a definitive 
           doctor/patient demarcation.  

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        The M.R.I. detected a small mass.

           Joan’s head falls slightly, but she quickly lifts her chin 
           and offers a small nod.  Feigned courage.

           Arthur places his hand on her back.

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Now, there are certain instances 
                        when the shape of a mass can 
                        provide clues to whether it’s 
                        malignant...

                                 ARTHUR
                        Is this one of those instances?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        I’m afraid not.
                                 JOAN
                        So, the only way to know is a 
                        biopsy?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        I could run your blood work, but 
                        even that can sometimes be 
                        inaccurate.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What about the mass itself?  

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                             (to Joan)
                        Right now it’s pressing against 
                        your frontal lobe, which, in and of 
                        itself, could be problematic. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        So, it needs to be removed, even if 
                        it’s benign?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        I’m always reluctant to use that 
                        word.  
                             (to Joan)
                        There’s nothing benign about the 
                        surgery you’ll undergo to remove 
                        the mass.  Let’s all hope it’s non-
                        cancerous, but know that if you 
                        choose resection -- which I highly 
                        recommend you do -- your recovery 
                        will not be swift.

           Fearful tears form in the corners of Joan’s eyes, though she 
           fights to remain stolid.  

           Arthur offers comfort.  Leans in, speaks quietly to her.  
           Kisses her on the head.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s okay... it’s okay...

           See the traces of doubt on his face, as well.

                                 JOAN
                        How risky is the surgery?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        It’s a highly invasive procedure --

           Joan, cutting right to it --
                                 JOAN
                        Can I die during it?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        It’s possible.

           Arthur, providing what he feels the Doctor should say next --

                                 ARTHUR
                        But unlikely.

           Doctor Fitzpatrick cannot concur, so he doesn’t.

           Joan is terribly distraught, but still fights to keep it 
           together.

                                 JOAN
                        Okay... um, so, what now?  What do 
                        I do?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        I would take a few days to talk it 
                        over.  In the meantime, avoid 
                        caffeine.

                                 JOAN
                        Including tea?

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        Yes.  Do you smoke?

                                 JOAN
                        No.

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        Good.  What about alcohol?

           Joan does not answer.  

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Do you drink alcohol?

           In a moment of difficult self-reflection --

                                 JOAN
                        Yes.

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        Eliminate it altogether.  These 
                        things could all exacerbate the 
                        issue.

           Joan nods, accepting the directive.
                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK (CONT’D)
                        If you opt to go forward with the 
                        procedure, it will performed at 
                        Mass General.  We could transport 
                        you to a hospital closer to your 
                        home once you’re in recovery.

           Joan nods, though it’s obvious her thoughts are elsewhere.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Arthur and Joan sit at the table. 

           It’s late.  The wall clock tells us so, as do the pajamas and 
           bathrobes they wear.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You still have time to eat.  They 
                        said twelve hours before is the 
                        cutoff.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What are you?

                                 JOAN
                        Afraid.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You should be.  Your chair’s 
                        broken.

           Arthur nods toward the leg of the chair.  A wooden support 
           brace has dislodged from its fitting.

                                 JOAN
                        Why not add falling off a chair to 
                        the list?

           The brief moment of levity is a welcome respite.  

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to die there, Arthur.

           Arthur takes his wife’s hands in his.  Looks directly into 
           her eyes.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Listen to me.  You’re not going to 
                        die.  
                                 JOAN
                        It’s not the thought of dying that 
                        scares me; it’s the thought of 
                        dying there.  At a hospital.  In 
                        some cold, empty room, surrounded 
                        by people who are only there 
                        because it’s their job to be.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll see if they’ll let me stay in 
                        the operating room.

                                 JOAN
                        I don’t think they let people do 
                        that.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll try anyway.

           Joan nods, probably knowing full well Arthur won’t be allowed 
           in the operating room.

           She takes another look at the broken chair fitting.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ve had this set for a long time.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think since we got married.

                                 JOAN
                        We had it in our apartment?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I think so.  Wasn’t it a gift from 
                        your aunt?

           Joan truly couldn’t care less about the furniture.  She can’t 
           continue with the small-talk; she says what’s really on her 
           mind.

                                 JOAN
                        Promise me something.  Promise me 
                        that whenever... it’s your time, 
                        promise me you won’t be in a place 
                        like that. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m serious, Arthur.  Please 
                        promise me you’ll find a perfect 
                        place.
                                 ARTHUR
                        You make it sound like I’ll know 
                        when it’s going to happen.

                                 JOAN
                        I think you will.  Deep down, I 
                        think we all know.
                             (beat)
                        Please...?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.  I promise.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           The rushing floodwaters have ceased.  The pool of ice-cold 
           water filling the small cave is still, tranquil.

           Arthur floats, suspended in nothingness.  His cold, pale face 
           shows no sign of life.  Takumi floats next to him, similarly 
           lacking animation.  

           The water pressure affects the integrity of the rocky cave 
           wall.  A large rock shifts, then another.  And then --

           A large portion of the cave wall GIVES WAY under the pressure 
           of the water, sending a deluge gushing out of the cave.

           Arthur and Takumi’s rag-doll bodies are forced out by the 
           current, which ultimately discards both men’s frames on the 
           cold, unforgiving ground.  

           The storm has subsided.  A drizzle of raindrops fall on 
           Arthur and Takumi; however, neither of them react to the icy 
           stings. 

           Just then, Arthur’s closed eyes flutter ever so slightly.  A 
           sign of life?  Or just the residual effects of a body’s 
           systems shutting down?

           This question is answered when his fingers curl; their 
           dexterity robbed by the cold.  His heavy eyelids yawn open, 
           revealing his impaired awareness.

           His body wretches.  His lungs expel copious amounts of water.

           It takes little time for his body to understand its current 
           predicament. 

           Managing to rise to his elbows, as if fighting a thousand 
           forms of gravity, Arthur sees Takumi’s still frame draped 
           over a welter of tree roots.  
           Arthur elbow-crawls to Takumi, his shivering body denying 
           nearly every move he asks of it. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Wake up... wake up...

           Takumi is unresponsive to Arthur’s jostling.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Please... wake up.

           Arthur’s trembling fingers search Takumi’s neck for a pulse.

           Nothing.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        No... Don’t do this.  Please...

           Arthur tries again.  This time he feels something.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Yes...

           A few quick breaths into Takumi’s mouth causes a subtle rise 
           and fall in his chest.  But nothing more.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on...

           Arthur tries again with two more rescue breaths, but is still 
           unable to resuscitate Takumi.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do this...

           Arthur grows desperate, reckless.  He vigorously shakes 
           Takumi’s body.  Bangs closed fists against his chest.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Wake up!  Please, wake up!

           When all hope appears to be lost, Takumi suddenly regains 
           consciousness.  He vomits up rainwater held captive in his 
           stomach and lungs.  

           Takumi thrusts violently, involuntarily, as he is plunged 
           back into this harsh world.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay-it’s okay.  It’s me.  
                        You’re okay.
           Takumi slowly regains his faculties, only to be struck by the 
           resurgent effects of hypothermia.  He screams out in pain, 
           shakes uncontrollably.

           Arthur huddles close to Takumi.  Prevents him from injuring 
           himself further.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  We... have to... get 
                        out... of here.

           Arthur attempts to climb to his feet, but the pain from his 
           wounded abdomen is too much to bear.  He falls to his knees, 
           doubles over.

           Neither man can survive much longer in their current 
           condition.

           Shivering madly, Arthur tries again.  As he climbs to one 
           knee, he notices something in the distance.  Though difficult 
           to see in the dark, it appears to be --

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        A tent.  There’s... a tent!

           This barely registers for Takumi; he is rapidly succumbing to 
           the frigid temperature.  Seeing this, Arthur grabs Takumi 
           under his armpits.  Uses what little strength he has left to 
           drag him.

           Arthur can’t stop shivering, making the short journey 
           incredibly arduous.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           Takumi’s leg becomes ensnared on a vine.  Arthur’s inertia 
           sends him falling backwards as Takumi’s limp frame slips from 
           his grasp.

           Arthur lands hard, but soldiers on.  He again grabs hold of 
           Takumi, freeing his leg from the vine and continuing on 
           toward the tent.  

           As they move closer, the tiniest indication of hope flashes 
           across Arthur’s blanched face.  

           The tent is in surprisingly good condition.  A small tarp is 
           strung up next to it, providing cover for a fire ring made of 
           a simple collection of stones.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (to tent)
                        Hey!  Hello?!
           Still inching closer to the darkened tent, Arthur gets no 
           reply from inside.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (to tent)
                        We need... help.

                                 TAKUMI
                             (weakly, in Japanese)
                        Please...

           Still no response.  

           Arthur finally reaches the tent.  Its zipper is unzipped, the 
           door flap sways in the slight breeze.  Pushing it aside, 
           Arthur sees someone lying asleep in the dark, wrapped up in a 
           flimsy sleeping bag.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hey.  Hey!

           It’s then Arthur gets his first clear view of the person, 
           who, judging by his decomposed state, has been dead for quite 
           some time.

           Though given pause by the grisly image, that fleeting moment 
           is all Arthur can afford.  He drags Takumi into...

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Both men collapse on top of the decomposed body.  Arthur 
           yanks the threadbare sleeping bag off the corpse.  Drapes it 
           over his and Takumi’s shoulders.

           The cold is unrelenting.  The men’s sodden clothing speeds 
           the drop in their core temperature. 

           Realizing this, Arthur takes off his shirt, laboring through 
           every movement.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Your clothes...

           Takumi struggles to take off the jacket Arthur earlier gave 
           to him.  

           Both men undress, until totally naked.  Their clothing, so 
           wet and cold, sticks to patches of their skin. 

           They toss their soaked clothing aside.  Arthur strips the 
           decomposed body of its clothing.  He hands Takumi most of 
           what is collected.
           Mixed among the random assortment of items in the tent -- 
           including two paperback novels -- Arthur finds a flashlight.  
           Its bulb is very dim, but still offers some light.

           Scavenging through the tent, altogether unconcerned with the 
           dead body lying next to him, Arthur’s trembling hands happen 
           upon --

           A walkie-talkie.  

           Turning it on, he is elated to find it works.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (into walkie-talkie)
                        Hello?!  Hello?!  Does... anybody 
                        hear... me?

           More static.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Arthur holds the walkie-talkie on front of Takumi’s quivering 
           lips.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (to Takumi)
                        Say we need... help.

           Takumi musters up the strength to do so --

                                 TAKUMI
                             (in Japanese)
                        Lost in... Aoikigahara.  Send help.  

           Static.  There’s nobody out there listening.

           Arthur places the walkie-talkie down, still powered on.  He 
           rummages through some of the deceased person’s other 
           belongings.

           He finds a pack of cigarettes.  A flash of hope -- because he 
           next finds a cigarette lighter.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Oh God... yes...!

           His frozen digits struggle to roll the striker.

           Spark... spark... spark...

           But no flame.
                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on!  Please!

           Spark... spark...

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Please!!

           Spark...

           It finally catches, producing a small flame. 

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Yes!!

           He holds the flame in front of Takumi.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Put your... your hands...

           Takumi’s tremulous hands encompass the small flame.  Arthur 
           has trouble holding the lighter steady.

           The flame goes out.

                                 TAKUMI
                        No-no...

           The lighter catches on the second try.  The flame reappears, 
           but already shows signs of weakness.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Shit!

           Arthur turns off the lighter.

                                 TAKUMI
                        No, please!

                                 ARTHUR
                        We need--

                                 TAKUMI
                        Please!!

                                 ARTHUR
                        We need to... save it!

           Arthur opens the door flap.  Sees the rudimentarily-
           constructed fire ring.  Two charred logs rest within its 
           rocky borders.

           He grabs the paperback novels, tears pages from them.  Exits 
           the tent.
           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - SECONDS LATER

           Outside the tent, underneath the small tarp, Arthur has 
           arranged the logs and book pages in the fire ring.  

           Spark... spark... spark...

           And then a flame.  Arthur touches it to the book pages; they 
           ignite in a glorious, warming glow.

           EXTREME WIDE SHOT 

           of the tent, the fire ablaze in a brilliant ball of orange 
           light, juxtaposed against the stark blackness of the forest.

           Arthur’s AD-LIBBED sounds of joy are heard in the distance. 

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           The rain has stopped, but the bitter cold persists. 

           Arthur and Takumi sit close to the crackling fire, taking in 
           its warmth.  Their sodden clothes hang from a makeshift 
           clothesline to dry.

           No longer freezing, the fire offers them new life.  Both men 
           remain in various states of undress, wearing only the 
           remnants scavenged from the deceased person in the tent.

           The walkie-talkie’s volume is kept low, but emits steady 
           white noise.  

           Arthur suddenly looks around, as if having just heard 
           something.  He turns down the volume further on the walkie-
           talkie.

                                 TAKUMI
                        What is it?

           Arthur peers into the forest -- but sees nothing.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I thought I heard something.

           Takumi does not look.  Arthur again calls out.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           No response.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        You must know by now, this forest -- 
                        it is very powerful.
                                 ARTHUR
                        I know it’s very cold.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Have you tried his compass?

           Arthur picks up the deceased person’s compass.  Its needle 
           spins oddly, never settling on a direction.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s broken.

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is only broken here.  Compasses 
                        do not work in Aokigahara.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s the rock -- it’s volcanic.  
                        The high iron deposits are throwing 
                        it off. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is more than that.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You make it sound like the forest 
                        is keeping us here.

                                 TAKUMI
                        It seems to have a reason.  Just as 
                        it did for bringing us here.

           Arthur considers this for a beat, but dismisses the notion.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (re: deceased person)
                        Why do you think he brought all 
                        this stuff with him?

                                 TAKUMI
                        As I said before, some people are 
                        sure when they come, others are 
                        not.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        You think he was unsure?

                                 TAKUMI
                             (nodding)
                        And then I think he get lost.  That 
                        happen often, too.

                                 ARTHUR
                        The ribbons...
                                 TAKUMI
                        Ribbons...?

                                 ARTHUR
                        The ribbons, the strings on the 
                        trees -- I saw them on the way in.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Ah, yes.  They are to help people 
                        find their way back.  Like bread 
                        crumbs.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I wonder if one of those ribbons 
                        were his.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I wonder if any are yours.

           This catches Arthur slightly off guard.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I used actual bread crumbs.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You are Handsome.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Um... what?

                                 TAKUMI
                        You use bread crumb, like Handsome 
                        and Gretel.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hansel.  Hansel and Gretel.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Ah, yes, yes.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        You made me nervous there for a 
                        second.  

           Their sullen demeanors slowly give way to unexpected, but 
           much-needed, laughter, only to then be gradually replaced by 
           a moment of mutual introspection.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        The sky is darker.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I thought the opposite.
                                 TAKUMI
                        Is it morning yet?

           Arthur checks his watch.  Takumi notices the wedding ring on 
           Arthur’s finger.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s ten past three.

           Takumi remains focused on the ring.  The white noise from the 
           walkie-talkie fills the void.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (off Takumi’s look)
                        What?

                                 TAKUMI
                        Does she know you are here?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Who?

           Takumi does not respond.  Keeps his stare.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Who are you talking about?

           Takumi makes a subtle gesture toward Arthur’s ring.  Arthur’s 
           reaction, though small, is quite revealing.

                                 TAKUMI
                        She is why you are here.

           Arthur looks away, battling back a sudden rush of emotion.

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        What is your name?

                                 ARTHUR
                        You know my name.

           Takumi gently shakes his head: “No.”

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is something else you did not 
                        say.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Arthur.

                                 TAKUMI
                        What was her name?

           A beat.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Joan.

                                 TAKUMI
                        When did...?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Two weeks ago.

           Arthur sheds his first tear.  The numbness, the disbelief -- 
           it is no more.  It all becomes painfully real.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You must have had very nice 
                        marriage with her.

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.  No, I didn’t.  

           More tears form.  Takumi watches, quietly, listening with 
           distanced compassion. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        Was it always bad?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.  We had a lot of really great 
                        years together.  A lot of them.

                                 TAKUMI
                        What changed?

                                 ARTHUR
                        We did. 
                             (beat)
                        She was an alcoholic.  Well, a 
                        functioning alcoholic; that 
                        supposedly made it okay.  She was 
                        horrible to me sometimes, but I was 
                        even worse to her.

           Takumi’s expression does not change. 

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I had an affair a few years ago 
                        with a coworker at a research lab.  
                        I wanted to tell her, but I didn't.  
                        She found out on her own, which 
                        made it worse, I think.  Things 
                        went downhill from there; she 
                        started drinking more, we almost 
                        got divorced twice.  She never 
                        trusted me again.  I don't blame 
                        her, either.  
                                 TAKUMI
                        Did you love her?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, it was just a meaningless 
                        fling.

                                 TAKUMI
                        I meant your wife.

                                 ARTHUR
                        More than anything on earth.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Then why did you do that to her?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I just did.  Sometimes you just do 
                        things.  And as much as you’d like 
                        to take them back, you can’t.

           Arthur’s mind wanders.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        After that, it was like we kept our  
                        feelings for each other a secret.  
                        I would fix things for her while 
                        she was asleep.  Or buy her a new 
                        box of tea, only, I wouldn’t tell 
                        her.  I’d wait for when the old 
                        package wasn’t too full or too 
                        empty; this way she wouldn’t notice 
                        I refilled it and have to choose 
                        whether or not to thank me.  And 
                        she... well -- I would find my 
                        shirts hung in my closet, washed, 
                        even though I didn’t wash them.  
                        She’d purposely put them way in the 
                        back so I wouldn’t find them for so 
                        long I’d forget they were ever 
                        dirty in the first place.  This way 
                        I wouldn’t have to choose whether 
                        or not to tell her I still 
                        appreciated her.  It was this 
                        little game we had.  It was all we 
                        had.

           Arthur falters in his attempt to appear stolid.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Then she got sick.  All the years 
                        of fighting and anger -- it all got 
                        put on hold.  
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        It’s always that moment that wakes 
                        us up, you know?  Some big, life-
                        changing event that reminds us what 
                        really matters.  The problem is, 
                        the only time that moment comes is 
                        when that moment comes -- and 
                        sometimes it comes too late.

           Thick, single tears crawl down his cheek, cling to his 
           clenched jaw.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I...
                             (hesitates)
                        I didn’t come here just because 
                        she’s gone. It wasn’t because of 
                        the grief. It was because of the 
                        guilt. I was wrong to treat my wife 
                        the way I treated her, and it was 
                        wrong for her to treat me the way 
                        she did. And now, neither of us 
                        will ever, ever, ever get the 
                        chance to say I’m sorry. 

                                 TAKUMI
                        She is listening.

                                 ARTHUR
                        She’s gone.

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is during our darkest times that 
                        our loved ones are closest.  Even 
                        those who have passed.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t...

                                 TAKUMI
                        Her spirit--

                                 ARTHUR
                        Stop--

                                 TAKUMI
                        She is with you--

                                 ARTHUR
                        Don’t.  

                                 TAKUMI
                        It is true.
                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s not true.

                                 TAKUMI
                        This forest holds her for you.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Stop it, stop it!

                                 TAKUMI
                             (backing off)
                        I am sorry...

                                 ARTHUR
                        No --

                                 TAKUMI
                        I am.  Please...

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, I’m sorry.  Okay?  I’m sorry!
                             (to forest)
                        I’m sorry!  Do you hear me?  Do 
                        you?  Do you?!!  I’m sorry!!  I’m 
                        sorry!!
                             (sobbing, now sincere)
                        I’m sorry!  I’m sorry.  I’m so 
                        sorry, Joan.  I’m sorry...  

           Arthur comes undone.  Sobs uncontrollably...

           Until catharsis finally pushes its way to the surface.

           He breaths a long, restorative sigh.  Sniffs the last of his 
           tears away as he removes the pill bottle from his pocket.

           Stares at it.  Lost in a million memories.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know how to live without 
                        her.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You will not have to.  Not forever.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I wish it were that simple.

                                 TAKUMI
                        There are many words to describe 
                        death.  Simple is not among them.

           Arthur silently absorbs this.  Offers the smallest nod 
           possible.
           He then tosses the pill bottle into the fire.  The plastic 
           melts unto itself in unceremonious collapse.

           He leans back against a rock.  Stares pensively at the 
           nighttime sky. 

           Takumi quietly watches him.  The slightest suggestion of a 
           smile.

           ANGLE ON

           on the walkie-talkie, still quietly awash with static.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Sunlight gleams off the linoleum floor, split into dusty rays 
           by an outmoded set of venetian blinds.

           REVEAL

           Joan lying in bed, her head bandaged and partially shaved.  
           She appears to be in relatively good condition.

           Arthur sits vigil at her bedside, showing her a few old 
           photographs.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (re: photo)
                        I always liked that hat.

                                 JOAN
                        What happened to it?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Good question.

                                 JOAN
                        We should get you a new one.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m not sure it’s in style anymore.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m not sure it was then.

           They share a heartfelt laugh.  Arthur looks at the next 
           photo.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh yeah, the trip to lake house.  
                        When was this -- ninety-three?
                                 JOAN
                        Around there.  Ninety-three, ninety-
                        four.

           Arthur points to the polo shirt he’s wearing in the photo --

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah, because that was the old 
                        NorthLab logo.  They changed it in 
                        ninety-five.  

           Arthur stops for a moment, as if regretting his last 
           statement.  Specifically, his mention of NorthLab.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 JOAN
                        It’s okay.  Really.

           Joan looks longingly at the photo.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I loved that lake.  Waking up 
                        early, picking orchids...  

                                 ARTHUR
                        You used to put them in the 
                        windowsill. 

                                 JOAN
                        You remember that?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Of course I do.

           Arthur takes Joan’s hand in his.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        We can go back there whenever you 
                        want.

           She doesn’t share Arthur’s optimism.

                                 JOAN
                        Okay.

           Speaking earnestly --

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’re going to be all right.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m nervous, Arthur.
                                 ARTHUR
                        I know, sweetie, I know.
                             (gestures at bandages)
                        But you made it past the first 
                        hurdle.  That has to be a good 
                        sign.

                                 JOAN
                        I hope so.

           So does Arthur.  In ways he cannot express with words.  They 
           share this moment.

           When Arthur notices Joan’s mind apparently wandering toward a 
           place of distress, he’s quick to bring her back.

                                 ARTHUR
                        How about this: We’ll both get 
                        those hats.

                                 JOAN
                        Can’t I get a different hat?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Fine, but I’m going to get the same 
                        different hat.

                                 JOAN
                        What if it’s frilly?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Are you saying I can’t do frilly?

           Arthur’s greatest success, perhaps in his entire life, is 
           making his wife smile at this moment.

           DOCTOR FITZPATRICK enters, carrying Joan’s chart.

           Arthur and Joan’s smiles evaporate from their faces.

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        We finally received the results 
                        from the test.  The mass was non-
                        malignant.

           Unequivocal relief.  Joan falls into Arthur’s embrace.

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK (CONT’D)
                        How are you feeling?

                                 JOAN
                        After hearing that, I feel great.
                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        Dealing with the pain okay?

                                 JOAN
                        It’s manageable.

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        Good.  So, the plan is still to 
                        transport you over to the recovery 
                        unit at Saint Mary’s.

                                 JOAN
                        Okay.  Thank you.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, thank you. 

                                 DOCTOR FITZPATRICK
                        You’re welcome.

           Doctor Fitzpatrick exits.  

           Arthur holds his wife close to him as relieved tears stream 
           down her face.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Joan lies on a stretcher, at the back of an ambulance, still 
           beaming from the recent good news.  Arthur stands next to 
           her, sharing similar sentiments of relief and joy.

           AMBULANCE TECH #1 and #2 open the ambulance doors.  Prepare 
           to place Joan’s stretcher inside.

           Arthur hands Joan her cell phone.

                                 JOAN
                        What’s this for?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I figured you wouldn’t want to be 
                        alone.
                             (to Ambulance Tech #1)
                        It’s okay if she uses her phone in 
                        there, right?

                                 AMBULANCE TECH #1
                        Yeah, sure.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (to Joan)
                        Or I can just ride with you.
                                 JOAN
                        What about the car?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I could come back here for it.

                                 JOAN
                        No, no -- it’s too far.  I’ll be 
                        fine.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You sure?

           Joan playfully holds up her cell phone.

                                 JOAN
                        Call me.

           Arthur smirks.

                                 EMERGENCY TECH #2
                        All set.

                                 EMERGENCY TECH #1
                        Go ahead.

           The Emergency Techs lift Joan’s stretcher into the back of 
           the ambulance.

           Arthur watches as the doors are closed.

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Arthur drives behind the ambulance; both vehicles travel at a 
           normal speed down a well-traveled surface street.

           His face expresses a look of unparalleled happiness.  He 
           talks to Joan on his cell phone.

                                 ARTHUR
                        ...We should do something fun. 

                                 JOAN (V.O.)
                        It’s going to be a while before I 
                        can do much of anything.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I know, but once you can, we should 
                        do something crazy.

                                 JOAN (V.O.)
                        Like what?
                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know.  Go skydiving... or 
                        get a tatoo.  

           INT. AMBULANCE - SAME - FLASHBACK

           Joan lies atop the gurney, talking to Arthur on her cell 
           phone.

           INTERCUT - Arthur and Joan having a phone conversation.

                                 JOAN
                        What happened to frilly hats?

                                 ARTHUR
                        We can get them, too.  Right after 
                        the tattoos.  

                                 JOAN
                        I’m getting one as we speak.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Oh yeah?  Of what?

                                 JOAN
                        Of you skydiving.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        You stole my idea.

           The ambulance continues down the busy street.  Arthur follows 
           right behind it.  

                                 JOAN
                        It’s weird riding in here.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’ve never been in an ambulance 
                        before?

                                 JOAN
                        No, actually.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Really?

                                 JOAN
                        Really.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Not even as a kid?
                                 JOAN
                        No.  Why is that so hard to 
                        believe?

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s not the fact that you’ve never 
                        been in an ambulance that’s hard to 
                        believe, it’s that, after all these 
                        years, I never knew you’ve never 
                        been in ambulance.

                                 JOAN
                        I’m sure there are things about you 
                        I don’t know.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I doubt it.

                                 JOAN
                        What’s your favorite color?

                                 ARTHUR
                        You don’t know my favorite color?

                                 JOAN
                        What’s mine?

           Arthur is stymied.  Impacted by the realization of how little 
           he and his wife truly know each other.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hi, my name’s Arthur.  It’s nice to 
                        meet you.

           INT. CAR - SAME - FLASHBACK

           A traffic light up ahead turns yellow.  The ambulance 
           continues through it; Arthur stops when the light turns red, 
           watching the distance spread between him and his wife.

                                 JOAN (V.O.)
                        It’s nice to meet you, too, Arthu--

           SMASH!!!!

           A speeding TRUCK jumps the intersection from the opposite 
           side and CRASHES INTO THE SIDE OF THE AMBULANCE WITH 
           THUNDEROUS FORCE. 

           The impact tips the ambulance onto its side.  Dark smoke 
           climbs from the front end of the mangled truck and underside 
           of the ambulance.  Glass shards litter the street.
           Arthur is thrown into a panic.  He leaps out of his car.  
           Races toward the accident, recklessly jumps over debris.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Joan!!  Joan!! 

           Pedestrians on the sidewalk stop and stare.  The driver of 
           the truck falls out of the open door, covered in blood.

           Arthur cuts through the black smoke.  Reaches the back doors 
           of the toppled-over ambulance.  Tears them open.  Climbs in.

           Heard OFF-SCREEN, inside the ambulance:

                                 ARTHUR (O.S.)
                        No!!  No!!  Oh God, no!!!

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - DAWN

           An uninterrupted hum of silence.  The rainfall has stopped, 
           stars fill the cloudless sky.  

           Mt. Fuji sits silently in the distance, backlit by the 
           faintest hues of an impending sunrise.

           CLOSE ON 

           Arthur’s face.  Asleep.  The quiet sound of walkie-talkie 
           static in the b.g.  

           Arthur awakens slowly.  His confused state quickly supplanted 
           by grave concern.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL 

           the fire, left unattended, has extinguished.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Shit!  Shit-shit!

           Arthur leaps to his feet, aided by surge of adrenaline.

           He attempts to reignite the fire by frantically sifting 
           through the ash with his bare hands. 

           But nothing remains.  Not a single glowing ember.

           Arthur takes the cigarette lighter in hand.  Looks to light 
           something -- anything.  But there is nothing to light; the 
           fire has consumed all its fuel.

           The lighter never catches.  Only spark after spark.
           The crippling cold seeps back into Arthur’s core as his 
           adrenaline diminishes.  

           Takumi lies asleep.  His face wan, his blueish fingers 
           clasping the tattered sleeping bag.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Oh God...
                             (beat)
                        Get up!  Get up!!

           Takumi does not stir.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on!  Get up...

           Takumi moves ever so slightly.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        We have to go!

           Takumi’s eyes crack open.

           Arthur puts the walkie-talkie to his own mouth.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Anybody?!  Hello?

           No response.  Static.  

           Arthur yanks the mostly dry clothes off the makeshift 
           clothesline.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (re: clothes)
                        Put these on.  Quick!

           He helps Takumi into the clothes.  Not a single movement is 
           completed with ease.  Takumi fades in and out of 
           consciousness.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        No-no.  Stay with me.

           Arthur manages to cover most of Takumi.  He then dresses 
           himself.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           Arthur tries to help Takumi to his feet, but Takumi’s body 
           falls limp.
                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Takumi?  Takumi?!

           He reaches around Takumi’s waist, barely lifts him, and drags 
           his lower body across the forest floor.  A woefully 
           ineffective endeavor.

           They distance themselves from the tent.  Arthur traverses the 
           forest, bearing the weight of a human life in his enfeebled 
           arms.

           Takumi has a moment of clarity, notices they are moving 
           further from the tent.  He extends his hand toward it.

                                 TAKUMI
                        No...

                                 ARTHUR
                        We have to go.

                                 TAKUMI
                        The fire...

                                 ARTHUR
                        There’s no more fire.

                                 TAKUMI
                        The fire...

                                 ARTHUR
                        There’s no fire.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           The sun peeks over the horizon, bringing faint light but 
           little warmth.

           Arthur continues to drag Takumi across the forest.

           He stops momentarily to blow into his quivering hands -- an 
           insufficient effort at warming them.  

           He doesn’t have the strength to continue in this fashion.  
           His own body has begun to shut down.

           He falls.  Drops Takumi.  Both men land hard onto the frigid 
           ground.

           Arthur climbs back to his feet.  Grabs Takumi.  Drags him 
           another few steps before collapsing again.

           He gets back up.  Grabs Takumi.  Drags him further.  And 
           further.  Arthur’s exertion draws fresh blood from his 
           abdomen.
           He fights unbearable pain.  Impossible terrain.  Significant 
           blood loss.  

           Moving forward, inch by inch, something suddenly stops him in 
           his tracks.  

           A sound.  No, a VOICE!!

                 -- Coming from the walkie-talkie.  He rips through his 
           jacket pocket, removes the walkie-talkie.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hello?!  Hello?!  

           The Voice responds in Japanese-accented broken English.  The 
           signal is weak, disrupted by intermittent static.   

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes!  Hello!  We need help, please 
                        send help!

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        What... wro...

                                 ARTHUR
                        Send help!  We are in the forest.  
                        Aoikigahara.  We need an ambulance! 

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Where... you?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Aokigahara.  We’re lost.  I’m with 
                        someone -- he’s dying.  Please!

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Th... nea.... er... lin.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What?  I can’t understand you.  
                        What did you say?  Hello?

           The static worsens.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t hear you.  What did you 
                        say?!

           The voice on the other end is totally overcome by static.
           Arthur stuffs the walkie-talkie back into his pocket.  A 
           restored hope fuels him.

           He grabs Takumi under the arm and helps lift him to his feet.  
           Arthur bends down and lifts Takumi in a fireman’s carry.

           Arthur barely takes a step before stumbling.  He’s incredibly 
           weak.  

           He stabilizes.  Adjusts Takumi’s rag-doll frame across his 
           narrow, scientist shoulders.  Each step requires colossal 
           effort.  Strength he simply does not possess.  

           Still, Arthur endures.  His determination worthy of 
           comparison to Fitzcarraldo dragging his steamship over a 
           mountain.

           His steps become slower.  Shortness of breath, lactic acid 
           buildup in his legs.  Each new step requires a longer period 
           of recovery.  

           As Arthur takes another labored step forward --

           His foot becomes entangled in a root and he stumbles.  His 
           ankle rolls, emitting an audible SNAP.

           He screams out in pain as he collapses.  Clasps his injured 
           ankle.

           Takumi falls from Arthur’s shoulders.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Go...

                                 ARTHUR
                        No!

                                 TAKUMI
                        You can... save yourself.

           Arthur rolls over, clutching his injury.  Bears the pain with 
           clenched teeth. 

                                 TAKUMI (CONT’D)
                        Go!

                                 ARTHUR
                        I have to... help you.

           Takumi places a gentle hand on Arthur’s back.

                                 TAKUMI
                        You have, Arthur.
           The sudden clarity of this statement gets Arthur’s attention.  
           He looks at Takumi, who reaffirms his directive with a nod.

           Arthur climbs to his feet.  He is barely able to stand.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll come back here for you.

           Takumi nods again.  Barely.

           Arthur removes his long, beige jacket.  Drapes it over 
           Takumi’s shoulders.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I swear, I won’t leave you.  I’ll 
                        find help... and come back here for 
                        you.

           Takumi weakly places his hand on top of Arthur’s.

                                 TAKUMI
                        Thank you for... taking care of me.

           Arthur takes his first hobbled step.  Then another and 
           another.  Takumi watches as Arthur drifts further and further 
           away.

           INT. PARK RANGER STATION - MORNING

           A small outpost, no bigger than a little league concession 
           stand.  Two CCTV screens show black and white images of 
           different locations, one of which is recognizable as the 
           Entrance/Parking Lot of Aokigahara.

           PARK RANGER #1 sips on tea as he completes paperwork.  He 
           pays little attention to the CCTV screens.

           The station telephone rings a few times before he decides to 
           pick it up.  He speaks in Japanese.  

                                 PARK RANGER #1
                        Hello?

           Park Ranger #1 listens the caller as he looks at the CCTV 
           screen.  Nothing appears out of the ordinary.

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (CONT’D)
                        Did they know where in the forest 
                        they are?
                             (listens)
                        How did he contact you?
                             (listens)
                        What channel was it set to?
           Park Ranger #1 sets his walkie-talkie to the appropriate 
           channel.

           PARK RANGER #2 enters the Ranger Station.  Notices Park 
           Ranger #1’s concern.  Quietly gestures: “What’s going on?”

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (CONT’D)
                        I see.  Okay.
                             (to Park Ranger #2)
                        Contact Station Three and Five.  
                        Have them meet us at Aokigahara.
                             (to caller)
                        Yes.  Thank you for informing us.

           Park Ranger #1 hangs up the phone.  Swipes a set of car keys 
           from the desk and grabs his heavy parka.  

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - MORNING

           The sun has almost fully risen, but its rays struggle to 
           penetrate the thick canopy of trees.

           Arthur’s condition has worsened.  His body begins to betray 
           him.  His feet, his hands -- nothing works as it’s designed 
           to.  His chances of survival are vanishingly small.  

           He manages to place the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hello?  Anybody?

           Static.  

           Shivering uncontrollably, he limps to the base of a rocky 
           hill.  With no observable way around it, his only choice is 
           to climb.

           He loses his footing on the third step of his climb, dropping 
           him to cold, hard ground.  He lacks the dexterity to protect 
           his face.

           The impact jars him.  He lies still, his face pressed against 
           the ground, as heavy breaths spiral from his mouth.

           A single tear crawls across his cheek.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - EVENING - FLASHBACK

           Hundreds of vehicles lined up in perfect symmetry.  A cold 
           wind courses through the shallow valleys they create.

           EXTREME WIDE SHOT 
           of Arthur walking in between a long row of parked cars.  His 
           gait slow, mechanical.  What algebra would look like if in 
           human form.    

           He climbs inside his mid-range sedan.  Shuts the door.  Does 
           not start the ignition.  HOLD on this moment. 

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Night has fallen.  True darkness.  Arthur slowly enters his 
           handsome home through the front door, still wearing a 
           catatonic visage.

           The home seems so empty.  Museum-like.  Lifeless.   

           Without removing his jacket, he spiritlessly makes his way up 
           the staircase.  The carpet runner on the bottom two steps are 
           slightly discolored by the faint red stain caused by Joan’s 
           port wine.  

           Each step creaks under his burden.  The climb seems to take 
           forever.  

           In this moment, he is a tourist in his own home.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Meticulously kept.  The queen-size bed perfectly made.  

           Arthur enters the room.  His troubled mind adrift, still 
           fully clothed, he lowers himself onto the left side of the 
           bed.  His side.

           Partial fetal position.  Too shaken to sleep.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A traditional Catholic wake.  MOURNERS pay their last 
           respects.  

           An easel displays a photo collage of Joan.  Flowers adorn a 
           closed casket.

           Arthur stands in the receiving line, next to Joan’s family 
           members.  Mourners offer condolences; Arthur barely registers 
           any of this.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - LATER - FLASHBACK

           An empty room except for Joan’s casket.  Even the photo 
           collage has been taken down. 
           The overhead lights have been dimmed, the flowers have been 
           removed.  Cost-cutting and practicality dismantle the 
           illusion that death is in any way glorious.

           Rows of unoccupied chairs.  Only one is taken -- by Arthur. 

           He sits in silence.  Numb.

           The FUNERAL DIRECTOR, (68), enters.  

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        Mister Brennan?

           Arthur does not respond.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Sir...?

           Arthur finally acknowledges the Funeral Director’s presence.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        We’re locking up for the evening.  
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Can I have another minute?

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        Of course.

           The Funeral Director watches Arthur for a beat.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        It was very well-attended.  She 
                        obviously was very loved.

           Arthur responds with a small nod.

           The Funeral Director starts to walk away --

                                 ARTHUR
                        I didn’t know her.

           The statement, made abruptly, catches the Funeral Director by 
           surprise.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        I’m sorry?

                                 ARTHUR
                        My wife -- I didn’t know anything 
                        about her.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARTHUR (cont'd)
                        I mean, I knew some things -- like, 
                        the date her car insurance needed 
                        to be renewed, her Social Security 
                        number...  Things that seemed 
                        important but really meant nothing.
                             (beat)
                        But I didn’t know... her favorite 
                        color...  her favorite season.  Or 
                        even her favorite book.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        It was a children’s story.

           Arthur looks incredulously at the Funeral Director.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        I overheard her sisters talking 
                        about it earlier.  Apparently one 
                        of them ordered it for her 
                        recently.

           Arthur takes this into account, but does not respond.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        No mention of a favorite color... 
                        or season.  I’m sorry.

           Arthur offers a small, detached nod.

           A beat.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Take your time, sir.

           The Funeral Director leaves him to his thoughts.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           The visual equivalent of a fireworks display.  Colors, 
           brands, slogans -- all haloed by the overhead fluorescent 
           lights.

           Arthur walks down an aisle, carrying a basket filled with a 
           random assortment of items.  He stops.  Stares blankly at the 
           unending rows of matching items.  Like a man with a permanent 
           head cold.  

           People mill about around him, including a YOUNG MOTHER; yet 
           Arthur just stands and stares.  He’s in her way.

                                 YOUNG MOTHER
                        Excuse me...?  
                             (re: box of cereal)
                        I’m sorry, I need to grab that.
           A beat.  

                                 YOUNG MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           Arthur places his basket on the ground and exits the store. 

           INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Underfunded.  Outdated desk/chair combinations.  

           The old-fashion radiator HISSES and POPS.  Disinterested 
           students.  Among them is ERIC, (18), probably the least 
           interested of all.

           Arthur sits across from the students, his forearms resting on 
           a Formica-top table.  He is there in body, but not in mind.  

           Behind him is a large whiteboard.  Several basic physics 
           equations fill its space. 

           A young FEMALE STUDENT reads her homework aloud.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                        For twenty-four, I chose C, 2400 
                        Jouls per Kilogram.  Umm... I 
                        couldn’t figure out twenty-five. 

           An iPod-wearing Eric chimes in --

                                 ERIC
                        I couldn’t figure out any of them.

                                 MALE STUDENT
                        It’s B, potential energy.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                        For number twenty-five?

                                 MALE STUDENT
                        Yeah.

           The students look to Arthur to clear things up.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT 
                        Um... Professor?

           Arthur finally snaps out of it.  At least enough to muster up 
           a response.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Velocity... yeah, that’s right.  
           The students exchange glances.  A few in the back hold back 
           laughter.  

           INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Arthur sits in his small, well-appointed space.  Pride taken 
           in its arrangement, despite its claustrophobic dimensions.  A 
           view of the campus seen through its lone window. 

           And a small framed photograph.  Arthur and Joan -- both 
           younger, happier.

           Arthur’s full attention is paid to the photo.  There is no 
           office, no world -- there is just this image.  This woman.  

           An unexpected KNOCK on his door.  Standing there is 
           Gabriella. 

           Arthur barely acknowledges her.  

                                 GABRIELLA
                        You’re trying.  But you don’t have 
                        to.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I don’t know what else to do.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        The department will approve a 
                        leave.  I can talk to Gil.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Maybe.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Have you eaten anything?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Still, you should.  

           No response.  

           Gabriella removes a Power Bar from her work bag, puts it on 
           Arthur’s desk.

                                 GABRIELLA (CONT’D)
                             (re: Power Bar)
                        Here. 

           Arthur ekes out a gesture of thanks.
                                 GABRIELLA (CONT’D)
                        Listen... if you need anything, I’m 
                        here for you.  We all are.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Okay.

           He returns his wilted perception to the photo of his wife.

           EXT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           A frigid wind spins a smattering of fallen leaves across the 
           front lawn.  

           Arthur rakes them into sloppy piles.  Going through the 
           motions.  His expression frozen in a permanent state of 
           detachment.   

           A Post Office JEEP pulls up in front of the house.  Arthur 
           pays it no mind.  Continues raking.

           The MAILMAN approaches, holding a small collection of mail.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Been on vacation?

           Arthur’s eyes acknowledge the Mailman well before his brain 
           catches up.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Your box has been full all week.

           Arthur notices his mailbox is overflowing with mail.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I... um, I haven’t emptied it.

                                 MAILMAN
                        Right.  That’s what I’m saying.

           This conversation is going nowhere.

                                 MAILMAN (CONT’D)
                        Anyway...

           The Mailman hands Arthur his mail and returns to his jeep.  
           Drives off.

           Arthur absentmindedly thumbs through the mail he holds.  
           Bills and flyers.  And then a small manila envelope package, 
           sent from: “MINERAL SPRING BOOKSELLERS.”  
           Addressed to: “JOAN BRENNAN.”

           Arthur stares searchingly at her name as it appears on the 
           envelope.  She will never get this package.  In his hand is 
           proof that she really is gone.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Haphazardly filled with the expected welter of little-used 
           items.  Dusty artifacts of this couple’s past.

           Arthur sits behind the wheel of his car, his countenance 
           betraying emptiness.

           He inserts his key.  Turns on the ignition.  Then shuts his 
           windows.

           There he waits.  Moment by moment.  

           His muffler, begging for repair with each choke and stutter, 
           spills a dark cloud from its tailpipe.

           In time, Arthur begins to register the ugliness of his 
           surroundings.

           He turns off his ignition.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

           Dark, save for the monochromatic blue glow of an open laptop 
           screen.  Arthur enters.  Absently places his car keys on the 
           kitchen table, where his laptop is placed near a pile of 
           uncorrected exams.  

           He stares at nothing in particular.  The refrigerator fills 
           the room with a steady HUM.  

           The other chairs surrounding the kitchen table are perfectly 
           situated, except one: The broken chair on which Joan 
           previously sat.

           Arthur places his hand on this chair.  It wobbles, even under 
           his minimal pressure.  He purposely wobbles it one more time 
           while lost in a long, deliberative moment.

           His eyes close.

           But then -- they open.  A thought.  A memory, perhaps.

           Acting on it, he sits down.  Opens his laptop.  Types:

           “A PERFECT PLACE” 
           into a search bar.  He’s about to press ENTER, but stops.  
           After a ruminative beat he adds the words --

           “TO DIE” 

           -- to his search.  Finally presses ENTER.

           The entry that catches Arthur’s full attention:

           “AOKIGAHARA - THE SEA OF TREES.  THE PERFECT PLACE TO DIE.”  

           Followed by a brief description: 

           “LOCATED AT THE BASE OF JAPAN’S MT. FUJI IS AOIKIGAHARA, A 
           DENSE FOREST ALSO KNOWN AS ‘THE SEA OF TREES.’  MANY HAVE 
           DESCRIBED IT AS THE PERFECT PLACE TO DIE, PERHAPS EXPLAINING 
           THE HUNDREDS OF SUICIDES THAT OCCUR IN THE FOREST EACH YEAR.”

           He clicks to read on.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. AOIKIGAHARA - MORNING

           Arthur remains exactly where we last saw him.  Face-down on 
           the rocky hill.  Weak. Pale. Bleeding.

           Dying.

           Sun rays finally breach the cluster of treetops, transforming 
           the forest into something beautiful.

           This is where Arthur Brennan’s life will end.  In a perfect 
           place.

           But, that is no longer what he wants.  Which is why --

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                             (in Japanese)
                        Hello?  Do you read me?

           -- the sound of the Park Ranger on the walkie-talkie lifts 
           Arthur’s head from the ground.  

           In Arthur’s languished state, the Park Ranger’s voice at 
           first sounds muddled, as if submerged underwater.

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Does anybody read me?

           Arthur’s senses sharpen.  The Park Ranger’s becomes clearer.

           Arthur removes the walkie-talkie from his jacket pocket.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Hello?  Please, hello...?

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                             (in broken English)
                        This Ranger Services.  Do you copy?

           Hearing this message resuscitates Arthur.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, yes -- I copy!  I hear you!

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                        We are here -- we are in forest.  
                        Look for you.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        Where?!  Where are you?!

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                             (over static)
                        ...er ...near th... ot.  Can you 
                        m...

                                 ARTHUR
                        What?  I couldn’t understand you.  
                        Hello?!

           The Park Ranger’s voice is totally overcome by static.

           Arthur yells aloud --

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I’m here-I’m here!  Help!!

           He musters up the strength to reach for a protruding rock.  
           His fingertips scratch at it before finally gaining purchase.  
           He inches his way up the rocky hill.

           Higher... and higher.  Dragging his attenuated frame over the 
           difficult terrain. 

           His knees join in the climb.  Then his feet.  His speed 
           increases.  The top of the small hill comes within reach.

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                        What... se... ...near?

           Forcing his frame into a locked position, Arthur feverishly 
           observes his surroundings.  Searches for a landmark.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m on a hill -- somewhere...  
                        Ah...
           Everything looks the same in all directions.  

           He loses some footing on the hill, but catches himself. 

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know...

           A stunned expression suddenly takes shape on his face when 
           his eyes hook on something --

           An abnormally straight collection of stones, ascending up the 
           side of the nearby hill from which they protrude, forming --

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        A staircase!  I’m near a staircase!

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                             (mixed English/Japanese)
                        Do not understand.  I do not--

                                 ARTHUR
                        A staircase!  Umm...

           His panic momentarily ebbs, allowing a critical memory to 
           surface --

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Umi no Kaidan!  Umi no Kaidan!

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - SAME

           Park Ranger #1 listens to his walkie-talkie.  Next to him is 
           Park Ranger #2, who carries a small medical bag.

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        I’m near an Umi!  Or-or a-a kaidan, 
                        a kaidan!  Please!!

                                 PARK RANGER #2
                             (confused, in Japanese)
                        A staircase...?

           Park Ranger #1 is equally confused, but then --

                                 PARK RANGER #1
                             (in Japanese)
                        Ah -- “Winding Steps.”

           They are joined in their search by several more PARK RANGERS.

           Park Ranger #1, speaking Japanese to the others:
                                 PARK RANGER #1 (CONT’D)
                        He is near “Winding Steps.”  You 
                        two head that way.  I’ll go through 
                        the north passage!

           He puts the walkie-talkie back to his mouth.

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (CONT’D)
                             (in broken English)
                        Hello?  Are you there?  

           EXT. AOIKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           By sheer will, Arthur has reached the top of the rocky hill.  
           He now begins the more dangerous descent.

           The walkie-talkie crackles with static and the Park Ranger’s 
           indecipherable speech.  

           Slithering on his stomach, Arthur inches his way down the 
           small hillside, carefully avoiding jagged rocks.  He grabs 
           hold of a tree root.

           The static breaks.  The Park Ranger is clearly heard.

                                 PARK RANGER #1 (V.O.)
                        Hello?  Are you there?

           In haste, Arthur lets go of the root to speak into the walkie-
           talkie.  He tumbles down the rocky hill.  The walkie-talkie 
           flies from his hand, bounces down the hill.

           He comes to a hard stop at the bottom.  Grabs the walkie-
           talkie.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I can hear you!  I’m here -- I came 
                        in from the parking lot.  There was 
                        a trail... some signs...
                             (beat)
                        Hello?  Hello?!

           Radio silence.  Not even static.

           Arthur looks at the back of the walkie-talkie.  The battery 
           compartment is exposed.

           One battery is now missing.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Shit...

           Arthur frenziedly runs his hands through the leaves covering 
           the forest floor.  Where the hell is it?!!
                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Come on...

           Just then, he hears the very distant sound of an AIR HORN.

           He stops.  Listens intently.

           Seconds later, he hears it again.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - CONTINUOUS

           Park Ranger #1 holds down the button of an air horn 
           cannister.  Its ear-piercing burst echoes through the forest.  

                                 PARK RANGER #1
                             (into walkie-talkie)
                        Do you read me?  Follow sound of 
                        horn.

           No response.  Only static.  

           Park Ranger #1 sounds the air horn again.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           Arthur takes invigorated steps through the forest, stumbling 
           toward the audible beacon like a dog hunting a scent.

           His legs give from under him, but he climbs back to his feet -
           - only to fall again.

           His body simply cannot support his hope.

           But it must.  He gets back up.  

                                 ARTHUR
                             (out loud)
                        I’m here!  Hello!  I’m here!!

           The air horn sounds every ten seconds or so.

           Tears stream down his ashen face.  

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        I’m here.  I’m coming...

           He struggles to determine the direction the air horn seems to 
           be coming from.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Where...?  No...
           Suddenly, a tidal wave of relief breaks through Arthur’s 
           pained expression.  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL 

           a single ribbon, tied off on a nearby branch, stretching 
           ahead through the forest.

           Arthur grabs hold of the ribbon.  Traces his hand along it as 
           he follows its extension.

           Soon, a second ribbon appears, not far from the one he 
           traces.  

           And then a third and fourth.  This is a well-traveled path.  
           More importantly, it’s a way out.

           Arthur’s painful tears transform into tears of hope.  His 
           feet, though encumbered by injury, move fleetly.

           The air horn sounds louder.  Closer.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                             (yelling aloud)
                        Over here!  I’m over here!

           They’re close -- but where are they?!!

           Arthur’s adrenaline soon begins to abate.  His pace slows, 
           his voice weakens.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Please... 

           Slower and weaker.  Slower... and weaker...

           Arthur’s enervated hand lets go of the ribbon.  He tries to 
           follow the trail, but his vision becomes blurry.

           His feet take him on an unintended journey away from the 
           ribbon.

           He wanders further.  His senses dull.  The air horn suddenly 
           sounds so soft, so distant.

           His feet begin a process of deceleration.  Time increases 
           between each lumbering step.  

           Until his feet stop completely.  He falls to his knees.

           The world begins to lose all its sharp edges as Arthur fights 
           to remain conscious.
           EXT. AOIKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           Park Ranger #2 notices something up ahead.  Racing forward, 
           he sees --

           -- Arthur, doubled over.

           He immediately calls this in over his walkie-talkie.

                                 PARK RANGER #2
                             (in Japanese)
                        I see him!  Near South trail!

           Park Ranger #2 runs toward Arthur.

           Moments later, other Park Rangers appear in the distance, 
           approaching from various directions.

           Park Ranger #2 finally reaches Arthur.  Takes hold of him.

                                 PARK RANGER #2 (CONT’D)
                             (broken English)
                        Sir, are you okay?!  Sir?

           Arthur slowly opens his eyes.  Stares blankly.

           The other Park Rangers arrive.  One wraps Arthur in an 
           emergency blanket.  Another compresses his wound with a gauze 
           pad.

                                 PARK RANGER #2
                             (Japanese)
                        We have to hurry.  Get emergency 
                        units on the radio.
                             (to Park Ranger #1)
                        Grab his legs.

           The Park Rangers carefully pick up Arthur, carry him. 

           He attempts to speak as the Park Rangers move swiftly through 
           the forest.

                                 ARTHUR
                        He’s still in there... No... you 
                        have to get him...

           He fades in and out of consciousness.

           EXT. NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           A group of EMTs await the Park Rangers’ arrival.  The Rangers 
           soon emerge from the forest, carrying Arthur.
           The EMTs place Arthur atop a gurney.  Waste no time putting 
           him inside the ambulance.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You have to find h...

           Arthur’s nearly incoherent pleas are silenced by the oxygen 
           mask placed over his face.

           The ambulance doors are shut.  The ambulance speeds off, 
           leaving the Park Rangers behind.  

           Park Ranger #1 regards the row of empty cars.  Shakes his 
           head.  It’s impossible to understand this level of grief.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Bright sunlight fills the room.  You can almost feel the 
           warmth.

           Lying comfortably in bed is Arthur.  Color has been restored 
           to his face, his health has returned.

           He scribbles on a small note pad of hospital stationary.

           A ridiculous Japanese TV game show plays in the b.g.

           DR. TAKAHASHI enters.  His English is perfect.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI
                             (re: game show)
                        We do play baseball, you know.

                                 ARTHUR
                        This is more fun to watch.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI
                        If you say so.  Let me take a look.

           Dr. Takahashi pulls aside the small bandage covering Arthur’s 
           abdomen, revealing a well-healed, sutured wound.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI (CONT’D)
                        It’s healing nicely.  How are you 
                        feeling?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Better.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI
                        Better’s good.  Better’s very good.
           Dr. Takahashi shines a pen light into Arthur’s eyes, checking 
           his pupils.

                                 ARTHUR
                        That’s bright.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI
                        It’s a light shining right in your 
                        eyeball.  It should be.

           Dr. Takahashi completes his check-up.  He notices Arthur’s 
           scribbled notes on the stationary.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI
                             (re: game show/scribbling)
                        Don’t tell me you’re playing along?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No, this is... no.

           Arthur puts the paper aside.  Dr. Takahashi does not pry.

           As he leaves, he throws Arthur the remote control.  It lands 
           on the bed.

                                 DR. TAKAHASHI
                        Channel five.  It’s the seventh 
                        inning.

           On that suggestion, Dr. Takahashi exits.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - OFFICE - DAY

           Arthur, now dressed in his own clothes, sits on a small couch 
           across from a female MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST.  Her English 
           is nearly perfect.

           She jots down notes on a clipboard.  

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Why did you go to Aokigahara?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Because it wasn’t working.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        What wasn’t?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Moving on.  

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Did you go there to end your life?
                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Do you still want to end your life?

                                 ARTHUR
                        No.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        That is the truth?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I have no reason to lie.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        We need to know you will not harm 
                        yourself.  We cannot release you 
                        otherwise.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m telling you the truth.

           The Mental Health Specialist looks at him searchingly. 

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Do you miss your wife?

                                 ARTHUR
                        What kind of question is that?

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        An important one.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I miss her tremendously.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Do you feel depressed?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Of course I do. 

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Were you depressed before?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I was numb.  Depressed oddly seems 
                        like a step in the right direction.

           The Mental Health Specialist takes note.
                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        What do you plan to do after you 
                        leave hospital?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Go back to the forest.

           Her pen stops moving.  Her eyes lift from the clipboard.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I made a promise to someone.  I’m 
                        going to keep it.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        You’re speaking of the other person 
                        who was with you?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I have to find him.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        As I understand it, the Park 
                        Rangers already tried.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s a big forest.  Trust me.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        There’s a video camera in the 
                        parking lot --

                                 ARTHUR
                        I know, I saw it.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        And it saw you on the day you 
                        entered the forest.  The Rangers 
                        reviewed the footage from the day 
                        you said he entered.  No one 
                        entered Aokigahara that day.

                                 ARTHUR
                        That can’t be the only way in.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        It’s the most convenient way.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I doubt he cared much about 
                        convenience at that point.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        You entered through the parking 
                        lot, so apparently you did.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Look, I was there with someone, 
                        okay?  I don’t know which way he 
                        walked in or even what day he 
                        actually got there, but when I left 
                        him, the guy was dying.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        The fact remains, without any 
                        visual confirmation, we have no way 
                        of identifying him, and therefore 
                        no way of notifying his family.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Takumi Nakamura.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        There are thousands with that name.

           Arthur removes a small note pad from his pocket -- the 
           hospital stationary.  Reads his scrawled notes.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        He’s about my height.  He said he 
                        worked in an office, but he lost 
                        his job.  He’s married to a woman 
                        named Kiiroi, has a child -- 
                        Fuya... or Fuyu. 

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                             (confused, skeptical)
                        Kiiori and Fuyu?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Something like that.

           This information clearly helps little, if at all.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                             (slightly exasperated)
                        Mister Brennan...

           Arthur realizes he’s reached an impasse.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        I’m telling you, he’s in there 
                        somewhere. 

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        I don’t doubt that.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Do you know if the Rangers found a 
                        tent?  I left him near a tent.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARTHUR (cont'd)
                        He could’ve even crawled back 
                        inside it.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        It’s been two weeks...

                                 ARTHUR
                        Twelve days.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Still.  The cold alone would have 
                        been too much, never mind the 
                        condition you said he was in.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Just answer me.  Did they find a 
                        tent?

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Yes.
                             (beat)
                        There was no sign of the person you 
                        described.

           This hits Arthur quite hard.  It takes a moment for him to 
           recover.  

                                 ARTHUR
                        So, that’s it?  I should just... 
                        what?  

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        I think you should go back home, 
                        begin taking steps to improve your 
                        life, and forget about Aokigahara.

                                 ARTHUR
                        The reason I’m still here, the 
                        reason I want to be here, is 
                        because of what happened in that 
                        forest.  I told him I would go back 
                        there for him; that’s what I’m 
                        going to do.

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST
                        Mister Brennan...

                                 ARTHUR
                        It’s what I’m going to do. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON 
           a thin line of ribbon, unfurling foot by foot across tree 
           branches.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL 

           Arthur, holding the spool of ribbon, marking his trail as he 
           traverses deeper into...

           INT. AOKIGAHARA - DAY

           He scans the forest as he limps slightly -- his injured ankle 
           not fully healed. 

                                 ARTHUR
                             (calling out)
                        Takumi...?  Hello...?

           After several more steps, the spool is emptied.  Undaunted, 
           Arthur removes a new spool from his jacket pocket, ties off 
           the ribbon’s end to a branch and resumes his walk.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           The sun will soon be setting.  The temperature drops 
           accordingly.

           Arthur’s gait has slowed slightly.  His breaths are deeper, 
           require more effort.  

           His ribbon is the only one that remains; gone are the 
           intersecting pathways marked by grief-stricken travelers.  

           He stops to catch his breath.  Looks around.  His isolation 
           is frighteningly apparent.  It’s then he sees something far 
           off to his left that gives him pause --

           A familiar clearing.  Its area distinct from the surrounding 
           woods.

           Moving toward it, Arthur sees --   

           The manila envelope he left behind, addressed to Joan.  It’s 
           still at the base of the tree at which he formerly sat.  

           Next to the envelope are chalky remnants of the prescription 
           pills he had previously dropped.  

           This landmark proves he’s on the right track.

           He slips the manila envelope into his pocket.  Continues his 
           search.  
           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - LATER

           The sun has almost completely set behind Mt. Fuji.  A narrow 
           strip of red sunlight is all that remains of the day.

           Arthur carries on, still marking his pathway with ribbon.

           Until --

           The spool reaches its end.  He searches his coat pocket for a 
           new spool, then the other.  Both are empty.  

           He stares ahead into the vast expanse of forest before him.

           A beat.

           He forges ahead, abandoning his lifeline.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           A breeze undulates the treetops, exposing the inauspicious 
           presence of storm clouds.

           Arthur peers over his shoulder, watching as his ribbon falls 
           deeper and deeper into the background with each step.

           He removes the hospital stationary pad from his pocket.  
           Tears off a blank page, crumbles it, drops it to the ground.  
           Once further ahead, he does the same again.

           EXT. AOKIGAHARA - MOMENTS LATER

           Arthur’s pace has slowed considerably. 

           Storm clouds saturate the sky.  Block out much of what little 
           sunlight remains.  

           His stationary pad is running low on sheets of paper.

           His eyes suddenly widen.  He sees the fire ring that was once 
           situated next to the now-removed tent.

           He scans the forest. 

                                 ARTHUR
                             (aloud)
                        Takumi?!  Takumi?!

           He looks left, right.  No sign of Takumi.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        Takumi?!  Tak...
           Arthur’s words are cut short at the sight of an arresting, 
           distant image --

           An amorphous, beige shape.

           He hurries closer.  Begins to make it out.  

           A body -- someone awkwardly splayed across a raised portion 
           of earth, wearing a beige jacket.  Arthur’s jacket.  The one 
           he left behind with Takumi.

                                 ARTHUR
                             (sotto)
                        No...

           But when Arthur reaches the top of the small hill, he finds --

           -- an empty jacket.  Looking around, able to see for great 
           distance in all directions, Arthur does not see any trace of 
           Takumi.  It is as if he simply vanished.

           Arthur’s chin falls to his chest.  Defeated, the last balled-
           up sheet of stationary slips from his fingers.

           Aware of his failure, and equally exhausted from his effort, 
           Arthur pulls his discarded beige jacket from the ground.

           Just then --

           His expression changes to one of utter astonishment.  As 
           Arthur stands, thunderstruck, staring at something on the
           ground, WE HEAR --

           VOICE-OVER AUDIO FLASHBACKS:

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...Things are not as they seem 
                        here.

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...This forest is what you would 
                        call purgatory. 

           Arthur’s mind begins to race...

                                 MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST (V.O.)
                        ...The Rangers reviewed the footage 
                        from the day you said he entered.  
                        No one entered Aokigahara that day.

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        Look, I was there with someone, 
                        okay?
                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...It is during our darkest times 
                        that our loved ones are closest.  
                        Even those who have passed.

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        Don’t...

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)(CONT’D)
                        She is with you. ... The forest 
                        holds her for you.

           His face slowly falls slack...

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...What was her name?

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        Joan.

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...I am most happy being near the 
                        water.

                                 JOAN (V.O.)
                        ...I loved that lake.  Waking up 
                        early, picking orchids.

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        ...We had a lot of really great 
                        years together.  A lot of them.

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        What changed?

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        We did.  

                                 JOAN (V.O.)
                        ...Because God forbid you take care 
                        of me for once.

           Tears form in the corners of his eyes as a startling 
           revelation takes shape.

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        ...I didn’t know her favorite 
                        color.  Her favorite season.  Or 
                        even her favorite book.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        It was a children’s story.
                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...You use bread crumb, like 
                        Handsome and Gretel.  

           Arthur’s eyes drift to the crumbled sheet of stationary on 
           the ground.  His “bread crumb” trail.

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        Hansel.  Hansel and Gretel.

           Arthur removes the manila envelope from his jacket pocket.  
           Tears it open.  Inside, he finds --

           A book.  “HANSEL AND GRETEL”.  

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        ...I guess one of them ordered it 
                        for her recently.

           Arthur stares at the book.  Astounded.

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...Did you love her?

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        More than anything on earth.

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...Thank you... for taking care of 
                        me.

           The clouds above exhale.  But not with rain.  With snow.  

                                 ARTHUR (V.O.)
                        ...I don't know how to live without 
                        her.

                                 TAKUMI (V.O.)
                        ...You will not have to.
                             (turns into Joan’s voice)
                           Not forever.

           Tears cascade down Arthur’s face as snow falls gently on The 
           Sea of Trees.

           REVEAL

           what Arthur saw when he lifted the beige jacket from the 
           ground, and what he still stares at now --

           A fully bloomed ORCHID, sprouting through the unfavorable 
           soil.  Tiny flakes of snow land on its fragile petals.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Arthur alone in his row, peering out the window.

           The “Hansel & Gretel” book open, resting on his lap.  

           A Japanese FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches with the food service 
           cart.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Would you like breakfast, sir?

           Arthur registers the question right away.  The fog has 
           lifted.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes.  Thank you.

           He closes his book, but first marks his page with a small 
           slip of paper -- specifically, the sheet of hospital 
           stationary on which he previously scrawled notes.  

           The Flight Attendant hands him a tray of food.  

           EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Arthur crosses the open-air level where he abandoned his car.  
           A light dusting of snow covers other vehicles.

           He soon finds his car.  Partly surprised it’s still there.

           The door is unlocked, just as he left it.  He climbs inside.  
           The keys still hang from the ignition.

           He starts the car.  A few strokes of the windshield wipers 
           clears away the collected snow.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           The front door opens, Arthur enters.  Hangs his coat.  Takes 
           in his familiar surroundings.

           He turns up the thermostat.

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Dressed for bed, Arthur sleeps soundly under the covers.  

           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Arthur dresses for work.  Buttons up his shirt.  Notices a 
           small stain on the sleeve.
           INT. BRENNAN RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The closet door opens.  Arthur stands in an undershirt.  His 
           hand glides across his small inventory of clothes, but then 
           reaches toward the back of the closet.

           He pulls a crisp, clean Oxford shirt from the rack.

           INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - OFFICE - LATER

           Arthur stands by his one window, wearing the same Oxford 
           shirt.  He transplants the orchid into a small pot.  Places 
           the framed photo of him and Joan next to it.

           The copy of “Hansel & Gretel” sits on his desk.  The 
           scribbled-on sheet of hospital stationary still serves as its 
           bookmark.  

           Gabriella walks by.  She stops, surprised to see Arthur’s 
           door partially open.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Arthur.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hi.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        How are you?

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’m doing better.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        That’s good.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        We tried calling you...

                                 ARTHUR
                        I was away for a little while.

           Not wanting to pry, Gabriella delicately changes the subject.

                                 GABRIELLA
                             (re: orchid)
                        It’s pretty.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yeah.  I think so, too.
           Arthur smiles thinly.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Listen... I might not be able to 
                        teach my intro course next 
                        semester.  I’m sure Gil would be 
                        fine with you teaching it.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I, um... I think this might be it 
                        for me.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        Oh.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I talked to some people I know at 
                        Piedmont.  They have openings in 
                        their lab.

                                 GABRIELLA
                        That’s great.  Good for you.

           Arthur’s gratitude is evinced with small smile.  

           A KNOCK at the door.  Eric, Arthur’s student, pokes his head 
           in the office.

                                 ERIC
                        Professor?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yes, Eric?

                                 ERIC
                        I have a question about the 
                        homework from a few weeks ago.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’re just getting to it now?

                                 ERIC
                        Um, yeah.
                             (re: Gabriella)
                        I’ll come back...

                                 GABRIELLA
                        No, no stay.  I have to get to 
                        class.
                             (to Arthur)
                        Welcome back.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Thanks.
           Arthur pulls up a chair for Eric.  They both sit.

                                 ARTHUR (CONT’D)
                        What can I help you with?

                                 ERIC
                        I didn’t understand the section on 
                        Colin’s Law.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Coulomb’s Law.  That’s a good 
                        one...

                                 ERIC
                        None of them are good.

                                 ARTHUR
                        It is, I’m telling you.  Let’s take 
                        a look.  When you have an electro-
                        static force of attraction or 
                        repulsion, it’s directly 
                        proportional to what?

           Eric, not fully paying attention --

                                 ERIC
                        Yellow winter.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Yellow winter?

           Eric points to the copy of “Hansel & Gretel”.

                                 ERIC
                        The paper -- it says yellow winter.

           Arthur looks at the slip of hospital stationary protruding 
           from the book.  Some of his scribbling is visible.

           Eric removes the sheet of stationary from the book.  Points 
           to what’s written on it.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Right here.  Yellow winter.  Well, 
                        you wrote yellow and winter.

           Arthur sees that Eric is pointing to Kiiroi and Fuyu.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You speak Japanese?

                                 ERIC
                        My dad was stationed in Okinawa.  I 
                        went to grade school there. 
                                 ARTHUR
                        Wait -- those aren’t names?

                                 ERIC
                        Not really.  They’re a color and a 
                        season.

           The significance of this is not lost on Arthur.  A small, 
           knowing smile forms as he considers the possibility of this 
           serendipitous discovery.  

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Um, Professor...?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Hmmm?  Oh, right -- so, it’s 
                        directly proportional to the 
                        electrical charges...

           As Arthur continues with his instruction --

           ANGLE ON 

           the photo of Joan and Arthur resting on the windowsill, next 
           to the orchid.  

           Outside the frosty window, a light snow falls over yellow 
           rays of sunlight. 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           The sights and sounds of springtime.  The placid water offers 
           a mirrored perspective of the surrounding beauty.

           In the distance, a small LAKE HOUSE.  A narrow trail runs 
           from it to the water’s edge, unwinding through a striking 
           field of orchids.

           Arthur walks down the trail, carrying an object covered with 
           a plastic shopping bag.

           Time has been good to him.  He looks healthy, happy.  He 
           wears a polo shirt, emblazoned discreetly with the company 
           name and logo for “PIEDMONT SCIENTIFIC”.

           He finds what he apparently deems a suitable patch of soil.  
           Kneels down, unveils what was covered with the plastic 
           shopping bag --

           The orchid.  Like him, it has grown stronger.  More alive.
           Arthur transplants the flower, placing it among the thousands 
           of others like it, forever making it part of this perfect 
           place.

                                                       FADE OUT:

                                          THE END
