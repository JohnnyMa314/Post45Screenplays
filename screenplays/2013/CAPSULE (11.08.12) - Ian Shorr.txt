           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           A MAN, gazing out the window of his high-rise hotel room over 
           downtown Los Angeles. Dawn light knifes through the smog. 

           CLOSE ON MR. PARK. 30’s, Korean, handsome, everything in its 
           right place. Except for what’s in his eyes: concealed panic. 
           From somewhere, we hear a recording of a MAN’S VOICE--

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                             (in Korean, subtitled)
                        I know what I’m asking is not easy.

           The voice is that of an older gentleman, steeped in nicotine 
           and unspoken tragedy. And it’s tinny, digital, occasionally 
           distorted. Like it’s being beamed in from another planet. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        But there are times at which we 
                        must make compromises with 
                        ourselves in order to survive.

           Off a table, he grabs a small shiny CAPSULE -- flawless 
           silver titanium, no bigger than a lipstick tube. Ponders it.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        I ask you to think of your future.

           CUT TO: Park’s hands weave an impeccably knotted tie.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) 
                        Our future.

           CUT TO: a drawer opening. An AUTOMATIC HANDGUN within. Park 
           lifts the weapon. Unfamiliar with its weight. The ticking of 
           the clock becomes the paranoid percussion of our SOUNDTRACK.

           EXT. LACMA - DAY

           WHAM! A taxi door slams shut, Mr. Park walks on...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        At 1:17 today, she will be in the 
                        upstairs gallery of the Museum Of 
                        Contemporary Art, wearing a red 
                        half-length coat. She’ll be alone.

           ...toward the white-and-red compound of LACMA.
           INT. LACMA - DAY

           ...into the massive, pale caverns of the quiet museum. 
           Passing colorful pop-art sculptures. His eyes scan...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Look for the hallway directly east. 
                        It will be empty. This is where 
                        your window will present itself.

           Park looks at the narrow hall to his right. Empty. Secluded.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Afterwards, go to staircase B...

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Park glides down a flight of steps marked STAIRCASE B.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Go to the 6th street exit...

           SIDE DOORS SLAM OPEN, he looks out into the VACANT ALLEY. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        There will be a car waiting. You’ll 
                        be taken to LAX, where you’ll catch 
                        the 3:35 flight back to Seoul. Then 
                        all of this will be in the past.

           INT. LACMA, BATHROOM - DAY

           WHOOSH! A faucet turns on, Park splashes water onto his face. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O)
                        I trust you to see this through.  

           Park takes a deep breath... then lunges into a stall to PUKE.

           INT. LACMA, UPSTAIRS GALLERY - DAY

           DING! An elevator opens and wan-faced Park steps out into the 
           gallery. Across the room, there’s a GLAMOROUS YOUNG WOMAN in 
           a red half-length coat, $500 haircut, Manolo flats, camera-
           bag over her shoulder, eyeing a painting. Call her MEREDITH. 

           Park makes his move. Fast. Auto-pilot. Reaching into his 
           jacket for his gun... when Meredith catches his reflection in 
           the glass frame and she turns around.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Hi.

           She’s not scared. She’s simply... expectant. Like this is the 
           opening of a blind date. For a beat, neither speaks.
                                 MEREDITH
                        ...are you looking for--

           WHAM! Park grabs her, whirls her around, gun jammed into her 
           back. Meredith goes rigid.

                                 MR. PARK
                             (gestures to the hall)
                        That way. Now.

           Gun held tight to her spine, he guides the scared-shitless 
           woman out of the gallery room and into THE HALLWAY...

                                 MEREDITH
                        I don’t-- I don’t understand--
                             (he keeps her moving)
                        Tell me what’s going on, I--

                                 MR. PARK
                        Don’t move.

           He’s guided her AROUND A CORNER, into a secluded alcove. 
           Meredith sizes up her situation... loosens her bag strap.

                                 MR. PARK 
                             (raises the gun)
                        I’m sorr--

           She SPINS and SWINGS her camera-bag at him, belting the gun 
           out of his hand, sends it sliding across the floor. Park 
           WHIRLS to grab the gun, Meredith’s already sprinting away--

                                 MEREDITH
                        HELP! HELP ME, HE’S GOT A GUN--

           Park DIVES, grabs his pistol off the floor and GIVES CHASE 
           INTO THE GALLERY, where we track predator and prey as they 
           haul ass through this menagerie of oversized artwork.  

           Park GUNS AFTER HER, bullets reducing neon sculptures to 
           fragments. Wild SPRAY-AND-PRAY. A big plastic city-scape 
           piece ERUPTS as ammo slams it, Meredith scrambles away and--

           A BULLET ZIPS THROUGH HER JACKET, bringing a spray of blood. 
           She HOWLS, goes stumbling around a corner. Mr. Park, 
           breathing hard, stalks along a trail of SPILLED BLOOD...

           AROUND THE CORNER

           ...where he finds Meredith, bleeding, trying to crawl away. 
           Sensing him looming over her, she garbles her last words:

                                 MEREDITH
                        ...why?...

                                 MR. PARK
                        You’ll leave me no choice.
           And off the BLAM of his gun, we SMASH TO:

           EXT. LACMA, BACK ALLEY - DAY

           Doors get KICKED OPEN, into the alley comes Park -- speckled 
           in blood, shell-shocked, still clutching the pistol....

           --and he FREEZES. Because, as promised, there is a car 
           waiting for him. Only problem is, it’s a COP CAR. Make that 
           FIVE cop cars. Park goes still. Realizing he’s been had...

                                 COPS
                        DROP THE GUN!/PUT IT DOWN!

           Park faces down the cops, as the sound drains away...

                                 MR. PARK
                             (in Korean, subtitled)
                        My apologies. I’ve been misled.

           BLAM! He shoots himself in the temple, sends grey-matter 
           confetti all over the alleyway. Crumples to the street. And 
           as he collapses, something falls out of his pocket...

           The CAPSULE we saw earlier. We follow it... and as it rolls 
           away, something odd happens: it starts to DISINTEGRATE. A 
           million bits becoming unglued, trailing into vanishing dust. 

           As if it’s being erased from reality.

           The light goes out of Park’s eyes. The capsule crumbles into 
           NOTHING. Cops’ shoes rush through the space it just occupied.

           As if it were never there at all.

           SMASH TO TITLE CARD:

                                   C  A  P  S  U  L  E

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           He lies alone. In last night’s clothes, on the couch in his 
           shabby living room. ELLIOT LOCKHART: 30, hangdog from a diet 
           of snark and self-contempt. His eyes are blue, dilated, and 
           deserted. On a cushion, his fingertip traces little designs; 
           old habit, what he does when he’s thinking.

                                 ELLIOT’S RINGTONE
                             (woman’s voice)
                        Pick me up, Elliot, I’m ringing, 
                        I’m ringing, I’m ringing, pay 
                        attention to meeee....
           Elliot digs his phone out from the forest of empty beer 
           bottles on the coffee table, shuts off the ringtone that he 
           no longer finds cute but still can’t bring himself to change. 
           On the other line, CRAIG BOLLINGER, all alpha-male bonhomie.

                                 CRAIG (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Ready to greet the day, rockstar?

                                 ELLIOT
                             (squeezes his temples)
                        Yep, just... finishing my yoga.

           What we’ll gather about Elliot: no matter how much he’s dying 
           inside, he always puts up a front of insouciant good humor.

                                 CRAIG
                        Funny, you sound like you spent 
                        last night in the Downward Facing 
                        Drunk position.

                                 ELLIOT
                        They started putting Cracker Jack 
                        prizes in bottles of bourbon. Spent 
                        the evening trying to fish mine 
                        out.

                                 CRAIG
                        Gotta stop that shit, brotha--

                                 ELLIOT
                        It had this amazing decoder ring. 
                        Had to have it. Matches my new tie.

                                 CRAIG
                        You’re a sick man. Get downstairs, 
                        we’re late.

           Elliot woozily gets off the couch... and starts undoing what 
           he did the night before. We sense that we’re looking at the 
           aftermath of a regular, deeply unhealthy ritual.

           --On a turntable, A RECORD SPINS -- soundless except for the 
           needle-click. Elliot switches it off. Throws away bottles.

           --Turns on the TV, mostly so he can ignore it. The news plays  
           the “LACMA Murder-Suicide” story. Our pals Park and Meredith.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        --victim has been identified as Los

           leaves, we focus on its contents. There’s framed award in 
           there: Popular Science 2009 Innovator Of The Year.

           EXT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Down to the street goes Mr. Innovator Of The Year, where he 
           looks around for his ride; no sign of it. Then--

           VROOOOOOM! A gleaming Aston Martin roadster suddenly zooms at 
           him, about to hit him head-on. Elliot stands there, unmoving. 
           (Welcoming it?) SCEEE! The car smokes to a stop at his knees. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Had to test the brakes.

                                 ELLIOT
                        They work. 

           At the wheel is CRAIG BOLLINGER: 30’s, on the wonky side, but 
           with a jaunty aplomb that comes from recently having become 
           the coolest guy in the room. As Elliot makes for the door, 
           they fall into their familiar, ball-busting rhythm.

                                 ELLIOT
                        So... you murdered a British secret 
                        agent and stole his car?

                                 CRAIG
                        Hey, just saying, you kill someone, 
                        you get to take their shit.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Principle our country’s founded on.
                             (shuts himself in)
                        Thanks for the ride, repairman says 
                        it’ll be another week. Think I’m 
                        putting his kid through Harvard.  
                                 CRAIG
                        On to more fun things. Wanna see 
                        how fast she does 60?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Hurt me.

           WHAM! Craig pulverizes the gas pedal, Elliot slumps back, 
           seatbelt-less, and they tear off into SAN FRANCISCO.

           INSIDE THE MOVING CAR

           Wind whips at them as they gun towards downtown, Elliot 
           nursing brain cells back to life with a cup of cheap coffee.

                                 CRAIG
                        So I’m at his house, right, and you 
                        know what he’s got in there? I’m so 
                        not shitting you -- a glass-
                        bottomed swimming pool built into 
                        the ceiling. ‘Course it’s 3 AM by 
                        this point and the party’s gotten 
                        kinda wild, so every time you look 
                        up it’s like getting a design 
                        course in female anatomy--

                                 ELLIOT
                        That must have been life-affirming.

                                 CRAIG
                        It didn’t suck.
                             (glances at him)
                        Look, I would’ve invited you, but--

                                 ELLIOT
                        I understand.

           They ride in silence for a moment.

                                 ELLIOT
                        So what you’re telling me is, all I 
                        have to do is show up at one party 
                        at Jonathan Wilkes’ place, then 
                        Altria will start to worry that I’m 
                        getting head-hunted, and the next 
                        thing I know, they’ll have an Aston 
                        Martin waiting for me in the lot.

                                 CRAIG
                        Look... I’m on a hot streak, you’re 
                        on a cold one. But in the history 
                        of the world, there’s never been a 
                        streak that lasted forever. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        That’s a shame, I was just getting 
                        used to this.
           As they speed on, we hear...

                                 FRANKLIN GANTT (PRE-LAP)
                        At Altria, we create the technology-

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, LOBBY - DAY

           There’s a VIDEO playing on a screen -- CEO FRANKLIN GANTT 
           (60’s, graying, sleeves rolled up) addressing the camera as 
           imagery of green tech goes past in the background. 

                                 FRANKLIN GANTT (V.O.)
                        --that makes tomorrow brighter.

           Elliot and Craig wipe frame, walking through the Altria 
           lobby, nodding hi to the RECEPTIONIST, passing the SECURITY 
           GUARD as they head for the elevators. Each climbing into 
           separate cars; Craig’s going up, Elliot’s going down.

                                 PRESCOTT (PRE-LAP)
                        You have the time, Elliot?

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, BASEMENT - DAY

           Cubicles in a windowless basement. As his computer plays 
           screensavers of SAILBOATS and crystalline water, Elliot looks 
           up at DAVE PRESCOTT, his boss -- five years his junior. An 
           Ivy-twerp Master Of The Universe who loves that he gets to 
           crack the whip on this former wunderkind.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...9:13?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        9:13. Your shift starts at nine.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Yeah, sorry, I--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Look, let me be candid...
                             (sits by him, leans in)
                        I’m the youngest guy ever to run a 
                        department at this company. No 
                        one’e ever been fast-tracked like 
                        me. Do you know why that is?

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...“People Skills?”
                                 PRESCOTT
                        Because the first thought that goes 
                        through my head when I wake up in 
                        the morning is “I am gonna kick 
                        this job’s ass.” What’s the first 
                        thought that goes through yours?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I think it might scare you.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Scare me.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I think about what’ll happen the 
                        day I clock in here and realize 
                        I’ve forgotten to take my meds.

           A beat. Then Prescott cracks up laughing, shaking his head...

                                 PRESCOTT
                        ...you are, hands down, the biggest 
                        self-saboteur I’ve ever met.
                             (hands him a folder)
                        Glitch in the D-160’s, you’re 
                        staying late.

           Prescott walks off. Elliot, dead-eyed, turns to his work.

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, R&D SECTOR - DAY

           HAROLD, a 70-year-old janitor with a face like an unmade bed, 
           unlocks a lab door and clandestinely ushers Elliot in.

                                 ELLIOT
                        You’re a saint, Harold.
                             (hands him a deli sack)
                        Turkey on rye from Ike’s. Don’t eat 
                        too many pickles, your wife’ll kill 
                        me if your blood pressure goes up 
                        any more.

                                 HAROLD
                        I’ll worry about me, you worry 
                        about you. Remember, you’re out by 
                        1:30, and if anybody sees you-- 

                                 ELLIOT
                        --you didn’t let me in.

                                 HAROLD
                             (slaps him on the back)
                        Give ‘em hell.

           Elliot and Harold do a suprisingly solid fist-bump.
           CUT TO: INSIDE THE LAB

           Elliot, alone in an R&D testing room, unplugs a flat-screen 
           TV. Hooks a digi-cam up to the TV -- on its screen, we get a 
           view of Elliot pacing, talking into his digital recorder.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Wire-free project, day 58...

           Out of his pocket comes a SQUARE DEVICE that looks a bit like 
           a cell-phone, lined with tiny metal coils. An RF amplifier.

                                 ELLIOT (INTO RECORDER)
                        RF amplifier adjusted to 130...

           He punches in numbers into a keypad on his amplifier.

                                 ELLIOT (INTO RECORDER)
                        And just remember, if this 
                        continues failing, all it means is 
                        that it takes on after the guy who 
                        created it. Who’s a fucking loser. 

           CLICK! Activated. A low HUMMING rises. Elliot stares at the 
           blank TV screen. The humming gets louder... and something odd 
           happens: the TV starts to FLICKER. A whisper from Elliot...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...there we go...

           Then it TURNS ON. Playing the image captured by the digi-cam: 
           Grainy footage of Elliot across the room, eyes lighting up...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...yes...

           The humming turns into a WHINE, the TV starts to SHORT OUT.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...no, no...

           He races to turn off the RF amplifier and POP! The TV screen 
           goes black, tendrils of smoke rise from its rear.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Fuuuck--

           Just then, the door opens; 2 R&D GUYS back early from lunch.

                                 R&D GUY
                        Hell’s going on in here? 

           CRACK! The TV screen suddenly BUCKLES, cracks shoot out. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        There’s a problem with your TV. 
           EXT. ALTRIA BUILDING, FRONT STEPS - EVENING

           Elliot stands warily outside the Altria tower as the sun goes 
           down. Craig comes outside, they walk on down the steps...

                                 CRAIG
                        Good news is, you still have a job. 
                        Bad news is, they catch you in the 
                        lab again, you’re gonna be working 
                        at Radio Shack.
                             (beat, softens)
                        What were you doing in there?

                                 ELLIOT
                             (shrugs it off)
                        Project I’ve been working on in my 
                        spare time, just this... thing 
                        where you can generate wireless 
                        electricity with a handheld device--

                                 CRAIG
                        Whoah, that’s-- that’s big, man. 
                        Why you keeping it under wraps?

                                 ELLIOT
                        ‘Cause, given the choice, I’d 
                        rather fail in private this time.

                                 CRAIG
                        You gotta let that shit go--

                                 ELLIOT
                        I have. I’m just... armed with a 
                        healthy sense of self-doubt.

                                 CRAIG
                        Your sense of self-doubt is as 
                        healthy as those monkeys they test 
                        radiation on over at NASA. Will you 
                        take a second and just imagine what 
                        happens if you succeed? 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...I get hailed as a genius, I land 
                        on the cover of Wired, the city 
                        throws me a parade, President Obama 
                        takes me out bowling--

                                 CRAIG
                        --Robyn realizes what a mistake she 
                        made, ditches the douchebag she’s 
                        dating, comes back to you--

                                 ELLIOT
                             (pointed)
                        I didn’t say that.
                                 CRAIG
                        Right. ‘Cause you’re over her.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (he’s not)
                        Yes.

                                 CRAIG
                        Good. Then come to DigiCon tonight. 
                        We’ll check out some demos, grab a 
                        beer, chat up some ladies... ladies 
                        who have the distinct advantage of 
                        Not Being Robyn. You even remember 
                        the last time you did that?
                             (Elliot thinks about it)
                        Get in the car.

           Craig hustles him along as from somewhere, we hear the sly, 
           ironic voice of WILKES, amplified over a big PA system: 

                                 WILKES (PRE-LAP)
                        Is everybody in?

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           JONATHAN WILKES takes the stage at DigiCon (think E-3, but 
           for tech.) As far as Silicon Valley moguls go, he’s the anti-
           Steve Jobs; his vibe is that of a hipster rock-star -- skinny 
           jeans, Hugo Boss blazer, buzzed haircut, devil-may-care 
           charisma masking a mind that never stops churning. 

                                 WILKES
                        Everybody in?
                             (crowd CHEERS)
                        Fuck it, we’re starting anyway. 

           Gets a laugh from the crowd as he prowls the stage, backlit 
           by images of sleek, Apple-esque products on massive screens. 
           In the audience, Craig listens avidly, but Elliot’s attitude 
           toward Wilkes is more complicated -- a grudging respect to 
           the guy who won the race that he himself lost.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        How’d you talk me into this again?

                                 CRAIG
                        Think of it as a learning 
                        experience.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Already had that. Learned Don’t Try 
                        To Compete With Jonathan Wilkes.
                                 WILKES
                        The biggest lesson my parents ever 
                        taught me was this: prepare for 
                        your future, because you never know 
                        what it’s gonna throw at you.
                             (beat)
                        Know what I discovered? They’re 
                        wrong.

           Wilkes has (almost) all of the crowd in his palm...

                                 WILKES
                        I was working at Sony back in 2000. 
                        MP3’s were on the rise, and the 
                        music industry was about to get 
                        decimated. So they started 
                        encrypting CD’s, suing the shit out 
                        of anyone who shared files... 
                             (beat)
                        I went the other way. I created a 
                        device that made the compact disc 
                        obsolete. Called it The Stack. 
                        Maybe you’ve heard of it. 

           The crowd chuckles as “The Stack”, our version of the iPod, 
           floats across the screen, trailed by the past few years’ 
           evolutions of it (the StackPhone, the StackPad, etc.)

                                 WILKES
                        Know what the most important lesson 
                        of my life so far is? Don’t prepare 
                        for the future... author it.
                             (over APPLAUSE)
                        Let’s see what’s on deck next year--

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           The crowd shuffles to the exit as Wilkes, on the other side 
           of the barrier, motions Elliot and Craig over to him--

                                 WILKES
                             (slaps Craig’s palm)
                        Clear your schedule, Bollinger, 
                        we’re hitting the town soon as I’m 
                        done with the Vanity Fair people.

                                 CRAIG
                        Consider it cleared, we’ve got shop 
                        to talk.

                                 WILKES
                             (as if just noticing him)
                        You hanging in there, Radius?
                                 ELLIOT
                        Like the cat in those pictures that 
                        say “hang in there.”

                                 WILKES
                             (smiles)
                        I like this guy, he’s funny.

           He makes the “call me” sign to Craig and walks on. Craig 
           looks at Elliot, who clearly feels like stepped-on gum.

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER, MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

           As Elliot and Craig make their way out through the crowd...

                                 ELLIOT
                        You think it’s weird that a guy 
                        with his education doesn’t know how 
                        to use the word “decimated?” 
                             (off his look)
                        He said “the industry was about to 
                        get decimated.” Decimated means “to 
                        eliminate 10% of something.”

                                 CRAIG
                        You gonna stick around, or are you 
                        gonna leave and let the jealousy do 
                        all your talking for you?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m not jealous, ok? I’m over it.

                                 CRAIG
                        Right. Just like with Robyn.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Yes.

                                 CRAIG
                             (eyes focused beyond him)
                        Good. ‘Cause she just spotted you 
                        and she’s walking over right now.

                                 ELLIOT
                        What-- 
                             (sees he’s serious)
                        oh Jesus...

                                 CRAIG
                        Two seconds, put your game-face on--

                                 ROBYN (O.S.)
                        Elliot?...
           Elliot turns... and making her way over is ROBYN GILMORE. Red 
           haired, fiery and vivacious, a woman who seems to be lit by 
           her own internal power source. She’s with her date, STEVE. 
           She and Elliot don’t know quite how to act around each other 
           post-breakup, but she’s trying to be a friend to him. 

                                 ROBYN
                        “Out of all the tech-cons in all 
                        the world...”

                                 ELLIOT
                        “She had to walk into mine.”
                             (to Steve)
                        Steve, right?

                                 STEVE
                        Robyn’s told me a lot about you. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Delighted to hear that.
                             (re: Robyn’s haircut)
                        Cut it short, huh? Looks great.

                                 ROBYN
                        Thank you, you look...
                             (”like shit run over”)
                        ...busy.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Totally. I’m neck deep in this 
                        wireless electricity project I’m 
                        doing over at Altria. Moving on up. 

                                 STEVE
                             (confused)
                        You get promoted? Thought they had 
                        you doing drivers downstairs. 
                             (off his look)
                        My old intern Dave Prescott... he’s 
                        your supervisor. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m, uh, wearing a lot of hats.

                                 STEVE
                             (concerned)
                        Didn’t they almost fire you today?

                                 ELLIOT
                        What? Ha ha, no. They lose me... 
                        then who’s gonna wear all the hats?

           It’s awkward enough to make Elliot want to commit seppuku.

                                 CRAIG
                        I’m thirsty, you thirsty?
                                 ELLIOT
                        Dying.

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER, BAR - NIGHT

           BAM! Tequila’s slammed. Widen to Elliot and Craig in the bar.

                                 CRAIG
                        Let me show you something.

           Sets Elliot’s empty shot glass a couple feet down on the bar.

                                 CRAIG
                        This back here, this is the past. 
                        Notice how there’s nothing in it? 
                        That’s because you’ve already taken 
                        in everything it has to offer you.

           Craig set his still-full shot glass, sets it on the bar. 

                                 CRAIG
                        You wanna turn things around? Focus 
                        here, on the future. Forget the 
                        sailboat, forget Robyn, forget 
                        Radius, just memory-wipe 2010. All 
                        that... it’s an empty glass. 
                             (stands)
                        I’m gonna hit the head.

           As Craig walks off, we reveal a gaggle of CUTE GIRLS down the 
           bar. One particularly striking woman (LOLA) keeps glancing at 
           Elliot. Elliot looks to the full glass. Decides. Shoots it. 

           CUT TO: DOWN THE BAR, A MINUTE OR TWO LATER

           Elliot, surprisingly, has a good rapport going with Lola. 

                                 LOLA
                        You see Wilkes talk? Guy’s such a 
                        rock star.

                                 CRAIG
                        Yeah, I was actually disappointed 
                        that he didn’t smash a guitar on 
                        the stage at the end there.

                                 LOLA
                             (laughs, shakes her head)
                        I had the biggest talent-crush on 
                        him when I did my internship.

                                 ELLIOT
                        “Talent-crush?”
                                 LOLA
                        That thing where you fall head-over-
                        heels for someone’s brilliance. 
                        Ever get one of those?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I got to be the subject of one.

                                 LOLA
                        How’d that go?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Turns out I wasn’t that talented.

           To her, it reads as charming self-deprecation. She smiles...

                                 ELLIOT
                        So what are you doing after--

                                 LOLA
                        --whoah-- 

           Elliot pauses. Lola’s eyes narrow in recognition...

                                 LOLA
                        Oh my God.
                             (beat)
                        Oh. My. Effing. God.
                             (beat)
                        Is your last name “Lockhart?” 

           We can almost see the confidence drain out of Elliot’s face.

                                 LOLA
                        ...you’re the Radius guy! “The 
                        StackPad-killer!” That was one of 
                        the biggest flameouts of all time! 
                        This is like meeting a celebrity 
                        but, like, in reverse...

                                 ELLIOT
                             (been through this before)
                        It didn’t go exactly the way they 
                        said it did on the news. I had a 
                        choice between going with Investor 
                        A who was offering me more money 
                        but less time to get the product 
                        right, and Investor B who was 
                        offering less money but more time. 
                        My gut said to go with A.

                                 LOLA
                        So you wind up putting out a tablet 
                        that turns into the White Screen Of 
                        Death if it sits in your car too 
                        long, your investors lose millions, 
                        they sue you into the next decade--
                                 ELLIOT
                        Let’s just say my gut has a 
                        tendency to be wrong.

                                 LOLA
                             (amazed)
                        I thought I heard you killed 
                        yourself...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Tried that. Didn’t work out for me 
                        either--

                                 LOLA
                        Hey guys!

           Lola grabs her friends’ attention, motioning them over--

                                 LOLA
                        Never believe who this is, remember 
                        the Radius?

                                 HOT GIRLFRIENDS
                        Ohmygod!/Wow!/No way!/I thought he 
                        committed suicide.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (gets up to go)
                        I’m gonna--

                                 LOLA
                        Wait, wait, wait--
                             (digs into her purse)
                        --mind taking a picture with us?

           To Elliot’s horror, she hands her digital camera off--

                                 LOLA
                        ...alright, on three, say “Radius!”

           CLICK! Image FREEZES. Elliot looking like he’s watching an 
           instant replay of his life with only the shitty bits left in. 

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           RAIN RATTLES the windows of Elliot’s apartment as he slumps 
           inside, soaked, heartbroken, carrying a twelve-pack of 
           bottled beer. Finishes his first one. Goes to his turntable, 
           cues the record we saw earlier, and from the speakers...

                                 FATS DOMINO 
                        I found my thrill... on Blueberry 
                        Hill... when I found you...
           The song’s never sounded as sad as it does here. He CRACKS a 
           new beer, flops down, pulls out the box of photos from under 
           the couch. Slipping into what’s become his nightly ritual.

                                 FATS DOMINO
                        ...the moon stood still... on 
                        Blueberry Hill... and lingered 
                        until... my dream came true...

           Flips through: Elliot at his MIT graduation, Robyn giving 
           herself a moustache with his sleeve. Elliot raising an IPAD-
           LIKE DEVICE (”The Radius”) for an applauding crowd. Elliot 
           and Robyn kissing, in front of a GOODBYE 2009 sign.

                                 FATS DOMINO
                        ...you're part of me still... for 
                        you were my thrill... on Blueberry 
                        Hill...

           Elliot flips through a few more. Then, disgusted with 
           himself, he tosses the stack away onto the coffee table...

           ...and it’s only now he notices it:

           Sitting on the table, next to the pictures he just tossed, is 
           a sleek, metallic capsule. Like what Mr. Park had. 

           He stares at it -- what the hell?... And as “Blueberry Hill” 
           goes into its big finish, he GRABS IT.

           INT. ELLIOT’S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CLICK! A lamp turns on. Elliot holds the capsule under it. 
           Studies its seamless titanium, its small opaque glass lens 
           and a LITTLE RED BUTTON. Thinking, his fingertip traces it--

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...ok...

           CLICK! Elliot presses the button... and all at once, his 
           lights FLICKER and DRONE, struggling to stay on. As if the 
           capsule is draining power from them. Elliot, looking around--

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        ...oh shit...

           Its lens emits a BURST OF ILLUMINANCE. Elliot drops the 
           capsule, it rolls under the table. He goes to grab it, when--

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hi, Elliot.

           WHAM! Elliot lurches back, hits the floor, eyes wide. 
           There’s a life-size GHOSTLY FIGURE flickering across the room 
           from him. Positioned upsidedown. That’s not the weird part.

           The weird part is: the figure IS ELLIOT -- 20 years older. 
           Sitting at a table in a blank room.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        You don’t believe what you’re 
                        seeing. That’s understandable. Take 
                        a moment, get used to it.

           Elliot, trembling, glances under the couch. Sees the capsule 
           is emitting a wash of blue light -- the ghostly image he’s 
           looking at is a HOLOGRAM projected from the device’s lens.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...oh my God...

           He turns the capsule, causing the hologram to FLIP UPRIGHT.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        I imagine you’re asking: “why am I 
                        looking at a twenty-years-older 
                        version of myself?” Answer is: 
                        because that’s exactly what I am. 
                        You, in 2033. 

           Elliot eyes himself; sees he’s put on a bit of weight, going 
           a little gray, but otherwise, time has been good to this guy.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        I’ll give you details shortly, but 
                        for now, know that this is not a 
                        joke, a hallucination, or a mental 
                        breakdown. This is real. I know you 
                        need help right now. I’m here to 
                        help. And I’m going to prove it.

           Elliot stands, turning in a slow circle, watching the 3-D 
           hologram travel through the room with his rotation. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        Write this down: 29-01-19-82-63-99-
                        47. California lottery. Play that 
                        number. Do it tonight, don’t wait.

           Because Future Elliot is talking into a recording device, his 
           eyes never meet with Elliot’s; forever looking through him...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        This is just a taste. The main 
                        course is coming.

           CLICK! The hologram DISAPPEARS. Like it’s been turned off by 
           a TV remote. The capsule’s glowing lens fades to opaque. 
                                 ELLIOT
                        ...holy shit.

           Elliot flops to the couch. Glugs the bottle. Hits PLAY again.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        Hi Elliot... you don’t believe what 
                        you’re seeing...

           Tighter and tighter on Elliot’s eyes. They flutter...

           INT. ELLIOT’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           HARD CUT to Elliot’s eyes snapping open. Face down on the 
           couch. Morning sunlight fills the room. Elliot SITS UP...

           ...and immediately his eyes dart to the coffee table -- where 
           the CAPSULE is still sitting there. And next to it is a half-
           eaten burger AND LOTTERY TICKET. He followed instructions.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...ok...

           He grabs his laptop, logs into the lottery web page, compares 
           the numbers... and sees that he got 5 out of 7 correct. Which 
           means, as he scrolls to see, he just won...

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        ...$50,000.

           Suddenly, a HISSING NOISE makes him turn. A small WHIRLPOOL 
           OF DUST has overtaken his table. Making papers RUSTLE.

           The swirl growing bigger, gaining speed, darkening. A reverse 
           of what we saw earlier: as opposed to disintegrating into 
           nothing, it’s a capsule manifesting itself out of nothing. 
           Swirling in a six-inch vortex, scorching a BURN MARK into his 
           table... before it solidifies into a simple, shiny capsule. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...wow.

           Elliot reaches for it -- JERKS his hand away. The capsule’s 
           hot. Lets it cool off, then hits the “play” button. The 
           electricity flickers, there’s a FLASHBULB BURST of light... 
           and once again, there’s holographic FUTURE ELLIOT. Sitting 
           with his hands on the table in that same blank room. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        Glad to see we’re on the same page. 
                        By the way, do me a favor and don’t 
                        drink -- it’s bad for our health, 
                        and it makes it difficult for me to 
                        remember what you remember.
           Elliot notes the surreality of being lectured by himself. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        You’re wondering why I only gave 
                        you five winning numbers. I did so 
                        because this is not about making 
                        you rich, but about making you into 
                        the person you need to become. I’m 
                        not sending you fish, I’m creating 
                        a fisherman. Now listen close...

           As Future Elliot talks, some sexy electronic BEAT rises...

           INT. ELLIOT’S DINING ROOM - DAY

           This sequence is driven by the THROB OF THE MUSIC and 
           narrated by the RECORDINGS of his future self. At his table, 
           Elliot gets to work doing exactly what an engineer would do 
           in this scenario: figuring out how the capsule works. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        As for those details I promised...

           In FAST MOTION, Elliot straps on microscope-goggles and 
           starts taking apart a capsule with a set of micro-tools. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Right now, you’re figuring out how 
                        to send wireless electricity 
                        through the air. In ten years, 
                        you’ll have perfected that. In 
                        fifteen years, you’ll figure out 
                        how to wirelessly transmit physical 
                        material.

           CUT TO: a micro-shot through the capsule’s PROCESSOR, a glass 
           orb filled with ROTATING SPARKS, racing along a Mobius strip. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        In two decades, you’ll figure out 
                        how to send material through time.

           WHOOSH OUT to reveal Elliot with his headset on, awed.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        And that’s why you and I -- or 
                        should I say ‘you and you’ -- are 
                        having this interaction right now. 

           INT. ELLIOT’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           SPLIT-SCREEN: Elliot feverishly writing notes, while on his 
           desk, a capsule whirs in, leaving a deeper scorch mark.
                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Each day at 7 PM, a capsule will 
                        arrive on your desk.

           CUT TO: Next time, Elliot puts a plate over the burn mark. A 
           capsule arrives, the heat SPLITS the plate. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Each capsule will contain 
                        information. Information that will 
                        prove valuable to you. 

           CUT TO: He replaces it with a metal tray. It stays intact.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        At this moment, you’re struggling 
                        to get your career resuscitated. To 
                        get over a love you lost. To regain 
                        your self-respect.

           We hear an ENGINE GUNNING...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Follow the advice I’m offering and 
                        your struggle will soon be over.

           INT. ELLIOT’S CAR, MOVING - DAY

           Elliot ZOOMS through San Francisco, flying on adrenaline.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        First step: accrue seed money. 

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE FIELDS RACE TRACK - DAY

           Carrying a suitcase, Elliot makes for the racetrack.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Clear your savings, go to the 
                        Golden Gate Racetrack and put 
                        everything down on a horse named--

           WHOOSH-CUT to Elliot at the BETTING BOOTH.

                                 ELLIOT
                        --Dagger’s Point. Fifteen hundred.

           Elliot slides over a large stack of bills. The BETTING CLERK 
           can’t help but look at him askew -- your funeral, kid.

           WHOOSH-CUT TO: Elliot in the stands, watching his horse get 
           its ass kicked, wondering what the hell’s going on... until 
           the lead horse suddenly COLLAPSES, causing a pile-up, which 
           Dagger’s Point DODGES and makes a SPRINT FOR THE FINISH.
                                 HORSERACE ANNOUNCER
                        Unbelievable! Dagger’s Point wins!

           WHOOSH-CUT TO: ka-ching goes a register and a stack of bills 
           FIVE TIMES THE SIZE of what Elliot put down is slid to him. 
           Smiles as he walks away, and the frame is WIPED BY--

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           PAGES IN ELLIOT’S JOURNAL FLYING BY. Scribbling notes. We 
           pull away out the window, as days and nights whip by and his 
           hologram appears in different places around the apartment.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        We can only send objects through 
                        time, nothing organic. These 
                        objects must be sent backwards,  
                        with a timeline destination of 20 
                        years. One-way communication. The 
                        only way to send a message to me is 
                        to memorize it. I remember what you 
                        remember.

           We follow his pen writing: “I remember what you remember.” 
           The screen SPLITS INTO TWO. One shows words being scribbled 
           into Elliot’s journal, the other circles his hologram.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        Are you damaging the time 
                        continuum? Think of a stone dropped 
                        into water, creating ripples beyond 
                        your control. Now think of dropping 
                        a stone into the Pacific Ocean; you 
                        get ripples in the immediate area, 
                        but the whole stays unaffected. The 
                        changes we’re making are meaningful 
                        only to their immediate vicinity.

           And as the SUN SCORCHES UP over his apartment, we ZIP DOWN to 
           find Elliot walking out, a noticeable swagger in his stride.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Next step: clear your debts.

           EXT./INT. PACIFIC EXCHANGE BUILDING - DAY

           We WHIP into the chaos of the Pacific Exchange Building...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        You’re in a tight spot after the 
                        lawsuit. Sooner we get you out, the 
                        better. What you’ll need to do is--

           WHOOSH! We’re in a PAUNCHY STOCKBROKER’S OFFICE, where 
           Elliot’s totally schooling him on potential investments:
                                 ELLIOT
                        --you keep saying Beijing Mineral, 
                        Beijing Mineral, but that’s a 
                        bubble and it’s gonna do what 
                        bubbles do. Do me a favor and type 
                        in Khungun Beton, Mongolian energy 
                        stock, got a hunch it’s going big-- 

           The overwhelmed stockbroker bashes in KHUNGUN BETON--

           INT. MAIL BOXES ETC - DAY

           CLICK! ELLIOT opens a safe-deposit box.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Next: create an emergency stash. If 
                        history has taught me anything, 
                        it’s that you never know when 
                        you’ll need this. Take $50,000 and 
                        your passport, put it in a safe box-

           WHAM! Elliot stuffs a duffel bag and passport inside.

           INT. ELLIOT’S CAR, PARKED - NIGHT

           Elliot, waiting in his car, parked at a downtown corner.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Next: intersection of 16th and 
                        Bryant, 9:03 PM. Keep your eye on 
                        the crosswalk. Be ready to pitch.

           Elliot glances at his watch as it ticks toward 9:03, looks up 
           at the street... and sees something odd: FRANKLIN GANTT, CEO 
           of Altria, steps onto the crosswalk, talking on his phone, 
           too distracted to see a WEAVING TOYOTA heading toward him.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Shit--

           WHAM! Elliot BARRELS into the street, LUNGES at Franklin and 
           TACKLES HIM, just as the car goes SCREECHING PAST and slams 
           into a power box -- mere feet away from splattering Franklin.

                                 FRANKLIN GANTT
                        ...holy God... ohJesus...
                             (stops, recognizes him)
                        ...Lockhart? 

           CUT TO: ELLIOT AND GANTT IN A SWANKY BAR, hours later, avidly 
           talking. Franklin sips scotch, Elliot goes with club soda.
                                 FRANKLIN GANTT
                        ...you’ve gotten the TV to turn on, 
                        without any wired electricity, from 
                        a device that fits in your pocket?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Only for a few seconds. But with 
                        the right support, sky’s the limit.

                                 FRANKLIN GANTT
                             (thinks, then)
                        My office, Monday. Be there.
                             (extends a hand)
                        Lucky I ran into you tonight, huh?

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, BASEMENT - DAY

           WHUMPH! Boxes get placed on a cart; reveal INTERNS helping 
           get Elliot’s former office packed up. Prescott scowls, 
           loathing the fact that Elliot’s been promoted over him.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (about to leave)
                        Prescott. Been a pleasure.

           Prescott eye-daggers him. Elliot grabs a rolled-up projector 
           screen, heads out, and “accidentally” knocks Prescott’s 
           potted plant off a shelf as he goes, spilling dirt.  

           OUT IN THE HALLWAY

           Prescott storms out of the office, yells after Elliot:

                                 PRESCOTT
                        You just burned the wrong fucking 
                        bridge, Elliot.

           Elliot just keeps walking. Prescott sees Harold the janitor 
           pushing his cart down the hall, yells over at him-

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Harold, get your ass in here, bring 
                        a vacuum, chop chop--

           Elliot intercepts Harold before he can take another step.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Do me a favor, Harold.
                             (shakes his hand)
                        Retire.

           And then walks off. And it’s then we see that Elliot put 
           something in Harold’s hand: a LOTTERY TICKET. 
           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, R&D SECTOR - DAY

           DING! The key-card in Elliot’s hand -- the one he used to 
           have to bribe the janitor for -- scans open a door...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        With the new dimensions your life 
                        is about to take on, you’ll need a 
                        new workspace...

           ...and he walks into his new domain: the R&D lab. He’s now 
           got a WHOLE RESEARCH TEAM working on his wireless electricity 
           project. As he gets to work, we pan to the entrance, where 
           Craig watches, trying to wrap his mind around all this...

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           CLICK! Elliot’s bathroom cabinet opens, and he takes out pill 
           bottles. But instead of popping them like earlier, he opens 
           them up and dumps them into the toilet, then walks out...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        A new place to call home...

           ...to reveal he’s in a BRAND NEW CONDO overlooking the Bay. 

           INT. HOME GYM - DAY

           Elliot, shirtless, works out in his home gym; push-ups, sit-
           ups, going to town on a heavybag. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        A new physical regiment...

           Reveal his latest capsule playing: his future self looks 
           healthier, fitter, sitting up straight now, posture improved.

           EXT. CRAIG’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Craig, in his office suit, walks out of his tony apartment 
           building, on his phone, looking around...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        New wheels...

           VROOOOOOOM! A shimmering CONVERTIBLE BMW ROADSTER barrels 
           down the street, straight towards Craig. Craig lunges out of 
           the way as it comes to a smoking stop. Elliot at the wheel.

                                 CRAIG
                             (climbs in)
                        Whatever you’ve been putting in 
                        your Frosted Flakes, I want some.
                                 ELLIOT
                        You said it first: just gotta focus 
                        on the future.

           Craig, suspicion growing, buckles up as they JET OFF.

           INT. HUGO BOSS - DAY

           WHIRRRT goes a fabric tape-measure. Widen to reveal Elliot, 
           in a high end store, getting fitted for a suit.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        New clothes...

           INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

           WHOOSH! A barber’s apron is pulled away, and there’s Elliot 
           2.0, looking like a million bucks. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        A new look...

           Elliot smiles at hot stylist, EVELYN. She’s a bit amazed.

                                 EVELYN
                        Look ready to take on the world.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Good idea. You want in on that?

           Evelyn can’t help but laugh as we hear--

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.0.)
                        And now that you’re a whole new 
                        man...

           INT. PENTHOUSE TOWER - NIGHT

           DING! Elevator doors open and Elliot, dressed to the nines in 
           his new suit, dolled up Evelyn at his side, comes gliding out 
           into the glass hall overlooking the city. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        ...I suggest finding yourself a 
                        date, going to WP-24, and saying  
                        “diamond” to the door guy.

           Ahead, there’s a line of people waiting to get into the 
           ROOFTOP NIGHTCLUB beyond the velvet rope. Place is jumping. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        If you happen to run into an old 
                        friend, be sure to say “hi.”
           As Elliot and his date move towards the club entrance--

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Elliot?

           Elliot and his date turn... and there’s Robyn, standing in 
           line with Steve. She couldn’t look more shocked to see him.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Robyn. Steve. Hi. This is Evelyn.
                             (off their awed stares)
                        Come find me when you get inside, 
                        let’s all have a drink.

           They head for the DOORMAN, Elliot murmurs to him, and they’re 
           let through. Leaving a bewildered Steve and Robyn behind.

                                 STEVE
                        Did he get a haircut?

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           SPEEDING PIXELS of blurry white light. We’re zooming along a 
           line of these glowing dots, a whole GALAXY of them around us.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        Most of all, you’re going to need 
                        to get your pet project fast-
                        tracked. In order for the capsule 
                        to exist, wireless electricity must 
                        exist first. And there’s no sense 
                        in you waiting the ten years this 
                        took under previous circumstances--

           We PULL OUT to reveal we’d just been traveling through the 
           glowing inner matrix of Future Elliot’s hologram. Elliot is 
           installing a safe in his wall, loading a case of capsules 
           into it -- can’t leave ‘em lying around. He spins in the 
           lock’s code, writes it down in his journal.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (THROUGH HOLOGRAM)
                        In one week, Altria’s CFO will be 
                        arrested for fraud. It will take 
                        Altria years to fully recover from 
                        his embezzlement, and those are 
                        years in which your hands will be 
                        tied. But there’s nothing like good 
                        news to get bad news off the front 
                        page, so what this means is... 

           INT. FRANKLIN GANTT’S HOME - DAY

           Gantt, in his lavish study, staring at Elliot...
                                 FRANKLIN GANTT
                        ...”we need to take on a partner?”

                                 ELLIOT
                        In light of recent... unforseeable 
                        events... that’s my recommendation.

           On a FLAT SCREEN nearby, the news shows a BEANPOLE MBA-TYPE 
           getting hauled off in handcuffs. NEWSCASTER rattling on:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ...CFO of Altria Industries, 
                        indicted on multiple counts of 
                        fraud and embezzlement, after an 
                        employee blew the whistle...

                                 ELLIOT
                             (motions to CFO on TV)
                        My intuition was right about that 
                        asshole, Mr. Gantt, and I’m pretty 
                        sure it’s right about this. 
                        Besides... nothing like good news 
                        to get bad news off the front page.

           INT. PENTHOUSE OFFICE - DAY

           A DOOR OPENS and Jonathan Wilkes motions us into his office 
           overlooking the city. Clearly taken this meeting as a favor 
           to Gantt; not expecting much out of a has-been like Elliot.

                                 WILKES
                        Gantt. Good to see you again. What 
                        can I do for you, Radius?

           Elliot goes to the TV, unplugs it. Lifts his HANDHELD RF 
           AMPLIFIER. CLICK! The TV turns on. And stays on. 

                                 WILKES
                             (unimpressed)
                        So... you’ve got a wireless 
                        electricity generator powerful 
                        enough to run a 30-inch flat screen 
                        TV. This is not new ground, Elliot-- 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Take your phone out.

           Wilkes takes out his Stackphone; its BATTERY BAR IS CHARGING 
           UP. Just by being in the same room as Elliot’s invention. 

                                 WILKES
                        You did that... with the device you 
                        just pulled out of your pocket.

           Elliot nods. Ditto Wilkes. Then...
           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 

           WHOOSH! BLINDING LIGHT scorches our eyes, as we pull back to 
           reveal a TV screen playing the news -- Elliot, Wilkes, and 
           Gantt shaking hands before a crowded conference room.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        ...big news today, as Jonathan 
                        Wilkes’ Trinity Corp joins forces 
                        with Altria to bring us what could 
                        be the next tech revolution. The 
                        brainchild of Elliot Lockhart, a 
                        former industry punchline now 
                        making a high-profile comeback...

                                 WILKES (O.S.)
                        Do I have a double chin in that 
                        shot? They totally gave me a double 
                        chin in that shot--

           WHOOSH BACK to find Elliot out for lunch with Wilkes and his 
           cronies at a classy restaurant, swilling oysters and martinis 
           (Elliot sticks to water.) Busting each other’s chops:

                                 ELLIOT
                        Sure, it’s the camera that gives 
                        you a double chin. Drinking three 
                        martinis at lunch all the time just 
                        makes you more handsome.

                                 WILKES
                             (laughing)
                        Hey, anyone at this table knows 
                        their way around a bottle, it’s 
                        you. By the way, what happened to 
                        Mr. Self-Destructo, you get a life-
                        coach or something? 

                                 ELLIOT
                             (thinks, smiles)
                        ...basically.

                                 WILKES
                        Whoever he is, he’s good. 

           Elliot’s not paying attention. Because outside the 
           restaurant, he’s spotted... Robyn, in her nursing scrubs, 
           ordering from a falafel stand. Elliot stands--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Gimme a second--

                                 WILKES
                        He’s like a shark, never stops 
                        moving...

           CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT
           Just as Robyn hands money to the vendor and walks on--

                                 ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        Of all the falafel stands in all 
                        the world.

           Robyn turns to find Elliot approaching, looking like the 
           coolest cat on the fire escape. She downplays her surprise.

                                 ROBYN
                        Elliot, alright, you... no longer 
                        appear to have risen from the grave 
                        to feast on human brain tissue.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m on a diet. Listen, you didn’t 
                        happen to watch TV last night--

                                 ROBYN
                        Wondering if I saw you on the news?

                                 ELLIOT
                        No no, they were showing “Road 
                        House” on AMC, I remember how much 
                        you love that movie--

                                 ROBYN
                        You love that movie. I tolerated 
                        that movie--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Stop cultivating dishonesty.

                                 ROBYN
                             (laughs despite herself)
                        Why am I having this discussion 
                        right now?

                                 ELLIOT
                        You’re right, we shouldn’t be 
                        having this conversation now. We 
                        should be having this over dinner.

           Robyn’s a little taken aback by his confidence. But...

                                 ROBYN
                        ...I’m proud of you. I’m glad you 
                        turned things around. I’m glad you 
                        even stopped wearing white socks 
                        with black suits--

                                 ELLIOT
                        You noticed.

                                 ROBYN
                        --but I can’t do this.
           It deflates him. A car pulls up to the curb, horn going beep-
           beep as the window rolls down, revealing Steve at the wheel. 

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Ready, babe?

                                 ROBYN
                             (a beat)
                        ...take care.

           She climbs into the car and they drive off, leaving Elliot 
           alone on the sidewalk, looking after her as we hear...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        Judging by your new memories, I’d 
                        say you could use some time away... 

           INT. ELLIOT’S NEW CONDO - NIGHT

           Elliot packs his suitcase with the muted frustration of a man 
           who’s getting everything he wants but not the thing he needs.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        The Khao Sok resort in Thailand 
                        doesn’t open to the public for two 
                        months. Ask for a Mr. Pheng, slip 
                        him 3,000 baht, watch what happens.

           Elliot locks his last capsule into his wall-safe (which is 
           now full of capsules) and shuts the door.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        By the way, don’t visit Laos, a 
                        civil war’s about to break out.

           EXT. THAI ISLAND - DAY

           VROOOOM! A PLANE soars over as we pan to Elliot, striding 
           into a GORGEOUS THAI RESORT overlooking the ocean.

           CUT TO: A BEACH-VIEW BAR

           Elliot’s mid-flirt with ISABELLA and HANNA, smoking-hot 
           Swedish tourists. The vibe is merry with sexual tension.

                                 ISABELLA
                        You are messing with me.

                                 HANNA
                        He’s messing with you.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m not in the business of lying to 
                        beautiful women.
                                 HANNA
                        “You can see the future.”

                                 ELLIOT
                        Yes.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Prove it.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Ok ok, um, lemme see...
                             (motions over shoulder)
                        She’s gonna leave him at the altar.

           He points to the TV, broadcasting a CELEBRITY WEDDING.

                                 ISABELLA
                        You’ve already watched this?

                                 ELLIOT
                        It’s live, nobody’s watched this. 
                        Count it down, five, four, three--

           And on TV the FEMALE CELEBRITY suddenly starts crying... and 
           walks away from the groom. Hannah covers her mouth -- OMG.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...about ten seconds the groom’s 
                        mother is gonna lose her shit-- 

           On cue, the GROOM’S MOM storms after her, YELLING. Isabella 
           and Hanna stare at Elliot -- who just raises his club soda; 
           cheers. A little devious smile from one girl to another.

                                 HANNA
                        So what do you see in your future?

           EXT. ELLIOT’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           WHAM! Elliot and his new Swedish friends pile into the bed, a 
           mass of roaming hands and hungry mouths. We PULL UP to see--

           --his hotel room is a TEAK TREE-HOUSE, suspended above the 
           beach, lit by lanterns. And just before the MPAA can slap us 
           with an NC-17, we lose the threesome amidst the branches.

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           CLICK! Elliot, tanned and happy, walks into his place. Sets 
           down his bag and FLOPS onto the couch. Sighs, satisfied...

           ...then notices it. On the nearby table, there’s a CAPSULE 
           waiting for him. Grabs it, hits PLAY. As we push in on him...
                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (FROM CAPSULE)
                        Call this number and ask for Leo. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Elliot pulls into a space. Alone in the cavernous parking 
           garage. A bit spooked. Glances at the capsule in his hand...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT  (V.O.)
                        Go to the parking garage on Geary 
                        and Leavenworth. Bring $800. 

           KNOCK-KNOCK. A fist raps on his window. Elliot whirls to see 
           LEO -- 20’s, scuzzy. Elliot, wary, rolls down the window--

                                 LEO
                        Eight.

           Elliot hands him over an envelope. Leo hands him a BROWN 
           PAPER BAG. Walks off. Elliot, confused, looks in the bag...

           ...and there’s a HANDGUN inside it. Black Glock .44 with a 
           silencer. He lifts it out, eyes narrow. The serial number’s 
           been filed off, just a blur on the metal where it used to be. 

                                 ELLIOT 
                        Hey, wait--

           Leo’s gone. Elliot sits there with the gun, mind spinning. 
           Fingertip nervously tracing designs on the center console.

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, HALLWAY/OFFICE - MORNING

           DING! Elliot steps out of the elevator and in the 9 AM 
           bustle. Head low, he makes a bee-line for his office, where--

           WHAM! Shuts the door. Locks it. Closes blinds. And goes to 
           the desk, where there’s already a capsule waiting. Jaw tight, 
           he hits play. The image of his future self SNAPS TO LIFE -- 
           he’s jittery, sleep-deprived, and looks roughed up.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        What I’m about to tell you is the 
                        last message I ever wanted to send, 
                        but it’s one you need to hear. 
                             (beat)
                        In 2033, your former boss, David 
                        Prescott, will be your chief 
                        competitor. He will do everything 
                        in his power to destroy you, 
                        beginning with a smear campaign and 
                        escalating to blackmail, extortion, 
                        and sabotage. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (CONT'D)
                        Historically, when those tactics 
                        fail, his enemies have a tendency 
                        to die in plane crashes and auto-
                        wrecks.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t want to die in an accident. 
                        And you don’t want to live with an 
                        expiration date. The reality is: 
                        the only way to stop Prescott from 
                        destroying your future... is in the 
                        bag you picked up last night.

           Elliot’s lips part, realizing what this means...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        You’ve got a decision to make. It’s 
                        going to be the hardest one of your 
                        life. But let me assure you... it’s 
                        either him now or you later. You  
                        don’t do this, we are doomed.

           The image SNAPS OUT. Elliot drops the capsule. Disbelieving. 
           KNOCK-KNOCK! A fist raps on his door, startles him.

                                 ASSISTANT’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Your meeting starts in five--

                                 ELLIOT
                        --one sec.

           He stares at the capsule in his hand... as we CUT TO:

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, BOARD ROOM - DAY

           A staff meeting. Elliot’s eyes keep drifting across the room 
           to Prescott... who catches his look. Shoots him an icy stare.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        I know what I’m asking is not easy. 
                        But there are times when we must 
                        make compromises with ourselves in 
                        order to survive.

           INT. ELLIOT’S CAR, PARKED - EVENING

           Elliot in his roadster. Toying with the capsule. Ahead of 
           him, a red Mercedes pulls out. Prescott at the wheel. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        He will depart the office at 6:15 
                        and take the 280 Freeway home.

           As he drives past, Elliot pockets his capsule and follows.
           EXT. BAYVIEW NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Keeping his distance, Elliot tails Prescott’s car through his 
           neighborhood; the burg is young, hip, a little sketchy.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        He’s purchased a home in Bayview. 
                        In two years, this will be one of 
                        the city’s most expensive locales.

           Elliot watches Prescott pull into his townhouse’s garage. 

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        But for now, home invasion 
                        robberies are not uncommon here.  

           EXT. DAVE PRESCOTT’S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           Prescott eats dinner in front of his TV. Not noticing he’s 
           being watched... by Elliot, parked outside. Surveilling. 
           Thinking. Pan down to reveal he’s got the GLOCK in his hand.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        The back entrance of his apartment 
                        will be unlocked. His alarm system 
                        hasn’t been installed yet. 

           Elliot breathes. Puts on leather driving gloves. Gets out.

           CUT TO: the back of Prescott’s townhouse, where Elliot steals 
           through the shadows. Eyes scanning, heart jack-hammering.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT 
                        Once this is done, take his wallet 
                        and go out the way you came in. 
                        Walk slowly, walk calmly. The 
                        police will not be looking for 
                        someone with your description.

           CUT TO: INSIDE PRESCOTT’S TOWNHOUSE

           ...the back door CREAKS OPEN. Slowly. Through Elliot’s POV: 
           we can hear the basketball game on the TV in the living room 
           as further down the hall we go, towards the well-appointed 
           living room, Prescott on the couch with his back to us...

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        I trust you to see this through.

           Elliot pulls the gun from his pocket. Doesn’t aim it. Just 
           looks at it... and then looks to Prescott...

           ...just as we hear a “meow” and a ginger TABBY CAT hops up 
           onto Prescott’s lap. He gently feeds the cat a baby shrimp 
           from his salad. Only nice thing Elliot’s ever seen him do. 
           We hold on Elliot, gun in his hand...

           EXT. PRESCOTT’S STREET - NIGHT

           BAM! Elliot SLAMS THE GAS and peels off. Revealing the 
           townhouse... where Prescott is still very much alive. Elliot, 
           for the first time, hasn’t followed orders.

           EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

           SCREEECH! Elliot slams to a stop in the emergency lane atop 
           the Bay Bridge. Gets out. TOSSES THE GUN over the bridge.

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           In his journal, Elliot scrawls:

                                        WHAT NOW?

           Then sits at his table, watching the metal plate. Waiting for 
           a capsule to arrive. He waits. And waits. And waits. Night 
           becomes dawn. And finally, answer-less, he gets up to leave.

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, LOBBY - DAWN

           Dawn in the empty Altria lobby. Elliot walks in from the 
           garage, heads for the elevator...

           ...finds that it’s roped off, an UNDER REPAIR sign on it. He 
           sighs, heads for...

           THE STAIRWELL: fluorescent tubes flicker, footsteps echo. As 
           Elliot trudges through this claustrophobic space, a door 
           suddenly BOOMS CLOSED 3 stories below. Elliot looks down...

           ...to see Dave Prescott. Intently making his way up the 
           stairs. Eyes Elliot, just for a second, as he comes up...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Morning.

           No answer. Apprehension growing, Elliot walks on. Notices 
           Prescott’s now just two stories below him. Moving faster. 

           Elliot picks up the pace. Rounds the next level. Sees 
           Prescott’s even closer now. One level below, and gaining.

           And it’s then Elliot notices something else, too.

           Prescott, hand trembling, is pulling out a GUN. A big, black 
           Glock. Like Elliot bought from Leo. Elliot, adrenaline 
           spiking, turns to FLEE and--
                                 PRESCOTT
                        DON’T!

           Prescott clumsily cocks the gun. Clearly new at this.

                                 PRESCOTT
                             (comes up the steps)
                        ...stay just like that.

           A sheen of panic-sweat is visible on Prescott’s face as he 
           approaches. Elliot stands there, frozen, hands up...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...what are you doing, Prescott?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Stopping you.

                                 ELLIOT
                        From doing what?--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Don’t. Don’t act like you’re in the 
                        fucking dark here, Elliot--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Prescott, listen to me, I have no 
                        idea what you’re--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s you or me. 

           Prescott’s finger goes to the trigger and WHAM! Elliot SWINGS 
           his laptop case and KNOCKS THE GUN AWAY. Then LUNGES at 
           Prescott, sending them both rolling down the stairs--

           ONTO THE LANDING BELOW

           --where Elliot makes a grab for the gun. STRUGGLING, gets two 
           fingers onto the gun... SNATCHES IT UP, whirls around--

           --just as Prescott SWIPES at the gun, it GOES OFF, the bullet 
           RICOCHETS off the wall, and PLANTS ITSELF in Prescott’s leg. 
           He HOWLS. Stumbles back, holding his bleeding thigh...

           ...and TAKES A TUMBLE down the next flight of stairs. Ass-
           over-teakettle, wallet and keys flying out of his pockets 
           BAM! Hits the landing. Doesn’t move. Elliot stands, freaked.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...Prescott?...

           Hesitantly, Elliot checks to see if he’s breathing. Sees that 
           he is. Elliot steps back... and his foot lands on something. 

           A CAPSULE. One that fell out of Prescott’s pocket.
                                 ELLIOT (CONT’D)
                             (in disbelief)
                        ...no...

           Elliot grabs it, hits play, an image appears: FUTURE 
           PRESCOTT, at a table in a blank room. Looks good for his age. 

                                 FUTURE PRESCOTT
                        At 6:17, Lockhart will come in 
                        through the garage. Place an “Under 
                        Repair” sign in front of the 
                        elevator. He will take the stairs. 
                        Then he will break into your office 
                        and wait with a gun. 
                             (beat)
                        I trust you to see this through.

           The hologram SNAPS OFF. Elliot stares down at his former 
           boss... then pockets Prescott’s gun and TAKES OFF RUNNING. 

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           In SPOOKY SLO-MO, Elliot bee-lines out of the stairwell and 
           into the lobby. Covered in sweat, limping, trying to control 
           his heartrate. 

           Through his POV, we see familiar faces -- Altria employees 
           working the early-AM shift. But now, we see them as potential 
           threats. After all, who else is getting capsules?...

           A SECURITY GUARD focuses on us as we pass. We look the other 
           way... and meet the stare of the FRONT DESK CLERK. Breathing 
           hard, we turn toward the doors...

           ...past a couple of GUYS FROM ELLIOT’S R&D TEAM, walking in. 
           One of them turns to us, eyes narrowing...

           ...and we RUSH ONWARD, out of the building, free.

           EXT. CRAIG’S APARTMENT - DAY

           BAM BAM BAM! Elliot beats his fist against a door. Until 
           finally it opens up and there’s Craig, fresh from sleep. 

                                 CRAIG
                             (taken aback)
                        Jesus... Elliot--

                                 ELLIOT
                             (all one breath)
                        Dave Prescott just came after me 
                        with a gun and tried to kill me--
                                 CRAIG
                        ...whoah.
                             (beat)
                        We gotta call the--

                                 ELLIOT
                        --no cops. No cops. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Why not?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’ll explain but it’s gonna take me 
                        a minute. Can I come in? Please?

           A loaded beat. Then Craig lets him in.  

           INT. CRAIG’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Craig shuts the door to his nouveau-riche apartment, 
           everything nice and neat inside. Elliot pulls off his sweaty 
           jacket, drapes it on the couch, already mid-blabber:

                                 ELLIOT
                        --ok, listen, I kinda shot Prescott 
                        in the leg and threw him down the 
                        stairs and left him unconscious and 
                        if I try to explain why, I’m gonna 
                        get locked in a psych ward.
                             (off his “what?” look)
                        I need to tell you something, and I 
                        need you to not freak out. 

           Craig puts Elliot’s jacket on a coat-rack, motions: go on.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’ve been getting these... 
                        capsules...

                                 CRAIG
                        I’m sorry-- what?

                                 ELLIOT
                        A few weeks ago, one of these just 
                        showed up in my apartment and--

           Craig’s not paying attention. He’s digging into a suitcase...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Craig?

                                 CRAIG
                        ...they look like this?

           In Craig’s trembling hand: a small silver CAPSULE.
                                 ELLIOT
                        ...holy shit.

           Craig, gravely, gives a nod. Just as freaked out as Elliot.

           INT. CRAIG’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A scotch on the rocks gets placed down, Elliot takes it and 
           drinks it up. He and Craig in midst of a tense conversation.

                                 ELLIOT
                        So... that’s how you got on such a 
                        hot streak.

                                 CRAIG
                        About to say the same about you.
                             (smirks)
                        There I was thinking you’d finally 
                        started believing in yourself.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Technically, all that stuff was 
                        me... believing in myself. 
                             (beat)
                        Again, we see where that gets me.
                             (beat)
                        Did yours... say to do anything--

                                 CRAIG
                        Nothing like what yours said to do.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...the hell is going on here?

                                 CRAIG
                        I don’t know. Figuring that out, 
                        that’s step two. Step one is taking 
                        care of the situation at hand.

                                 ELLIOT
                        What do you mean?

                                 CRAIG
                        Go to the cops. Tell them your boss 
                        attacked you with a gun. He caught 
                        a bullet. You were scared. You ran. 
                        No word about the capsules, ‘cause 
                        you’re right, that makes you sound 
                        crazy. And if you’re crazy, then 
                        I’m crazy.

           Elliot breathes deep, nods. Slugs the rest of the drink.

                                 CRAIG
                        Let’s take your car.
           Elliot makes to follow him, pulls his jacket off the coat 
           rack, gets as far as the door... 

           ...when he stumbles. Plants a hand on the wall. Vision 
           doubling. Craig standing there -- expression suddenly cold.

                                 CRAIG
                        I’m curious about something.

           Elliot sways, almost TOPPLES OVER, steadies himself.

                                 CRAIG
                        You sure your capsules didn’t say 
                        anything about me?

                                 ELLIOT
                        What’re-- what’reyou--

                                 CRAIG
                        I only ask, ‘cause... you won’t 
                        believe what mine said about you.

           Elliot’s eyes go to the EMPTY LIQUOR GLASS on the table. 
           Realizing what’s happening. Horror flooding into him.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...no...

                                 CRAIG
                        I didn’t wanna believe it when I 
                        heard it. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Craig--

                                 CRAIG
                        “He’s gonna come to your house, 
                        begging for help. He’s gonna ask to 
                        come in. He’ll have a gun.” 

           Elliot reaches for his jacket pocket; the gun’s gone. Craig 
           holds it; stole it from Elliot’s coat when he hung it up.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...you don’t... understand...

                                 CRAIG
                        ...I understand, Elliot. Wish I 
                        fuckin’ didn’t, but I understand.

           Elliot tries to GRAB HIM... and BAM! Collapses. BLACKNESS.

           THROUGH ELLIOT’S POV:

           --Blinks of reality, going in and out of consciousness.
           --BLINK TO: Craig standing over us with the gun. Aiming it at 
           us, trying to summon the strength to pull the trigger...

           --BLINK TO: Craig, in the hazy distant kitchen, takes a long 
           pull off his Scotch bottle. Leaning on the wall, in turmoil.

           --BLINK TO: Our feet getting dragged across a garage floor.

                                 CRAIG (O.S.)
                             (whispers)
                        ...it’s ok... it’s ok... I hear 
                        it’s just like falling asleep...

           BLACKNESS.

           INT. ELLIOT’S CAR, PARKED - DAY

           WHAM! Elliot JERKS AWAKE. Realizing where he is: in his car, 
           in the backseat, with the ENGINE RUNNING. Foggy outside... 
           except that he’s not outside; he’s inside a closed, exhaust-
           filled garage. He’s been left here to “commit suicide.” 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...jesushchrisht...

           Moving with doped sluggishness -- the drugs Craig gave him 
           have worn off early, but he’s still feeling the residuals -- 
           Elliot tries to the unlock the doors.

           No dice -- unlock mechanism’s disabled. Oh shit.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...c’mon...

           Elliot leans into the front -- sees the keys in the ignition 
           and a CINDERBLOCK on the gas, the car REVVING IN NEUTRAL. 

           ELLIOT’S POV: he LUNGES forward to reach for the keys, his 
           vision doubles, monoxide poisoning kicking in, he COLLAPSES--

           --against the seat, slumping down onto the GEAR SHIFT. Which 
           starts to GET PUSHED FORWARD from his weight.

           Juuuuust about to click from NEUTRAL to REVERSE...

           CLICK!

           The sedan FLIES BACK. Elliot’s eyes snap open, JERKS AROUND--

           --to see the garage door BUCKLE and BURST OPEN as the car 
           tears through it and out onto...

           THE TOP OF A VERY LONG, STEEP SAN FRANCISCO HILL 

           Staying ENTIRELY INSIDE ELLIOT’S POV, we experience this:
           Traffic zipping both ways past us until BAM! We get clipped 
           by a TRUCK, shatters a window, force THROWING us into the 
           backseat, car now aimed ass-first down the hill. 

           VRRRRRRRM goes the engine as the world goes BLURRING PAST in 
           the windows, powerlines ZIPPING OVERHEAD through the sunroof. 
           Terrified, we try to crawl into the front seat as-- 

           BAM! A set of DENTED TRASH CANS sail over the windshield and 
           bounce away-- catapulted by the rear of the speeding vehicle.

           Cars SWERVE around us, horns BLASTING, as we pull ourselves 
           into the driver’s seat... and for a split second, in the REAR 
           VIEW MIRROR, we can see a CUBE-TRUCK CAREENING TOWARD US.

                                 ELLIOT
                        --no--

           We JAM our seatbelt into place and SHOVE THE CINDERBLOCK OFF 
           THE GAS WITH OUR FOOT, giving the WHEEL A JERK--

           --causing us to BURN A SICKENING 180, the truck WHIPPING 
           PAST, missing by inches...

           CRASH! We jump the sidewalk and SLAM side-first into a light 
           pole. CRUMPLE goes the passenger door, glass hurricanes into 
           our eyes. We finally BREAK OUT OF ELLIOT’S POV, floating...

           OUTSIDE THE CAR

           The driver’s door flies open, Elliot STUMBLES OUT, battered, 
           gasping. There’s a WAIL OF POLICE SIRENS approaching. Not 
           even bothering with the LOOKY-LOOS crowding in, he HOBBLE-
           SPRINTS down a side street, then another, before dodging--

           INTO AN ALLEYWAY

           --where he SKIDS UP behind a dumpster and collapses against 
           it -- looking half-dead and cauterized with adrenaline.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...holyshit... holyshit...

           Elliot sneaks ahead and peeks out of the alleyway...

           BACK TOWARD THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT

           ...where the cops have surrounded the accident, chatter 
           coming in over the radios...

                                 RADIO CHATTER
                        ...vehicle registered to Lockhart, 
                        Elliot... suspect wanted for the 
                        245 downtown this morning...

           Elliot turns and gets out of there. Fast. 
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A taxi’s brakes WHEEZE as it stops, Elliot hops in. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Where to? 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Home. Uh, 24th and Dolores--

           The DRIVER suspiciously eyes this beat-up mess of a fare. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Got money?
                             (off his nod)
                        Show me.

           Elliot grabs his wallet -- only a few dollars inside. Grabs a 
           credit card. Looks to the card machine. Thinks better of it.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Forget it.

           Out of the cab as quick as he got in as we hear a WHOOSH--

           EXT. POST OFFICE EXPRESS - DAY

           A BUS ROARS OFF, revealing Elliot at a Post Office Express.

           INSIDE: Elliot JAMS a key into his safe-deposit box. The one 
           where he put his $50,000 and passport. Opens the door...

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        ...fuck me...

           The deposit box is EMPTY. Apprehension and confusion 
           overtaking him, he SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT.

           INT. POST OFFICE EXPRESS, BATHROOM - DAY

           Elliot locks himself in the bathroom. Stares at the mirror. 
           Betrayed by everyone... even, it seems, by himself. 

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        ...the hell are you doing to me?...

           He rips open his journal, scribbles the words over and over:

                             TALK TO ME TALK TO ME TALK TO ME

           Then, all at once... he loses it. HURLS the journal across 
           the bathroom. KICKS the shit out of the trash can, sends 
           soiled paper towels flying. 
           PUNCHES the mirror, cracks it, bloodies his knuckles. 
           Cradling his hand, he catches his breath... 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...ok... ok...

           Gives himself a look in the cracked mirror. Fights for calm.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        ...go home, get your shit, find a 
                        place to hide, figure out what the 
                        fuck is going on.

           He sucks in a deep breath... and we SMASH TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Elliot’s shoes beat the pavement, moving intently through the 
           night,heading for his street. His apartment’s a few hundred 
           feet away. Stops, checks it out. Coast looks clear. 

           But as he approaches, he hears it: a COOKING SHOW,from the 
           radio of a white rental Impala parked by his building.

                                 COOKING SHOW HOST
                        ...I like to add a lil’ Chinese 
                        five-spice to the roasting pork...

           He can only make out the driver’s silhouette. Similar build 
           to Elliot, wearing a jacket and a ball-cap. Some SUNFLOWER 
           SEED SHELLS get spat out the window... and it’s then Elliot 
           notices that the gutter is littered with them. 

           Whoever this guy is, he’s been sitting there a while. Elliot 
           pauses... then turns tail. Fast. Rounds the corner--

           DOWN THE NEXT STREET

           --SPRINTING NOW. When all of a sudden... the Impala goes 
           SPEEDING PAST HIM, then JERKS to a stop, blocks his path. The 
           driver -- who we’ll know simply as MAGUIRE -- calls over:

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Cool it, Elliot.
                             (motions)
                        Hop in.

           Elliot steps back, makes to BOLT-- 

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Don’t do that. It’s a 2008 rental 
                        Impala, but I think it can still 
                        move faster than you. 
           Still, Elliot refuses to move. Maguire opens his jacket, 
           shows him the HEAVY HANDGUN inside. Voice still even:

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Hop in.

           Pushing in on Elliot’s fear-frozen face, we SMASH TO:

           INT. IMPALA, MOVING - NIGHT

           The two men ride in silence -- Elliot’s born out of fear, 
           Maguire’s born out of professional courtesy. He drives with 
           one hand, casually keeps his gun on Elliot with the other.

                                 ELLIOT
                        So you’re... taking me out 
                        somewhere to shoot me.

           No reply. They pass streetlight, Elliot gets a look at 
           Maguire: 40, face like an aging Irish choir boy. As 
           dispassionate as an NYC coroner seeing his 500th dead hooker.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Guessing you’re not gonna say why.

           Silence from Maguire. Elliot looks down, glimpses a BALLPOINT 
           PEN in the center console. Closest thing he’s got to a 
           weapon. All he has to do is palm it. Elliot, hoping to direct 
           Maguire’s attention elsewhere, keeps talking...

                                 ELLIOT
                        You realize that makes no sense, 
                        right? Considering that any 
                        information you give me is gonna go 
                        out the back of my skull along with 
                        most of my gray matter whenever we--

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Have you and I met?

           Elliot’s taken aback by his sudden response. Then...

                                 ELLIOT
                        No. 

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Exactly. So you got no reason to be 
                        treating this like it’s personal. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        So this is business.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Yep.

           They ride on silence for a moment. Elliot, eyes on the pen...
                                 ELLIOT
                        ...somebody just gives you money, 
                        you go shoot someone, just like 
                        that, without even questioning it.

                                 MAGUIRE
                             (sighs)
                        Ever cook lobster?

                                 ELLIOT
                        What?

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Lobster, ever cooked one?

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...yeah?

                                 MAGUIRE
                        After you throw it in the water, 
                        you stay around to watch it cook?

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...no.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Right. ‘Cause then you start 
                        wondering why you’re doing it and 
                        the next thing you know, you’re 
                        eating sprouts and tofu. Soon as 
                        you start questioning, you start 
                        doubting. Me, I don’t question. And 
                        that’s why I’m sitting here and 
                        you’re sitting there.

           WHEEEOOOO-WHEEOOOO! A cop car approaches, sirens wailing. As 
           Maguire watches the cops pass by, Elliot snatches the pen. 
           Pockets it just as he turns back. Speeding on into the dark.

           EXT. VIADUCT - NIGHT

           We WHOOSH past an industrial-sector bridge, to the darkened 
           aqueduct below... where Maguire’s car pulls into an alcove.  

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Outside.

           Elliot climbs out. Gets marched to the trunk, lid popped.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Open it.

           Elliot -- waiting for his moment to grab the pen and jam it 
           into this fucker’s neck -- follows orders. The trunk door 
           opens, reveals BOXES and SAMPLE KITS, all with a company 
           logo: KITCHEN SOLUTIONS, INC. Elliot glances at him...
                                 ELLIOT
                        ...you chose... kitchen-supply 
                        sales as your cover-job?

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Stop talking.
                             (motions)
                        Underneath.

           Elliot reaches in and finds a FOLDED UP TARP under the boxes.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Lay it down, unfold it.

           Face like stone, Elliot tosses down the tarp. Gets on his 
           knees, unfolds it. Glances at Maguire, who’s doing a sweep of 
           the perimeter. Elliot reaches into his pocket for the pen--

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Nice try, asshole--

           WHAM! Maguire PISTOL-WHIPS him. Kicks him in the ribs, knocks 
           him onto his stomach. Elliot, in agony, tries to crawl away. 
           Maguire stalks after, into the near-blackness of the alcove--

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Make this difficult, I start with 
                        your feet and work upward, got it?

                                 ELLIOT
                             (drooling blood)
                        ...I’m not really in the mood for a 
                        massage, but thanks for asking...

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Not the last words I would’ve 
                        chosen, but to each their own...

           And just as Maguire levels the gun at him, Elliot turns... 
           and we see he’s got a CAPSULE in his hand. 

           CLICK-FLASH! The capsule emits its blinding-white light. 
           Maguire shields his eyes, disoriented...and BAM! Elliot 
           LUNGES AT HIM. Tackles him, wrestles his gun away...

           WHACK! Elliot CLOCKS HIM with it, Maguire quits struggling.

                                 ELLIOT
                        See? That hurts. It’s not fun. You 
                        shouldn’t do that to people.

                                 MAGUIRE
                             (squeezing his forehead)
                        ...fuckin’ dead man...
                                 ELLIOT
                        Yeah, let’s talk about that. Who 
                        hired you?

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Fuck yourself.

           WHACK! Elliot whips him again. Maguire SEETHES in pain.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Listen, I’ve been off my meds for 
                        four weeks and I’ve been getting 
                        personal messages from myself in 
                        the future, you are not dealing 
                        with a stable person here.
                             (puts gun to his head)
                        Last time -- who? 

           Maguire spits some blood... and tells the truth.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        We don’t meet. I get an email, I go 
                        to a safe-deposit box, I collect 
                        fifty grand, I go to work. 

           Elliot suddenly pauses -- safe deposit box? Fifty grand?

           And it’s then he spots something sticking out of Maguire’s 
           pocket. He snatches it... and his mouth drops open.

           It’s Elliot’s passport. The one he left in his emergency 
           stash. Name, photo, phone number, address. The realization 
           hits Elliot like a boxer’s uppercut to the sternum...

           ...I’ve been tricked into hiring my own hit-man. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...jesus...

           WHOOSH! Maguire, having snagged a broken bottle off the 
           ground, SLASHES with it. Elliot tries to block it, gets his 
           forearm cut open, drops the gun. Maguire SHOVES HIM AWAY, 
           lunges for the gun, Elliot KICKS IT into the shadows--

           --then SPRINTS. Maguire pulls a SNUB-NOSE from his ankle 
           holster, gives chase. Elliot VAULTS up the steps toward--

           THE BRIDGE

           ...where Maguire rounds the corner to discover Elliot is 
           nowhere to be seen. Maguire stalks along, eyes scanning...

           ...until he sees it. In the canal, floating away, is Elliot’s 
           jacket. Maguire eyes it. Turns back toward the stairwell. And 
           as he passes, we reveal Elliot -- perched up on the bridge, 
           flattening himself against a column for dear life...
           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

           CRASH! A busboy dumps BAGS OF TRASH into a dumpster... 

           ...not noticing Elliot hiding beside it. Crouched and 
           sweating, journal open in his hand, the scrawl reading: 

                               I REMEMBER WHAT YOU REMEMBER

           But Elliot’s eyes aren’t on the journal, they’re on the 
           LIQUOR STORE across the street. A beat. Then, decision made, 
           he scrawls a message into his journal, big and bold:

                                         FUCK YOU

           INT. GENE’S LIQUOR - NIGHT

           A bell DINGS as Elliot war-paths up to the tattooed cashier.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Let’s say you didn’t want to 
                        remember a single thing you did 
                        tonight -- what would you drink?

           The clerk gives this some serious consideration.

                                 CLERK
                        ...I’d say a combination of Early 
                        Times whiskey and Night Train wine.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’ll take it.

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

           CLICK-CLICK go numbers on the pump. Maguire, looking worse 
           for wear, refills his sedan. His phone buzzes, he reads the 
           incoming email: GENE’S LIQUOR ON TARAVAL ST AND 32ND. 

           INT. GENE’S LIQUOR - NIGHT

           DING! The liquor store door swings open, Maguire moves 
           through, scanning the area for Elliot. No sign of him. He 
           punches an email into his phone: NEED UPDATED LOCATION. Then 
           eyes clerk, tosses Elliot’s PASSPORT on the counter. 

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Seen this guy tonight?

                                 CLERK
                             (eyes the photo)
                        Came in earlier. Way he was 
                        looking, about to have the best 
                        night of his life or the worst. 
           Maguire nods a “thank you”, turns to go, and his phone buzzes 
           with an incoming email: UPDATED LOCATION UNAVAILABLE.

           INT. ROBYN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           BANG-BANG! A rowdy knocking on a door. The door opens and 
           Elliot SPILLS IN, beyond wasted. Robyn, exasperated, stuffs 
           her TASER back into her purse as Elliot stumbles in her boho-
           chic living room, slurring his speech--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Sorry-- sorry, lishten, I--

                                 ROBYN
                        Jesus, Elliot, what’d you drink?

                                 ELLIOT
                        All of it.

                                 ROBYN
                        Alright, know what, this is not ok--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Robyn, wait--

                                 ROBYN 
                             (dials her cell)
                        Hi, yes? I’m 4306 Indian Wood Road, 
                        I need a taxi... Yes, I can hold...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Listen to me--

                                 ROBYN
                        You’re hurting. I get it. Move on.

                                 ELLIOT
                        What if I told you that people are 
                        trying to kill me?

                                 ROBYN
                        I’d say you need to get back on 
                        your medication.
                             (into phone)
                        Hi, ok, phone number is--

           There’s a BLINDING FLASH. Robyn WHIRLS... and finds herself 
           looking at a HOLOGRAM projected from the capsule in Elliot’s 
           hand: insider her kitchen sits Elliot, 20 years older, at a 
           table in a blank room, projected in jittery pixels.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (THROUGH HOLOGRAM)
                        What I’m about to tell you is the 
                        last message I ever wanted to send--

           WHACK! Robyn’s phone hits the floor. She covers her mouth.
                                 ROBYN
                        ...is that... you?...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Not yet.

           INT. ROBYN’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           AMBER LIQUOR pours, Robyn takes a big gulp. Clear that she’s 
           been brought up to speed. Elliot takes slugs from his 
           Nighttrain bottle, keeping his mental-cloud in place. 

                                 ROBYN
                             (after a beat)
                        You have any of your Klonopin left? 
                        I could really use one. Or twelve.

                                 ELLIOT
                        So you believe me.

           Robyn takes a moment. Then, breaking it down:

                                 ROBYN
                        You get messages from yourself. You 
                        get lulled into trusting them. Then 
                        you get told to kill Prescott. You 
                        don’t. Then you discover Prescott’s 
                        been told to kill you. He fails. So 
                        then Craig tries to kill you. That 
                        doesn’t work either. Then there’s 
                        the kicker: you hire your own hit-
                        man. And it’s at that point... you 
                        decide to get me involved?

                                 ELLIOT
                        We’re safe, nobody’s gonna find me--

                                 ROBYN
                        How do you know? Can you see the 
                        future? Wait, don’t answer that--

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m being tracked by my memories. 
                        Least I think I am. Wherever I go, 
                        I remember it, and then the bad 
                        guys show up. But thanks to this--
                             (toasts his bottle)
                        --anything I do gets blotted out.

                                 ROBYN
                        Keep drinking.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Copy that.

           He follows orders. Robin paces, overwhelmed, stressed. 
                                 ROBYN
                        ...are you seeing the obvious 
                        question here?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Why am I trying to take myself out?
                             (off her nod)
                        ...wouldn’t be the first time I 
                        tried to make that happen.

           In his drunken state, he’s almost got a sense of humor about 
           it. But it’s still not a pleasant memory for Robyn. 

                                 ROBYN
                        So what, this is... retroactive 
                        self-obliteration-by-time-travel?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Well, when you put it like that--

                                 ROBYN
                        What if that’s not you in the 
                        capsules? What if it’s just... 
                        someone who looks what you might 
                        look like in twenty years?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Trust me, it’s me. Same voice, 
                        features, posture, nervous habits--

                                 ROBYN
                        Like what you’re doing right now?

           Elliot realizes he’s doing the little tic he does whenever 
           he’s thinking: tracing little designs with his fingertip on 
           the table. And suddenly... something clicks in his brain.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...yes.

           He’s out of his chair in a flash as we CUT TO:

           THE KITCHEN, where Elliot’s capsule FLICKERS TO LIFE.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...you see? You see?

           Robyn sees it. So do we. Future Elliot is subtly tracing a 
           design with his fingertip onto the table he’s sitting at. 
           Elliot moves alongside the hologram, so he can mimic it...

           ...drawing the design into his notebook. Elliot and Robyn 
           look at the page in his journal, which now reads:

                                            P
                                 ROBYN
                        So your future self is either 
                        teaching you the alphabet... or 
                        he’s trying to send a message.
                             (off his nod)
                        Were you doing this in the others?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I don’t-- I gotta watch them again--
                             (stands up)
                        They’re at my place, I gotta get--

           He rushes up, drunkenly trips, hits the floor, hard. 

                                 ROBYN (PRE-LAP)
                        One, two, three--

           INT. ROBYN’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Robyn strains to pull half-conscious Elliot onto the couch. 
           Tosses him a pillow. Not happy about being thrown into this 
           scary, surreal world, but dealing with it the best she can.

                                 ROBYN
                        ...I’m gonna put this big, powerful 
                        brain of mine to work tomorrow, and 
                        we’re gonna figure out a way to un-
                        fuck this situation.
                             (beat)
                        Questions?

                                 ELLIOT
                             (looks around)
                        Isn’t... Steve gonna wonder why I’m-

                                 ROBYN
                        Not that kind of relationship.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Oh. 
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t-- I thought you guys were--

                                 ROBYN
                        I wasn’t look to jump into anything 
                        big after...
                             (beat)
                        Plus, he’s into Fantasy Football 
                        and listens to Jason Mraz.

           Elliot takes a moment to savor that. Robyn notices. 
                                 ROBYN
                        I wanna be clear: only reason you 
                        and I are together now is because 
                        I’m pretty sure you’ll get killed 
                        if you try to do this alone.

           Tosses a comforter to him. And just as she walks out...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Since I won’t remember any of this, 
                        I’m just gonna spit this out...
                             (beat)
                        I know why you left.

           She turns back to him, skeptical.

                                 ROBYN
                        Why’d I leave, Elliot?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Because I turned out to be a 
                        complete and total colossal 
                        failure. Took me a while to realize 
                        that, so don’t worry, I get it, I 
                        wouldn’t have stuck around either-- 

                                 ROBYN
                        I didn’t leave because your company 
                        went under.
                             (off his surprised look)
                        Even if you’d succeeded, I still 
                        would’ve left.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...what are you talking about?

                                 ROBYN
                        You weren’t happy with yourself. 
                        Not even when things were good. You 
                        were only happy with who you were 
                        gonna be in the future. Always “one 
                        day.” One day we’d get married. One 
                        day we’d go down to the islands and 
                        you’d teach me how to sail. One day 
                        you’d believe in yourself the way I 
                        did. But “one day” never 
                        materialized. And after Radius, you 
                        just... threw in the towel.

           Elliot stares blearily at her, unprepared to hear the truth. 
           Taking it as best he can...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...for the record, I never stopped 
                        wanting to get on that boat with 
                        you.
           She almost softens for a beat. Turns to go. Then pauses--

                                 ROBYN
                        What are you gonna do once the 
                        booze wears off?

           She realizes she’s talking to a passed-out person. Her face -- 
           shit. Thinks for a long beat... then grabs her CAR KEYS.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Robyn, now in her nursing scrubs, goes through the late-night 
           corridors of the hospital. Nods “hello” to a fellow NURSE.

                                 NURSE
                        Got you on late tonight, huh?

                                 ROBYN
                        No rest for the wicked.

           And rounds a corner to a LOCKED DOOR marked PHARMACEUTICALS.

           INT. ROBYN’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           THROUGH ELLIOT’S POV: the blurry world gradually sharpens...

                                 ROBYN (O.S.)
                        Easy now, it’d mean the world to me 
                        if you didn’t puke on my couch...

           Robyn looms into frame, handing us a glass of water. Elliot 
           gulps most of it, flops back down on the couch. Then--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Shit.

           WHAM! Elliot sits up in a lurch.

                                 ROBYN
                        What?

                                 ELLIOT
                        --I’m sober, I’ll-- remember this--

                                 ROBYN
                        No you won’t.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (checks watch)
                        It’s 9:30, last drink I had was--

                                 ROBYN
                        I just dosed you with Rohypnol.

           Elliot -- what? She motions to his water glass.
                                 ROBYN
                        And 50 milligrams of Dexedrine. So 
                        you’ll be awake, alert, and 
                        remembering absolutely nothing.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Isn’t Rohypnol a... date-rape drug?

                                 ROBYN
                        It’s not just for date-rape. Jesus. 
                        Rohypnol gets such a bad rap. 
                             (pulls him to his feet)
                        We’ve got four hours before the 
                        amnesiac effects wear off, so we’ve 
                        got that long to go get those 
                        goddamn capsules and figure out 
                        what you’re trying to tell you.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...how do I know when it kicks in?

           INT. ROBYN’S CAR, MOVING - MORNING

           Elliot -- riding slumped in Robyn’s car, gazing blissfully 
           through the open sun-roof at the building’s passing overhead. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Elliot? Still with me? 

           Elliot turns up the MUSIC -- some Phil Spector wall-of-sound 
           track. Sticks his head out the window. And through Elliot’s 
           POV, everything slows to a crawl. Colors brighten. The music 
           takes over. And Elliot just grooves with it. Momentarily 
           floating above the maelstrom that his life has become. Until--

                                 ROBYN
                        Forgetting you’ve got a warrant?

           Robyn YANKS HIM back into the car as we CUT TO:

           EXT. ELLIOT’S STREET - DAY

           We focus on Elliot’s building. Robyn’s car drives past, she 
           scopes out the area, no sign of Elliot in the vehicle...

                                 ROBYN
                        Nobody on the street, nobody 
                        waiting in a car.

           Reveal Elliot on the floor of the backseat, out of view. 

                                 ROBYN
                        I’ll keep watch in the courtyard--
                                 ELLIOT
                        Hell you will--

                                 ROBYN
                        I just dosed with two different 
                        Schedule 1 drugs, think you’re 
                        gonna get by on your wits alone?

           He registers the validity of her point.

                                 ROBYN
                        Anything weird, your phone’ll ring.

           As she parks them a couple blocks down around the corner, the 
           two breathe deep and prepare themselves for what’s to come...

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

           Elliot moves swiftly down a side-street, toward his 
           courtyard. Head low, trying to control his breathing. Behind 
           him, Robyn posts up at the courtyard entrance. On high alert.

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           CLICK! Elliot keys open his apartment.. Steps back, peeking 
           into his domicile... and sees its empty. Just to be sure, he 
           takes an empty Perrier bottle off a table and ROLLS IT down a 
           hallway, RATTLING across the floor. Gets no response.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        ...ok...

           And cautiously goes in... 

           IN THE COURTYARD

           Robyn waits. Watches. Wipes a trickle of sweat from her brow. 
           Notices a STOCKY FELLA IN A HOODY on a stoop. Not exactly 
           ignoring her. Her fingers grip her phone, ready to hit call.

           INSIDE THE APARTMENT

           A CLOCK gets removed from the wall, revealing the small 
           titanium safe behind it. Elliot approaches...

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        54-66-31-97...

           He spins the code into the safe... and nothing happens. The 
           door stays shut. He retries the code. No dice. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...shit...
           He tries a few more combinations on the lock. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Thank you for giving me an amnesia-
                        causing drug... the one time I need 
                        to remember something...

           Looks to his NOTEBOOKS strewn on the table. We saw him write 
           his safe code down in one of these. Starts flipping through--

                                 ELLIOT
                        C’mon, code, code, code...

           IN THE COURTYARD

           Robyn’s got her eyes glued on the HOODY-WEARING FELLA down 
           the street. Who’s now moving down the sidewalk. Locks eyes 
           with her for a second. His are bloodshot with THC.

                                 HOODY
                        I like your hair. 

                                 ROBYN
                             (tense)
                        Thank you.

                                 HOODY
                             (smirks)
                        Curtains match the drapes?

           Robyn, realizing this guy’s not a threat, just a prick...

                                 ROBYN
                        I look bald to you, asshole?

           That shuts this jerkoff down cold. He keeps walking. Then--

                                 MAGUIRE (O.S.)
                        Some real charmers in this 
                        neighborhood, huh?

           Robyn turns to see our pal MAGUIRE strolling up. Doing a not-
           bad impression of an around-the-way-Joe.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Been living here almost a month, 
                        wife doesn’t like me smoking in the 
                        house. I get to stand out here and 
                        see the whole rainbow of upstanding 
                        humanity this street has to offer.
                             (lights his smoke)
                        You live in the neighborhood?

                                 ROBYN
                        No, just... waiting on a friend.

           Maguire nods, drags on his smoke. Subtly sizing her up.
           INSIDE ELLIOT’S APARTMENT

           PAGES WHIP PAST in Elliot’s journal, his finger scanning... 
           and then stops. He’s found the code. He WHIRLS to the safe--

           OUT IN THE COURTYARD

           Robyn, apprehension growing, allows herself a glance at 
           Maguire as he contemplatively taps ashes off his smoke. 

                                 MAGUIRE
                        They got a law against smoking on 
                        the sidewalk in this part of town, 
                        you believe that?

                                 ROBYN
                        I didn’t hear.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Pretty soon, only legal place left 
                        to have a cigarette is gonna in the 
                        trunk of some guy’s car in Modesto.

                                 ROBYN
                             (tries to laugh)
                        ...so which unit do you live in?

                                 MAGUIRE
                        304. Patels on my left, Lockhart on 
                        my right. Know any of them? 

                                 ROBYN
                        Can’t say I do.

           Maguire can tell she’s lying without even looking at her. He 
           goes to a butt-can on a stoop to deposit his smoke. As he 
           does, Robyn reaches into her pocket for her phone, when--

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Gimme it. Don’t think, just do it.

           Robyn freezes. Maguire approaches, smirking, as we SNAP TO:

           INSIDE ELLIOT’S APARTMENT

           Elliot’s fingers RAKE capsules out of his safe. Scoops the 
           last ones out, turns for the door... 

           ...and notices it: Robyn’s not in the courtyard. Elliot grabs 
           his phone, punches CALL...

           ...and then notices something even weirder: he can hear her 
           phone ringing. It’s outside, getting closer and closer, until 
           BAM! His front door SWINGS WIDE, Robyn gets SHOVED THROUGH. 
           She hits the floor, purse scattering its contents. 
                                 ELLIOT
                        Robyn--

           CRACK! He’s laid out by a blow from Maguire. Who calmly shuts 
           the door behind him and locks it. Out comes his silenced .45

                                 MAGUIRE
                        I’m only getting paid for one, so 
                        trust me, Elliot, this is not my 
                        idea of a good time.

           He stalks toward Elliot, who crawls backwards through the 
           debris from Robyn’s purse. Glances at Robyn--

                                 MAGUIRE
                        You don’t wanna watch this. 

           Elliot spots something: there’s a weapon right by him. Her 
           Taser, the one we saw the night before. Robyn, wheezing--

                                 ROBYN
                        ...don’t... please...

                                 MAGUIRE
                        If I had a dollar for every time I 
                        heard that... I’d make money in a 
                        really weird way.

           Maguire turns back to Elliot. CLACK! Elliot fires the Taser, 
           its hooked wires SHOOT OUT, biting into Maguire’s gun-hand.

           CLICKA-CLICKA-CLICKA go the twin electrical currents, frying 
           their way into Maguire’s body, causing him to DROP TO HIS 
           KNEES... but he can still pull the trigger. POP! POP! POP! 
           The silenced gun WILDLY SPRAYS AMMO ALL OVER THE LIVING ROOM. 

           Elliot tosses the Taser and LUNGES for cover as bullets whip 
           through the space he just occupied and atomize his coffee 
           table into spurts of glass. SKIDS UP behind his big steel 
           desk as AMMO WARPS ITS SURFACE, sparks flying over his head.

                                 ELLIOT
                        --jesuschrist--

           CLICK-CLICK-CLICK!

                                 MAGUIRE
                        ...sonofabitch...

           Maguire yanks the hooks out of his hand with his teeth, spits 
           them away, slaps in fresh ammo, stands and CRACK! Crumples to 
           the wall. Revealing Robyn, holding the bottle Elliot rolled 
           across the floor, surface cracked. Elliot’s on his feet--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Wasn’t that supposed to... shatter?
                                 ROBYN
                        You get hit with something that 
                        thick, your skull shatters, not the 
                        bottle. He’s not going anywh--

                                 ELLIOT
                        ROBYN--

           Elliot TACKLES ROBYN, just as BULLETS CHEW UP THE WALL THEY 
           WERE JUST IN FRONT OF. Maguire, scalp bleeding, is back up as-

           ELLIOT AND ROBYN: bolt around the next corner toward the back 
           door. CRACK! They bust it open and out they go, just as--

           MAGUIRE

           --rushes to the back exit, looks to the alley: empty. Rips a 
           u-turn, rushes back through the apartment and out into--

           THE COURTYARD

           --concealing his gun as he war-paths toward the street, just 
           in time to see Robyn’s car go SMOKING OFF. Gone. He looks 
           after them, anger sizzling just under his unflappable facade.

           INT. ROBYNS CAR, MOVING - DAY

           Elliot at the wheel, they whip through traffic, when an ALARM 
           sounds. Digs out his cell; it’s an alarm text, reading DOSE.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Oh shit--

                                 ROBYN
                        What?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Need more Rohypnol.

           Robyn’s face goes white as she realizes...

           INT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT - DAY

           We go travelling over the debris-strewn floor, to find the 
           bottle of ROHYPNOL. Spilled from her purse.

                                 ROBYN (POST-LAP)
                        ...it’s back in your house.

           BACK IN THE CAR

           She looks at him, fear rising.
                                 ROBYN
                        We can... we can get more, we just 
                        have to go to the hospital--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Time we get there, I’ll remember 
                        where we are.

                                 ROBYN
                        ...what do we do?

           Elliot thinks... and SCREEEEE! Swerves over, slams the 
           brakes, grabs a CANVAS GROCERY SACK out of the backseat.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Follow me. 

           INT. TAXI, PARKED - DAY

           WYLIE, a harried Hatian cab driver, sits in his parked taxi, 
           playing Angry Birds on his iPhone. Suddenly, his door opens 
           and Robyn and Elliot -- Elliot wearing the canvas sack over 
           his head like a Guantanamo prisoner -- slide in.

                                 ROBYN
                             (hands over a $50)
                        Take this, listen, we need--

                                 WYLIE
                        Son, you got a fuckin’ bag on your 
                        head.

                                 ELLIOT
                        --just drive. Don’t tell us where 
                        we’re going. No street-names, no 
                        addresses, no landmarks. Got it?

           Wylie shakes his head; you’re the boss. Drives them off.

           INT. CAB, MOVING -- EVENING

           As the sun sinks over San Francisco, Robyn and bag-head 
           Elliot ride in silence. She breaks it:

                                 ROBYN
                        Guess I should probably say thank 
                        you for lunging in front of a gun 
                        for me back there. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Yeah, well... quid pro quo.

           A long beat. She looks at his hand, resting there on the seat 
           near hers. It seems, for a moment, that she might just simply  
           throw caution to the window and close his hand in hers...
           ...but she doesn’t. They ride on in silence.

           EXT. PORT OF OAKLAND - NIGHT

           Nightfall. We go soaring over the industrial futurescape that 
           is the PORT OF OAKLAND, finally sinking towards...

           THE PARKING LOT OF A STORAGE RENTAL FACILITY

           ...into the main office we go, where we find Robyn handing 
           over $100 cash to a sleazy RENTAL CLERK. Who glances over at 
           Elliot, still sitting in the taxi, bag over his head. 

                                 RENTAL CLERK
                        ...he with you?

                                 ROBYN
                        Yep.

                                 RENTAL CLERK
                             (nods appreciatively)
                        You guys like to party.

                                 ROBYN 
                             (lifts another $100)
                        For you... if this doesn’t get 
                        entered into the system.

           The clerk winks, takes the money, and we CUT TO:

           INT. RENTAL STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

           CLANG! The garage-style door SHUTS. Robyn yanks the bag off 
           Elliot’s head, he looks around at this anonymous space.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (sly smile)
                        ...where are we?

                                 ROBYN
                        Nowhere.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Perfect.

           CUT TO: the bag of capsules gets dumped out. Elliot grabs 
           one, hits PLAY. The overhead light flickers as it powers up, 
           the flash POPS, and Future Elliot delivers a message.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        ...next step: find yourself a date 
                        for tonight. Go to the WP-24, say 
                        “diamond” to the door man...
                                 ROBYN
                             (a beat, then)
                        Wait... WP-24... wasn’t that--

                                 ELLIOT
                             (embarrassed)
                        Uh, yeah, that was--

                                 ROBYN
                        So you used this piece of 
                        miraculous technology as a means 
                        to... humiliate Steve.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Future-me did that, ok? Future-me--

                                 ROBYN
                        Future-you is kind of an asshole--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Future-me is also apparently a 
                        conniving psychopath, so I’ll add 
                        that to my list of complaints--

                                 ROBYN
                        Wait, look, you’re doing it again--

           Elliot focuses on the hologram... and in it, just as before, 
           he sees his future self subtly tracing a letter on the table.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Let’s see what I’ve got to say...

           He scrawls the letter D onto the wall. Fires up the next 
           capsule as PERCUSSION RISES and we WHOOSH TO:

           --Elliot scribbling letters onto the wall of the storage 
           unit, sweating and pacing like a madman...

           --Robyn, noticing that Elliot’s been working out (and down to 
           her tank-top herself at this point), snaps back to attention.

           --Words starting to take shape...

                                         D O N T

           --More capsules. More scribbling on the wall.

                                    D O N T  T R U S T

           --CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! More capsules get turned on, the poor 
           single 60-watt bulb above them straining to stay alight...

                                          H O S 

           --Holographic Future Elliot: finger every-so-secretly tracing 
           out the next letter.
                                 ROBYN
                        --’T’, it’s an ‘T’--

           --Elliot scrawls as CLICK CLICK CLICK go more capsules...

           --More letters on the wall:

                                          H E L

           --The marker in Elliot’s hand gets TOSSED AWAY as we reveal 
           Elliot and Robyn, standing before a wall of words. 

                                   D O N T  T R U S T 

                                      H O S T A G E

                              T H E Y  C A N  R E A D  M Y  

                                     M E M O R I E S

                                         H E L P

           The look between Elliot and Robyn -- holy fucking shit.

           CUT TO: LATER IN STORAGE UNIT

           Elliot, sweating, pulls off his shirt and wipes his brow.

                                 ELLIOT
                        So I’ve been kidnapped... twenty 
                        years from now... 

                                 ROBYN
                        ...and forced to manipulate your 
                        younger self into... this fucked-up 
                        murder scheme...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...because apparently someone wants 
                        me, David Prescott, and Craig 
                        Bollinger to kill each other.

                                 ROBYN
                        And anywhere you go, you remember 
                        it, and that’s how they’re able to 
                        track you. 
                             (beat)
                        Question is, who’s “they?” Who’s 
                        pulling the strings? 

                                 ELLIOT
                        That’s what we need to find out.
           EXT. STARLIGHT MOTEL - NIGHT

           ZOOMING WE GO along the second-story deck of a CHEAP MOTEL 
           somewhere outside Oakland, hearing:

                                 ELLIOT (POST-LAP)
                        First things first: we make it 
                        impossible to get a location on me. 
                        That means I gotta travel blind...

           ...ELLIOT, blindfolded, being guided up the outside stairs by 
           Robyn. Paranoid as hell as she makes a bee-line into their...

           CHEAP MOTEL ROOM

           ...where she shuts and double locks the door. 

                                 ELLIOT (POST-LAP)
                        ...and it means I can’t allow 
                        myself to see any visual clue of 
                        where I end up.

           WHOOSH! Robyn closes the curtains, blocking out the view of 
           the neon STARLIGHT MOTEL sign. FLIPS OVER magazines, hiding 
           the postal address stickers. TOSSES stationary in the trash.  

                                 ROBYN
                        We’re good.

           Elliot pulls off his blindfold, looks around. Could be 
           anywhere in the world right now. Nods, relieved. 

                                 ROBYN 
                        Now what?

           Boots up a capsule, pauses it, points to the METAL DOOR 
           behind his future self. Eyes zeroing in on the DOOR’S LOCK...

                                 ELLIOT 
                        We teach me how to break out of 
                        that room.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           --A hardware shopping bag spills out LOCKS. All similar 
           models to the one we saw on the door in the hologram.

           --Elliot, eyes focused, opens a kit of LOCK PICKS. 

           --Slides the tension wrench into a lock.

           --Struggles to fit the torque wrench in. SNAP! It breaks.

           --Tension and torque wrenches now fit into place.

           --Finally pops the lock open. Turns to Robyn... 
                                 ELLIOT
                        How long?

           Robyn holds up her watch:

                                 ROBYN
                        Ten minutes.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Gotta get faster.

           --Elliot surgically places the pins in. Tries again. No dice.

           --Hands moving even faster now, he tries to same pattern of 
           pins... and this time the lock OPENS.

           --Through the windows, day turns into night as Elliot slaves 
           onward. Sweating, steel-eyed...

           --CLICK-CLACK-CLICK! In go the pins, Elliot’s fingers 
           twisting and turning, until... POP! The lock opens.

           --POP! POP! POP! The next three locks open.

           --POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! Elliot picks all five locks.

                                 ROBYN
                        Forty-five seconds a piece. 
                        Congratulations. You just made 
                        yourself an escape artist.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Not yet.
                             (off her look)
                        It doesn’t do me any good to know 
                        how to pick a lock if I don’t have 
                        anything to pick the lock with.

           She looks at him curiously. Clear from his face that he’s 
           really not looking forward to what’s gonna come next.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Have you ever... performed surgery?

                                 ROBYN
                        I’m a nurse, Elliot, we’re not even 
                        legally allowed to perform--
                             (beat)
                        Wait a minute-- why?

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           On the TV, a news report plays: tonight’s big story:
                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        Days after making headlines for his 
                        wireless electricity initiative, 
                        tech mogul Elliot Lockhart is now 
                        sought by police for allegedly 
                        attempting to murder a co-worker...

           Elliot, psyching himself up for what he’s about to do, eyes 
           the news, shaking his head as a soundbite from Wilkes plays:

                                 WILKES 
                        All I can say at this time is that 
                        I believe Elliot to be innocent and 
                        I look forward to having him back.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        Altria CEO Franklin Gantt, 
                        meanwhile, refused to comment...

           The TV shows a shot of Franklin Gantt, flop-sweaty, hustling 
           into a company car as a REPORTER throws questions after him. 
           Elliot’s eyes linger on him for a moment, when--

           CLICK! The motel room door opens and Elliot WHIRLS... to see 
           Robyn coming in, wearing her hospital scrubs, carrying a bag.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Get everything?

           She nods -- neither of them looking forward to this.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Let’s do something horrifying.

           CUT TO: THE BATHROOM

           Paper towels get laid across the sink. Items from Robyn’s bag 
           set down: a set of small, thin LOCK PICKS; a SCALPEL; a 
           HEMOSTATIC CLAMP; SURGICAL NEEDLE and THREAD. Elliot, sitting 
           shirtless in this makeshift surgery theater, steels himself. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Ok, if this works--

                                 ROBYN
                        --huge emphasis on “if”, ‘cause who 
                        knows what the hell will happen to 
                        your body over the next 20 years--

                                 ELLIOT
                        --if this works, once we implant 
                        it, the lock picks will just show 
                        up in my body in 2033, and I’ll 
                        have to get ‘em out from under my 
                        skin. Most likely using my teeth. 
                             (off her wan look)
                        I never said this was gonna be fun. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLIOT (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        It’s just gotta be someplace I can 
                        reach, like...

           Robyn takes his left arm. Eyes the long, dark scar going down 
           the length of his wrist. Then turns his arm over, plants a 
           finger on the unmarred skin of his forearm.

                                 ROBYN
                        Guess you’re getting a new scar. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        This one’ll be different.

           Their eyes meet. Charged. Then back to business...

                                 ROBYN
                        It’s a good spot. Not too many 
                        veins or arteries, less of a chance 
                        you’ll bleed to death.
                             (beat)
                        You ready?

                                 ELLIOT
                        No. 

                                 ROBYN
                        Me neither.

           Robyn SNAPS ON latex gloves.

           CUT TO: Robyn shaving the hair off his forearm.

                                 ROBYN
                        Ok, little caveat? I’ve only 
                        watched surgery being performed--

                                 ELLIOT
                        I have faith in you.

           She douses his forearm with some hand sanitizer.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Is that-- Purell?

                                 ROBYN
                        I had to be in and out of the 
                        hospital like a ninja, ok, the 
                        place is kind of on high alert 
                        since some Rohypnol mysteriously 
                        went missing. I didn’t exactly have 
                        time to grab everything...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...what else did you not get?
                                 ROBYN
                             (a beat)
                        I got everything that’s necessary.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (eyes narrow)
                        ...What Did You Not Get?

           Robyn lifts the scalpel in her hand, glances at Elliot.

                                 ROBYN
                        ...Novocaine?

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...you mean we’re doing this 
                        with... no anesthetic? 

                                 ROBYN
                             (winces)
                        Yeah?--

                                 ELLIOT
                        --where are we, Andersonville? You 
                        couldn’t at least give me a bottle 
                        of bourbon and belt to bite on?

                                 ROBYN
                        You want a belt?

           Elliot looks at her -- are you serious? 

           CUT TO: Elliot putting his belt in his mouth. Ready as he’ll 
           ever be. Robyn sterilizes the scalpel with a lighter, then...

                                 ROBYN
                        Hold still and... try to think of 
                        something nice.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...ikeuht?

                                 ROBYN
                        Like--
                             (thinks)
                        --first time you took off my skirt.

           He goes there... and nods. Not bad. Then she puts the scalpel 
           to his skin and cuts. The wound blooms blood.  His face loses 
           color as he sees little white blobs of fatty tissue emerge.

                                 ROBYN
                        Stop. Stop looking at it. Look over 
                        there.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...hookay...
           Elliot looks away, tries to focus on something else. Focuses 
           on the TOWELS hanging on the rack...

           ...which have the words STARLIGHT MOTEL, OAKLAND CA 
           embroidered into them. The belt falls out of Elliot’s mouth.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...fuck.
                             (off her look)
                        I know where we are.

           Robyn looks where he’s looking -- at the towels.

                                 ROBYN
                        Shit--

           On instinct, she grabs the towels, about to throw them out--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Won’t do any good. 

                                 ROBYN
                        What do we do?

           Elliot’s mind whirs, processing his few options...

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...hurry.

           INT. MAGUIRE’S IMPALA, PARKED - NIGHT

           A swab dabs at a nasty gash. MAGUIRE, in his car, tending to 
           the wound from when Robyn hit him with the bottle. His phone 
           buzzes... and in the incoming email, the text reads:

                                 Starlight Motel, Oakland

           Maguire punches in the address into his phone. The map pops 
           up -- ten minute drive time. 

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Stay put, asshole.

           VROOOOM! Maguire throws the car in gear and PUNCHES IT.

           INT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Hands shaking, Robyn cuts further into Elliot’s arm, he 
           suddenly JERKS BACK in pain, she drops the scalpel--

                                 ROBYN
                        Sorry-- must’ve nicked a nerve--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Get-the-scalpel.
           She’s down to the floor in a half second flat, digging the 
           bloody scalpel out from behind the toilet. Brings it back up, 
           washes it in the sink, takes the cigarette lighter to it, 
           tries to get back to work, but her hands won’t stop shaking.

                                 ROBYN
                        I can’t -- I can’t do this--

                                 ELLIOT
                        It’s ok it’s ok, you’re doing great-

                                 ROBYN
                        I don’t wanna hurt you.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Couldn’t if you tried.

                                 ROBYN
                        Think history’s shown otherwise.

           Inches between them. As intimate as it gets. Whispering:

                                 ELLIOT
                        That wasn’t your fault. None of it. 
                        It was mine. You were right. I 
                        threw in the towel. 
                             (beat)
                        Sooner we finish this, the sooner I 
                        can start making it up to you.

           Robyn weighs his words. Wipes her tears, gets to work. Fast.

           INT. MAGUIRE’S IMPALA, MOVING - NIGHT

           VRRRRRRRR goes the Impala’s engine as Maguire slaloms through 
           freeway traffic. Following the GPS on his phone, seeing his 
           exit coming up. SWERVES past two lanes of traffic to get off--

           INT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           CLINK! The red-dripping scalpel gets tossed into the sink. 
           Robyn snatches up the plyer-style HEMO-CLAMP...

                                 ROBYN
                        Ok, next, I, uh...
                             (hands him the clamp)
                        I need both hands for this next 
                        part, so I need to... take these 
                        and hold the incision open for me.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...really?

                                 ROBYN
                        Do it.
           Elliot yanks the hemo-clamp from her, sucks in a breath...

                                 ROBYN
                        Just put it right in the middle of 
                        the cut and open ‘em up.

           He does it. Eyes jammed shut in pain.

                                 ROBYN
                        Little deeper.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (pushes them further in)
                        ...ohmygod...

                                 ROBYN
                        Good. Open ‘em.

           A flash of it -- the clamp spreading open Elliot’s wound. 
           Robyn tweezers up the bundle of LOCK-PICKS, plants a latex-
           clad finger at the edge of the incision... and starts feeding 
           the tools into the “pocket” Elliot’s made in his forearm.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...holyshit, holyshit...

                                 ROBYN
                        Almost there--

           EXT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           SCREECH go Maguire’s tires as he skids into the motel parking 
           lot. Hops out, makes for the FRONT OFFICE, where he flips out 
           an ID badge from his wallet for the tired female CLERK.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        Department of Homeland Security, 
                        we’ve got a situation and I don’t 
                        have a lotta time. I need to know 
                        if a woman, possibly a couple, came 
                        in here within the past 24 hours 
                        and paid for a room in cash. 

           The clerk is clearly bowled over. 

                                 CLERK
                             (grabs the ledger)
                        There was one, came last night...
                             (lifts a card key)
                        Room 202--

                                 MAGUIRE
                             (snatches the key)
                        Thank you.
                                 CLERK
                        Sir, wait--

           Maguire’s already out the door, Clerk calling after--

                                 CLERK
                        Sir?

           INT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           A surgical needle criss-crosses its thread through flesh. 
           Robyn closing his wound with all the speed she can muster.

           EXT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, UPPER DECK - NIGHT

           Maguire’s boots pound as he runs to the upper level. Clicks 
           the key into a door-slot, THROWS OPEN THE DOOR...

           ...and the lights are on, but nobody’s home. Maguire eyes the 
           bathroom door -- shut. Beats a path toward it, throws it 
           open, letting the door BANG AGAINST THE WALL...

           ...and there’s no one inside. 

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Uh, sir?

           INT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Elliot and Robyn stand frozen. Having just heard the BOOM of 
           the door in the next room. Voices through the vent grate:

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, I meant to tell you--

                                 MAGUIRE (O.S.)
                        Meant to tell me what?

           INT. STARLIGHT MOTEL, OTHER ROOM - NIGHT

           Maguire stalks toward the cowering clerk in the doorway.

                                 CLERK
                        ...she didn’t rent just one room.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        How many?

                                 CLERK
                        202-208. 
           Maguire shoulders past her, glances at the door he just 
           opened -- 202. Then down the row of doors, up to 208. All 
           with their lights on. Shakes his head...

                                 MAGUIRE
                        ...cute.

                                 CLERK
                        Will you be needing more keys?

                                 MAGUIRE
                        No.

           WHAM! He kicks open door 203... and finds the back window 
           open. And a bathroom littered with blood and surgery tools.

           EXT. STARLIGHT MOTEL - NIGHT

           Elliot and Robyn SPRINT through the shadowy back parking lot 
           of the motel, heads low, sucking air. Elliot peeks from 
           behind a pick-up, scans the road ahead of them, towards the  
           TRAIN STOP down the block. BART train approaching.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        On three, we run. Ready?

           She nods.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (whispers)
                        One... two... 

           And on “three”, they hear a noise from behind them. A 
           WHIRRING. Elliot, wide-eyed, looks back to see... a cluster 
           of dust swirling atop the parking lot pavement. A capsule.

                                 ROBYN
                        Elliot...?

           He snatches it, burning his hands as he pockets it. Then 
           together, he and Robyn BOLT FOR THE TRAIN, when--

           VROOOOM! Headlights. Maguire’s Impala, fishtailing toward 
           them. Elliot drags Robyn over the concrete median, just as 
           the Impala SCRAPES it. Our heroes sprint for the train, 
           Maguire lunging out of his vehicle, racing to catch up...

           ...and the DOORS WHOOSH CLOSED. Carrying Robyn and Elliot 
           away into its underground tunnel.

           INT. TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

           Together, they ride in silence. Elliot’s freshly stitched 
           wound seeping red. 
           Their hands closer together this time, almost touching...

           INT/EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Rising up we go, through the ceiling and concrete of the 
           train statio before ending in AN ALLEYWAY ON THE STREET 
           ABOVE, where Elliot and Robyn crouch in an alcove.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Guess we’re about to find out 
                        whether or not this worked.

           He hits play on the capsule. Out blooms a hologram... only 
           this one is different from any we’ve seen previously.

           It’s the same angle in the same room that Future Elliot was 
           being held captive in... but this time the door in the 
           background is open. And the chair at the desk is empty. A 
           figure takes a seat. His face is a mass of blurred pixels, 
           impossible to make out features. Voice digitally distorted:

                                 BLURRED FIGURE (THROUGH HOLOGRAM)
                        Lockhart. Hello. 

           Elliot can only watch, mouth open. The figure lifts a set of 
           LOCK-PICKS from a puddle of blood on the table.

                                 BLURRED FIGURE (THROUGH HOLOGRAM)
                        Pretty strong survival instinct for 
                        a man who tried to kill himself. 
                        Impressive. But it’s time to listen 
                        to reason...

           The figure starts reading off a printed list:

                                 BLURRED FIGURE
                        Your mother and father up in 
                        Bethesda? Your little sister in 
                        Seattle? That pretty redhead you 
                        used to be with? You just painted a 
                        target on all of them. And I don’t 
                        mean in 2033, I mean tonight.

           A look from Robyn to Elliot, the color draining from her.

                                 BLURRED FIGURE
                        Wanna keep these people safe? Turn 
                        yourself in and make sure the cops 
                        lock you up somewhere you won’t get 
                        out of. Or, if you don’t feel like 
                        doing that, you can take a gun and 
                        eat it. Your choice. But if you 
                        don’t choose one... I’m going to 
                        decimate everyone you care about.
           He FLICKS the bloody lock-picks into our faces, then CLICK! 
           The transmission shuts off. Our heroes stand, trembling...

                                 ROBYN
                        Elliot?...

           Elliot’s got something on his mind, silent..

                                 ROBYN
                        Elliot, talk to me--

                                 ELLIOT
                        For a guy that smart, you’d think 
                        he’d know how to use the word 
                        “decimate.”
                             (off her look)
                        “To eliminate 10% of something.”

           Robyn has no idea where Elliot’s sly little smile came from. 
           Until it all comes rushing out of him:

                                 ELLIOT
                        It’s Wilkes. He’s the one who’s 
                        doing this--

                                 ROBYN
                             (disbelieving)
                        Jonathan Wilkes. “Guy who created 
                        the Stack-Phone” Jonathan Wilkes. 
                        “Guy who just became your business 
                        partner” Jonathan Wilkes. Why would 
                        he want to--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Trust me, it’s him.

                                 ROBYN
                        How do you know?

                                 ELLIOT
                        My gut says so.

                                 ROBYN
                        Thought you didn’t trust your gut.

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m learning to.
                             (starts walking)
                        C’mon, let’s pay him a visit. 

                                 ROBYN
                             (catches up with him)
                        Wait -- even if you’re right, even 
                        if he’s the one behind this, how do 
                        you know that “Wilkes-now” is aware 
                        of what he’s doing in 20 years? 
                                 ELLIOT
                        We’ll ask him. 

                                 ROBYN
                        You even know where he lives?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I know someone who does.

           INT. CRAIG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Craig’s Aston Martin rolls up into his garage and he climbs 
           out, mid cell-call as he enters his tacky new apartment...

                                 CRAIG
                        ...no, no, no, what I’m telling you 
                        is, the sauna is too hot. It’s like 
                        Satan’s balls in there, not kidding-

           Craig stops. Because the dimmed lights in his apartment are 
           FLICKERING. Then there’s a BRIGHT FLASH and all over the 
           place, HOLOGRAMS OF FUTURE CRAIG start to pop up, delivering 
           their messages, nightmarishly talking over each other.

                                 CRAIG
                             (whispers)
                        ...oh shit...

           He turns around and WHAM! Elliot DECKS HIM BACKWARDS over his 
           couch, moves in fast. Craig, on the floor, YANKS open a 
           drawer in his end-table, hauls out a gun-case-- 

           --empty. CLICK! Looks to see ROBYN aiming his gun at him. The 
           tense silence is interrupted CRAIG’S DROPPED CELL PHONE..

                                 VOICE ON PHONE
                        Hello? Mr. Bollinger? Still there?

           Elliot grabs the phone and responds matter-of-factly:

                                 ELLIOT (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m gonna have to call you back, I 
                        tried to kill my best friend but 
                        apparently I fucked up because he’s 
                        in my apartment. Talk to ya later. 

           CLICK! Elliot hangs up. Motions to Craig -- sit.

                                 CRAIG
                             (as he sits)
                        My goddamn sauna repairman really 
                        need to know about all that?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Everybody’s gonna know about all 
                        that, Craig. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLIOT (CONT'D)
                        That is, if I don’t just leave you 
                        dead right here in your tacky 
                        fuckin’ living room.

                                 CRAIG
                             (spits blood)
                        It was you or me, Elliot. What was 
                        I supposed to do? 

                                 ROBYN
                        What were you supposed to do? 
                        Jesus, you are...
                             (for lack of better word)
                        ...a really bad friend, Craig.
                             (to Elliot)
                        Did you know he asked me out like 
                        two weeks after we broke up?

                                 ELLIOT
                        What’d you tell him?

           She gives Elliot a “fuck you” look.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (to Craig)
                        Gimme your keys, we’re going for a 
                        drive.

           Craig hands them over. Elliot notices a familiar SAFE KEY. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        “Emergency stash?”

                                 CRAIG
                        Yeah, so?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’ll let Wilkes explain it. Call 
                        him up, get us into his house. 

                                 CRAIG
                        How am I supposed to do that?

                                 ELLIOT
                             (to Robyn)
                        Shoot him in the foot.

                                 CRAIG
                        Ok! Ok, ok, I got this...

           Craig takes the phone, starts dialing, waits...

           INT. WILKES’ MANSION - NIGHT

           DING-DONG! A doorbell chimes and Jonathan Wilkes, tipsy and 
           happy, swings it open to see...
                                 WILKES
                        Bollinger! If there were ever words 
                        to warm my heart, “I got two hot 
                        Asians and an 8-ball” are 
                        definitely in the top ten. C’mon--

           WHUMPH! Bollinger gets SHOVED into Wilkes, knocking them both 
           to the floor as Elliot and Robyn storm in. 

                                 WILKES
                        Whoah! Jesus, Elliot, the fuck is 
                        going on, where you been? The cops 
                        are looking for--

           He cuts himself off when he sees Elliot holding a GUN.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Let’s talk shop.

           INT. WILKE’S MANSION, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Robyn ties off Wilkes’ hands and we follow him as he’s 
           DRAGGED BACKWARD in his rolling desk chair through the house--

                                 WILKES
                        --look, guys, I have no idea what 
                        the fuck any of you are doing here, 
                        but this is really not the way to--

           WHAM! He’s slammed to a stop, gut-first, at the dining room 
           table. Sucking wind, in pain. Positioned next to a similarly 
           chair-bound Craig. Elliot faces him, lifts a CAPSULE.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Recognize this?

           Wilkes stares at him -- pure confusion.

                                 WILKES
                        I give up.

           CRASH! Elliot SWEEPS table-settings away, sending silverware 
           clattering and plates BURSTING off the floor. Getting up 
           close to Wilkes -- who, for the first time, looks scared.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (sticks capsule in face)
                        Lie to me again, I’m gonna make you 
                        fucking choke on this.

                                 WILKES
                        Elliot?... I’ve got a niece and a 
                        nephew coming into town next week, 
                        and I’d really like to see them 
                        again. I’m not lying to you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILKES (CONT'D)
                        I just wanna know what you’re... 
                        trying to communicate to me here.

           Elliot turns away, brain racing, finger tracing on the table-
           top. Robyn closes in, whispers:

                                 ROBYN
                        What if he’s telling the truth?

                                 ELLIOT
                        So what if he is? He’s still gonna 
                        do what he does.

                                 WILKES
                             (calls over, interrupting)
                        Can I propose a solution here? How 
                        about... you two keep silent about 
                        the fact that you were able to get 
                        in by promising me coke, and I 
                        pretend tonight never happened. 
                        Everybody’s happy, whaddya think?

           Elliot suddenly stops. Because his finger has landed on 
           something: a burn mark. A black swirl singed into the table. 
           Leftover from the heat of a capsule taking shape. 

                                 WILKES
                        Elliot?...

                                 ELLIOT
                        Things do a number on your 
                        furniture, don’t they?

           Elliot turns, lifts the weapon toward Wilkes’ face-- 

                                 WILKES
                        Six minutes. 
                             (off his silence)
                        Give me six minutes of your time, 
                        and I’ll show you what’s going on, 
                        and how we can undo all this.

           Robyn meets Elliot’s glance. A long, long beat...

           INT. WILKES MANSION, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Tight on a DIGITAL KEYPAD. A hand punches in numbers. Widen 
           to Wilkes, now freed from his chair, with Elliot and Robyn, 
           entering the code to some kind of panic-room-like STEEL DOOR.

                                 WILKES
                        Probably too late to get you to 
                        sign a non-disclosure, huh?
           Elliot motions with the gun -- hurry. Wilkes finishes the 
           code and there’s a THUNK of heavy electric locks tumbling out 
           of their sockets. The door opens and beyond it we reveal...

           A GLEAMING HOME LABORATORY

           ...full of state-of-the-art everything, lit by white lights. 

                                 WILKES
                        Bienvenidos.

           As Wilkes leads his gobsmacked captors in, we see this room 
           is lined with GLASS CASES -- each one containing a CAPSULE. 
           Each case is marked with a date and a prototype code. 

                                 WILKES
                        I got my first capsule a year ago. 
                        Thought I was going insane when it 
                        showed up. Those early ones didn’t 
                        even have holograms, so I can only 
                        imagine what it was like for you...

           He triggers a BULKY-LOOKING CAPSULE the size of a pear. It’s 
           screen lights up, displaying a text message:

                              IF THIS WORKS, I WILL REMEMBER

           Elliot the long row of encased capsules, watching the design 
           become sleeker, more sophisticated. An evolutionary ladder.

                                 WILKES
                        Deal is: twenty years from now, two 
                        tech firms are gonna be locked in a 
                        race to invent time-travel. In one 
                        corner, we’ve got... me. And in the 
                        other, we’ve got the five people it 
                        takes to equal me: you, Craig 
                        Bollinger, Dave Prescott, this guy 
                        Park Chang-Sun outta South Korea 
                        and Meredith Rothert from LA--

                                 ELLIOT
                             (getting it)
                        The murder-suicide at the museum...

                                 WILKES
                        Those two were gonna go through a 
                        nasty divorce in 18 years anyway. 

                                 ELLIOT
                             (shaking his head)
                        Sick fuck...

                                 WILKES
                        Hey, that’s no way to talk to a 
                        business partner. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILKES (CONT'D)
                        By the way, without you, I wouldn’t 
                        get my hands on wireless 
                        electricity until 2017, so uh... 
                        thanks.

           Wilkes, ignoring Elliot’s dark stare, continues:

                                 WILKES
                        Now, both teams are playing a zero 
                        sum game. Think about it: the only 
                        way that time-travel can be useful 
                        is if you’re the only person who 
                        knows it exists and has access to 
                        it. Or else any forward step can be 
                        undone by your rivals. “You invent 
                        the microprocessor? Fuck you, I’ll 
                        send info back and I’ll invent it.”

                                 ELLIOT
                        So you used these things to make 
                        your competitors wipe each other 
                        out in the past? Before they ever 
                        had a chance to step on your toes?
                             (off his silence)
                        Why not just send a hit-man right 
                        off the bat?

                                 WILKES
                        No sense in risking that kind of 
                        exposure when I can get you idiots 
                        to do it for me.

                                 ELLIOT
                        How are you... reading my memories?

                                 WILKES
                        It’s 2033, Elliot, we’ve got 
                        machines for that.

                                 ELLIOT
                        You’re getting my older self to 
                        talk, got “machines” for that too?

                                 WILKES
                        No. We’re just asking you really 
                        nicely.

           Wilkes smile says “We’re torturing the shit out of you.” 
           Elliot gives him a look that could freeze vodka. 

                                 ROBYN
                        So... you’re kidnapping people, 
                        making ‘em send messages to their 
                        past selves so that they’ll kill 
                        each other... in order to protect 
                        intellectual property?
                                 WILKES
                        Intellectual property? I’m talking 
                        fate-of-humanity here, sweetheart. 
                        Take a guess what happens if the 
                        wrong kind of person gets access to 
                        those capsules. Wanna fuck up New 
                        York? Send back instructions on how 
                        to make a suitcase nuke. Wanna 
                        collapse the global economy? Send 
                        back a computer virus that’ll turn 
                        the world’s financial markets into 
                        Chernobyl. I’m just scratching the 
                        surface here. Trust me, this shit 
                        is not safe for just anyone to have-

                                 ROBYN
                        But it’s safe for you to have.

                                 WILKES
                        Got a better candidate?

                                 ELLIOT
                             (cuts in)
                        Maybe someone who’s not a--

                                 WILKES
                        Shhh.
                             (motions)
                        Hear that?

           They do hear it: a WHIRRING. On the far table, a cluster of 
           particles forms a FRESH CAPSULE. Tension rising...

                                 WILKES
                             (a little smile)
                        Looks as if my future self would 
                        like a word with you.

           Cautiously, gun fixed on Wilkes, Elliot plays capsule... and 
           what they see before them takes their breath away.

           IN THE HOLOGRAM: it’s Robyn. 20 years older, bound to a chair 
           in that same room Future Elliot was in, gag stuffed into her 
           mouth, tears streaming down her terrified face...

                                 ROBYN
                        ...ohmygod...

           With little fanfare, a half-seen figure enters frame, plants 
           a HANDGUN to her temple and... BLAM! 

           We don’t see Future Robyn die; we see Present Robyn’s 
           reaction to it. Choked gasps going staccato in her throat, 
           hands clasping over her gaping mouth as--

           --Elliot WHIRLS to Wilkes, gun raised. 
                                 WILKES
                        I think my six minutes are up.

           Above them, they suddenly hear it: POUNDING SHOES. People 
           rushing through the house, coming down the stairs.

                                 WILKES
                        By the way, my security team has a 
                        six-minute response time.

           Elliot, seconds to make a decision, looks to the REAR DOOR of 
           the lab, then to Wilkes. Levels the gun at his face.

                                 WILKES
                        Too late, Elliot.

           KA-BOOM! The lab door BLOWS OPEN, shockwave blasting everyone 
           to the floor, room filling with smoke as--

           --a SECURITY TEAM, clad in Secret Service-style suits and 
           earpieces, sweeps into the lab, guns up, moving through the 
           smoke... as we reveal Wilkes, finding his feet, hands raised:

                                 WILKES
                        DON’T SHOOT! DO NOT SHOOT THE GUY 
                        THAT’S PAYING YOU! 

           And beyond him, they see it: the lab’s rear door is OPEN.

           EXT. WILKES MANSION, GARDEN - NIGHT

           BAM! A side door BANGS OPEN, Elliot and Robyn go rushing out. 
           Hauling ass through the manicured Japanese garden surrounding 
           the estate, making a break for the FAR WALL...

           ...where Robyn SCRAMBLES UP OVER IT, Elliot right beside her, 
           about to toss themselves over when--

           --they stop cold. The wall drops ten feet down to a STEEP 
           SLOPE on the other side. A near-verticle descent through 
           rocks and thorns, 100 feet down to the winding road below. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...fuck me...

           POP! POP! POP! The wall they’re standing on suddenly SPEWS 
           GOUTS OF DUST as ammo slams into it. Security thugs rushing 
           at them from the house, guns alive.

           The two clasp hands and JUMP. Legs kicking in air...

           ...and WHUMPH! They land rolling, down the ragged slope as--

           IN THE YARD

           --the gun-thug BOUNCES UP onto the wall, aims his handgun--
                                 WILKES (O.S.)
                        Hold it!

           He turns to find Wilkes approaching, mad as hell, whispering:

                                 WILKES
                        You’re opening fire outside?  Those 
                        bullets are traveling 3000 feet per 
                        second, one of them goes into that 
                        house down there, I’m gonna have a 
                        lot of fucking explaining to do.
                             (beat)
                        Inside. Now.

           CUT TO: INSIDE THE MANSION

           Wilkes storms into his living room as the sec-team regroups.

                                 SEC-TEAM LEADER
                        What’s the play? No way they’re 
                        more than a couple miles from here--

                                 WILKES
                        --play is, you stay on me wherever 
                        from now on. No more of this 
                        response-time shit. Whatever their 
                        next move is, they’re coming after 
                        me, and they’re not going to do it 
                        here. Wherever they pop their heads 
                        up again, I need those heads 
                        ventilated. Understand?

                                 SEC-TEAM LEADER
                        Yes sir.
                             (motions)
                        Your, uh, friend wants to talk.

           Wilkes looks to Craig -- still bound to his chair in the 
           living room. Wilkes goes over and yanks the gag out.

                                 WILKES
                        Hi, Craig.

                                 CRAIG
                             (out of breath)
                        I know I fucked up-- but I can help 
                        you, I know how this guy thinks--

                                 WILKES
                        Interesting, I’ll give it some 
                        thought.

           Wilkes makes a finger-gun gesture to a sec-agent, who plants 
           a couch cushion over Craig’s face, puts a gun to it. BAM! 

                                 WILKES
                        Asshole.
           Wilkes rolls Craig’s corpse aside in the chair, STORMS OFF as-

           EXT. CITY OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           Robyn DRY HEAVES. Clutching her stomach, face pale.

                                 ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        Robyn--

           She’s with Elliot, in an overgrown thicket in the hills above 
           the lights of San Francisco. He puts a hand on her--

                                 ROBYN
                             (pushes him away)
                        Sorry-- I just watched myself die--

                                 ELLIOT
                        You’re still here. Look at me.

           He takes her face in his hands.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...you’re still here.

           And as if to prove this, he leans in and kisses her. And she 
           finds herself, through her tears, kissing him back. For a 
           while. Suddenly...

           ...there’s a STIR OF WIND in the trees that billows her hair, 
           then a WHIRRR... and a capsule forms at their feet. 

                                 ROBYN
                        They-- they know where we are-- we 
                        have to go--

                                 ELLIOT
                        Wait.
                             (off her look)
                        ...what if it’s not from them?

           He grabs it. Hits play... and the hologram that pops up is in 
           a different room than the ones we’ve seen before.

           A BARE BONES MOTEL ROOM, the dime-thin TV on the wall the 
           only indication that this is being recorded in 2033. Front 
           and center, adjusting the recording device, is FUTURE ELLIOT.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT (THROUGH HOLOGRAM)
                        First time I’ve gotten to speak to 
                        you off-script. Better late than 
                        never. 
                             (glances to the window)
                        I don’t have long, I have to stay 
                        moving. But I need you to see this.
           Future Elliot is sweat-soaked, his left arm wrapped in a 
           bloody towel from where he tore out his lock-pick kit. A mile 
           away from the calm, robotic version we’d seen in the past.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        As of right now, Wilkes is days 
                        away -- maybe less -- from turning 
                        the capsule into a weapon. I’m 
                        attaching a video file--

           The footage BLIPS, and we take in the 3-D holographic 
           tableau. We’re watching hologram video from the future.

           IN THE HOLOGRAM

           Test-footage from inside Wilkes’ lab in 2033, where there’s a 
           PLEXIGLASS BOX the size of an elevator. The walls splotched 
           with burn marks. There’s a YOUNG GREASY FELLA IN A PRISONER’S 
           JUMPSUIT inside the box, trembling in the fetal position.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        ...1100 hours, December 3rd 2033, 
                        capsule 2.0, case designate 8-A...

           A lab-coated figure passes frame with a pair of LAB TECHS at 
           his side, talking into a futuristic digital recorder headset. 

           Present Elliot’s face goes wan as he realizes... the figure 
           is JONATHAN WILKES -- 20 years older, still undeniably him.

                                 FUTURE WILKES
                        ...commencing capsule delivery.

           He places a NEWFANGLED CAPSULE (bigger, sleeker, with a 
           progress bar screen) into a MICROWAVE-LIKE “delivery” device, 
           punches in numbers, we hear a RISING DRONE...

           ...then something odd happens: the capsule vanishes from the 
           delivery device. A moment later, in the plexiglass cell, it 
           starts to re-appear: gathering matter into a swirl...

           But this one’s different. We can tell as the prisoner LUNGES 
           UP, BEATS against the walls, screaming soundlessly. The 
           capsule coalesces, its progress bar lighting up...

                                 LAB TECH
                        Five, four, three, two...

           A SILENT EXPLOSION goes off inside the plexiglass box. 
           Filling the thing with fire like a bucket filled from a 
           flood. INCINERATING the screaming man inside it, before--

           --the flames SELF-EXTINGUISH in a heartbeat. And aside from 
           the burn marks on the glass and the charred human remains on 
           the floor, there’s no sign that the capsule was ever there.
           Elliot covers his mouth in horror. Robyn’s turned away, 
           unable to watch. The hologram BLIPS, and we’re back to...

           FUTURE ELLIOT

           ...hunching into the lens in that shabby motel room.

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        What you saw is just the beginning. 
                        Right now, that prototype can only 
                        travel through limited space, but 
                        once Wilkes is done, it’ll be able 
                        to travel through--

           Future Elliot hears something, stops cold. WHIRLS TO THE 
           LEFT. Panicking, he SNATCHES UP the recording device, and for 
           a moment, we’re SWINGING SIDEWAYS through the motel--

                                 FUTURE ELLIOT
                        --shit, oh God, shit--

           --there’s a CRACK and a BANG BANG BANG of gunfire as the 
           world goes HAYWIRE, then CLICK! End of transmission. 

           ELLIOT AND ROBYN

           ...sit there, frozen. A long beat, before Robyn asks:

                                 ROBYN
                        Did you just...

           Elliot remains silent. Processing what he’s seen. Then... 

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...does it matter?
                             (off her look)
                        I might be alive in twenty years, I 
                        might be dead. Doesn’t matter. 
                        What matters now is what we know: 
                        Wilkes is about to start using 
                        those capsules to kill people. You 
                        heard what I said, “it can only 
                        travel through space right now”--

                                 ROBYN
                        --but he’s on the verge of being 
                        able to send it through time.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Which means he’ll be able to erase 
                        people from existence whenever he 
                        wants. Like a drone strike you can 
                        send through time. Power of life 
                        and death at the push of a button.
                                 ROBYN
                             (beat)
                        ...this is bigger than you and me.

           Robyn looks at him. His voice lowers as it registers in him:

                                 ELLIOT
                        We gotta make sure those goddamn 
                        things never get invented. 

                                 ROBYN
                        ...how?

           Elliot toys with the capsule in his hand.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Wilkes thinks he’s the only person 
                        who should have control of these 
                        things. Thinks he’s infallible.  
                        Anything his future self tells him 
                        to do, he’s gonna do...
                             (beat)
                        Let’s use that against the son of a 
                        bitch.

           EXT. TRINITY CORP BUILDING - MORNING

           As PERCUSSION BUILDS, we soar over San Francisco, over the 
           streaming double-decker traffic of the Bay Bridge, finally 
           landing amidst the office parks of the south end...

                                 ELLIOT (V.O)
                        If we’re gonna do this, it’s gonna 
                        mean destroying his research, his 
                        prototypes, anything that could 
                        lead to the capsule’s invention. 

                                 ROBYN (V.O.)
                        So we have to get into his lab.

           ...and there it is: the TRINITY CORP CENTER, a five-story 
           glass-and-marble megalith. From a distant parking garage, 
           Elliot and Robyn spy through binoculars. As he pans along...

                                 ELLIOT 
                        ...this ain’t good...

                                 ROBYN
                        What?

           Through the binoculars: she sees the building has ARMED SEC-
           AGENTS secreted away in positions all around it. The same 
           private security goons we saw at Wilkes’ mansion.  

                                 ROBYN
                        Jesus, that’s... four, five, six--
                                 ELLLIOT
                        --eight total. Maybe more inside.

           Elliot scrawls words into his notepad, marking each area 
           patrolled by a guard. This place is a fucking fortress.

                                 ELLIOT
                             (shuts his journal)
                        Time to go see an old friend.

           INT. HAROLD’S HOUSE - DAY

           As his GRANDKIDS play in the pool of his nice new house, 
           Harold The (Former) Janitor opens drawers in his room, hands 
           something over to Elliot: a janitor uniform and a swipe-key.

                                 HAROLD
                        Go through the service entrance. 
                        Second you put that uniform on, no 
                        one sees you -- trust me, I worked 
                        there 30 years and you were the 
                        only one who ever looked twice. Now 
                        remember, same as always--

                                 ELLIOT
                        You didn’t let me in.

                                 HAROLD
                             (slaps him on the back)
                        Give ‘em hell.

           INT. ALTRIA BUILDING - DAY

           David Prescott -- out of the hospital, leg in a cast, bangs 
           away at his laptop in his office. His door opens, a UNIFORMED 
           JANITOR pushing a cart comes in--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Hey hey, hold it, I didn’t call for-

           WHAM! His laptop SLAMS SHUT ON HIS HANDS. He lets out a YELP 
           as we reveal the guy in the janitor’s uniform is Elliot. 
           Robyn locks the door behind them, shuts the blinds, stays on 
           lookout. Prescott sputters, hands trapped-- 

                                 ELLIOT
                        I’m tired of having conversations 
                        with people who’ve tried to kill 
                        me, so I’ll make this quick. You 
                        got an emergency stash with $50,000 
                        and a passport. I want the key.

                                 PRESCOTT
                             (in pain)
                        --in my jacket-- little gold one--
           Robyn snatches a key-ring from his pocket, slides one off.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Where do I go?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Sutter St Post Office, box 2901.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Thank you.

           Elliot sets Prescott’s hands free -- Prescott REELS BACK in 
           his chair. As they make to go--

                                 PRESCOTT
                        So this is your plan? Rip me off 
                        and skip town? How far you think 
                        you’re gonna make it on $50,000, 
                        dipshit?

                                 ELLIOT
                        I don’t know... but it’ll sure buy 
                        a whole lotta kitchen supplies.

           And as they exit, we CLOSE IN TIGHT on the pen in Elliot’s 
           hand: it’s the pen from Maguire’s car. It’s logo on it: 
           KITCHEN SOLUTIONS, INC. And beneath that, an EMAIL ADDRESS. 

           INT. TRINITY BUILDING, WILKES’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           WHIRRRRT! A capsule materializes on a burn-proof PLATE on 
           Wilkes’ desk. Wilkes grabs it (with tongs; ain’t his first 
           rodeo), clicks play. His FUTURE SELF appears via hologram: 

                                 FUTURE WILKES
                        Just got fresh intel off Prescott’s 
                        memory-scan. Elliot paid a visit to 
                        him at the office today, he’s going 
                        for Prescott’s emergency stash at 
                        the Sutter Street Post Office...

           EXT. POST OFFICE - NIGHT

           We follow Wilkes’ sec-team -- 6 of them, moving fast -- into 
           the post office -- an old, opulent two-story affair downtown.

                                 FUTURE WILKES (V.O.)
                        I want all hands on deck there, 
                        now.

           They slipstream past the line of people waiting, the bony-
           faced SEC-TEAM LEADER adjusting his thick black glasses...
           INT. TRINITY BUILDING, WILKES’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           ...we see the same image -- now blurry, grainy and digitally 
           stabilized -- on Wilkes’ security monitor. He’s hunched in 
           his office, flanked by two sec-team guards, watching as...

           INSIDE THE POST OFFICE

           ...down the rows of mailboxes they go, reaching the LAST 
           HALLWAY... where they spot their target: Elliot, his back to 
           us, clad in a hat and dark jacket, keying open a mailbox.

                                 SEC TEAM LEADER
                             (into earpiece)
                        Bingo.

                                 WILKINS (THROUGH EARPIECE)
                        Bag him.

           They move in, surrounding him, leader puts a gun to his back.

                                 SEC-TEAM LEADER
                        Hands on the wall.

           The guy doesn’t move. Because, as we reveal, the guy isn’t 
           Elliot -- it’s MAGUIRE, here to retrieve his latest 50 grand 
           and passport. Maguire doesn’t like having a gun held to him.

                                 MAGUIRE
                             (quiet, calm)
                        I dunno who you are, but I’d get 
                        that piece the fuck off me.

                                 SEC-TEAM LEADER
                             (cocks the gun)
                        I said put your hands on the---

           All at once: Maguire SPINS, grabs the guy’s gun-hand, 
           WRENCHES the weapon out of it, shoots him under his chin--

           IN WILKES’ OFFICE

           Wilkes gapes at the monitor, realizing--

                                 WILKES
                        STAND DOWN, IT’S NOT HIM--

           IN THE POST OFFICE

           Too late. Maguire uses the sec-team leader’s body as a human 
           shield as he DOUBLE-FISTS HANDGUNS--

           --mowing down the rest of the team before anyone can even get 
           a bead on him. WHUMPH! Maguire drops the body, pockets his 
           guns, and storms toward the exit, stepping over corpses...
           BANG! Maguire suddenly stiffens. Touches his chest. Fingers 
           come up bloody. Turns around to see one of the team isn’t 
           quite dead yet... and has a smoking side-arm aimed at him.

                                 MAGUIRE
                        You just shoot me in the back? 
                             (wavers)
                        Jesus, that’s how I gotta go?

           BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG! The sec-agent unloads into 
           Maguire’s chest, stomach, neck. Knocks him against the wall, 
           sliding to the floor, leaving a smear of blood. Whispers:

                                 MAGUIRE
                        ...that’s better.

           BLAM! Maguire shoots the guy in the face and we SMASH TO:

           INT. TRINITY BUILDING, WILKES’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           Wilkes turns away from the CCTV monitors in dismay. One of 
           his two remaining sec-team agents speaks up:

                                 SEC-TEAM AGENT
                        ...if Lockhart’s not there, then...

           Wilkes seems to have a pretty good idea where Elliot is...

           EXT. TRINITY BUILDING - NIGHT

           We PUSH IN toward one of the building’s side doors... ajar,  
           TORQUE WRENCHES stuck into its lock. We WHOOSH AHEAD...

           INTO THE BUILDING, THROUGH WALLS, DOWN A LEVEL

           ...into the UTILITY ROOM: lined with catwalks, generators 
           THRUMMING. There’s Robyn, sweat-slick fingers unzipping her 
           duffel bag to reveal A MASS OF CAPSULES. Every one Elliot’s 
           had stored up. Now all connected to each other with wiring. 

                                 ROBYN (INTO HER BLUETOOTH)
                        Christ, Elliot, this better work...

           We go WHOOSHING THROUGH THE WALL and UP TWO LEVELS, to...

           A LONG CORRIDOR leading toward a sealed-off laboratory marked 
           LAB A. Elliot’s moving through with his own heavy duffel.

                                 ELLIOT (INTO EARPIECE)
                        It’ll work. Once you hit “play”, 
                        I’ll have a thirty-second window to 
                        brute-force open the lab door. 
                        That’s when you get the hell out.

           BACK IN THE UTILITY ROOM
           Robyn hauls up her makeshift rope of capsules, takes a deep 
           breath... and hits “play.” Which sends a series of ELECTRICAL 
           CLICKS down the wire. Each capsule turns on at the same time.

           And that’s when shit gets interesting. 

           INSIDE WILKES’ OFFICE

           Wilkes looks up to see the lights above FLICKERING. Hears the 
           drone of the building’s power struggling to stay on. And 
           through his window, he can see EVERY LIGHT IN THE BUILDING 
           SHORTING OUT IN A WAVE. And right then... he smiles.

                                 WILKES
                        They’re in the utility room. 
                             (motions)
                        Gimme a flashlight--

           WHRRRRRRMMM! The power goes completely out, as we SMASH TO:

           ELLIOT

           ...making a run down the darkened hallway, headlamp bouncing 
           in the blackness. Straight for the sliding metal door of LAB 
           A. Glances at his watch -- 25 seconds to go. 

           Elliot hauls out a CROW BAR and a PNEUMATIC CAR JACK from his 
           duffel bag. Jams the bar into the doorjamb. Strains. Metal 
           CREAKS. The door slides open on its track a few inches.

           On his watch: 15 seconds to go.

           WHAM! Elliot jams the car jack int the space. Starts working 
           the jack -- forcing the door open inch by inch...

                                 ELLIOT
                        C’mon, c’mon, c’mon...

           And just as he makes a gap wide enough for him to fit his 
           body through... the lights above him blink spasmodically, and 
           there’s the HUM OF THE BACKUP GENERATOR KICKING IN.

                                 ELLIOT
                        No--

           Elliot LUNGES through the door, just as the power kicks back 
           on in full -- causing the electronically-sealed door to SLAM 
           SHUT, almost taking his feet off, CRUMPLING the jack.

           INSIDE THE LAB

           Overhead lights turn on, illuminating the white sterile 
           space. Similar to Wilkes’ home lab, but three times the size.

                                 ELLIOT
                        ...alright...
           Elliot reaches into his bag and hauls out a pair of ten-
           gallon GASOLINE CANS. Gets to work. Splashes computers. Dumps 
           it into filing cabinets. Douses racks of HARD DRIVES. Making 
           sure that nothing in this lab will survive as we CUT TO:

           THE LOWER HALLWAY

           Robyn makes her escape from the utility room, out the door...

           ...and BAM! Takes a blow to the face that pulverizes her lips 
           and knocks her to the floor, back-first. Looks up to see 
           Wilkes, flanked by his two sec-agents, standing over her.

                                 WILKES
                        Where’s Elliot?

           WHAP! Something SLASHES across Wilkes’ face, cutting his 
           cheek -- in her hand, the chain of capsules now drips blood 
           from being used as a whip. Wilkes, seething, lifts a handgun:

                                 WILKES
                        One more time. Where. The Fuck. Is--

           An ALARM GOES OFF. A Siri-esque electronic voice announces: 

                                 ELECTRONIC VOICE
                        Sprinkler-system in Lab A has been 
                        disabled. Sprinkler-system in Lab A 
                        has been disabled.

           Robyn’s face falls. Wilkes smiles.

                                 WILKES
                        C’mere, sweetheart--

           And as he HAULS HER UP, we SMASH TO:

           INSIDE LAB A

           ...where Elliot breaks open locked metal drawers with his 
           crowbar, dumping gasoline in. COUGHING from the fumes, he 
           surveys the room; seemingly every object in it drips petrol. 

           WHAM! Elliot slams his hand against the “exit” button, the 
           door slides open. Walks through, takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER. 
           All he’s gotta do is light the flame, toss it in, and shut 
           the door. He clicks it open, fingers the strike-wheel, when--

                                 WILKES (O.S.)
                        Red light, Elliot.

           Elliot freezes. Turns to see Wilkes approaching -- his sec-
           agents holding a gun to Robyn’s head. Elliot thinks fast... 
           puts his hands up, and takes a step back into the lab, 
           letting them follow him. And just as they cross past the door-
                                 WILKES
                             (sniffs)
                        Is that-- gaso--

           WHAM! Elliot slams a hand onto the entry button, SHUTTING THE 
           DOOR BEHIND THEM. They’re all trapped in here now.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Yeah. Whole lab’s covered in it. I 
                        recommend not firing any guns.

           Wilkes ponders that a moment... then motions to his team: 
           drop the guns. They do. And then Wilkes starts applauding.

                                 WILKES
                        So that’s the plan, you’re gonna 
                        burn this whole place up and take 
                        me with it?

                                 ELLIOT
                        Let her go and we’ll figure out an 
                        alternative.

                                 WILKES
                        Right. Give up the one piece of 
                        leverage I have over the guy with a 
                        well-known death-wish. Superb idea--

           WHAM! He shoves Robyn down, snatches a pair of handcuffs from 
           one of his sec-agents, CUFFS HER TO A WALL-PIPE. 

                                 ROBYN
                        --sonofabtich--

                                 ELLIOT
                             (aiming the lighter)
                        Get ‘em off her, now--

                                 WILKES
                        You mean with this?

           Wilkes lifts the sec-agent’s handcuff key... and tosses it 
           down the drain of a lab-sink. Elliot’s jaw tightens and his 
           guts churn -- looking from Robyn, to Wilkes and his armed 
           goons, to the limp dick of a Zippo lighter in his hand...

                                 WILKES
                        Let’s get down to brass tacks. You 
                        flick that Bic, she dies with us. 
                        You set it down and surrender, 
                        we’ll see how generous I’m feeling.

                                 ELLIOT
                        You’ll kill us both.
                                 WILKES
                        Might, might not. But I do know 
                        this for sure...

           Wilkes is pacing the room now, not unlike he was doing 
           onstage at the tech conference.

                                 WILKES
                        It’s gonna take real courage of 
                        conviction for you to light that. 
                        You’re gonna have to believe, in 
                        your heart, that you’re doing the 
                        right thing. And let’s face it, 
                        pal, that’s not your style. You 
                        don’t have that kind of faith in 
                        yourself. You never have.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Could be worse. I could be the evil 
                        motherfucker who thinks he’s Jesus.

           Wilkes sighs, turns away, puts his hands on a lab table.

                                 WILKES
                        At least I deliver, Elliot. Some 
                        people get up to the plate and hit 
                        a home run. Other people?...

           Wilkes’ fingers curl around a HARD DRIVE on the table...

                                 WILKES
                        ...other people choke.

           WHIR-CRASH! Wilkes SPINS and LUNCHES THE HARD DRIVE, sending 
           it careening off Elliot’s skull. Elliot stumbles away, 
           bleeding, clutching his head as--

                                 ROBYN
                        Elliot--

           Wilkes’ sec-agents are on him in a heartbeat, grabbing him--

                                 WILKES
                        Bring him here--

           --dragging him across the lab over to Wilkes, who uses him as 
           a HUMAN PUNCHING-BAG. Uppercuts to his gut, shots to his 
           face, kicks to his stomach. The air BARFS out of Elliot, his 
           nose leaks crimson, his teeth turn red, Robyn SCREAMS--

           --as BAM! Elliot’s knocked across a table, shattering glass 
           lab-ware, hitting the floor a bloody mess.

                                 WILKES
                        No firing guns in here, huh? Let’s 
                        see what else we got on deck...
           CLICK! He cuffs Elliot to the same pipe Robyn’s cuffed to. 
           Then grabs a box of HARD DRIVES out of a cabinet, and as 
           Wilkes and the sec-agents make for the exit...

                                 WILKES
                        That new capsule we’re developing 
                        in 2033? Kind that goes boom? 
                        Prototype’s finished.
                             (smirks)
                        Which means that we are now in the 
                        “testing” phase. Do me a favor and 
                        stay put, it’s on its way. 

           Horrified realization dawns upon Elliot and Robyn...

                                 ELLIOT
                        You burn the lab, you lose your 
                        research--

                                 WILKES
                             (lifts hard drive)
                        All right here. Only thing getting 
                        burned is a documented head-case 
                        who was trying to torch my lab.

           Wilkes hits the entry-seal button, the door opens, and out he 
           steps. But before he can seal them in, he hears Elliot’s 
           voice... and there’s something unnerving about it.

                                 ELLIOT
                        Shouldn’t walk away from the pot 
                        when you leave a lobster to boil. 

                                 WILKES
                        ...what?

           Elliot’s focused on a PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS on the floor 
           nearby. Eyes twinkling with an idea. 

                                 ELLIOT
                        Ask the last guy you sent to kill 
                        me. He’ll explain it you.

                                 WILKES
                        Yeah, well... something tells me 
                        you’re gonna see him before I will. 

           There’s a faint WHIRRING sound from across the lab. Papers 
           starting to rustle on tables, as if from a breeze. 

                                 WILKES
                        Uh oh. Here comes the future. See 
                        ya, Elliot. 

           WHAM! Wilkes slams the button, the doors shut, leaving our 
           heroes trapped behind metal and glass in the lab, about to 
           get burned alive. Wilkes walks on with his sec-team as...
           INSIDE THE LAB

           ...the WHIRRING NOISE RISES, and particles start to collect 
           atop a table ten feet away... 

                                 ROBYN
                        ...oh my god--
                             (beat)
                        What are you doing?

           What Elliot’s doing: using that piece of broken glass with 
           his free hand, he’s cutting open the stitches in his arm. 
           Blood blooms from his wound...

           ...as Elliot plucks a LOCK-PICK ROD, and it becomes clear: he 
           has to get himself free in time.

           ON THE LAB TABLE: particles take on the shape of a capsule.

           ELLIOT’S BLOODY HAND: forces the picks into his handcuffs. 

           ON THE LAB TABLE: smoke rises from the metal surface as the 
           CAPSULE 2.0 comes scorching into reality. Its screen lights 
           up with a RED PROGRESS BAR, five seconds from filling...

           ELLIOT’S HANDCUFF SNAPS OPEN...

           ...and we RAMP DOWN TO SLOW MOTION.

           Elliot rises and SPRINTS for the capsule, SNATCHING it off 
           the table, singing his flesh as--

           IN THE HALLWAY BEYOND THE LAB

           --still in that dreamy slo-mo, the lab door WHOOSHES OPEN 
           behind Wilkes. Revealing Elliot, rushing forward. Wilkes 
           turns... and Elliot throws the capsule like a fastball. 

           We track the capsule as arcs out into the hallway. Suspended 
           in soundless air. Wilkes barely has time to get out a--

                                 WILKES
                        Fuckin’ Radius...

           KA-BOOOOOM! The weaponized capsule SPLITS OPEN in mid-air and 
           FILLS THE ROOM WITH FIRE, incinerating Wilkes and his guards.

           WHAM! Elliot hits the “entry seal” button, the door slams 
           shut, protecting the lab from in the incoming ball of 
           flame... except there’s one problem: the windows don’t hold.

           CRASH-BOOM! The fireball BLOWS OUT the glass in the lab’s 
           door, Elliot dives for cover as it snakes out over his head, 
           setting the gasoline-soaked lab ablaze as--

           ROBYN
           --KICKS at the pipe as the lake of fire spreads towards her. 
           The cuff makes her bleed. Flames and smoke rise around her...

                                 ELLIOT (O.S.)
                        ROBYN!

           There he is: Elliot, coming across the lab through the fire, 
           shielding his face, hefting up a sec-agent’s dropped handgun.

                                 ELLIOT
                        DOWN!

           She ducks. He SHOOTS, bullets chewing through the pipe, WATER 
           SPEWING OUT. She slides her cuff up the pipe to the break 
           point, slips it free, as Elliot LUNGES to drag her out-- 

           --and they rush for the exit, Elliot SLAMMING the entry-
           button, door opening, escaping the inferno. And from his 
           hand, Elliot tosses something away...

           A capsule.

           Just as we saw in the beginning, it rolls across the floor...

           IN THE LAB HALLWAY

           ...Wilkes lays dead as his life’s work burns. Intercut this 
           with the capsule rolling away, disintegrating into PARTICLES.

           INT. WILKE’S HOME LAB - NIGHT

           We travel down the rows of PROTOTYPE CAPSULES we saw in 
           Wilkes’ home lab. One by one, in glorious slo-mo, they COME 
           UNRAVELED, bursting into sprays of dark matter...

           BACK INSIDE THE BURNING LAB

           ...Elliot’s last capsule tumbles onward, becoming dust, and 
           then nothing. 

           As if it were never there at all.

           CUT TO BLACK.

           In the darkness, we hear:

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        You said you remember what I 
                        remember, so I hope this finds you.

           FADE IN ON: Elliot’s journal. His hand scrawling into it. Pan 
           up to him -- wounds now bandaged, but eyes still haunted. 

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        For all I know, you could be dead 
                        right now.
           CUT TO: Elliot and Robyn, driving into the night. Putting the 
           smoke clouds of the burning lab in their rear view mirror.

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        I want to know more, but I can’t. 
                        Time doesn’t work that way. It’s 
                        not supposed to tip its hand. But I 
                        have to believe, in my heart, that 
                        you made it.

           Elliot’s hand finds hers. They clasp tight.

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        I have to believe we’ll make it...

           CUT TO: Wilkes lays dead in the burning lab.

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        ...even though I’ve seen what 
                        happens when you believe 
                        unquestioningly. 

           CUT TO: the lab is sprayed down by fire hoses. Flames 
           extinguishing. We travel through this wasteland of half-
           melted hard-drives and scorched computers...

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        I know that progress is 
                        unstoppable, and that someday, 
                        someone else might invent what we 
                        already did. We’ll have to cross 
                        that bridge when we come to it. You 
                        can’t author the future. You can 
                        only prepare for it...

           CUT TO: an envelope opening to reveal a dividends report. For 
           Khungun Beton, the Mongolian energy stock Future Elliot 
           advised our hero to invest in. Elliot and Robyn stare at the 
           report in awe. We don’t see the figure, but it’s a lot.

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        ...and hope it’s got good things in 
                        store for you.

           CUT TO: WATER, crystalline blue, rushing beneath us...

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        There’s a place I always talked 
                        about going one day. Years from 
                        now. You know the one.

           We PAN UP to find ourselves flying towards a SAILBOAT.

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        I think I’m just gonna go today.
           Elliot follows Robyn to the edge of the boat, leans in to 
           kiss her... but she drops off backwards into the water. 

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        I’ll see you in two decades. Every 
                        time I look in the mirror. Until 
                        then... 

           Elliot smiles, dives in after. Leaving us alone on the deck.

                                 ELLIOT (V.O.)
                        ...enjoy the memories.

           We pull back, over the table... and we hear a FAMILIAR  
           WHIRRING NOISE. Could be a plane. Could be something else 
           entirely. A BREEZE rustles maps. The whirring gets louder... 

           AND WE SNAP TO BLACK.
