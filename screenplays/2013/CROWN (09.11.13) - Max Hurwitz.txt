                             In November 2008, the FBI detected a new computer virus called “Conficker.”
                                    Within three months, it grew into the largest virus ever recorded.

                                                        No one knows who designed it.
                                                          No one knows what it does.

                                                 And only one man is capable of stopping it.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           The back of a teenager’s head, bobbing to some unheard beat.  
           He has a given name, but for now call him NIGHTWATCH.

           He sits at a community table, laptop open in front of him.  
           All around him, we see a DOZEN CUSTOMERS reading and working.  
           Idle chatter and beeping cash registers.  We could be at any 
           coffee shop in any suburb in the country.

           After a moment, he reaches for his laptop and PULLS a THUMB 
           DRIVE from the side.  He drops it in a CARDBOARD BOX on his 
           left, and then grabs ANOTHER THUMB DRIVE from a box on his 
           right.  There are HUNDREDS of identical drives in each one.

           He begins to type, and VOICEOVER BEGINS -- rapid-fire and 
           impatient, like someone begrudgingly giving a tutorial.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        This is how you black out a city.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           A CARDBOARD BOX full of THUMB DRIVES rocks in the passenger 
           seat as street lights wash over them.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        The first step is learning how the 
                        system works.  How everything 
                        connects.  Why everything matters.  
                        That’s the first step no matter 
                        what you’re trying to do.

           The car pulls to a stop.  Nightwatch grabs the box.

           EXT. POWER PLANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           We follow the box under Nightwatch’s arm as he reaches inside 
           and drops THUMB DRIVES on the ground.  He wanders the lot, 
           scattering them like bird seed.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Then you need to find an exploit, a 
                        hole.  If you think there isn’t one 
                        that just means you gave up too 
                        easily or you’re an idiot.  In this 
                        case the hole is a privilege 
                        escalation vulnerability in a 
                        keyboard layout file.

           One particular DRIVE lands on the ground.  We hold as we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. POWER PLANT - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The same shot during the day.  A COROLLA pulls up next to the 
           thumb drive and parks.  A LOAFER swings out of the car and 
           lands next to the drive.

           A HAND reaches into frame to pick it up, and we follow the 
           hand until we see the face of the WORKER who found it.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Simple is better.  Spend enough 
                        hours looking and you might find a 
                        back door into the internal network 
                        of the System Operations Center, 
                        but it’s easier to save your 
                        malware on USB drives and scatter 
                        them around the parking lot.

           The Worker contemplates the drive.  Looks brand new.

           INT. POWER PLANT - OFFICE - DAY

           The Worker pops the THUMB DRIVE into the DELL TOWER under his 
           cluttered desk and waits.  After a moment, a WINDOW pops up 
           on his screen.  Empty -- no files.

           The Worker clicks the empty window, confused.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Eventually some poor sap who works 
                        in the building will be curious 
                        enough and dumb enough to plug one 
                        of your drives into a machine 
                        connected to their network.  Just 
                        to check it out, just for a second.  
                        But that’s all it takes.

           CLOSE ON the computer’s ACTIVITY LIGHT -- it blinks 
           frantically, stopping just before the Worker PULLS the drive 
           from the computer.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Internal networks usually have piss-
                        poor security, because lazy admins 
                        think being cut off from the 
                        outside world makes them safe.

           We stay on the computer, moving around to the back of the 
           tower and following the ETHERNET CABLE into the wall --

           INT. POWER PLANT - VARIOUS - DAY

           We FLY through the cabling in the walls, twisting through the 
           building.  We snake through rooms, watching PEOPLE WORK IN 
           CUBICLES and GENERATORS SPINNING IN A MACHINE ROOM --
                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        So your bug just spreads and 
                        spreads --

           INT. POWER PLANT - SYSTEM OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

           We fly through the power plant’s mission control.  A 70’ by 
           16’ screen on one wall that displays the entire electrical 
           network.  A dozen TECHNICIANS monitor the activity.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        -- and spreads and spreads --

           We squeeze through another ETHERNET PORT into a --

           INT. POWER PLANT - SERVER ROOM - DAY

           -- room with a half-dozen GRAY SERVER RACKS, activity lights 
           blinking.  Managing the equipment and offices we just saw.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        -- until you’re in the main server.  
                        That’s the gold mine, the holy 
                        grail, the other clichés.  You root 
                        the admin account and you have an 
                        all-access pass to do whatever you 
                        want.  Direct connection.

           We suddenly SHOOT DOWN through the floor --

           INT. UNDERGROUND - DAY

           -- and ZOOM along an UNDERGROUND CABLE, rapidly turning as 
           the thick wires split and change direction --

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           -- and emerge in the same coffee shop as before.  Nightwatch 
           sits in the same seat, but the nighttime crowd is thinner.

           ON THE SCREEN: Connection established

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        So the question is, what do you 
                        want to do first?

           Nightwatch’s FINGERS hover over the keyboard for a moment.  
           In a window behind his main console, we see a CHAT ROOM of 
           sorts.  And if we're quick, we can make out several names:

           Crown, Marchee, Profs, Teknine, and finally Nightwatch.

           The hacker takes a deep breath, then types a rapid-fire 
           command and hits ENTER --
           INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

           We ZOOM back along the UNDERGROUND CABLE, twisting and 
           turning --

           INT. POWER PLANT - SERVER ROOM - NIGHT

           -- and pop back up in the server room.  We float past 
           BLINKING ACTIVITY LIGHTS and then dive into the wall, moving 
           through CABLING --

           INT. POWER PLANT - CUBICLE FARM - NIGHT

           We float through the empty cubicles.  Everything packed up 
           and turned off for the night.

           Then: one COMPUTER TURNS ON.  Then ANOTHER.  Then EVERY 
           COMPUTER, one by one, bathing the darkened office in a sickly 
           blue glow.

           A PRINTER FIRES UP, spitting paper.  We see one page:

           HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

           Over and over in giant letters.  Down through the floor --

           INT. POWER PLANT - LOBBY - NIGHT

           The SLIDING DOORS OPEN.  The SECURITY GUARD looks up from 
           behind his desk, confused.  He cautiously stands, putting his 
           hand on the TASER on his belt.  The doors CLOSE, and then 
           OPEN again.

           The Guard reaches for his phone, but it’s DEAD.  Behind him, 
           LIGHTS SHUT OFF, one by one.  The Guard begins 
           hyperventilating.  We DROP through the floor --

           INT. POWER PLANT - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The temperature on the THERMOSTAT clicks up to 120 and STEAM 
           SHOOTS from a pipe --

           INT. POWER PLANT - SYSTEM OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

           The GIANT SCREEN flickers off, piece by piece.  The NIGHT 
           SHIFT reacts in surprise as each technician’s station flashes 
           to the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH --

           INT. POWER PLANT - GENERATOR ROOM - NIGHT

           We fly past the MASSIVE GENERATORS and settle on a GRAY BOX 
           attached to the wall.  Plastic with a locked latch, like a 
           shoebox-sized locker with cables running out the top and 
           bottom.

           We hold on the box for a beat.  Two beats.  Then:
           A PUFF OF SMOKE escapes from the latch.  Barely noticeable.  
           But the HUM of the generators changes pitch...

           EXT. POWER PLANT - NIGHT

           Bird’s-eye view of the power plant.  Suddenly, all the lights 
           around it FLICKER OFF.  Then the lights of the WHOLE BLOCK.  
           Then the NEIGHBORHOOD.

           As we widen out, more sections of the power grid go down, one-
           by-one like dominoes, until...

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

           All the lights go out.  The patrons GASP and MURMUR for a 
           moment, then begin to pack up their things.

           A slight grin breaks out on Nightwatch’s face, still 
           illuminated from the screen of his battery-powered laptop.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Okay.  You did it.  You think 
                        you’re in control.  Anonymous.  
                        Untraceable.  Invincible.

           Nightwatch shuts his LAPTOP --

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        But there’s a mistake you’re 
                        making.  The same one I made.

           He pulls the POWER CORD from the socket and stuffs everything 
           in his bag --

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        The problem is you’re not really 
                        connected to a network of 
                        computers.  You’re connected to a 
                        network of people.

           EXT. SATELLITE VIEW - NIGHT

           Far enough away to see that the blackout is centered on a 
           suburban portion of the Eastern seaboard.  It’s not a 
           particularly well-known area, but those familiar will see 
           it’s Fort Meade, Maryland.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        And they’re never exactly who you 
                        think they are.

           Emergency generators kick in and an ENORMOUS COMPLEX in the 
           center LIGHTS UP.  A beacon in the surrounding dark.

                                                        SMASH TO TITLE:

                                          CROWN_
           The title STUTTER-FLASHES OUT, giving way to a BLINKING 
           CURSOR.

           BLINK.  BLINK.  Then, a number appears:

                                2001:db8:0:1339:0:667:4:1_

           The cursor blinks at the end of the line.  BLINK.  BLINK.  A 
           command is typed:

                             /whois 2001:db8:0:1339:0:667:4:1_

           A bunch of data spits out, ending with:

                                  1576 Ringe Drive
                                  Odenton, Maryland 21113_

           Blink.  Blink.  Blink.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Establishing.  Unremarkable house on Ringe Drive.  An 
           UNMARKED BLACK CAR pulls up in front of the house, followed 
           by a few ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT cruisers.

           INT./EXT. UNMARKED BLACK CAR - NIGHT

           In the driver's seat is RICK CHAN.  Mid-twenties, tailored 
           suit.  Tightly wound, intelligent, with a smug air of 
           superiority.

           In the passenger seat is MARY DUBLONSKI (50s), eating a 
           POWDERED SUGAR DONUT.  She comes off as laughably casual, but 
           there’s a reason she’s running the FBI Cybercrime division.

           Rick puts the car in park.  POLICE OFFICERS get out of their 
           cruisers and quietly set up a perimeter.  Dublonski looks at 
           the darkened house.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Never ceases to amaze me how 
                        unimpressive their lives are up 
                        close.

                                 RICK
                        I find the whole of Maryland fairly 
                        unimpressive.

           Dublonski dusts off powdered sugar, gets out of the car.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dublonski walks across the yard to the house as she puts an 
           EARPIECE RADIO in her ear.  Rick catches up as they tromp 
           over the grass.
                                 DUBLONSKI
                        How is there an entire floor of 
                        tech guys back in New York who 
                        can't decrypt one teenager's hard 
                        drive?

                                 RICK
                        Technology's advanced a bit since 
                        WarGames was in theaters.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        That was when you were what, five?

                                 RICK
                        Wasn't even born yet.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Jesus.

           Dublonski and Rick reach the door.  They're joined by a 
           UNIFORMED OFFICER.  More officers sneak around back.  Rick 
           opens his jacket and puts his hand on his PISTOL.

           Dublonski clocks it --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        He's a nineteen year-old geek who 
                        lives with his mom.

           Rick shrugs and leaves his hand in place.  Dublonski KNOCKS 
           on the door.

           After a moment, it opens a crack.  Chain's still bolted.  MS. 
           GARRETT (40s) is on the other side.  Stringy hair, paranoid.

                                 MS. GARRETT
                        Who are you?

           Dublonski holds up her FBI ID CARD --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Sorry to bother you so late, ma'am.  
                        I'm Special Agent Mary Dublonski 
                        and this is Agent Rick Chan with 
                        the FBI.  And this is officer...

           Dublonski waits for the Uniformed Officer, who catches on a 
           half-second too late.

                                 UNIFORMED OFFICER
                        Phillips.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Maryland’s finest.  Is Keith home?

           She looks back and forth between Dublonski, Rick, and the 
           police officer.
                                 MS. GARRETT
                        Is my baby in trouble?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        A little bit, ma'am.  We have a 
                        warrant, if you could please open 
                        the door.

           Rick holds out a WARRANT.  She looks at it through the crack --

                                 MS. GARRETT
                        He's not here right now.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Warrant still stands.  Ma'am.

           Ms. Garrett's eyes dart back and forth, thinking --

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

           A TALL OFFICER crouches to look inside a BASEMENT WINDOW --

           INSIDE THE HOUSE

           KEITH GARRETT ("NIGHTWATCH" from the opening sequence) stands 
           in the doorway, trying to hear what's happening upstairs.

           BACK OUTSIDE

           The Officer reaches for his radio --

                                 TALL OFFICER
                        Got eyes on him in the basement.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dublonski and Rick both hear the warning in their earpieces.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Ma'am, open the door.

                                 MS. GARRETT
                        I told you he's not home --

                                 RICK
                             (to Dublonski)
                        Tick tock.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Ma'am.

                                 MS. GARRETT
                        You all get away from my house --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (to Rick)
                        Okay.  Draw the gun.
           Dublonski steps aside as Rick pulls his PISTOL --

                                                       MS. GARRETT
                           RICK
           Step away from the door now.
                                              Shit --

           She SLAMS the door shut.  Rick winds up and KICKS the door, 
           SPLINTERING IT OPEN --

           Ms. Garrett SCREAMS --

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Rick pushes past her into the dark house, searching for a way 
           downstairs.  He tries one DOOR -- a closet.  Then ANOTHER -- 
           stairs.  Rick runs down --

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           -- and emerges in a basement hallway.  Closed door on the 
           other end.  Rick approaches, PISTOL out in front of him --

                                 RICK
                        Keith.  I'm coming in, so put your 
                        hands where I can see them.

           No response.  Rick reaches for the handle, cautiously --

           BANG!  A bullet tears through the door.  Rick pulls back 
           against the wall.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Keith!

           Rick waves Dublonski back as she comes down the stairs.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Bastard's shooting at us.

           They both fall silent.  Listening.  Then --

           BANG!  Another shot rips down the hallway.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (yelling)
                        Keith.  You're shooting at federal 
                        agents.

                                 RICK
                        We should call tactical.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        That’ll take too long.
                             (into radio)
                        Do you have eyes on him out there?
           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

           The Tall Officer looks through the window -- he can't see 
           anyone inside.  He gets up close, cautiously...

           THERE.  The Officer can see just the top of his head.  He's 
           sitting on the floor, directly under the window, across the 
           room from the door.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dublonski and Rick wait for a response.

                                 TALL OFFICER (RADIO)
                        He's right under the window.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (into radio)
                        Okay.  Break it in.

                                 TALL OFFICER (RADIO)
                        Break in the window?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        One, two, now.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

           The Officer SHATTERS the window with the butt of his gun --

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dublonski and Rick hear the GLASS BREAK and STORM INSIDE --

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BASEMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Both enter with guns drawn -- 

                                 KEITH GARRETT
                        Don't shoot!  Don't shoot me!

           Keith's covering his head on the floor as GLASS RAINS DOWN on 
           him.  LAPTOP in front of him.  Rick KICKS it away and POUNCES 
           on him, knocking the GUN out of his hands --

           Rick shoves him to the ground and HANDCUFFS him as he 
           whimpers --

                                 GARRETT
                        I'm sorry!  God I'm sorry!

           Dublonski picks up the laptop.  She and Rick make eye contact 
           across the room as Keith squirms under Rick's knee.
           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DIGITAL FORENSICS - NIGHT

           A "clean room".  White, sterile.  Dublonski and Rick are 
           hunched over the shoulder of a chubby analyst named SIMMS 
           (30s), who works on a three-monitor rig.

           Keith Garrett's laptop is laying to one side like a 
           transplant patient, opened up with all the guts torn out.  
           The hard drive's open, with the SPINNING DISKS placed inside 
           a SPECIAL READER.

                                 SIMMS
                        The media's in okay shape, 
                        actually.  Some of the data's 
                        hosed, but I salvaged most of it.  
                        Found these chat logs.

           Simms clicks, bringing up a massive amount of text.

                                 SIMMS (CONT’D)
                        Thought you might find this one 
                        interesting.  From last week.

           Simms points to one of the screens.  Highlighted:

                                        CONFICKER

           Dublonski and Rick share a look.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EARLY MORNING

           The sun's barely up.  Assistant Director in Charge DAN 
           ZALPOWICZ (60s) huffs and puffs down a Central Park jogging 
           trail as Dublonski easily keeps pace.

           Zalpowicz runs the New York Field Office, and he's 
           comfortable with his role as a middle management bureaucrat.  
           He’ll put up with outside-the-box thinking to a point, but 
           isn’t afraid to clamp down when he can't predict an outcome.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Absolutely -- not.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Dan, it's our best chance.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        He's not -- not an undercover 
                        agent.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        He's not an agent at all.  That's 
                        why this can work.

           Zalpowicz has to stop, putting his hands on his head and 
           gulping in breath.  Dublonski stops with him.
                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Goddamn wife thinks I'm getting 
                        fatter, can you believe that?  
                        Kicks me out of the house at 5 am 
                        and won't let me back in unless 
                        I've worked up a sweat.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Probably not too late to pick up a 
                        late-shift prostitute.  That’ll get 
                        you sweating.

           Zalpowicz sneers at her, still wheezing.  Dublonski steers 
           back to the topic at hand --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Look, they don't know what 
                        Nightwatch looks like, what he 
                        sounds like, where he's from.  
                        Peter's arrest wasn't in the news 
                        anywhere and he's been monitoring 
                        Nightwatch online for a month.  
                        He's how we found him.  It's just 
                        one day --

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Stop talking.  Now.  I can’t let 
                        your pet monkey with a court-
                        mandated ankle bracelet go to a 
                        hacker convention in Atlantic City.  
                        Are you an idiot?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Creative thinker.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Send Rick instead.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I love Rick.  I do.  But he smells 
                        like Fed from fifty yards.  Shay is 
                        one of them.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        That's what I'm afraid of.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Dan.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        When you took this desk you said 
                        you'd play it safe, do a year in 
                        cybercrime, and take your pension 
                        like a good god-damn lifer should.  
                        This is the kind of thing one does 
                        when they’re planning to file an 
                        extension.
           Dublonski holds his gaze, not refuting him.  Zalpowicz looks 
           around the park in the early-morning mist, disappointed.

                                 ZALPOWICZ (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  How much do you really 
                        trust Peter Shay?

           Off Dublonski, as the question hangs...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Eggs FRY in a pan.  We’re in a cramped kitchen as ANNA (early 
           30s) flies around preparing breakfast.  She’s dressed in 
           HOSPITAL SCRUBS and looks exhausted -- like a popular 
           cheerleader whose life didn’t go quite as planned.

                                 ANNA
                        Michael!  Five minutes!

           ON A SCREEN

           COMPUTER-GENERATED SOLDIERS storm a POST-APOCALYPTIC NEW YORK 
           street, FIRING and THROWING GRENADES as digital HELICOPTERS 
           scream overhead --

           INT. ANNA’S HOUSE - BASEMENT ROOM - MORNING

           Low ceilings.  Dark wood.  Mattress on the floor.  Everything 
           about the room is claustrophobic.

           PETER SHAY (mid-20s) sits on the floor next to MICHAEL (10), 
           his nephew, both wearing XBOX HEADSETS and playing CALL OF 
           DUTY on Peter's small TV.

           Peter is tall and slender, with brown-yellow eyes that never 
           stop searching.  He's the kind of person you wouldn't even 
           notice on the street, which is part of why the FBI thinks 
           he’s so dangerous.

                                 PETER
                        Alright, stay low.  Wait for cover 
                        fire... Now!  Go go go go --

           MICHAEL'S AVATAR jumps out into the fray as PETER'S AVATAR 
           (who is FEMALE) provides cover fire.  Michael's avatar makes 
           it to the next layer of cover and LOBS A GRENADE --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why do you always play as the girl?

           Peter's avatar FIRES and runs to join Michael's --

                                 PETER
                        You're not some six-two Marine last 
                        time I checked.
                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s weird though.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Michael!  I’m not kidding!

                                 PETER
                        That’s why the game’s fun.  You can 
                        be anyone you want.

           Michael's avatar peeps out from behind the cover and gets 
           NAILED IN THE HEAD --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Shit!

                                 PETER
                        Hey, language.  Go eat.

                                 MICHAEL
                        One more game --

           Michael tries to restart but Peter grabs the REMOTE and 
           clicks off the TV --

                                 PETER
                        Upstairs.  My sister’s scary.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you coming?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah I’ll be right there.

           Michael seems skeptical, but scrambles up the stairs anyway.  
           Peter wakes his LAPTOP, sitting on a table behind him.

           He opens his email, scrolls, stops cold.  Subject line:

                        Confirmation for appointment with S. Farrow

           He checks the clock -- 7:23.  Shit.  He's late.

           INT. ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Anna finishes dumping eggs on a plate as Peter rushes in -- 
           coat on over a cheap suit, bag slung over his shoulder.  
           Michael brightens.

                                 ANNA
                        You want to take off your coat?

           Peter looks at Michael and hesitates.

                                 PETER
                        I'm late for that interview with 
                        Farrow.
                                 ANNA
                        Steve Farrow?

                                 PETER
                        He works network security at the 
                        stock exchange now.  Pays well.

                                 ANNA
                        Good for him.

                                 PETER
                        He can get me this job, Anna.

           Anna blocks the exit with her body, looking at Peter's shoes.  
           His pants are bunched up around a GPS ANKLE MONITOR.  Peter 
           looks down and sees the problem, smooths out his pants.

                                 ANNA
                        Heard that a lot from you lately.

                                 PETER
                        I really have to go.
                             (looks at Michael)
                        I’m sorry.

           Anna looks disappointed, but makes no move to stop him as he 
           squeezes by her and out of the kitchen.  A moment later we 
           hear the front door shut.

           Michael looks down at his plate, clearly disappointed.  
           Resigned, Anna takes a bite of bacon.

           EXT. ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Peter walks down the driveway, bag slung over his shoulder.  
           On the street, Dublonski is waiting for him, leaning against 
           a BLACK TOWNCAR, drinking coffee.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Look at you with your tie.

           Peter approaches, stops.

                                 PETER
                        I have a thing in the city.

           Dublonski opens the passenger door --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        That's swell.  I need to talk to 
                        you about something.
                             (Peter hesitates)
                        It's adorable you think you have a 
                        choice.
           INT. BLACK TOWNCAR / EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY

           Dublonski drives as Peter fidgets uncomfortably in the 
           passenger seat, looking through her NOTEBOOK.

                                 PETER
                        Atlantic City?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Last week the ringleader -- the one 
                        who goes by "Crown" -- he called 
                        some sort of meeting during the 
                        "Hacktiva" convention this weekend.  
                        Whole crew's supposed to get 
                        together, Crown, Profs, Marchee, 
                        Teknine.  Nightwatch.

           Peter looks up at her, realizing what she's asking.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        They're planning to steal a set of 
                        logins for Conficker.

                                 PETER
                        I don't know what that is.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        This is why I ask you to come to 
                        meetings -- okay.  It's a worm.  
                        Some honeypot firm found it about a 
                        month ago, and it's currently 
                        building the largest botnet on the 
                        planet.  If it keeps this pace 
                        there'll be a 90% saturation rate 
                        by the end of the year.

                                 PETER
                        That's impossible.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        It's a digital nuclear bomb.  Send 
                        one byte of data from every 
                        infected machine at the same time 
                        and you lock up every networked 
                        device on the planet.  It’s 
                        cybercrime’s top priority.

           The gravity of that isn't lost on Peter.  He remains silent.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        You go to this meeting as 
                        Nightwatch, help steal the logins, 
                        and we arrest the blackout guys and 
                        this worm's creator in one fell 
                        swoop.  Then we use the logins to 
                        shut down Conficker for good.
                                 PETER
                        No.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        No?

                                 PETER
                        When we started this you said I 
                        wouldn't have to testify.  Wouldn't 
                        have to look anybody in the eye.  We 
                        didn’t specifically talk about 
                        assuming some other hacker’s 
                        identity but I think that falls 
                        outside the bounds of our agreement.

           Dublonski pulls over and stops in front of a TALL OFFICE 
           BUILDING.  Metal-and-glass in Lower Manhattan.  She sighs.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        One of my first cases in the Bureau 
                        was this bank heist in the Bronx.  
                        Couple junior varsity morons.  They 
                        did okay inside, but they're 
                        running out the door and one of 
                        them trips and knocks his front 
                        teeth out.  Concussion, all that.  
                        Other guy, his best friend since 
                        they were in diapers -- he just 
                        leaves him there.  Gets away clean.
                             (sips coffee)
                        We bring dumbass number one back to 
                        the interrogation room and the 
                        first and last words out of his 
                        mouth are, "I ain't no snitch."  
                        Except he's still missing his two 
                        front teeth, bleeding like a 
                        faucet, so what he really says is, 
                        "I ain't no thnitch."
                             (beat)
                        Did twenty-two years in Lewisberg.  
                        We never got his friend, though.

           Peter thinks about the story.  Dublonski reaches into the 
           back seat and grabs a laptop, hands it to Peter.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        This is Nightwatch's laptop.

           Peter takes the laptop, looking it over, spinning it in his 
           hands.  He's not happy about this.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        You're facing espionage charges, 
                        Peter.  Thirty years.  I said I'd 
                        only work with the D.A. if you 
                        helped me, and help means whatever 
                        I say it does.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                             (looks at his GPS monitor)
                        Have a great interview.

           Peter glares, acknowledging the threat.  He gets out of the 
           car and slams the door behind him.

           INT. NY-TEC OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Flat screens and mood lighting.  Peter taps his foot 
           nervously in the high-tech waiting room, adjusting his pants 
           to make sure the ankle monitor is hidden.

           After another moment, a door OPENS --

           STEVE FARROW (late 20s, urban chic) stands in the threshold.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        Pete?

           Peter looks up.  Stands.  They stare at each for a moment...

           And then go in a for a BIG HUG.  Steve pats Peter's back.

                                 STEVE FARROW (CONT’D)
                        It's good to see you.

           INT. NY-TEC OFFICE - STEVE FARROW'S OFFICE - DAY

           Peter leans over Steve's computer as they look at pictures of 
           a BABY GIRL.  It's a nice office -- modern, sleek, with a 
           tasteful amount of personality and comic book paraphernalia.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        She's almost two now, can you 
                        believe it?

                                 PETER
                        I cannot believe it.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        I only get to see her weekends, 
                        usually, but... God, I had to baby-
                        proof everything.  I put all these 
                        little gates in the doorways, 
                        trying to keep her in some rooms, 
                        out of other rooms -- my whole 
                        apartment looks like a maximum 
                        security prison.

                                 PETER
                        For toddlers.

           Peter sits in the chair across the desk.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        Exactly, toddler jail.  It's -- oh.  
                        Oh shit.  I'm sorry --
                                 PETER
                        It's fine --

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        No, shit, I wasn't thinking --

                                 PETER
                        Steve.  It's fine.

           Awkward beat.  Peter looks around the office -- pictures of 
           Steve on a mountaintop, pictures of Steve parasailing, 
           pictures of Steve smiling.  A good life.  A life Peter could 
           have had.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        You look good.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, thanks, you too.  This is...

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        Pretty good, huh?  There's a gym in 
                        the building, and there's a kitchen 
                        they keep pretty stocked.  Good 
                        pay, good benefits.

           Peter nods, taking it all in.

                                 PETER
                        This is owned by the exchange?

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        No, no, we're just contractors.  
                        They're our biggest client, though.

           Peter nods, trying to figure out how to broach what he really 
           wants to talk about.

                                 PETER
                        Wow, yeah.  So, where do I fit in?

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        What do you mean?

                                 PETER
                        You said there's an opening.  In 
                        your email.

           Steve is suddenly uncomfortable, and Peter clocks it.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, we could talk 
                        about that.

                                 PETER
                        I thought that's what we were 
                        talking about.
                                 STEVE FARROW
                        Yeah.  Pete, I -- look, I should 
                        have called.  I tried, all right?  
                        I did the best I could.

           Peter doesn't like where this is going.

                                 STEVE FARROW (CONT’D)
                        There're serious charges hanging 
                        over you, Pete.  I looked.  What 
                        the hell were you doing poking 
                        around Langley's servers?

                                 PETER
                        It wasn't Langley --
                             (stops, composes himself)
                        You told me I had a job here if I 
                        wanted it.

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        We do security for the New York 
                        Stock Exchange.  They just can't.

                                 PETER
                        Can't what?  Who's "they"?

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        They can't hire you.  And they, you 
                        know they.  There's always a they.

                                 PETER
                        I bet most of "they" have poked 
                        around worse places than some off-
                        site CIA computer --

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        That's not the point --

                                 PETER
                        What's the point then, partner?

                                 STEVE FARROW
                        The point is you got caught.  I 
                        warned you --
                             (beat, calmer)
                        I warned you to back off and you 
                        didn't listen.

           And there it is.  Peter nods, stands to leave.

                                 STEVE FARROW (CONT’D)
                        Pete.  Shit, I'm sorry, okay?  Let 
                        me talk to them again, maybe I can 
                        get you a referral.  Pete --

           But Peter's out the door.  Steve taps his knuckles on his 
           desk.  Worried about his friend.
           INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter sits on the floor of his room, Nightwatch's laptop open 
           in front of him.  An old piece of tape covers the camera 
           above the monitor.

           He's scrolling through CHAT LOGS -- hundreds of hours of text 
           conversation between Nightwatch and various other people.

           After a moment, he opens a program called XChat.  It's an 
           Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client, a kind of anonymous chat 
           program.

           He goes to Recents -- the top result is a room called 
           "cmptn102713.net".

           He types:

           /server irc.cmptn102713.net_

           He hits ENTER and a CHAT WINDOW pops up.  There's only one 
           other name in the room:

                                         Marchee

           Peter stares at the name.  He wasn't expecting that.  The 
           cursor blinks as Peter considers whether or not to leave.

           Marchee:    hey

           Text in the main window.  Peter looks around his empty room, 
           types:

           Nightwatch: hey

           Another pause.

           Marchee:    I'm excited to finally meet you

           Peter considers that -- what kind of relationship does 
           "Nightwatch" have with this person?  He types --

           Nightwatch: I still feel like it's not real

           But before he hits enter, something nags at him.  He alt-tabs 
           to the chat logs and reads through them --

           Sure enough, Nightwatch doesn't capitalize his "i"s.  Peter 
           makes the appropriate edit and hits enter:

           Nightwatch: i still feel like it's not real

           A beat.  Did that work?  Another WINDOW POPS UP:

                        Marchee would like to send an image file.
                                      Do you accept?
           Peter hesitates a moment, then hits YES --

           A MOSTLY-NUDE WEBCAM SCREENSHOT of a girl pops up.  Slim, 
           pale, dark hair, making an arm bra, cropped from neck to 
           waist.  Sexy, in a voyeuristic sort of way.

           She has a half-dozen tattoos, including a SMALL CLUSTER OF 
           STARS near her collarbone, like a CONSTELLATION.  Peter 
           stares, transfixed.

           Marchee:    it’s real
           Marchee:    ;)

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Peter?

           Peter looks up and sees Anna coming down the stairs.  Scrubs.  
           Exhausted expression.  Peter alt-tabs away from the picture 
           as she approaches.  She spots the laptop --

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        This new?

                                 PETER
                        FBI's.

                                 ANNA
                        Mike's been asking for one.  Says 
                        he needs it.

                                 PETER
                        He's ten.

           Anna shrugs and plops down next to him on the floor.

                                 ANNA
                        How'd the interview go?

                                 PETER
                        Good.  He's going to call me next 
                        week.

           Anna rests her head on his shoulder, closes her eyes.  Does 
           she know he's lying?

                                 ANNA
                        There was this patient today, this 
                        investment banker's wife.  Her 
                        daughter's going to Princeton next 
                        year and they were taking out an 
                        equity loan to pay for it.  And I 
                        was thinking, shit.  I can't even 
                        afford to fix the car's air 
                        conditioning.

                                 PETER
                        I'll find a job, Anna.
                                 ANNA
                        It's so much simpler down here.  No 
                        mouths to feed, nobody screaming at 
                        you, nobody to disappoint.  Just 
                        this little cave where you can 
                        avoid the rest of the world.

                                 PETER
                             (re: the laptop)
                        Whole world's right here.

                                 ANNA
                        I mean the real world, Pete.

           She didn't exactly mean it as a dig, but that's how it lands.  
           As Anna drifts off to sleep, Peter stares at the GLOWING 
           SCREEN.  He reopens the picture, looking at it...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HIGH LINE PARK - DAY

           Dublonski sits on a bench atop the High Line, nursing a 
           coffee and looking out across the water.  She looks around -- 
           nannies with kids, dogs, etc.  The early-morning crowd.

           After a moment, she spots Peter walking towards her.  She 
           looks back out over the water as he sits next to her.  A beat.

                                 PETER
                        These aren't townie bank robbers.  
                        They've never met in person.  They 
                        don't join forces to commit federal 
                        crimes and then go for a fun 
                        weekend in Atlantic City.  Do you 
                        know what hacking really is?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I have a feeling you're about to 
                        enlighten me.

                                 PETER
                        Hacking is figuring out how systems 
                        work and learning to exploit them.  
                        It's not just stealing data.  You 
                        can hack phones, you can hack 
                        locks.  You can reprogram batteries 
                        and make them explode.
                             (beat)
                        The only reason these guys are 
                        showing up in Atlantic City is 
                        because they think Conficker is 
                        worth risking everything for.

           Dublonski considers him a moment -- he seems almost afraid.
                                 DUBLONSKI
                        So do I.
                             (beat)
                        What do you need?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

           A ceremony of sorts.  Peter, Dublonski, Zalpowicz, and a PAIR 
           OF LAWYERS holding court.  The PROSECUTOR stands over Peter, 
           watching him sign a consent form.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        They're going to assume everybody's 
                        working for the cops, so I need to 
                        lose this GPS.  I can't wear a 
                        wire.  I can't have a tail.  There 
                        can't be any indication anything at 
                        all is suspicious.

           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DUBLONSKI'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dublonski stands over Rick's shoulder as he works on the 
           computer.  The PRINTER spits out pages, adding to an already-
           thick stack.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You have to erase me from your 
                        system.  My picture.  My 
                        fingerprints.  Any video of me 
                        entering or exiting the federal 
                        building.

           The printer finishes.  Dublonski picks up the stack and NODS 
           to Rick.  He DELETES Peter's image on the screen --

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Back in the DA's office, the second LAWYER inserts a SPECIAL 
           KEY into Peter's ANKLE MONITOR and TWISTS -- the LIGHT stops 
           blinking.  He rips off the velcro.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        After the initial meeting every one 
                        of these guys'll go home and trawl 
                        through federal informant files to 
                        see if they recognize any faces.

                                 DUBLONSKI (V.O.)
                        How would they get access to 
                        confidential files?

           Peter rubs his leg, looking up at Dublonski.  Freedom.  But 
           what's it going to cost him?
           EXT. HIGH LINE PARK - DAY

           Back on the park bench with Peter and Dublonski.

                                 PETER
                        If you really thought the world's 
                        best hackers worked for the 
                        government, we wouldn't be having 
                        this conversation.

           Dublonski cracks a smirk.  Respect.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        We'll drive down in an hour.  
                        Anything else?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  I want to meet him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. METRO FEDERAL PRISON - VISITOR ROOM - DAY

           Keith Garrett sits at a metal table, alone in the vast echo 
           chamber except for a few GUARDS milling in the periphery.

           THUNK-SQUEAK... the door opens and Peter enters, alone.  
           Scopes out the empty room and takes a seat across from Keith.  
           The two stare at each other for a few moments.

           FROM BEHIND A ONE-WAY MIRROR

           Dublonski and Rick watch with a LAWYER and a PRISON GUARD.

           BACK IN THE ROOM

           Peter leans in --

                                 PETER
                        Do you know who I am?

           Keith looks to the one-way glass, doesn't respond.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Guess that's the point, I'm nobody.  
                        So are you.

           Peter adjusts his position in the chair, mimicking Keith's 
           posture.  Dublonski notices the change through the window.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how you got caught?

           Another steely stare in response.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You got caught because six days ago 
                        you forgot to route your IP through 
                        Tor at three in the morning and one 
                        person in the whole world noticed.  
                        Doesn't matter what you were doing.  
                        Doesn't matter why.  All that 
                        matters is you have to live with 
                        the consequences of that split-
                        second mistake for the rest of your 
                        life.

           Keith stares at this stranger, finally speaks up --

                                 KEITH GARRETT
                        You're the snitch.

           Keith adjusts his position in the chair, and Peter matches.  
           Dublonski watches Peter transform.

                                 PETER
                        No.
                             (glances to mirror, then 
                              back to Keith)
                        I'm Nightwatch.

           PRELAP: rain from inside a car on a highway...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOWNCAR / EXT. EXPRESSWAY - DAY

           Raining, cold.  Peter leans against the window as the HIGH 
           RISE CASINOS of Atlantic City creep up on the horizon.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - MAIN HALL - DAY

           Situated somewhere between the Consumer Electronics Show and 
           the Exxxotica Porn Expo, the whole convention area is wall-to-
           wall with dyed hair, half-naked women, piercings, khaki 
           shorts, and socks with sandals.

           Peter weaves through the throngs of people, dodging drunks 
           and scanning for something familiar.

           Ahead, a CONVENTION-GOER jumps out of a cluster.  His VOICE 
           pierces above the din, nasal and screechy --

                                 CONVENTION-GOER
                        Fed!  I see one!  Fed fed fed!

           He’s pointing right at Peter, who freezes in place -- he’s 
           been here just a few minutes and has already been made.  A 
           few people stop what they’re doing and turn to look.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES NSA (O.S.)
                        Got me!
           Peter whips around -- standing right behind him is an NSA 
           AGENT (early 40s, fit, with an ugly haircut).  He holds up 
           his NSA ID triumphantly.

           The crowd erupts into a CHEER.  Everyone clinks glasses and 
           takes shots.  Two scantily-clad TROPHY GIRLS place a medal 
           around the convention-goer’s neck.

           Someone playfully slaps the Plainclothes NSA on the back, 
           leaving a taped “I’m an NSA Agent!” sign, with the “NSA” 
           hastily scrawled by hand.

           Random screams from the crowd: “Don’t show him your shit!” 
           “Watch your back!” “Five-Oh!”

           Peter breathes a sigh of relief and continues wandering.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           Peter walks down a hall of hotel rooms.  A few tourists 
           wander back and forth.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GREAT HALL - DAY

           Peter comes up the stairs out of DUSK NIGHTCLUB.  He looks 
           around the great hall as tourists and gamblers swirl, getting 
           his bearings.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SIDE AREA - DAY

           Peter meanders into the less crowded hall, overwhelmed.  He 
           finds a spot against the wall and sits on the floor as 
           gamblers and convention-goers stream past.  He pulls out the 
           Nightwatch laptop.  Opens it.

           In XChat he types:

           /server irc.cmptn102713.net_

           The familiar CHAT WINDOW pops up.  This time, nobody's 
           inside.  He opens up MARCHEE'S PICTURE and stares at it, 
           focusing on the CONSTELLATION TATTOO near her collarbone.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - BUFFET LINE - DAY

           Dublonski holds a plate at a buffet table, considering a 
           SHRIMP COCKTAIL on display.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES NSA (O.S.)
                        You know they spray on that pink 
                        color in the kitchen.

           Dublonski looks up -- across the table is the previously-
           identified NSA agent.  His name is NORM LYDEKKER.  His 
           plate's piled high with meat and potatoes.
                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (re: his plate)
                        Do they spray the green on the 
                        vegetables too?

           A playful smile between them.  The moment hangs...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - LYDEKKER'S SUITE - DAY

           The headboard BANGS against the wall as Dublonski and 
           Lydekker have sex.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah...

           Lydekker finishes and rolls off to one side, panting.  
           Dublonski's opinion on the experience is inscrutable.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - LYDEKKER'S SHOWER - LATER

           Dublonski stands under the stream of water, running her hands 
           through her hair.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - LYDEKKER'S SUITE - SAME

           Lydekker sits on the edge of the bed in a bathrobe, watching 
           FOOTBALL on TV.  Large food service tray off to the side.

                                 LYDEKKER
                             (yelling)
                        Chelsea's doing great, by the way.  
                        She took the kids up to the ranch 
                        in Montana, I'm gonna meet them 
                        there next weekend.

           On the night stand, Dublonski's Blackberry BUZZES.  Lydekker 
           notices and scoots toward it, continuing --

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        She's been doing this riding 
                        workout thing, she ordered like six 
                        different DVDs.
                             (the WATER TURNS OFF)
                        You ever seen those?  Supposed to 
                        really help with your stamina on 
                        the... saddle.

           Lydekker looks concerned as he reads the text message.

                                 DUBLONSKI (O.S.)
                        I don't like horses.

           Dublonski emerges from the bathroom in a robe and immediately 
           goes for her clothes on the dresser, ignoring Lydekker.  He 
           looks up from the Blackberry.
                                 LYDEKKER
                        You lied to me.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Didn't realize a shared love of 
                        equestrian sports was an important 
                        part of our relationship.

           Dublonski looks at Lydekker as she slides into her pants.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        I heard the Bureau was doing their 
                        own investigation into Conficker, 
                        but I thought we were friends.  
                        What's yours is mine and all that.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        You can’t look at my texts.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Of course I can, I have a higher 
                        security clearance.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Oh that’s right, you have the 
                        security clearance, I only have the 
                        phone number to your ranch in 
                        Montana.  Do you check Chelsea’s 
                        messages too?

           Lydekker’s not amused.  Dublonski continues getting dressed.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        You need to introduce me to your 
                        undercover.  We both know the 
                        Bureau's got no business chasing 
                        hackers all over the place.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Is there an alternate definition of 
                        cybercrime I’m not familiar with?

           She finishes buttoning up her blouse, eyeing the food tray.  
           Lydekker realizes something --

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Your birthday's coming up, huh.  
                        Big five-seven.  Forced retirement.

           Dublonski pulls on her jacket, doesn't respond.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        This little cyber case won't be 
                        enough for an extension.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        We're the armpit of law 
                        enforcement, you know that.  Hard 
                        drives aren’t sexy like cocaine 
                        bricks and towel-heads.

           She grabs a COOKIE off the tray and turns to go.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Thanks for lunch.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DUMPY DINER - EVENING

           Establishing.  Off the main drag.  Not many tourists drive 
           this far for food this bad.

           Peter gets out of a taxi and heads for the entrance.

           INT. DUMPY DINER - EVENING

           Peter sits across from Dublonski and Rick.  Dublonski's 
           tearing into a club sandwich while Rick pokes at a salad.  
           Peter stares at the sad hamburger in front of him.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (mouth full)
                        Go over it with me one more time.
                             (no response)
                        Pete?

           He snaps out of his trance, looks up.

                                 PETER
                        I show up at the club and ask for 
                        "Mr. Fujiwara."  They bring me 
                        inside.  You watch from the 
                        surveillance room, take stills, and 
                        we meet back for the ID.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        We'll have eyes on you the whole 
                        time.  Oh.

           Dublonski gestures to Rick and he slides a SMARTPHONE across 
           the table.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Eyes and ears.

           Peter looks at the phone like it’s radioactive.  Rick 
           predicts his complaint --

                                 RICK
                        It's called a roving bug.  There's 
                        no software to find even if they 
                        search it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICK (CONT'D)
                        Phone company remotely activates 
                        the mic and we listen in.  Just a 
                        regular cellphone.

                                 PETER
                        You're allowed to do that?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Pete.  We're the FBI.

           Peter deadpans, dissatisfied with that answer.  But he stuffs 
           the new phone in his pocket.  Dublonski reaches across the 
           table and ruffles his hair --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        You're gonna do great.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Strobe lights.  Laser beams.  Bone-trembling bass.  Peter 
           wanders through the crowd in the massive, oval-shaped club, 
           searching for something familiar.

           He looks up at a DOME CAMERA on the ceiling.

           POV DOME CAMERA: Peter stares right at it, a still body in a 
           sea of movement.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Dublonski and Rick are settled in chairs, watching Peter on 
           an array of monitors.  A SURVEILLANCE TECH sits nearby.

           A DULL MURMUR comes from a speaker -- Peter's roving bug 
           picking up the ambient noise.

                                 SURVEILLANCE TECH
                        Good picture, huh?  Upgraded the 
                        whole system to HD last year.  This 
                        is infrared 1080i.

           The thumping bass of the club is just a tinny roar inside the 
           surveillance room.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Fascinating.
                             (to Rick, re: sound)
                        Can we filter that out?

                                 RICK
                        Not in real time.

           Not what Dublonski wanted to hear.
           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - BAR - NIGHT

           Pete approaches the bar, squeezing between ED HARDY BROS and 
           SARAN-WRAPPED WOMEN.  A FEMALE BARTENDER notices and comes 
           over.  She has to yell over the bass --

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                        Help you sweetie?

                                 PETER
                        I'm looking for Mr. Fujiwara.

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                             (cups her hand to her ear)
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        Fujiwara!

           She looks at him for a moment -- clearly still not 
           understanding -- and then moves off to serve someone else.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        No, I --

           As the bartender walks away, he sees -- 

           Another WOMAN, a couple yards away.  Slim, pale, dark hair.  
           CONSTELLATION TATTOO on her neck.  Staring directly at him.

           MARCHEE.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Dublonski concentrates on Peter's image on the screen.  The 
           resolution is good enough to see his shocked expression.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        What's he looking at?

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - BAR - SAME

           Peter looks around to make sure she's actually looking at 
           him.  She doesn't break eye contact.  It's intense.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Dublonski gets close to the monitor --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        It's either this man or this woman.
                             (to Rick, re: speaker)
                        Turn that up.
                             (to Tech)
                        Are you recording this?
           Rick turns up the speaker, but they can't hear anything over 
           the TINNY HOUSE MUSIC.  It's drowning everything else out.

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - BAR - SAME

           While Peter's still processing who he's seeing, Marchee 
           approaches, grabs the scruff of his neck, and leans close to 
           his ear, whispering in the throbbing room --

                                 MARCHEE
                        Do you know who I am?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

           She deftly reaches into his pocket and removes his NEW 
           SMARTPHONE.  Peter doesn’t notice.  Marchee smiles, sexy.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Are you sure?

           She pulls back and looks at him.  He's a deer in the 
           headlights.  She smiles, flirty, and then turns around and 
           DISAPPEARS into the crowd.

           Peter's mind whirls.  After a beat, he goes after her --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Back in the surveillance room --

                                 RICK
                        He's following her.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        After that I'd follow her too.

           ON THE MONITOR: Peter is carving his way through the crowd, a 
           few paces behind Marchee --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                             (to Tech)
                        Is there a better angle?

           The Tech cycles another monitor, flipping between cameras, 
           but there are too many people in the club.  It's too 
           disorienting.

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - BAR - SAME

           Peter follows Marchee through the crowd, a few arm-lengths 
           behind.  He struggles to keep her in sight through the mass 
           of bodies as the music throbs around him.

           Every once in a while she looks back over her shoulder.  
           Smirks, coy.  Enjoying the chase.
           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Rick's watching the main monitor as Dublonski struggles to 
           find him in another angle --

                                 RICK
                        He's almost off the screen --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (to Tech)
                        Where's he going?

                                 SURVEILLANCE TECH
                        Looks like the private rooms.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (scanning monitors)
                        Show me those.

           The Tech hesitates.  Dublonski SNAPS at him, impatient.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Hey.  Now.

                                 SURVEILLANCE TECH
                        There's no cameras back there.

           ON THE SCREEN: Peter disappears off the edge.  Dublonski 
           pulls away and looks at the Tech in disbelief.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        You told me every inch of this 
                        place was covered.

                                 SURVEILLANCE TECH
                        Back rooms are for high roller 
                        clients, they don't want any -- 
                        look, I don’t make policy.

           Dublonski glares at him --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Better hope the sound's good.

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - BACK HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dark, moody.  Muffled bass thumps through the walls.  Deserted 
           save for stray glimpses of HIGH ROLLERS and PRICEY ESCORTS.

           Peter jogs to catch up to Marchee, who's scrolling through 
           his SMARTPHONE.

                                 PETER
                        How did you --
                             (sees smartphone, panics)
                        Hey --
           Peter reaches for it, adrenaline spiking through the roof --

           Marchee SWINGS AROUND and THROWS Peter against the wall, 
           catching him by surprise --

                                 MARCHEE
                        Why would you yell that in there.

                                 PETER
                        That's what I was supposed to say --

                                 MARCHEE
                        It’s not amateur hour.  You don't 
                        know who's watching.

                                 PETER
                        Who the hell else would know what 
                        Fujiwara means?

                                 MARCHEE
                        I don't know.  That's the point.

           She releases him, holds up the smartphone --

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        Crown said no phones.  No names, no 
                        birthdays, no hometowns, no 
                        identifying information.  I'm 
                        Marchee, you're Nightwatch.  That's 
                        all I want to know.

                                 PETER
                        How do you know I'm Nightwatch?

           She pulls the battery out --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Rick and the Dublonski hear the speaker go DEAD.  Shit.  No 
           video, no audio.  Dublonski thinks for a moment.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Does he still have his old phone?

                                 RICK
                        What?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        The other phone, the silver one.  
                        Can we get a tap on that number?

           Rick’s already dialing the appropriate people --

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - BACK HALLWAY - SAME

           Marchee puts the disassembled phone next to a plant on a 
           built-in shelf.
                                 PETER
                        Is Crown here?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Not yet.

                                 PETER
                        Then why do you care what he said?

           Marchee appreciates the balls of this, but isn't swayed.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Just pick it up when we’re done.

           She turns and walks down the hall.

           Peter reaches in to his pocket to remove his OLD CELLPHONE, 
           but decides to leave it there.  He takes off after her.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Rick types a new code into the laptop connected to the 
           speaker, and the SOUND COMES BACK IN.  He turns to Dublonski.

                                 RICK
                        They catch him with that phone and 
                        this is all over.

           Dublonski listens to the swishing sounds of Peter walking 
           down a hallway, doesn't respond.  She knows.

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

           Marchee opens the door to the lavishly-appointed room, Peter 
           right behind.  Three men sit in lounge chairs, talking --

                                 TEKNINE
                        -- because I ain't hanging around 
                        until the feds show up and charge 
                        us with conspiracy --

           Facing away and speaking is TEKNINE (20s), tall and wiry, with 
           sloppily-cut GRAY HAIR and rapid-fire speech.  Looks one 
           sleepless night away from full-blown meth addict.

           Opposite him are two older men, ELIX (late 40s) and RAMSEY 
           (30s, black).  Elix's designer suit contrasts sharply with his 
           bushy beard, and Ramsey's all muscles, malice, and quiet calm.

           Elix and Ramsey look past Teknine to notice Marchee and Peter 
           come through the door.

                                 TEKNINE (CONT’D)
                        -- what?
                             (turns, sees Peter)
                        Fucking finally.  You check him?
                                 MARCHEE
                        Yeah I checked him.
                             (to Peter)
                        This is Teknine, past him is Profs.

           Peter looks at each man sitting behind Teknine --

                                 PETER
                        Which one?

           Elix pipes up and stands --

                                 ELIX
                        Both of us.

           He approaches Peter with his hand extended.  Peter reaches up 
           to shake, realizing he was touching his OLD CELLPHONE through 
           his pocket.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        You can call me Elix.  This is my 
                        associate Ramsey.

           Ramsey nods a greeting from the lounge chair.  Elix can see 
           Peter's still confused --

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        We work as a team.

           Peter looks around the room -- no one else in here.

                                 PETER
                        Guess I'm not late after all.

                                 ELIX
                        The very problem we were 
                        discussing.  To me it seems 
                        impolite to call a meeting and be 
                        the last to arrive.

                                 TEKNINE
                        To me it seems like a fucking sting 
                        operation --

           RING-RING -- a cell phone.  Everyone freezes as Peter's 
           adrenaline skyrockets --

                                 TEKNINE (CONT’D)
                        Who the fuck has a cell phone?

           Teknine glares at Peter, who stares back helplessly.  Marchee 
           comes to his defense --

                                 MARCHEE
                        It isn't his.

           RING-RING.  Ramsey nods with his head --
                                 RAMSEY
                        It's over there.

           Teknine tears across the room.  He reaches under a lounge 
           chair and emerges with a CELLPHONE.  Unknown number.

           Peter tries to control his relief --

           RING-RING.  Still going.  Everyone stares.

                                 PETER
                        Are you going to answer it?

           Teknine tosses the phone to Peter --

                                 TEKNINE
                        Fuck no.

           Peter awkwardly catches the RINGING phone and answers --

                                 PETER
                        Hello?

                                 MODULATED VOICE (PHONE)
                        Put the phone on speaker.

           The voice is pitch-shifted enough to make it impossible to 
           tell who's calling.  Doesn't matter -- Peter already knows.

           Peter hits the speakerphone button, uncomfortable with so 
           many eyes on him.

                                 MODULATED VOICE (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello everyone, this is Crown.  As 
                        you no doubt have gathered, I won’t 
                        be joining you this evening.

           The four hackers look around the room at each other.

                                 MODULATED VOICE (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Instead I have some information for 
                        you.  Stored on this phone is a 
                        preliminary dox on a man staying in 
                        this hotel with access to 
                        Conficker’s primary command server.

           More looks around the room -- did anyone know this?

                                 MODULATED VOICE (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        The server is activated by one of 
                        sixteen combinations of user names 
                        and passkeys, and this man carries 
                        on his person the master table for 
                        every unique login.  He leaves the 
                        convention tomorrow evening, so we 
                        only have until then to liberate it 
                        from his possession.

                        you for the next phase.

           CLICK.  Line's dead.  They all stare at the phone.

           BEEP-BEEP -- the phone lights up with a text message:

                            UPLOAD TO 2001:db8:0:2093:1:427:2:1

           BEEP BEEP -- another message, this time a DRIVER'S LICENSE-
           STYLE PHOTO of a MAN.  Blonde.  Vaguely handsome.  Crooked 
           nose, like he broke it as a child and it never healed.

                                 TEKNINE
                        How's he fucking know all that?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Tek --

                                 TEKNINE
                        No fuck this, I'm not buying this 
                        Mission Impossible bullshit.  Feels 
                        like feds walking us into a trap.

                                 MARCHEE
                        You heard Crown --

                                 TEKNINE
                        I heard some voice on some phone.  
                        That's it.

           Elix is lost in thought.  Ramsey speaks to no one in 
           particular, philosophical --

                                 RAMSEY
                        Until half an hour ago we were all 
                        just pixels on a screen.

                                 TEKNINE
                        That's exactly fucking right.  I 
                        don't know any of you, I don't know 
                        what Crown knows or how he knows 
                        it, and all the shit I don't know 
                        is making me very fucking 
                        uncomfortable.

                                 RAMSEY
                        Conficker’s worth a lot of money.

                                 MARCHEE
                        The data's worth more.  We'd have 
                        access to all the infected machines.

                                 ELIX
                        More than access.
           Everyone turns to Elix, who snaps out of his reverie.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        We would have control.  With the 
                        flick of a switch we'd command the 
                        most powerful network humanity has 
                        ever seen.  And if the five of us 
                        can wrest the logins from this 
                        individual in a single day, I'm 
                        guessing others could as well.

           Elix looks at Peter, holding the phone with the pertinent 
           information on this mysterious man.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        Why shouldn’t we do it first?

           Looks around the room.  Peter conceals his unease amidst the 
           general agreement from the rest.  He looks at the Blonde 
           Man’s photo again, then passes the phone to Elix.

                                 DUBLONSKI (PRELAP)
                        You’re telling me the login 
                        information for the biggest botnet 
                        in human history is stored on a 
                        keychain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dublonski sits on one of the room’s two beds, two dozen 
           Sharpie-circled SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS from the nightclub on 
           either side of her.  Peter stands at the mini-bar, rifling 
           through the contents.  He’s been debriefing her.

                                 PETER
                        It’s a 64-bit word salted hash 
                        encryption.  You’d have to be some 
                        kind of mutant to memorize it.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Still, a snatch and grab on a thumb 
                        drive feels low tech for these guys.

                                 PETER
                        Hacking is finding the simplest 
                        solution to a problem.  Sometimes 
                        you just need the right password.

           Peter holds up two MINI VODKA BOTTLES.  Dublonski shrugs, and 
           he tosses her one.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Once you have the credentials, then 
                        what happens?
           Dublonski takes a pull from the small bottle.

                                 PETER
                        Then we log in to the server and 
                        change them.  His copy can’t be the 
                        only copy.  As soon as he learns 
                        his master key’s missing the first 
                        thing he does is change the locks.  
                        We have to beat him to it.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        How’d Crown find out this guy runs 
                        Conficker in the first place?

                                 PETER
                        I don’t know.  He just gave us the 
                        picture, the name, and the room 
                        number.  Which is more than you and 
                        your crack cybercrime team found, 
                        by the way.  FBI pay for Kit Kats?

           Peter emerges with candy from the mini bar.  Dublonski 
           doesn’t respond, just takes another sip.  She looks at the 
           bottle as if it gave her an idea.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Do Marchee and Nightwatch have a 
                        relationship?

           Peter looks up, surprised at the question --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Because if she knows more about 
                        Keith than we think she does --

                                 PETER
                        She doesn’t.

           Peter’s defensive tone isn’t lost on her.  Or himself.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’m not like them.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        You were arrested for hijacking a 
                        Predator drone.

                                 PETER
                        That’s not what happened --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        You uploaded a virus to the Ground 
                        Control Station.  So you’re right, 
                        you technically hijacked all the 
                        Predator drones.

           Pointed stare.
                                 PETER
                        It was keylogging software.  A 
                        lieutenant on base wanted to spy on 
                        his wife because he thought she was 
                        cheating on him, and he infected 
                        his flight terminal by mistake.  
                        But it’s easier to string up the 
                        guy who wrote the code than admit 
                        the biggest security flaw on a 
                        military base running highly 
                        classified and almost certainly 
                        illegal bombing missions is the 
                        stupidity of its own employees.  
                        I’m guessing that part didn’t make 
                        it into the file.

           Dublonski considers him a long beat -- he’s right, that 
           wasn’t in the file.  She slips off her shoes and lifts her 
           legs on to the bed.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Get some sleep.  Big day tomorrow.

                                 PETER
                        FBI doesn’t pay for your own room?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Of course they do.

           She clicks off the light, rolls over.  Off Peter, shaking his 
           head, incredulous --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PETER’S ROOM - LATER

           Lights out.  Peter and Dublonski both sleep in their 
           respective beds.  Dublonski’s still wearing her pant-suit, 
           covers balled up around her.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - CHECK IN COUNTER - NIGHT

           The casino is still buzzing with night owls, but there’s only 
           one CLERK behind the desk.  A long row of check-in computers, 
           but most are off.  The clerk’s busy looking at her phone.

           IN THE FOREGROUND: a computer lights up.  Clerk doesn’t notice.  
           The CURSOR MOVES on it’s own, looking up a room record...

           The cursor stops on KEITH GARRETT -- Room 1607.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           DING!  The elevator doors open and SOMEONE with a BACKPACK 
           steps out, in one hand a STACK OF PLASTIC CARDS and in the 
           other something that looks like a PORTABLE CARD READER.
           The figure walks down the hall and stops in front of a door.  
           Hits a few buttons on the reader and SWIPES a card through -- 
           BEEEEEP.  Hands slide the card into the ELECTRIC DOOR LOCK.

           BZZT.  Red light.  No good.  The hands hit a few more buttons 
           on the reader and swipe another card --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Muffled BZZT through the door.  Peter blinks awake in the 
           dark room, looks over to the other bed -- Dublonski is still 
           sound asleep.

           He sits up, listens...

           BZZT -- another muffled buzz.  He gets out of bed and 
           approaches the door.

                                 PETER
                        Hello?

           Dublonski wakes at the sound of Peter’s voice --

           BING!  Peter realizes what’s happening a half-second too 
           late.  The door in front of him swings open, revealing --

           Marchee.  She’s surprised to see Peter so close, illuminated 
           from the light in the hallway.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Oh.  Hi.

                                 PETER
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Are you busy?

                                 PETER
                        No -- what?  You can’t just break 
                        in to my room --

           He throws a quick look behind him to see if Dublonski is 
           visible -- she isn’t.  But Marchee catches his glance.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Is somebody in here?  Who’s in here?

           Marchee pushes past Peter into the bedroom -- and Dublonski 
           is no where to be seen.  But both beds are unmade.  Peter 
           stands behind her, helpless.

           Marchee walks deeper into the room, puzzled.  She spots a 
           BARE FOOT on the floor, peeking out from behind the bed.

           Marchee walks around the side... revealing Dublonski, 
           stripped to her underwear, face down.
           Marchee turns back to Peter, alarmed --

                                 PETER
                        It’s not -- um --

           Dublonski suddenly BOLTS UP, startling both of them.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Whathefuck --
                             (sees Marchee, squints)
                        Keithy?  Where’s Keithy.

           Dublonski doubles over, holding her head in faux-pain --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhh...

                                 MARCHEE
                        Ma’am, are you all right?

           Dublonski looks around, blinking fake drunk from her eyes.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Did you see my clothes?  They’re 
                        right...
                             (spinning, swaying)
                        I haddem earlier.  They were 
                        right... on me.

           Marchee looks at Peter, horrified --

                                 MARCHEE
                        I’m sorry.

           She rushes out of the room, door closing behind her.

                                 PETER
                             (hisses)
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        At least she didn’t see the badge.

           Peter turns and runs out the door --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Peter catches up with Marchee at the elevator.  She’s hitting 
           the call button over and over, willing the elevator to come.

                                 PETER
                        Marchee wait --

                                 MARCHEE
                        I shouldn’t have done that.
                                 PETER
                        No.  Probably not.

           Marchee can’t look at him, but he’s not leaving.  The 
           elevator still hasn’t arrived.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Was that a...

                                 PETER
                        No, god, no.  She was just drunk at 
                        the bar, I didn’t -- nothing happened.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Okay.

           Clearly Marchee doesn’t believe him.

                                 PETER
                        Nothing happened.  She just -- she 
                        wouldn’t tell me where she was 
                        staying and I couldn’t just... let 
                        her...

           He trails off.  It’s a long wait until --

           DING!  The elevator doors open and Marchee jumps inside.  She 
           finally looks at him -- hurt.  Peter knows he can’t just let 
           her leave.  At the last possible second, he jumps in the 
           elevator --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           -- and the doors close.  Marchee’s trapped with him now.  She 
           stares straight ahead, doing her best to ignore him.

                                 PETER
                        Are you not talking to me now?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Sometimes people just don’t match 
                        the version you had in your head.  
                        I shouldn’t have come.

                                 PETER
                        Why did you?

           Marchee doesn’t answer.  Peter considers her a moment, then 
           hits the EMERGENCY BUTTON.  The elevator JERKS to a stop.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What are you doing?

           Peter crouches and slips his fingers around a PANEL under the 
           elevator buttons.
                                 PETER
                        Let me see your laptop.

                                 MARCHEE
                        No.

           Peter PRIES OFF the panel, exposing the guts of the elevator.  
           He turns and looks up to her.

                                 PETER
                        You want to be stuck in here until 
                        someone comes to get us?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Just hit the button again.  It’ll go.

                                 PETER
                        Come on.  We can have more fun than 
                        that.

           He smiles, charming.  Against her better judgement, Marchee 
           hands over her messenger bag.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT

           A SUPERVISOR walks over to the Surveillance Tech, who’s 
           watching the monitor array with glassy eyes.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        How long’s that been blinking?

           He points to an ELECTRICAL DIAGRAM in front of him, where a 
           RED LIGHT in one of the elevator shafts is flashing.

                                 SURVEILLANCE TECH
                        I, uh... must have just started.

                             (skeptical)
                        Yeah.  Show me elevator four.

           The Tech types and --

           AN EMPTY ELEVATOR pops up.  The Supervisor leans in.  The 
           image looks... frozen.  Like a still frame.

                                 SUPERVISOR (CONT’D)
                        What the...

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - ELEVATOR - SAME

           Peter looks up at the SECURITY CAMERA on the ceiling, then 
           returns to his work.  He has Marchee’s laptop plugged 
           directly in to the elevator.

           After a few seconds of typing he looks back up at Marchee.
                                 PETER
                        You should hold on to something.

                                 MARCHEE
                        I think I’ll be fine.

                                 PETER
                        I would really recommend it.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Noted, thank you.

           Peter chuckles to himself and holds the laptop tight.

                                 PETER
                        All right then.

           He hits ENTER and --

           The elevator DROPS LIKE A STONE, vaulting them both a few 
           inches off the ground.  Marchee SCREAMS --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           The ELEVATOR GRAPHIC on the diagram DROPS RAPIDLY --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - ELEVATOR - SAME

           Peter types again and the elevator slows to a stop.  Marchee 
           calms down, panting.  Exhilarated.

                                 PETER
                        Told you we could have more fun.

           Marchee looks at him, smirk growing on her face.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Want to see something better?

           Off Peter, pleased --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           Gargantuan self-parking monstrosity.  Peter and Marchee 
           wander the aisles packed with thousands of cars with out-of-
           state plates, footsteps CLACKING on the concrete.

                                 PETER
                        What was I supposed to say?

                                 MARCHEE
                        I don’t know, maybe ‘No, stranger, 
                        you can’t sleep in my room’.  Like 
                        a normal person.
                                 PETER
                        That would necessitate being a 
                        normal person.

           Marchee side-eyes him.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What kind of person are you?

                                 PETER
                        Feigning ignorance is unbecoming.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Everyone lies on the internet.  Who 
                        they are, what they do.  How they 
                        feel.  Ah, there.

           Marchee gestures to a car on Peter’s side of the aisle -- a 
           new BLACK BMW.

           She pulls a STRANGE KEY from her backpack, INSERTS it into 
           the door, and CLICKS the button without turning.  The car 
           unlocks with a BEEP and she hops in the driver's seat.

                                 PETER
                        But you sent me a real picture.

           She ignores him.  He walks to the passenger side --

           INT. BMW / EXT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Peter falls into the passenger seat next to her.  She's 
           pulling a NETBOOK and CABLES out of her backpack.

                                 PETER
                        The picture you sent was really 
                        you, so what are you lying about?

                                 MARCHEE
                        What are you lying about?

           A hesitation --

                                 PETER
                        That’s not an answer at all.

           Marchee reaches under the steering wheel and removes a PANEL.

           She plugs a CABLE into the exposed electronics as Peter goes 
           on the offensive --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        People lie face to face too.  The 
                        medium doesn't change the message.
                                 MARCHEE
                        The medium is context, and context 
                        changes everything.

           Marchee opens the netbook and starts typing something.  Peter 
           watches her, unsure of what she’s doing.

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        Are you ready?

                                 PETER
                        I don’t know what I’m supposed to 
                        be ready for.

           Marchee types into a COMMAND PROMPT WINDOW and hits ENTER 
           dramatically.  The BMW engine ROARS to life.  Marchee beams 
           with pride, and Peter finally realizes what's going on as she 
           hands him the netbook.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You're stealing this car.

                                 MARCHEE
                        We’re stealing this car.  “Gear 
                        slash reverse”.  Type.

           Peter stares at her, suddenly in over his head.  She waits 
           for him, excited, oblivious to his discomfort.

           He looks down at the netbook.  The CURSOR blinks back at him.

           Peter still hesitates.  Marchee gives him a reassuring nod, 
           and he types "GEAR/REVERSE" into the command prompt window 
           and hits ENTER.

           ON THE DASHBOARD, the GEAR INDICATOR moves from “P” to “R”.  
           Whoa.

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        Now hit the back arrow.

                                 PETER
                        How did you do this?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Back arrow.

           Peter complies, cautiously, and the car LURCHES BACKWARD.  
           Marchee's overjoyed --

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        There you go.  Now the left arrow.

           Peter hits the LEFT ARROW and watches the STEERING WHEEL TURN 
           ITSELF, right in front of her.

           Holy shit.
           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The BMW jerks backward from the parking spot again, then 
           stops just as suddenly.  Then another stutter, pulling out of 
           the space --

           INT. BMW / EXT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

                                 PETER
                        I don’t understand how this is 
                        possible.

                                 MARCHEE
                        New cars are just six computers.  
                        Engine, brakes, power steering... 
                        everything’s drive-by-wire.

           Marchee reaches over and buckles Peter’s seat belt with the 
           lap belt OVER HIS WRISTS.  Pinned to the netbook in his lap.  
           She YANKS the strap so it LOCKS --

                                 PETER
                        Hey --

                                 MARCHEE
                        Each floor you get down without 
                        hitting anything, you get a point.  
                        Every time you crash or bump or 
                        scrape something, I get a point.  
                        Five floors, five possible points.

           Peter stares at her for a moment.

                                 PETER
                        Why?

                                 MARCHEE
                             (broad grin)
                        Not an interesting question.  Gear 
                        slash drive.  Go.

           Peter understands: “why” isn’t the point.  He types and the 
           TRANSMISSION SHIFTS AGAIN.  He taps the UP and RIGHT arrows 
           and the car lurches forward...

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - RAMP - NIGHT

           The BMW lurches down a ramp, speeding up and slowing down, 
           rounding the corner...

           INT. BMW / EXT. PARKING GARAGE - SAME

           Marchee watches Peter concentrate.  He’s trying not to pick 
           up too much speed, and as a result they’re both jerking back 
           and forth in their seats.  Marchee’s not impressed, but 
           technically Peter makes it to the next floor.
                                 PETER
                        First point for me.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Minimum speed of ten miles an hour 
                        or you lose the rest by default.

                                 PETER
                        No no no, you didn’t say --

           Without hesitation, Marchee leans over and TYPES.  The car 
           LURCHES FASTER --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, uh -- hey --

           The BMW drifts to the left.  Peter types but overcorrects, 
           the wheel turning too much to the right --

                                 MARCHEE
                        No braking --

           He’s coming up on an EXPENSIVE CAR at the end of the row, 
           just before the next ramp --

           Peter TYPES FRANTICALLY and the wheels spins back to the 
           left.  TIRES SQUEAL as the BMW speeds down the ramp, but it 
           doesn’t have the proper angle and THUNK --

           The car hits the wall and STOPS.  They weren’t going fast 
           enough to cause much damage, but it’s still an accident.

           Shit.

           Marchee reaches over and clicks his seatbelt, which slides 
           back into place -- releasing his hands.

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        One-one.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BMW / EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           The (slightly damaged) BMW zooms through the garage, 
           squealing around corners and accelerating down ramps.  
           They're laughing, pointing, having fun.

           A PEDESTRIAN jumps out of the way as the car flies around a 
           blind corner --

           INT. BMW / EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

           The BMW squeals around another corner and approaches the exit 
           at the bottom.  Peter hits keys to stop the car at the 
           threshold, grinning ear to ear.
                                 PETER
                        And... winner.

           Marchee's not happy about it.  The competitive streak runs 
           deep.  Peter sees her pouting, asks --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you get involved with Crown?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Same as you.  Money.

                                 PETER
                        I’m not here for the money.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Neither am I.
                             (gets an idea)
                        Want to try your luck outside?

                                 PETER
                        No no no.  I made it to the bottom 
                        and that’s what you said.

           Marchee looks at him, gives him a crooked smile, earnest --

                                 MARCHEE
                        You're not having fun?  We could 
                        bet on it.

                                 PETER
                        Bet what?  I already won.

           Marchee looks at him for a moment, then reaches down and 
           STRIPS OFF HER SHIRT.

                                 MARCHEE
                        I believe in second chances.

           He looks at her, stunned.

                                 PETER
                        This is not a good idea.

           He hits the UP and RIGHT ARROWS and the BMW squeals out of 
           the garage --

           INT. BMW / EXT. CAESARS CASINO DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- and out into the wet night.  An incoming car HONKS AND 
           SWERVES as Peter struggles to get the BMW into a lane.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Easy tiger -- there you go.  Cars 
                        move out here.
                                 PETER
                        I see the cars, thank you.

           Peter makes another right on to --

           INT. BMW / EXT. ATLANTIC AVE - CONTINUOUS

           The main drag.  Peter changes lanes, the BMW flying through 
           traffic on Atlantic.  Marchee PUTS HER HAND ON HIS KNEE and 
           he notices, hesitating before weaving around a BUS, still 
           going too fast.

           Peter levels out, Marchee's hand still on his leg.  Nervous, 
           he says the first thing that pops into his head --

                                 PETER
                        How do you bypass the controls?

                                 MARCHEE
                        That’s the best part.  There's no 
                        auth protocol, so you can either 
                        just plug in or --

           She reaches through the seats and rummages through her 
           backpack.  She BUMPS the steering wheel as Peter tries to 
           drive --

                                 PETER
                        Hey, careful --

                                 MARCHEE
                        The idiots left an exploit in the 
                        radio receiver.

           Marchee comes back with a small POLICE-ISSUE RADIO.

                                 PETER
                             (looking at her CB)
                        Is that a police scanner?  Where 
                        did you get --

                                 MARCHEE
                        Watch it!

           Peter looks back to see a CAR PULL OUT right in front of him.  
           He swerves around, prompting a BARRAGE OF HONKS from a CAB he 
           cut off.  Peter speeds up --

                                 PETER
                        Shit --

           He changes lanes again to avoid a car in front of him --

                                 MARCHEE
                        The light the light --
           The STOPLIGHT up ahead just turned YELLOW.  Peter jams on the 
           DOWN ARROW, but the car’s going too fast on the wet street --

                                 PETER
                        Shit shit shit --

           The TIRES LOCK and the BMW starts drifting sideways.  Marchee 
           tries to yank on the wheel but it won’t budge --

           The traffic light turns RED, but the BMW’s skidding 
           uncontrollably toward the intersection --

           Cross traffic starts moving.  Peter’s a deer in the 
           headlights.  Marchee grabs the laptop --

           CARS HONK AND SWERVE as the Beemer skids into the 
           intersection --

           Marchee types a command and the BRAKES DISENGAGE, wheels 
           suddenly spinning as the BMW LURCHES FORWARD, effectively 
           having made a left-hand turn.

           INT. BMW / EXT. SMALLER STREET - CONTINUOUS

           They continue down the street, panting.  Marchee tosses the 
           netbook back on Peter's lap and takes the wheel.

                                 PETER
                        Fuck.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Yeah.

           WOOP-WOOP.  Lights.  Peter turns -- an ATLANTIC CITY POLICE 
           CRUISER.

                                 PETER
                        Fuck.

           They drive in silence for another moment as the red and blue 
           lights wash over them.  Marchee’s breathing starts to get 
           faster.  Panicked.

           Peter looks over his shoulder again at the flashing cruiser, 
           then grabs the CB radio from the floor.  He flicks it on, 
           scanning frequencies until --

                                 POLICE (RADIO)
                        -- six eight one, repeat, I need a 
                        10-14.  It’s a black beemer.

           Peter thinks for a moment, then looks out the window --

                                 PETER
                        What's that say on the sign?
                                 MARCHEE
                        What's what say?

           Peter reaches into his pocket and comes up with his OLD 
           SILVER CELLPHONE.  He dials...

                                 PETER
                        The address, what's the address?

           The line picks up --

                                                         MARCHEE
                     OPERATOR (PHONE)
           Nine-one-one emergency 
           response.
                                                (squinting)
                                              One-eighty north 
                                              Pennsylvania.

           Peter suddenly screams, startling Marchee --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Fuck he's got a gun!  He's got 
                        Steve he's gonna kill him!

                                 OPERATOR (PHONE)
                        Sir?  Sir what's your address?

                                 PETER
                        One-eighty north Penn, please god 
                        he's gonna shoot --

           Peter hangs up the phone.  Marchee looks at him like he's 
           insane.  A beat, then:

                                 DISPATCH (RADIO)
                        All units please respond to one-

                        ten-fifty-nine in progress.  Repeat 
                        all units please respond.

           As Peter concentrates on the radio, Marchee notices the cell 
           phone in his hands -- it’s SILVER.  Different.  Not the black 
           one she saw before.  She realizes he has another cellphone.

                                 POLICE (RADIO)
                        Copy dispatch, fifty four 
                        responding.

           Behind them, the cruiser peels off and screams into a nearby 
           parking lot.

           Marchee looks at the SILVER PHONE in Peter’s hand.  Peter 
           looks back at the cruiser screeching into the parking lot, 
           oblivious to his error.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. SIDE ROAD - DAWN

           The BMW pulls to a stop on a deserted side road.

           INT. BMW / EXT. SIDE ROAD - DAWN

           Marchee turns off the car and pulls her shirt back on.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Give it to me.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Give me that fucking phone.

           Peter looks down and sees the SILVER PHONE in his lap.  Shit.  
           He hands it over.

           She scrolls through the RECENT CALLS, sees names like "Anna" 
           and some 212 numbers.  One has been called a few times.  She 
           dials, puts the phone up to her ear.

           It rings.  Peter watches, nervous.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
                             (Chinese accent)
                        Great Wall Chinese can I help you?

           Not what Marchee was expecting.  She recovers --

                                 MARCHEE
                        Yeah, hi, I'd like to make an order 
                        for delivery.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (PHONE)
                        Of course can I get your phone 
                        number?

           Marchee hangs up --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - DUBLONSKI'S ROOM - SAME

           Dublonski holds her phone out in the air.  Rick sits at the 
           desk, the surveillance equipment set up there.  They both 
           look exhausted from the long night of listening in.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Was that racist?

                                 RICK
                        Little bit.
           INT. BMW / EXT. SIDE ROAD - SAME

           Marchee thinks for a moment, makes a decision.  She removes 
           the back from the phone and TAKES OUT THE BATTERY.  She looks 
           at the dead phone for another moment, then --

           SMASHES it on the steering wheel.  SMASHES it again.  And 
           again and again until it's a plastic mess and she's panting.

           She hands Peter back the destroyed phone.  He looks at her, 
           concerned.  She’s afraid.

                                 MARCHEE
                             (as if it's an 
                              explanation)
                        Police can trace the number from 
                        the 9-1-1 call.

                                 PETER
                        I know.

           Marchee sits in silence for a moment.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Give me your other phone.  The 
                        black one.

           Peter digs it out of his pocket and hands it over without 
           protest.  Marchee rolls down the window and TOSSES it out.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Dublonski and Rick hear the phone CLATTER ON THE PAVEMENT.  
           Not good.  They grab their jackets and run out --

           INT. BMW / EXT SIDE ROAD - DAWN

           Marchee rolls the window back up.  Peter’s trying to figure 
           out how to explain this situation when --

                                 MARCHEE
                        Did he put you up to this?

                                 PETER
                        Who?  What?

           Nervous, Marchee begins grabbing her things from the car.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Marchee what are you talking about?

           Marchee whips to Peter, suddenly stern --

                                 MARCHEE
                        I need to find Crown.  Okay?  I 
                        need to meet him.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCHEE (CONT'D)
                        So if that other phone ever comes 
                        up again, I’ve never heard of it.
                             (looks around)
                        I never saw you after the meeting.

           She gets out of the car and takes off running.  Peter watches 
           her go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SIDE ROAD - MORNING

           Peter leans against the back of the BMW as a TOWNCAR skids to 
           a stop.  Dublonski and Rick hop out, guns ready.  Marchee’s 
           nowhere in sight.

           Dublonski and Rick see Peter’s safe and lower their weapons.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        What happened?

           INT. DUMPY DINER - MORNING

           Dublonski and Rick sit across a booth from Peter.  They're 
           the only people inside, save for a DISINTERESTED WAITRESS 
           mainlining coffee behind the cash register.

           Rick and Peter are both appealing to Dublonski --

                                 RICK
                        We have to call it off.

                                 PETER
                        She doesn’t think I’m a Fed --

                                 RICK
                        What the hell else could she think?

                                 PETER
                        I don’t know.  She was scared.  She 
                        was scared of Crown.

                                 RICK
                        That’s not our problem.  We can 
                        arrest four hackers right now plus 
                        the Conficker controller.

           Peter scoffs --

                                 PETER
                        You won’t get the Conficker logins.  
                        Or Crown.

                                 RICK
                        Who gives a shit about Crown?  He’s 
                        probably some Hungarian teenager, 
                        that’s why he’s not here.
                                 PETER
                        Marchee was scared.  I’ve never 
                        seen her like that.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        How much have you seen her?

           Peter and Rick are both surprised by Dublonski’s entry into 
           the conversation.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I had to pull out my big book of 
                        scary threats to get you down here, 
                        and now we’re giving you an out and 
                        you don’t want it.

                                 PETER
                        The situation changed.

           Dublonski knows exactly what he means.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        What’s your big idea?

                                 PETER
                        Crown said he’d be in touch again 
                        once we have the logins.  You keep me 
                        undercover for a couple weeks and I 
                        can lead you to him.

           Dublonski nods, considering.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Rick’s right.  I don’t give a shit 
                        about Crown right now.
                             (turns to Rick)
                        But I do need to shut down 
                        Conficker.  So we stay the course 
                        and round everybody up right after 
                        the logins are secure.

                                 PETER
                        This is the most myopic bullshit --

           Dublonski loses her patience, hisses --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Hey.  We had an arrangement.  The 
                        fact this hacker girl swells your 
                        nether parts doesn’t change the 
                        fact that you do what I say or 
                        there’s 30 years of solitude 
                        waiting for you in New York.

                        Come on.  You’re going to be late.

           Off Peter, a sinking feeling in his stomach --

                                                                CUT TO:

           A LAPTOP’S OPENED.  FINGERS CLICK OVER KEYS.  LIGHTS BLINK.  
           FANS WHIR.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        This is how you hack an ATM.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - DAY

           Peter and Marchee walk through the crowded gambling floor, 
           weaving through COCKTAIL WAITRESSES and DRUNK GAMBLERS.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        First thing to know is there are 62  
                        companies that produce ATMs in the 
                        United States, and each make and 
                        model uses a slightly different 
                        interface and operating system.  So 
                        you have to know exactly which 
                        machine you’re trying to crack if 
                        you expect to have any success.

           Peter and Marchee approach a STANDALONE ATM next to a pillar.  
           Peter uses one hand to shade his eyes, and covers the BUILT-
           IN CAMERA with the other.

           Marchee kneels next to the machine like she’s tying her shoe.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        ATM software has barely any 
                        security, authentication protocols, 
                        or remove overrides.  If you have a 
                        decent understanding of OS 
                        mechanics, a couple hours with J-
                        TAG should be enough to code 
                        something that’ll do just fine.

           Marchee takes a BOBBY PIN and POPS OPEN a panel on the side 
           of the ATM, just slightly, making sure to cover what she’s 
           doing from the cameras overhead.

           She plugs in a USB THUMB DRIVE --

                        Physical security isn’t much 
                        better.  While the cash sits inside 
                        a fire-proof steel safe, the CPU is 
                        protected by the same kind of lock 
                        they use on toilet paper dispensers 
                        in public bathrooms.

           Dublonski and Rick settle in to their posts in the 
           surveillance room.  ON A MONITOR, it looks like Marchee is 
           kneeling as Peter uses the ATM.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        If you wrote your code right, the 
                        ATM’s hardware should recognize it 
                        as a system update and accept any 
                        special commands you insert without 
                        so much as an error report.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - SAME

           Marchee stands and she and Peter walk away, blending in the 
           general hubbub in the casino.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        And that’s it.  Abracadabra.  
                        You’re now the proud owner of a 
                        shiny new money machine.  You can 
                        make withdrawals, transfer funds...

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - CAFE - DAY

           Peter and Marchee join Teknine and Elix at a table in a hotel 
           cafe.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Or you can do something a little 
                        more fun.

           Marchee opens her laptop, types a few commands.

           Peter looks at the camera on the ceiling -- he knows 
           Dublonski is watching.  He turns his attention to Marchee as 
           she concentrates on typing a last line of code.

           Marchee hits ENTER with a flourish, looks up.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Okay.

           She looks up at Peter.  They lock eyes for a moment, a shared 
           secret between them.

                                 ELIX
                        Any foreseeable problems?

           Elix has caught them staring at each other.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           A door opens and the BLONDE MAN FROM THE PICTURE steps out.  
           He walks past Ramsey, who's leaning against the wall checking 
           his phone, messenger bag slung over his shoulder.

           He hits send on a text message: INCOMING

           As soon as the Blonde Man rounds the corner to the elevators, 
           Ramsey approaches the door.  Out of his bag, he pulls what 
           looks like a WHITE BOARD MARKER.

           He fishes under the bottom of the lock and pulls a PLASTIC 
           PLUG from a small hole.  He uncaps the marker, revealing a 
           METAL CONTACT instead of ink, and sticks it into the hole.

           After a moment, the lock makes a SATISFYING BEEP and the 
           LIGHT turns GREEN.  Ramsey opens the door --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - BLONDE MAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- and takes quick stock of the room.  It's tidy.  A few 
           clothes in a suitcase, toiletries in the bathroom.

           Ramsey opens the closet door, revealing a HOTEL SAFE.  He 
           removes TWO PAPERCLIPS from of his pocket and sticks one in a 
           SMALL HOLE under the electronic lock.

           He presses in and twists and...

           The LED LIGHTS flash and the lock GROANS.  It’s unlocked.  
           Ramsey pulls open the safe --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - DAY

           Downstairs, the elevator doors open and the Blonde Man steps 
           out.  Elix spots him from across the room, phone to his ear.

                                 ELIX
                        You’re sure.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - BLONDE MAN'S ROOM - SAME

           Ramsey is on the other end of the line, rifling through the 
           meager contents of the safe.

                                 RAMSEY
                        Got a laptop and some bigger 
                        drives, but that’s it.  He’s got to 
                        have it on him.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - SAME

           Elix picks a trajectory to walk toward the Blonde Man.
                                 ELIX
                             (into phone)
                        Alright.  Pack it in.

           He makes eye contact with Peter and Marchee, sitting at SLOT 
           MACHINES on another part of the floor.  He hangs up and DUMPS 
           HIS PHONE IN A TRASH CAN as he approaches the Blonde Man.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                             (to Blonde Man)
                        James.  James!

           The Blonde Man turns to see Elix rushing towards him.  He 
           looks around -- is he talking to me?  Elix reaches him --

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        Richard Chambers.  We met yesterday 
                        at lockpick village?

           Elix's way of speaking has changed.  It's faster, looser, 
           more colloquial.

                                 BLONDE MAN
                        You must be thinking of someone 
                        else --

                                 ELIX
                        No, no, James.  I'm Richard, 
                        remember?

           The Blonde Man starts fiddling with his KEY RING -- his 
           nervous habit.

                                 BLONDE MAN
                        I don't think we met --

                                 ELIX
                        'Course we did, of course.  Look, 
                        hey, maybe you can help me out 
                        because I'm in a little bit of a 
                        jam here.  I've been looking for a 
                        friendly face for the past half 
                        hour.  My phone died and I'm 
                        supposed to meet my wife and I 
                        can't reach her.

                        I'm sorry --

           The Blonde Man tries to walk past, but Elix gracefully steps 
           into his path.

                                 ELIX
                        It'll just take a second.

           Peter and Marchee watch Elix try to work the Blonde Man.  He 
           clearly doesn't want to let Elix use his phone.

                                 MARCHEE
                        He's not giving it up.

           Peter looks up at the DOME CAMERA, makes a decision.

                                 PETER
                        Set them off.

                        I'm supposed to wait until Elix has

                        Just do it now.  Trust me.

           Peter starts to walk off.  Marchee types on her laptop.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - NEAR ATM - SAME

           AN IMPATIENT GAMBLER stands at an ATM, hitting the buttons 
           along the side of the screen to complete his transaction.  
           After a second, the SCREEN GOES BLANK.

           The Gambler reacts, then hits a button.  Nothing.  He hits 
           another button, then starts frantically pushing them all as 
           fast as he can.

           Something RATTLES deep inside the machine.  The Gambler 
           stops, curious, as the RATTLING noise increases...

           The SLOT OPENS and the machine starts EJECTING MONEY like a 
           fire hose.  Twenties pelting him in the stomach.

           The Gambler is stunned for a moment, then bends down and 
           begins SCOOPING up as many bills as he can.

           ACROSS THE ROOM: another ATM starts SPEWING MONEY.

           A CROWD starts to gather, with people looking up from their 
           slots and tables and wandering closer to the money fountains.

           INT. CAESAR'S CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - SAME

           Elix and the Blonde Man watch the gathering crowd.  It's 
           starting to get violent as people jostle for position.

           WHAM --

           Peter slams into the Blonde Man and sends them both tumbling 
           to the ground.  Peter helps him up --

           A THIRD ATM starts dispensing MONEY.  Peter and Elix make 
           brief eye contact, then Peter takes off across the room.

                                 ELIX
                        Aaron, please, my wife's waiting.

           Anxious, the Blonde Man turns back to Elix and hands over the 
           phone as chaos erupts around them.

           Word of the ATMs has spread into the cafe, and Peter

           with his laptop.

           He plops the BLONDE MAN'S THUMB DRIVE on the table.  Keeps 
           the rest of the keys.

           Peter waits impatiently for Teknine as the cafe area is abuzz 
           with news of the ATM "malfunction".

           There's a CHIME on Teknine's computer.  He leans back and 
           looks at the screen, amazed.

                                 PETER

           Closer than Teknine knows.  Peter looks at the LINES OF CODE.  
           Ultimate power disguised as run-of-the-mill software.

                                 PETER
                        Just change the logins.

           Teknine takes a deep breath, drunk with power.  He sobers up 
           and leans in to type.

                                 TEKNINE
                        Yeah.

                        Thanks again so much James.

           As the Blonde Man puts his phone in his pocket, he absent-
           mindedly reaches to touch his keyring, but realizes it's 
           gone.  He realizes what happened, GRABS Elix’s shirt --

           Dublonski watches Peter and Marchee have their quiet 
           conversation.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        What's he saying?  Turn that up.

           Rick turns up their speaker -- still can't hear their 
           argument.  It's too loud in the chaotic casino.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - CAFE - SAME

           Teknine sits over his computer, waiting.  A window POPS UP on 
           the screen:

                                   NEW LOGINS APPROVED

           He taps the trackpad with his thumb, and --

                                       UPLOADING...

           Teknine looks up to where Peter was waiting and sees that 
           he's gone.  He panics, looks around.  Then he types another 
           command and --

                                     UPLOAD CANCELLED

           He studies the TABLE OF LOGINS for a moment, mouthing to 
           himself.  Memorizing.

           Then he hits another button --

                                SECURE DEGAUSSING COMPLETE

           He closes his laptop and stands to go, checking to see if 
           anyone's watching him --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Rick sees Teknine get up from the table in the monitor --

                                 RICK
                        He's walking away.

           Dublonski watches Peter and Marchee in another monitor, still 
           talking quietly.  Psychically begging Peter to give them a 
           signal.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - ACROSS THE GAMBLING FLOOR - SAME

           Marchee's arguing --
                                 MARCHEE
                        You’re supposed to wait until he's 
                        done --

                                 PETER
                        We don't have time.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What are you talking about?

           Peter looks back up at the DOME CAMERA, anxious.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           Rick watches Teknine snake his way through the casino.

                                 RICK
                        We're losing him.  Mary.

           Rick looks at Dublonski for guidance, but she's stoic.  
           Doesn't want this to be true.  Doesn't want to admit she's 
           losing control.

           On the monitor, Teknine walks through the crowd...

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Mary.

           Rick can't wait any longer.  He picks up a radio --

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Send in tactical.  Now.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - GAMBLING FLOOR - DAY

           FBI SWAT floods the gambling floor, forcing their way through 
           the crowds still fighting over the LOOSE BILLS and heading 
           toward's Peter and Marchee's position.

           Peter yanks her up --

                                 PETER
                        We have to go now.

           Marchee turns and sees the SWAT officers.  She looks at 
           Peter, confused --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (pulling her away)
                        Come on.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

           Rick barks orders into the radio as he tracks Peter and 
           Marchee on the monitor --
                                 RICK
                        They're heading for the pit.  Lock 
                        it down, no one in or out.

           Rick looks over to another MONITOR and sees Teknine walking 
           briskly, carrying a bag over his shoulder --

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Get someone to the skybridge now, 
                        suspect "Teknine" is almost clear 
                        of the building --

           Dublonski watches everything, paralyzed.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SKYBRIDGE - SAME

           Teknine heads toward the end of the elevated walkway.  He 
           looks over his shoulder to make sure no one's following --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PIT - DAY

           Peter and Marchee push their way through the frenzied crowd.

           Peter turns to see SWAT officers rounding the corner, 
           scanning for them.  Clearly getting assistance from cameras.

                                 PETER
                        We have to split up.  Keep your 
                        head down and meet me at the 
                        souvenir shop on Atlantic and 
                        Delaware.

           Before Marchee can respond Peter TAKES OFF TO THE RIGHT, 
           drawing SWAT’s attention.  They run after him, shoving people 
           out of the way.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PIER SHOPS - DAY

           Peter and Marchee SPRINT through the high-end shopping mall.

           Confused shoppers scatter as they weave through the crowd, 
           SWAT officers a dozen yards behind, knocking people over as 
           they bulldoze through the heavily-populated shopping area.

           SUDDENLY --

           Peter’s YANKED sideways into a DESIGNER STORE --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PIER SHOPS - SOAP STORE - CONTINUOUS

           -- by Marchee, who ushers him toward a SERVICE ENTRANCE in 
           the back.

                                 MARCHEE
                        You knew this was going bad.
                                 PETER
                        What?

           Peter looks back toward the entrance as the SWAT officers RUN 
           PAST.  Marchee pulls him into the employees-only back room --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PIER SHOPS - STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

           Marchee holds Peter just inside the door.  He looks through 
           the door’s cut-out window, anxious.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What’s my dog’s name?

                                 PETER
                        Your dog’s name?

                                 MARCHEE
                        On IRC I said I had a dog and I 
                        told you it’s name.  What did I 
                        say?

           Peter’s heart starts beating fast.  Out the window a SWAT 
           officer has returned to the front of the store.

                                 PETER
                             (taking a chance)
                        You don’t have a dog.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Doesn’t matter.  We talked about my 
                        fake dog for an hour, you’d 
                        remember.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, the SWAT officer talks to a SHOPPER 
           (female).  She points toward the employees-only area --

                                 PETER
                        I... I don’t know.  Marchee we have 
                        to go.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Who are you?

           The SWAT officer approaches the back room...

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        Who are you working for?  FBI?

           The officer’s almost there.  Peter takes a chance --

                                 PETER
                        I was.  Until I warned you to run.

           Marchee stares at him for a second, not wanting to believe 
           it, then hears the DOOR OPEN --
           She turns --

           The SWAT officer’s startled to see them so close.  They look 
           at each other for a half beat...

           Peter and Marchee BOLT.  The SWAT officer SCRAMBLES after 
           them --

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PIER SHOPS - SERVICE HALLWAYS - DAY

           Peter and Marchee sprint through the twisty, narrow halls, 
           the SWAT officer on their tail, yelling into his radio --

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Got two of them running through the 
                        back halls of the mall thing --

           Peter and Marchee make a SHARP RIGHT through some service 
           doors --

           EXT. CAESARS CASINO - LOADING DOCK - DAY

           They run out into a loading dock area, the lone SWAT Officer 
           chasing behind --

           SCREEEE --

           In front of them -- a BLACK TOWNCAR screeches around a 
           corner, heading straight toward them.

           Peter and Marchee both stare for a moment, deer in headlights 
           as it races closer.

           They look back -- the SWAT officer's closing in fast.  They 
           turn and run towards him -- better chance of getting by him 
           than the car.

           VRRRM --

           The towncar weaves to the left, NARROWLY MISSING Peter, 
           before pulling a HARD RIGHT -- cutting them off from the SWAT 
           officer.

           Peter and Marchee both skid to a stop as the passenger window 
           rolls down --

           Elix.  Ramsey in the driver's seat.

                                 ELIX
                        Get in.

           Marchee and Peter look at each other for just a moment, then 
           pile in as Ramsey steps on the gas.  The SWAT officer aims 
           his gun, but decides not to fire.  He gets on his radio --
                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Suspects hopped in an unmarked 
                        black Lincoln heading toward...

                              know where he is)
                        Shit.

           Rick's frantic, yelling --

                        Give me a half mile lockdown in all 
                        directions now --

           INT. TOWNCAR / EXT. ATLANTIC CITY STREETS - DAY

           The towncar SQUEALS out on to the street.  Elix leans through 
           the gap in the seats --

                                 ELIX
                        Where's Teknine?

                                 PETER
                        I don't know.

           Elix and Ramsey look at each other.  Peter tries to read 
           Marchee's face -- what’s she thinking?

           An Atlantic City Police cruiser screams past going the other 
           direction, lights flashing and siren blaring.

           Peter watches through the back window as it pulls a SHARP 
           LEFT and BLOCKS OFF an intersection.

           They made it past the lockdown.

           EXT. CAESARS PALACE - BUS LOBBY - DAY

           Teknine walks down the stairs to the bus lobby, head on a 
           swivel.  He grips his bag tighter.

           After a few more steps, it becomes apparent the crowd is 
           thinning.  Compared to the chaos of the gambling floor, in 
           here it's almost... eerie.

           Teknine slows down.  Everyone has disappeared from sight.  He 
           gets a very bad feeling about this...

           FBI SWAT OFFICERS swarm in from everywhere at once, assault 
           rifles drawn, as Teknine sinks to the ground and puts his 
           hands on the back of his head.

           Dublonski's watching the scene unfold on the monitors, biting 
           her thumb nail.  Rick scans monitors, pissed.  They’re gone.

                        Should have shut this down when you

           Ramsey snakes his way through Atlantic City, obeying every 
           traffic law to the letter.  They listen to POLICE RADIO 
           CHATTER in silence.  Elix works on a CELLULAR-CONNECTED 
           LAPTOP.

           Ramsey reaches over and clicks off the radio.  Silence in the 
           car for a moment.

                                 MARCHEE
                        We need to find Crown.  Tell him

           The towncar makes a right into an underground garage.

           INT. TOWNCAR / INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

           Daylight disappears as the car drives deeper.  Peter's 
           getting even more nervous.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What are we doing down here?

                                 ELIX
                        There are six northbound toll 
                        booths between here and Manhattan.  
                        They're looking for a black town 
                        car with no plates, it won't be 
                        hard to spot us.
                                 MARCHEE
                        What's in Manhattan?

           Ramsey pulls into an empty space, turns off the engine.

                                 ELIX
                        If the FBI has Teknine, that's 
                        where they'll take him.  Wait here.

           Elix gets out and Ramsey follows, leaving Peter and Marchee 
           alone in the back seat.  After a moment:

                                 MARCHEE
                        I need to know exactly who you are 
                        right now.

                                 PETER
                        Marchee please --

                                 MARCHEE
                        You don’t get to lie anymore.  Not 
                        to me.

           Peter looks at Elix and Ramsey talking out the window, knows 
           what he has to do.

                                 PETER
                        My name is Peter Shay.  I live in

                        broke down the door of her split 
                        level and arrested me in her 
                        kitchen, and every day since I’ve 
                        been helping FBI cybercrime in 
                        exchange for time off what’s 
                        expected to be a very long sentence.

                        Where’s Keith Garrett?

                                 PETER
                        Federal prison.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Did you help put him there?

           Peter doesn’t answer, but Marchee doesn’t need him to.  She 
           wrestles with what to do with this knowledge.  

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        Why would you throw out your deal 
                        for someone you don’t even know?

                                 PETER
                        Because you shouldn’t have to pay for 
                        my mistake.
           Marchee looks out the window, thinking.  Elix and Ramsey chat 
           a short distance away.

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Elix and Ramsey are huddled, facing away from the car.

                                 ELIX
                        We can't take the risk.

                                 RAMSEY
                        They're a couple kids.  This is 
                        really how you want to handle it?

                                 ELIX
                        It's not that I want to.

           Ramsey sighs, looks back at the car.  Hard to see inside with 
           the glare from the overhead fluorescents.  He hands Elix 
           another set of CAR KEYS.

                                 RAMSEY
                        Van's two levels down.  I'll meet 
                        you outside.

           Elix leans in and KISSES Ramsey.  Passionate.

           INT. TOWNCAR / INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Marchee and Peter both react to the kiss -- whoa.  Elix 
           squeezes Ramsey’s shoulder, then heads toward the stairs.

                                 PETER
                        We can still get out of this.  
                        Together.

           Marchee turns to look at Peter, unsure.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        They want to head right back to the 
                        FBI an you know we can’t do that.

           Peter grabs her hand, and she lets him.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        The only leverage left is Crown.  We 
                        track him down and we have something 
                        to trade.  We can still get out of 
                        this.

           Marchee considers, wondering how much she can trust him.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Do you hear what I’m saying?
                             (no response)
                        Marchee.
           Peter sees motion out the window --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Down!

           Peter YANKS Marchee to the floor of the car as --

           BANG-CRASH-BANG!  TWO BULLETS SHATTER THE WINDOW as GLASS 
           RAINS DOWN on Peter's back --

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Ramsey holds the smoking gun.  SIX-SHOT REVOLVER.  He looks 
           for motion in the car, sees none.  He approaches, slowly, gun 
           still aimed...

           INT. TOWNCAR - SAME

           Peter lays on top of Marchee on the floor of the car, between 
           the seats.  They're facing away from the window Ramsey shot 
           through.

                                 PETER
                             (whispering)
                        Are you okay?

           Marchee nods, terrified.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                             (still whispering)
                        I'm going to open the door.  Stay 
                        put no matter what I say, alright?

           Marchee nods again.  Peter reaches for the handle, opens it, 
           and SHOVES the door open with his hand --

           BANG-CRASH!  More glass rains down --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Go!  Run run run!

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Ramsey hears the yell and runs around the back, hoping to 
           head them off --

           But nobody's there.  The other door opens and Peter and 
           Marchee spill out, catching Ramsey out of position.  Ramsey 
           takes aim through the car again --

           BANG!  Glass SHATTERS on ANOTHER CAR, setting off a CAR 
           ALARM.  It ECHOES through the garage.

           Peter and Marchee stay low, weaving between cars.  They have 
           to yell over the ALARM --
                                 PETER
                        Can you start one of these?

                                 MARCHEE
                        What?

           Peter grabs her and they both crash down behind a car, 
           several rows between them and Ramsey.

                                 PETER
                        We have to start a car.

                                 MARCHEE
                        I don't have my laptop --

                                 PETER
                        What about an older car?

           ACROSS THE GARAGE

           Ramsey stalks through the rows as the ALARM BLARES.  He scans 
           for movement.

                                 RAMSEY
                             (yelling)
                        Come on kids.  I don't like this 
                        any more than you do.

           BEHIND A CAR

           Peter gets on his knees and peeks through a window, spotting 
           Ramsey still a fair distance away.

                                 MARCHEE
                        That one.

                                 PETER
                             (ducking back down)
                        What?

           Marchee points to a RED FORD BRONCO across the aisle.

                                 MARCHEE
                        My mom used to have a Bronco.

           Peter clocks the admission of personal information, but it's 
           not the time to get into it.

                                 PETER
                        How much time do you need?

                                 MARCHEE
                        Thirty seconds outside, maybe a 
                        minute in.
                                 PETER
                             (that's too long)
                        A minute and a half?

                                 MARCHEE
                        You want to hotwire the car?

                                 PETER
                        Okay, okay.
                             (works up his nerve)
                        Okay.  You ready?

           She nods.  Peter scrambles up from their hiding place and 
           SPRINTS away from the Bronco --

           ACROSS THE GARAGE

           Ramsey sees the movement and tracks it with the gun, but 
           can’t get a good shot.

           Peter stays low between the cars as he runs.  Ramsey realizes 
           it's only Peter running and WHIRLS AROUND --

           Marchee is standing by the door of the Bronco.  Ramsey sees 
           she’s stationary and FIRES --

           BANG-CRASH!  The window EXPLODES by Marchee's head.  She 
           reaches in and UNLOCKS the car, throwing the door open --

           Ramsey runs toward her, angling for a better shot --

           Peter sprints up behind Ramsey and JUMPS on his back, 
           swatting at the gun in his hand.  He misses --

           Ramsey SPINS around mid-stride and FALLS, smashing Peter into 
           the concrete --

           Peter keeps his arm wrapped around Ramsey's neck --

           INT. BRONCO / INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Marchee's under the dash, panel pulled out, rifling through 
           thick bundles of wires.  She finds one she wants and SCRAPES 
           off the rubber coating with her teeth --

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Ramsey ELBOWS Peter in the side as the two struggle on the 
           ground.  Peter SWATS at the revolver again and it skitters 
           across the concrete --

           INT. BRONCO / INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Marchee twists two exposed wires together.  The DASH LIGHTS 
           turn on.  She STRIPS a third wire with her teeth --
           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           The CAR ALARM STOPS.  Odd silence in the garage.

           Ramsey ELBOWS Peter again and scrambles after the gun.

           Peter spins on the concrete and GRABS Ramsey's foot.  Ramsey 
           SLAMS into the concrete again.

           Ramsey KICKS Peter with his free foot and Peter releases --

           INT. BRONCO / INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Marchee touches the third exposed wire to the other two and 
           the engine GROWLS to life.

           She jumps into the driver’s seat and throws the car into 
           reverse, ROARS out of the parking spot on a turn.

           Directly in her headlights is --

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Ramsey, pointing the revolver at Peter.  Both sitting on the 
           floor of the garage.

                                 RAMSEY
                             (doesn't take his eyes off 
                              Peter)
                        Get out of the car, Marchee.

           The only sound is the idling Bronco.  Nobody moves an inch.

                                 PETER
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 RAMSEY
                        FBI SWAT doesn't just hang out at 
                        Caesars.
                             (yelling to Marchee)
                        Get out of the car or I'm putting 
                        air holes in your boyfriend.

           Peter tries another tactic --

                                 PETER
                        They’re chasing us too.  We’re on 
                        the same side here --

           Ramsey laughs, but it’s short lived.

                                 RAMSEY
                             (to Marchee, still looking 
                              at Peter)
                        Get out.  Of the car.
           Marchee TURNS ON THE BRIGHTS.  The sudden light change causes 
           Ramsey to turn to the Bronco --

           Peter seizes on the opportunity and DIVES at Ramsey --

           Ramsey raises the gun --

           BANG!

           Peter falls on Ramsey, grappling with the gun --

           CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- empty.

           INT. BRONCO / INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Marchee pops the transmission in drive and MASHES THE 
           ACCELERATOR, the Bronco heading directly toward Peter and 
           Ramsey as they GRAPPLE --

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME

           Ramsey PUNCHES Peter in the jaw and JUMPS off to one side, 
           Peter rolls the other way.  There's BLOOD on both of them --

           Marchee VEERS the Bronco toward Ramsey and SLAMS ON THE 
           BREAKS, separating him and Peter --

           Peter climbs in the passenger seat and Marchee PEELS OUT 
           before Peter even gets the door closed.

           The Bronco SQUEALS up and a ramp and out of sight as Ramsey 
           watches from the ground.

           EXT. ANOTHER ATLANTIC CITY STREET - DAY

           The Bronco BUMPS out of the garage and rejoins traffic.

           INT. BRONCO / EXT. ANOTHER ATLANTIC CITY STREET - SAME

           Marchee drives as Peter leans against the window, holding his 
           LEFT SIDE.  His shirt’s SOAKED WITH BLOOD.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Jesus, you're shot.

           Peter groans, realizing how much pain he's in now that the 
           adrenaline's wearing off.  He lifts his shirt -- a BLOODY 
           GRAZE, like a deep cut.

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        We have to get to a hospital.

           Peter presses his side and fights through the pain.

                                 PETER
                        No.  They'll find us.
                                 MARCHEE
                        You're bleeding all over the 
                        fucking car.

           Peter grits his teeth --

                                 PETER
                        My sister.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        My sister’s a nurse.

                                 MARCHEE
                        You think the FBI hasn’t already 
                        thought of that?

           Peter takes a few sharp breaths, pressing his already blood-
           soaked shirt harder into his side.

                                 PETER
                        There’s a game store.  There’s a 
                        game store on 6th Ave.

                                 MARCHEE
                             (no idea what he means)
                        A game store?

                                 PETER
                        Fuck.

           Peter doubles over, holding his side.

           Marchee catches his eye.  A moment between them.  Trust.  He 
           closes his eyes as Marchee steps on the gas...

                                                          FADE TO BLACK

           SCREEEEEEE --

           INT. HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dublonski scrapes open a METAL DOOR, a FILE BOX in her arms.  
           Teknine sits at a table handcuffed to a metal loop in the 
           center.  Three empty chairs.

           No windows, so no sense of time, but the expression on 
           Teknine's face indicates he's been there a while.

           Dublonski takes a quick look around the room.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Lawyer's still not here?
           Teknine looks up, says nothing.  Dublonski sits and puts the 
           file box down in front of her.  Opens it.  Straightens the 
           contents.  Checks her watch, exaggerated.  Looks at the door.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        You mind if I just...?

           Teknine remains silent.  She takes that as consent and pulls 
           a YELLOW PAD out of the file box.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)

                        I bet Agent Chan fifty dollars you 
                        memorized it, though.  How’d I do?

           She slides the pad and a pen over to Teknine.  He just stares.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Attorney General's prepared to let 
                        you plead down to misdemeanor 
                        trespassing and all you have to do 
                        is write it down.

           He looks at the pad, then back up to Dublonski.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        How are you feeling, by the way?
                             (still no response)
                        Everything okay with the...

           She vaguely references her own heart.  Teknine registers 
           barely-perceptible surprise.

           Dublonski sees she's on to something, and pulls a THICK 
           MEDICAL FILE from the box.  She opens it --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        There was a boy in my high school, 
                        had a heart problem like yours.  
                        Ghostly pale all the time.  Sick.  
                        One day he just disappeared, no one 
                        knew what happened to him.  Not 
                        sure many people noticed, actually.  
                        Came back a few months later and 
                        his hair was turning gray.  Guess 
                        that happens sometimes after 
                        surgery, it’s how the body 
                        processes the shock.
                             (looks over file, musing)
                        A few kids called him ‘grandpappy’ -- 
                        it was rural Virginia.  Most kids, 
                        though, they just kept ignoring him 
                        like before.  Poor kid.  Spent his 
                        childhood all alone.
           Teknine starts picking at his thumb nail.  Dublonski looks 
           around the empty room, at the empty chair next to him.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Looks like nothing's changed.

           Teknine picks up the pen, considering...

           ... and then puts it back down.  Folds his hands and looks at 
           Dublonski.  Not going to say a word.

           INT. FBI NEW YORK OFFICE - ZALPOWICZ'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dublonski lightly knocks as she enters the stuffy, old-
           fashioned office.  Zalpowicz is behind his enormous desk, 
           facing Rick and another man with his back turned.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Mary.  How about you sit down.

           Dublonski cautiously approaches a third empty chair.  The 
           unknown man turns -- it's Lydekker.

                                 ZALPOWICZ (CONT’D)
                        This is Agent Lydekker.  From the 
                        Puzzle Palace.

           Dublonski sits, suddenly on high alert.  She doesn't like 
           where this is going.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        We're familiar.

           Uncomfortable silence.  Finally:

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Right.  Well.  I just want you to 
                        know before we start I don't have a 
                        choice in this --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Dan.

           She already knows what's coming.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        What do you want me to say?  We 
                        don't know who has access to the 
                        Conficker thing and your undercover 
                        helped three suspects vanish into 
                        thin air.  The director called me 
                        personally to elucidate what a 
                        clusterfuck this whole thing is.

           Dublonski looks at Rick, pointed --
                                 DUBLONSKI
                        We're still sorting out the 
                        situation.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        That's the problem.

           Uncomfortable silence.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Are you taking this away from me?

           He just looks at her.  Nothing else to say.  Lydekker fills 
           the silence --

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Should have just let me handle it 
                        from the start.  Less embarrassing 
                        for everyone.
                             (standing)
                        The moment I walk out that door 
                        this becomes a classified 
                        operation.  No media appearances, 
                        news stories, or mentions of this 
                        to anyone in any department of any 
                        organization for any reason.  Have 
                        someone pack up your files on 
                        Conficker, Crown, and anything else 
                        pertinent and the courier'll come 
                        by in a few hours.  And Mary?

           Dublonski glares daggers as Lydekker puts on his jacket.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        What's yours is mine.  Remember 
                        that.

           Dublonski turns her fury on Zalpowicz, who shrugs helplessly.

           INT. FBI NEW YORK OFFICE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dublonski and Rick are alone in the hall just outside 
           Zalpowicz's office.  Dublonski hisses --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        You go over my head again and I'll 
                        make sure you spend the rest of 
                        your miserable career in evidence 
                        control.  I've been here a long 
                        time, I can still pull strings.

                                 RICK
                        Pete played you, I get that.  But 
                        we both saw the warning signs and 
                        you went after your gold star 
                        anyway.  You had a chance to nip 
                        him in the bud and you choked.
           Rick's tone is calm, confident.  Dublonski knows he's right, 
           backs off.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        The NSA was gracious enough to take 
                        this mess off our hands.  How about 
                        we let them worry about it now.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        First time I've heard "NSA" and 
                        "gracious" in the same sentence.

           The dry joke catches Rick off guard.  He smiles.

                                 RICK
                        You should go home.  I'll make sure 
                        the asshole with the bad haircut 
                        gets what he needs.

           Dublonski nods, realizing Rick's right again.  Their job here 
           is done.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DIGITAL SOLDIER gets MOWED DOWN by gunfire.

           INT. VIDEO GAME STORE - NIGHT

           Peter and Marchee stand behind a 13-YEAR-OLD playing CALL OF 
           DUTY at a display inside the nearly-empty store.  Peter’s 
           still holding his side, his shirt soaked through with blood.

                                 PETER
                        Hey kid.  Our turn.

           The 13-year-old ignores them, restarts the game.

                                 MARCHEE
                             (louder)
                        Hey kid.

           The kid turns and BLANCHES when he sees Peter.  He drops the 
           controller and scuttles off.  Peter wipes his hands on his 
           shirt and puts on the HEADSET.

           INT. ANNA’S HOUSE - BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

           Michael sits in the basement, playing Call of Duty with his 
           own headset.  Eyes glazed.

           Out of nowhere, his AVATAR’S HEAD EXPLODES.  He blinks, 
           stunned.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (into headset)
                        Who the fuck did that?
                                 PETER (HEADSET)
                        Hey.  Language.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Shut the fuck up noob, you come out 
                        in the open and I’ll stab you in 
                        the fucking asshole --

                                 PETER
                        Mike.  Jesus.

           Michael realizes who’s on the other end of the line --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Uncle Pete?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           HANDS press a DAMP RAG on to Peter’s bloody gash.

                                 PETER
                        Ahhh --

           He winces, looking at the filthy mirror.  His sister Anna is 
           cleaning his wound, a MEDICAL BAG nearby.

           LATE NIGHT TV can be heard from the other room.  Peter and 
           Anna talk quietly.

                                 ANNA
                        There was an FBI agent at my house, 
                        Peter.

                                 PETER
                        I know.  I’m sorry.

                                 ANNA
                        I had to lie to an FBI agent.  They 
                        tried to convince me you’re dangerous.

           She pulls out a NEEDLE and starts STITCHING Peter’s side.

                                 PETER
                        Ow.  Could you...?

                                 ANNA
                        No.  This is going to hurt.

           She goes in for another stitch and he WINCES.  She looks out 
           the door to make sure that Marchee is still watching the TV, 
           then lowers her voice even further.
                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        You had a plan.  You said you were 
                        going to do some real good.  Was 
                        that bullshit?

           Peter doesn’t have an answer Anna wants to hear.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        What about me, Pete?  What about 
                        Michael?

           Anna does one more stitch, more aggressive than necessary --

                                 PETER
                        Ow!

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - ROOM - SAME

           Marchee’s watching TV on the bed.  She turns to the door 
           after Peter’s outburst, concerned.  When she determines it’s 
           not an emergency, she turns back to the TV.  Giving them 
           their privacy.

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - BATHROOM - SAME

           Anna dabs the stitched-up wound, still glaring.  Peter stares 
           off into space, emotional.

                                 PETER
                        I was standing in the casino, and I 
                        started thinking about a few months 
                        from now, when I’d have to put on a 
                        suit and a tie and go to court and 
                        testify.  And I couldn’t do it.  I 
                        couldn’t do that to her.

           Anna softens.  It’s odd to see him like this.  Odd to see him 
           caring about someone.  She applies a thick bandage.

                                 ANNA
                        How bad trouble are you in?

                                 PETER
                        Bad.

           Anna knows exactly what that means.  She pats the bandage 
           down, then pulls a few CREDIT CARDS out of her purse.  She 
           puts them on the counter as Peter pulls on his shirt.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m reporting these stolen tomorrow 
                        night.  That’s the best I can do.

                                 PETER
                        Thank you.
           They look at each other for a long beat.  Maybe for the last 
           time.  Anna can’t play tough anymore -- she wraps him up in a 
           big hug.  Peter winces from the pain, hugs back.

                                 ANNA
                        Bye baby brother.

           Peter can’t bring himself to say anything.  Anna releases, 
           takes a deep breath, puts on a brave face, and walks out of 
           the bathroom.

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

           Anna crosses through the room without even casting a glance 
           in Marchee’s direction.  Marchee watches her close the door 
           behind her.

           Peter appears in the door of the bathroom.

                                 PETER
                        Sorry about that.  She’s... she 
                        didn’t understand.

           Marchee looks at him.

                                 MARCHEE
                        It’s okay.

           Peter sits next to her on the bed.

                                 PETER
                        I know a guy that can get us good 
                        fakes.  We can go to Ecuador.  
                        Beaches.  Sun.  Lack of extradition 
                        treaty.

           Peter’s attempt at a joke falls flat.  Marchee stares into 
           the middle distance.

                                 MARCHEE
                        I can’t just run away.

                                 PETER
                        If we get caught we’re looking at 
                        decades.  Espionage, terrorism 
                        maybe.  It’s our best option.

           A beat of silence.

                                 MARCHEE
                        My sister and I lived with my mom 
                        in this one bedroom shithole by the 
                        freeway.  She had these boyfriends.

                        One of them, Tom -- they would get 
                        in these screaming fights and then 
                        he'd storm out, and she'd cry 
                        through her black eyes and bloody 
                        cheeks.  Then a few nights later 
                        he'd come back and it would be like 
                        nothing ever happened.
                             (beat)
                        One night, he broke her orbital, 
                        right here --

           She touches her own orbital bone, right under the eye.

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        She wouldn't go to the hospital 
                        because Tommy was on parole and she 
                        didn't want him to get in trouble.
                             (beat)
                        That was the night I decided to 
                        leave.  I couldn't understand why a 
                        person would work so hard to 
                        protect someone who hurt her so 
                        badly.
                             (beat)
                        My sister was still little.  I told 
                        her I'd come back for her.  I told 
                        myself.

           The weight of that lands on Peter.  It’s why Marchee can’t 
           flee the country.

                                 PETER
                        She'd understand if she knew why 
                        you had to run.

                                 MARCHEE
                        But she won't know.

           Peter looks around the dump of a room.  A far cry from the 
           hotel in Atlantic City.  Hell, a far cry from the basement in 
           his sister’s house.

                                 PETER
                        Neither would my nephew, Michael.  
                        He's a good kid.
                             (beat)
                        What's your name?  Your real name.

           Marchee looks up at him, surprised by the question.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Lauren.

                                 PETER
                        Lauren.
           They look at each other for a beat.  He leans in to kiss her, 
           and she reciprocates.  Soft.  Tender.

           Then it gets hotter and heavier.  Marchee strips off his 
           shirt and then her own.  They fall back on to the bed.

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - ROOM - LATER

           Marchee's asleep facing away.  Peter watches her breathe, her 
           back gently rocking up and down.

           After a moment, he gets up and picks up his discarded pants.  
           He rifles through the pocket and comes up with the BLONDE 
           MAN’S KEY CHAIN.

           He rifles through it, finding a gray KEY FOB.  He turns it 
           over in the moonlight.  Etched on the back are small letters --

                                          OPS2A
                                         TAO_0028

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dark bedroom.  A cell phone LIGHTS UP on the night stand, 
           BUZZING along on the wood panel.

           A MAN on the opposite side of the bed stirs.

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Mmm-honey, phone.  Mary.

           The man nudges his partner, who elbows up and clicks on the 
           light -- Dublonski.  The man is presumably her HUSBAND (65).

           Dublonski answers the phone.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Dublonski.
                             (sits up)
                        Peter?

           INTERCUT:

           EXT. STREET OUTSIDE 7-ELEVEN - NIGHT

           Peter paces the street, talking on a new BURNER PHONE.

                                 PETER
                        I don’t want to run.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Where are you?
                                 PETER
                        Teknine’s the only one who can 
                        access Conficker and you have him 
                        in custody.  I want to make a deal.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        It’s too late, I can’t do it.

                                 PETER
                        You’re the FBI.  Thought you could 
                        do anything you want.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Just tell me where you are and we 
                        can talk about it.

                                 PETER
                        We're talking about it now.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        NSA took over the investigation.  
                        It’s their deal to make.

           Shit.  Not what Peter wanted to hear.  He debates whether to 
           play his next card.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Peter?

           He decides to go for it --

                                 PETER
                        Ask Rick why the Crown's in Utah.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Crown’s in Utah?  How do you know?

                                 PETER
                        Just ask him.

           Dublonski scribbles "CROWN IN UTAH?" on a notepad.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        One-forty-two-four B.

           CLICK.  Dublonski stares at the phone, puzzled.  She 
           scribbles that down too -- "1424B".

                                 DUBLONSKI'S HUSBAND
                        Who was that?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Work.

                                 DUBLONSKI'S HUSBAND
                        Oh, Jesus.
           He rolls over and tries to go back to sleep.  Dublonski RIPS 
           the page off her pad and gets out of bed.

           EXT. CITY HALL PARK - NIGHT

           Dublonski walks through the park in the cold.  She's looking 
           for something...

           There.  Rick, standing alone in a pool of light.  He waves 
           her over with a head nod.

                                 RICK (PRELAP)
                        I should have made the connection 
                        earlier.

           EXT. CITY HALL PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Rick and Dublonski walk through the park.  Dublonski pulls 
           her coat tighter, trying to keep out the cold.

                                 RICK
                        When I got assigned to CyberCom in 
                        '09, there were a couple weeks I 
                        had access to a classified NSA 
                        database.  It was around the same 
                        time they were proposing a new 
                        communications monitoring system, 
                        like a worldwide data wiretap.  I 
                        saw some of the specs.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I remember that.  I thought the 
                        Justice Department shot it down.

                                 RICK
                        What they never released to the 
                        public was that it wasn't just a 
                        monitoring program.  It was 
                        designed to give NSA control over 
                        the entire internet in an 
                        emergency, like a global kill 
                        switch.  It was supposed to be 
                        based out of NSA's new data center, 
                        the one they finished last month --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        In Utah.
                             (reeling)
                        Conficker is the NSA’s?

                                 RICK
                        You know their code name for the 
                        project?

           Everything clicks into place.
                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Crown.

           Holy shit.  Dublonski stops walking.

                                 RICK
                        Someone knew exactly what they were 
                        stealing.

           Dublonski thinks about her next move --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Find out where Peter called me 
                        from.

                                 RICK
                        Where are you going?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I need a drink.

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The kind of place with gold flecks in the fois gras.  It's 
           late, the restaurant empty.  Lydekker sits at the bar with 
           two CONGRESSMEN and the Blonde Man, laughing at some joke.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        -- and that was even before the 
                        report came in.  Should have seen 
                        his face an hour later, looked like 
                        some sort of human-lemon hybrid --

           Hand on his back.  He turns --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I need to steal you for a minute.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Mary.  Sorry I had to bigfoot you 
                        back there, but I'm sure you can 
                        see it's for the best.  You 
                        remember representatives Alvarez 
                        and Fabry?

           The doughy politicians offer a polite nod, but she ignores 
           them and presses on Lydekker.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I want to talk about Crown.

           Lydekker looks to the Blonde Man -- is she serious?

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Race is almost over and you're 
                        still betting with your horse three 
                        lengths behind.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LYDEKKER (CONT'D)
                        You don’t have to concern yourself 
                        with him anymore, Mary.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I’m not concerned about the person.  
                        I’m concerned about the program.

           Lydekker's face falls as he realizes how much Dublonski 
           knows.  He and the Blonde Man share a quick look.

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - MEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lydekker checks under the stalls -- nobody.  He gets up close 
           to Dublonski and lowers his voice.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Everything about it was approved.  
                        The Joint Chiefs already know.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Do the congressmen at your table?

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Don't push this, Mary.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        In hindsight you probably should 
                        have mentioned you were the one 
                        infecting every network on the 
                        planet.  Why haven't you taken the 
                        command server offline?

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Everything's under control.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Oh fuck you.  There are nuclear 
                        launch codes in the wind and you're 
                        the one who armed the fucking bomb.

           Lydekker steps closer.  She becomes acutely aware of how big 
           he is, how strong.  His voice is low, intense --

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Your undercover helped a wanted 
                        terrorist steal the U.S. 
                        government's most valuable asset.  
                        That's treason, at best.  The death 
                        penalty.

           Dublonski holds her ground.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        You don’t go near him.  He's not 
                        your problem --
           Lydekker suddenly GRABS DUBLONSKI and SLAMS HER against the 
           bathroom stall.  Violent, scary.  A side she hasn't seen 
           before.  He GRABS HER WRISTS, spins her, growls in her ear --

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Everything.  Is my problem.  This 
                        is chess, Mary.  My job’s to take 
                        the king.

           He breathes in her ear for a beat as Dublonski remains very 
           still.  Then he releases her and exits through a side door.

           Dublonski resumes breathing again in ragged bursts, her 
           adrenaline up.

           After another moment, to seemingly no one:

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Did you get that?

           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DIGITAL FORENSICS - SAME

           Rick sits with the analyst Simms, a RECORDING DEVICE 
           blinking.  He speaks into a microphone:

                                 RICK
                        Every word.

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - MEN'S BATHROOM - SAME

           Dublonski pulls her phone out of her jacket pocket.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Good.

           She powers the phone off, lets it clatter to the floor.  Digs 
           a tiny LISTENING DEVICE out of her ear.  Breathes for a 
           beat...

           ... then breaks down into SHARP SOBS.  Finally letting 
           herself be afraid.

           INT. HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT

           Teknine's still sitting at the table under the ugly 
           fluorescents, but they've removed the handcuffs.  The door 
           opens and a LANKY GUARD steps in.

                                 LANKY GUARD
                        Lawyer's finally here to see you.

           Teknine looks up -- a man with a briefcase walks quickly past 
           and sits opposite Teknine.

           It's Elix.  Shaved, haircut, looking different but with the 
           same enigmatic sparkle in his eye.  He turns and nods to the 
           Lanky Guard, who exits and closes the door behind him.
                                 TEKNINE
                        Where the fuck have you been?

                                 ELIX
                        Arrangements had to be made.

                                 TEKNINE
                        Fuck your arrangements.  Get me out 
                        of here.

                                 ELIX
                        The Bureau's treating you as a 
                        terrorist suspect.

                                 TEKNINE
                        So how do we fix that?

                                 ELIX
                        We don't.

                                 TEKNINE
                        You ain't leaving me to rot in 
                        here.  You can't.

           Elix opens his briefcase, removes a YELLOW PAD and an IPAD.

                                 ELIX
                        This is the long game we're 
                        playing.  Better to be here for 
                        what's coming next.

           Teknine looks up at the camera in the ceiling.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        They aren't recording audio.

           Elix slides over the yellow pad.  Teknine picks up the pen 
           and clicks it open and closed.  CLICK-CLICK.

                                 TEKNINE
                        I want to talk to Crown.

                                 ELIX
                        Who do you think you're talking to?

           A possibility Teknine hadn't considered.  His eyes go wide.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        We have the opportunity to 
                        permanently destabilize the source 
                        of inequality in this country.  The 
                        root of all political malfeasance, 
                        all corporate greed, all social 
                        injustice.

           CLICK-CLICK.  Teknine steals a look to the camera again.
                                 TEKNINE
                        Things look a little different now, 
                        from this side of this table.

                                 ELIX
                        You have a chance to change the 
                        world.  Not many men can say that.  
                        Not many are brave enough.  But time 
                        is not on our side, you know that.  
                        You know I won’t abandon you.

           Teknine looks directly at Elix, considering.  CLICK.  He 
           lowers the pen and writes, fast scribbles on the paper.  
           After he's finished, he slides the pad back.

           Elix looks -- a long sequence of letters and numbers.  
           Teknine keeps his hand on the yellow pad.

                                 TEKNINE
                        Get me out of here quick.

           Elix unlocks his iPad and types.

                                 ELIX
                        Sooner than you think.

           He taps once more and --

           Teknine's CHEST SPASMS.  Like a silent hiccup.  He recoils in 
           pain, unsure what happened.

           ANOTHER SPASM.  Elix starts packing up.  Teknine realizes 
           what's wrong --

                                 TEKNINE
                        No.

           Elix shuts his briefcase and stands.  Teknine yells --

                                 TEKNINE (CONT’D)
                        Help me.

           The Lanky Guard and his PARTNER rush in, unsure what's 
           happening.  They take stock of the room -- other than Teknine 
           writhing in his chair, everything looks in order.

                                 TEKNINE (CONT’D)
                             (having trouble breathing)
                        He's trying -- to kill me.

           Teknine SPASMS again, the pain getting worse.  The guards 
           look at each other, not sure what to do.

                                 LANKY GUARD
                        I was watching the whole time.  He 
                        didn't go near him.
           Elix approaches --

                                 ELIX
                        My client needs medical attention.

                                 TEKNINE
                        He's -- killing -- me.

           Teknine FALLS off his chair.  The guards rush to him, leaving 
           Elix alone.  They RIP OPEN his shirt, revealing a HEART 
           SURGERY SCAR --

                                 TEKNINE (CONT’D)
                             (wheezing)
                        Please.  Pace -- maker.

                                 LANKY GUARD
                             (into radio)
                        We need a medic now --

           Elix watches from the doorway.  Teknine's eyes are rolling 
           back into his head, his tongue sticking out, his breath 
           ragged.  Looks like a heart attack.  Elix slips out.

                                 LANKY GUARD (CONT’D)
                             (into radio again)
                        Where's the goddamn medic?  He's 
                        got a heart condition --

           INT. METRO FEDERAL PRISON - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Elix walks down the hall without looking back as PARAMEDICS 
           sprint past him into the holding room.

           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DIGITAL FORENSICS - NIGHT

           Dublonski has joined Rick and Simms in the forensics lab.  
           Simms is working on tracing the source of Peter's call, 
           pointing at maps on his screen --

                                 SIMMS
                        The call was made from a burner 
                        phone, but we traced it to this 
                        cell tower.

           A CIRCLE pops up, centered on a cell site.  Pretty big area 
           in Harlem.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        That's the best you can do?

           Simms looks at Dublonski -- please, lady.
                                 SIMMS
                        Cell towers have three antennas 
                        that each cover a third of the 
                        circle.  Closest one receives the 
                        signal, so I can shrink it to this.

           Simms types for a second and 2/3 of the circle disappears, 
           leaving a single wedge.

                                 SIMMS (CONT’D)
                        Based on the signal strength he was 
                        about a half mile away, which means 
                        we're looking at somewhere on this 
                        band.  But again, that was hours 
                        ago.

           Dublonski looks at the highlighted area -- still a big zone, 
           but not huge.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Show me some flop houses around 
                        there.  Hotels that pay with cash 
                        and you don't need ID.

           A few keystrokes and Simms highlights all the shitty hotels 
           in the area.  Dublonski looks at them, then checks the 
           notepad she scrawled on in her bedroom.

           She looks at the "1424B", then back to the map.  She draws a 
           line:

           142/4B.

           She points at one highlighted hotel --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        This one.  Room 4B.

                                 RICK
                        How do you know?

           She hands the pad to Rick, stands.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        He wanted us to find him.

                                 RICK
                             (looks at the number)
                        Why not just tell us where he was?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Because he wanted us to know who we 
                        were dealing with.
           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN

           The sun's not quite up, but the sky is getting brighter 
           through the dirty window.  Peter looks outside -- nothing 
           remarkable out there.  Pedestrians, cabs.

           Someone SHOOS an oblivious PIGEON out of the street before a 
           car flies by.

                                 MARCHEE (O.S.)
                        What’s out there?

           Peter turns and sees that Marchee's awake.  She's putting her 
           shirt back on.  He's not sure how long she's been watching.

                                 PETER
                        There was a bird in the street.

           Marchee sits up, realizing something's odd about his tone.

                                 MARCHEE
                        What time are you leaving?

                                 PETER
                        I’m not.

           Marchee pauses at the news.  She doesn’t like that.

                                 MARCHEE
                        No.  You have to go.  You’ve done 
                        enough, okay?  Please.

           Peter is silent.  She knows something’s really wrong.

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        Peter.  Please.

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry.

           Time slows...

           CRACK --

           The door SPLINTERS off its HINGES as FBI SWAT bursts in and 
           swarms.  Yells of "Down on your knees!" and "Hands on your 
           head!" fill the quiet room.  Peter and Marchee both sink to 
           the floor.

           Peter looks to the door as Dublonski enters, trailed by Rick.

           He turns to see Marchee glaring at him, realizing what he 
           did.  Betrayed.
           She never breaks eye contact as the SWAT officers force her 
           to the ground and cuff her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

           A dark blue SPRINTER VAN is parked on the street.  A small 
           ANTENNAE is attached to the top.

           INT. SPRINTER VAN - PRE-DAWN

           The back has been converted into an ad hoc TECH LAB.  Ramsey 
           sits in the driver’s seat, clipping his fingernails, while 
           Elix tightens a screw on a server rack he’s assembling.

           A POLICE RADIO drones in the background, lots of chatter.  
           Elix hears something and perks up.  Ramsey heads him off --

                                 RAMSEY
                        We don’t know they’re a problem.

                                 ELIX
                        They’ve seen our faces.

           Ramsey knows Elix is right.

                                 RAMSEY
                        What if you can’t interface with 
                        the command server?

                                 ELIX
                        All we need is a good... connection.

           Elix finishes the last screw and KNOCKS on the metal panel.  
           He hits a button and the server begins booting up.

                                 RAMSEY
                             (sighs, gives up)
                        You ready?

           Elix scoots to the keyboard and types -- on his screen we see 
           HUNDREDS OF LINES OF CODE.  The seeds of destruction.

                                 ELIX
                        No one's ever ready for the world 
                        to change.

           Elix takes a breath, then leans in and hits ENTER --

           -- and nothing happens.  Just a blinking cursor.  Then, an IP 
           ADDRESS pops up on the screen.  Then another, and another, 
           and suddenly there’s a flood.  Hundreds.  Thousands.  
           Millions of them, scrolling faster and faster --
                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        This is how you shut down modern 
                        civilization.

           INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Suddenly we’re in a living room.  A WOMAN’s web browser 
           freezes.  The COMPUTER FAN kicks in, WHIRRING --

           INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MORNING

           An OLD MAN bangs on the keyboard of his computer.  The 
           WHIRRING FAN NOISE increases --

           INT. CUBICLE FARM - DAY

           A JAPANESE OFFICE DRONE clicks his mouse, frustrated.  The 
           FAN NOISE keeps getting louder...

           The range of malfunctioning devices broadens, and we see...

           FLAT SCREEN TVS IN A STORE WINDOW CUT OUT

           A NETWORK TV CONTROL ROOM SUDDENLY FREEZES UP

           AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SCREENS GO BLANK

           And so on and so forth, ending with...

           INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - TRADING FLOOR - MORNING

           Thousands of SCREENS flash and change as TRADERS watch.  
           Nothing unusual yet, until...

           ... a MURMUR ripples through the floor.  A large section of 
           numbers have turned RED.  Then another.  Suddenly 
           everything's CRASHING and people are panicking --

           The fan noise increases to a DEAFENING ROAR --

           INT. TOWNCAR / EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING

           The towncar glides through light morning traffic.  Dublonski 
           drives, Rick in the passenger seat.  Times Square's 
           electronic billboards still blaze brightly in the morning 
           half-light.

           Peter and Marchee sit in the back, both handcuffed.

           Marchee chuckles to herself, sad.  Peter looks at her.

                                 MARCHEE
                        Never really know anyone.

           SUDDENLY --
           Outside the window, a billboard FRITZES OUT.  Then another.  
           Then they're all going HAYWIRE.

           Traffic stops as everyone slows to look at the bizarre light 
           show going on overhead.

           Dublonski turns over her shoulder to Peter --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        How is this happening?

                                 PETER
                        Someone activated Conficker.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        You said yourself, Teknine's in 
                        lockup --

                           PETER
                                                          RICK
           Are you sure about that?
                                              Mary!

           CRUNCH.  Everyone jolts forward as Dublonski REAR-ENDS a BMW 
           in front of them.  Dublonski scowls and flicks on the POLICE 
           LIGHTS.  The BMW stays in the middle of the street.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Stay with them.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING

           The cars are stopped in the middle of the giant intersection.  
           Other drivers HONK and SWEAR as they try to get by.

           Dublonski puts her hand on her gun as she approaches the BMW, 
           which remains in the middle of the street.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                             (yelling over traffic)
                        Sir?  I’m going to have to ask you 
                        to get out of the intersection.

           Dublonski inches closer to the car, trying to see what’s 
           going on.  She looks up at the STREET LIGHTS -- all of them 
           are BLINKING RED.  Everywhere.  Uh oh...

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Are you alright?  Are you hurt?

           Dublonski looks around.  Traffic is gridlocked, everyone’s 
           screaming, honking, swearing.  Her spider sense tingles.

           She gets closer to the BMW and bends down to see --

           There’s no one in the driver’s seat.

           No time to react before an ENGINE ROARS and TIRES SQUEAL --
           SMASH!

           ANOTHER CAR T-BONES the FBI cruiser, sending it skidding --

           More HONKING and SWERVING as cars get out of the way --

           Dublonski runs back to the cruiser, where Rick is already 
           spilling out the passenger side --

           Another ENGINE ROAR as a THIRD CAR flies toward Rick.  He 
           DIVES out of the way but it NAILS the front of the cruiser, 
           sending it spinning --

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Get them out!

           Rick pulls on the door but it’s DENTED INWARDS -- stuck.  
           Peter spills out the other door, groggy from the accidents, 
           bleeding profusely.  Dublonski UNLOCKS HIS HANDCUFFS.

           Marchee spills out after him in similar condition.  She tries 
           to stand, but stumbles --

           Another ENGINE ROAR and Dublonski instinctively covers Peter.  
           The BLUE SPRINTER VAN pulls up --

           Ramsey aims his REVOLVER from the driver’s seat --

           Dublonski freezes, releasing her grip on Peter.  The van's 
           SIDE DOOR opens and Elix pops out and pulls Peter inside.  
           Marchee tumbles in after him, still handcuffed.

           Dublonski watches the van ROAR OFF, in shock.  No plates.

           She scrambles back to the towncar as Rick piles in the 
           driver's side.  He TAKES OFF after the van, driving up on the 
           sidewalk, LIGHTS FLASHING --

           INT. TOWNCAR / EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING

           Dublonski grabs the radio as Rick tries to chase the van --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Ten-thirteen, ten-thirteen Federal 
                        agents need assistance pursuing 
                        navy van no plates south on 
                        Broadway at 39th.

           She release the button and waits for acknowledgement.  
           Static.  The Times Square billboards and traffic lights are 
           still going haywire.

           Rick SQUEALS around a car, the van still a few blocks ahead.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                             (into radio again)
                        Hello?
           Nothing.  She chucks it.

                                 DUBLONSKI (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. SPRINTER VAN - DAY

           Peter slams against a bank of INTERCONNECTED CAR BATTERIES as 
           Ramsey weaves the van through traffic.  The screens and 
           equipment are mostly holding, bolted to the inside.  A few 
           random bits of plastic and metal clatter around.

           Elix is holding Marchee around the waist, a SEMI-AUTOMATIC 
           PISTOL pressed against her temple.  He talks to Peter --

                                 ELIX
                        We know how this is going to end, 
                        so all that's left is to figure out 
                        the order.  Were you working for 
                        the Feds?  Or was she?

           Peter tries to hold on as the van flies around another curve.

                                 ELIX (CONT’D)
                        I need an answer.

                                 MARCHEE
                        I was.

           Elix clocks Peter's disbelief that she said that.

                                 ELIX
                        Really Mr. Nightwatch?  Is that the 
                        answer you're going with?

                                 PETER
                        No.  I called the FBI.

           Peter glares at Marchee -- what are you doing?

                                 RAMSEY
                             (yelling from the front)
                        The lady Fed's still on our tail.

                                 ELIX
                        Looks like our time's running 
                        short.  Anything else to say?

                                 PETER
                        We can all still walk away from 
                        this.  Nobody needs to get hurt.

           Elix shakes his head in disbelief.  In a flash, he levels the 
           gun at Peter --

           Marchee SHOVES his arm --
           Elix FIRES --

           The bang is DEAFENING --

           The bullet misses Peter's head by inches, going right through 
           the wall of the van as Peter DIVES the opposite direction --

           Ramsey SWERVES, throwing everybody off balance.  Peter 
           struggles up, EARS RINGING --

                                 RAMSEY
                             (like he's underwater)
                        God-dammit --

           Marchee and Elix GRAPPLE on the floor of the van over the 
           gun, which is pinned over Elix's head.  He overpowers her and 
           raises it --

           BANG --

           Another deafening shot rings out in the tin can and the van 
           ACCELERATES, throwing them all to the back.

           Peter climbs to his knees and looks out the windshield --

           It's CRACKED, a SPIDERWEB growing right in front of Ramsey.  
           Peter looks at him.  He's slumped over the wheel, BLOOD ALL 
           OVER THE FLOOR.

           Shot.  Oh fuck...

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

           The van's racing toward a DEAD END -- 35th Street, where 
           Broadway turns into a PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY next to Macy's, 
           guarded by CONCRETE BARRIERS.

           Pedestrians look up from their non-functioning cell phones 
           and SCATTER as the van roars closer --

           INSIDE

           Peter pulls down on the wheel --

           INT. TOWNCAR / EXT. BROADWAY AND 35TH - SAME

           Dublonski and Rick watch as the blue van careens toward the 
           dead end.  It turns to the right, but it's going too fast --

           It SLAMS through the barriers, inertia knocking it over as it 
           SKIDS ON ITS SIDE, taking out GIANT UMBRELLAS and CHAIRS, 
           sparks flying...

           ... until it comes to a rest.

                                 RICK
                        Holy shit.
           Traffic's stopped, Rick can't drive any closer.  Dublonski 
           opens the door and gets out --

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Mary, don't --

           INT. SPRINTER VAN - DAY

           Equipment everywhere as Peter, Marchee, and Elix all struggle 
           for consciousness.

           They're laying on what was formerly the wall of the van, most 
           of the computer equipment still bolted to the "floor" at a 
           funny angle.

           Elix reaches up and opens the back door, and the formerly 
           vertical door falls to the ground.  Light spills inside.

           Elix crawls out --

           EXT. BROADWAY BETWEEN 34TH AND 35TH - CONTINUOUS

           -- into the winter day.  He's bruised, bloody, beaten up.  
           Almost everyone has disappeared from the pedestrian square.

           He feels someone behind him, standing over him.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Just so you know, Crown.

           Elix turns to look --

           Lydekker stands over him, holding a pistol.  Bulletproof vest 
           over his shirt, heavy coat, tired expression.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        You were never really in control.

           BANG --

           Brains on the pavement.  Whatever bystanders were left SCREAM 
           and SCATTER in every possible direction.  The Blonde Man 
           hovers nearby, backup.

           Lydekker turns to the van --

           INT. SPRINTER VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Peter crawls over to Marchee, realizing how much his side 
           hurts.  He looks down -- he’s bleeding through his bandage.

           Marchee's in bad shape, a GASH on her head from the accident.  
           Peter pulls her upright, wipes the blood from her face.

                                 PETER
                        Here we go, okay.
           Marchee looks at him, struggles to remain conscious.

                                 MARCHEE
                        I wasn't lying.

                                 PETER
                             (trying to placate her)
                        I know, it's okay.

                                 MARCHEE
                        No.  I was helping the S...

           Peter leans in to listen...

                                 MARCHEE (CONT’D)
                        The N-S...

           The back door swings all the way open, Marchee lolls her head 
           to look.  Lydekker steps into the wreckage.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        How's my girl doing?

           Lydekker shoves Peter away, crouches down.  He keeps his gun 
           trained on him while he examines her head wound.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        Couple stitches and a cat scan and 
                        you'll be good as new.

           Marchee makes eye contact with Peter across the van.

                                 MARCHEE
                             (whispers)
                        I'm sorry.

           Lydekker knows she's not talking to him, but --

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Nothing to be sorry about, sweetie.  
                        Did your part admirably.
                             (to Peter)
                        She's got this incredible soft spot 
                        for her sister, you wouldn't 
                        believe.  Hell of a lay, too.  But 
                        you know that.

           He reaches under her shirt and pulls out a THIN, TRANSLUCENT 
           CIRCUIT BOARD that was taped to the inside.  He tosses it to 
           the Blonde Man, who's standing just outside the van.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        Get rid of that.  Think everybody's 
                        heard enough.

           The Blonde Man disappears from sight.  Lydekker turns his 
           attention back to Peter.
                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        And now it's time for our little 
                        test to come to an end.

           Lydekker nods to the CONTROL SERVER, bolted to what appears 
           to be the wall.  Peter stares at him, dumbfounded.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        We had to know Conficker worked.  
                        Director didn't think it would, to 
                        be honest.  Wanted plausible 
                        deniability.  So I suggested making 
                        it a carrot.  Figured hacker trash 
                        would jump at the chance to take it 
                        from us.

           Peter's stunned.  Lydekker grabs Marchee's hair, yanking her 
           towards him.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        I don't have all day, Petey.  
                        Civilization's crumbling out there.

           Peter struggles to process this new information.

           Lydekker gestures with the gun.  Peter approaches the 
           terminal, cautious.  Starts typing.  Lydekker keeps one eye 
           on Marchee, who's still struggling to remain conscious.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        Don't look so glum, it’s just a 
                        tool.  It's protection.

           EXT. BROADWAY BETWEEN 34TH AND 35TH - SAME

           Dublonski stands just outside the van, gun drawn.  Rick 
           hovers over the Blonde Man a short distance away, who's 
           cuffed and gagged, sitting cross-legged on the ground.

           INT. SPRINTER VAN - SAME

           Back inside the van, Peter’s typing --

                                 PETER
                        Is that what you tell yourself in 
                        Tailored Access Operations?

           Lydekker smirks.  Peter’s smarter than he thought.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        That’s what you call it, right?  
                        TAO.  Very zen name for NSA 
                        skunkworks.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        It’s our world, Petey.  We have to 
                        maintain control.
           On the screen, Peter opens something called POWER CONTROL 
           SETTING.

           Lydekker looks out the van door, scanning for any movement.  
           He can’t see Dublonski --

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        Tick tock...

           EXT. BROADWAY BETWEEN 34TH AND 35TH - SAME

           Dublonski listens from outside the van, waiting.

           INT. SPRINTER VAN - SAME

           Peter is in BATTERY EMERGENCY SETTINGS.  He adds a 0, 
           changing a "100" to "1000".  The number turns RED and a 
           HISSING SOUND starts from somewhere.  Quiet.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        I know you see me as the bad guy 
                        here, but we're doing good work 
                        together.  Important work.  It's 
                        just too bad neither of you’ll see 
                        the results.

           Peter finishes typing.  Turns.

                                 LYDEKKER (CONT’D)
                        Are you finished?

                                 PETER
                        Almost.

           Dublonski appears in the doorway behind Lydekker, sidearm 
           poised and ready.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Norm.  Put the gun down.

           Lydekker turns, sees Dublonski, starts to laugh.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Look at you.  Caught up in the 
                        final turn.

           Peter looks up and sees the van’s SLIDING DOOR, now on the 
           ceiling.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Put the gun down and let these two 
                        walk away.  

                                 LYDEKKER
                        Fletcher!
                                 DUBLONSKI
                        He's not coming.  It's just you and 
                        me.

           The HISSING is louder, gradually increasing.  Lydekker steals 
           a glance back at Peter before returning to Dublonski.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        We're on the same side here.  This 
                        is all for our protection.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Protection from who?

           Dublonski reaches out and grabs Marchee, keeping her gun 
           trained on Lydekker.  She helps her out of the van.  Lydekker 
           stutter steps to intervene, but hesitates.

                                 LYDEKKER
                        You're not going to shoot me.

           In a flash, Lydekker swings the gun around to Dublonski and 
           takes a SHOT --

           She FIRES BACK, hitting him in the leg --

           Peter OPENS the sliding door / roof --

           The HISSING is at a ROAR --

           Peter JUMPS and SCRAMBLES out of the van as Lydekker turns 
           and FIRES at him --

           EXT. BROADWAY BETWEEN 34TH AND 35TH - CONTINUOUS

           Dublonski pulls Marchee away as Peter hops down from the 
           "roof".  Rick moves to intervene, but --

                                 PETER
                        Run!

           Peter, Dublonski, and Marchee scramble away from the van, the 
           HISSING now loud even outside --

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        What is that?

                                 PETER
                        Batteries.

           BOOM -- glass shatters as the van CONCUSSIVELY EXPLODES from 
           the inside --

           Peter, Dublonski, and Marchee are THROWN to the ground a 
           short distance away.
           They pant.  Slowly, civilization starts to fade back in.  
           Cell phones ring.  Traffic lights work.  A SIREN is heard in 
           the distance as someone's 911 call finally connects.

           Dublonski looks at Peter.  Marchee's a bloody mess, still 
           handcuffed, still struggling for consciousness.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Police will be here in a few 
                        minutes.

                                 PETER
                        I'm not leaving her.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I can’t promise what happens if 
                        they arrest you.

                                 PETER
                        I'm not leaving her alone.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        No.  You're not.

           The SIRENS grow louder.  Peter stares at her a moment, then 
           understands.  A silent thank you.

           He kisses Marchee on the hair, then gets up and heads toward 
           a building.  Disappearing around a corner.

           Rick watches him go, not making any move to intervene.

           Dublonski leans back on her hands, Marchee's head in her lap.  
           She strokes Marchee’s hair, maternal.  Closes her eyes as the 
           sirens approach...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           HANDS FLIP PAGES IN A REPORT.  POV from across a desk.

           INT. FBI NEW YORK OFFICE - ZALPOWICZ'S OFFICE - DAY

           Zalpowicz flips through a report, squinting through READING 
           GLASSES.  Dublonski sits across, waiting.  Zalpowicz finishes 
           the last page and rubs the bridge of his nose.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        What is this?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        It’s the final report on the Crown 
                        investigation --
                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Don’t be a smartass.  You’re better 
                        than that.

           Dublonski shrugs -- that’s what it is.

                                 ZALPOWICZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  This is the game you want to 
                        play?  You want me to file this?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I brought it to you first, Dan.

           Zalpowicz thinks for a moment, drumming his fingers.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        This program’s still operational?

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        As far as I know.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        The director can't afford to go toe-
                        to-toe with the NSA.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        I can.  So can you.

           Zalpowicz knows she's right, but doesn't like it.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Any hope you had of staying in the 
                        fold will be gone.  They’ll take 
                        your pension.  Crucify you.
                             (beat, thinking)
                        Same for me, I suppose.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        So much for being good lifers.

           Zalpowicz lets out a slight smile, nods -- how things have 
           changed.  He closes the file.

                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        There’s one more thing.  Rick's 
                        been following up on the forensics, 
                        says he can prove neither Elix or 
                        Ramsey were "Crown."  I’d tell you 
                        how but he started using words like 
                        “IPs” and “timestamps” and I tuned 
                        out.

                                 DUBLONSKI
                        Elix was lying?
                                 ZALPOWICZ
                        Means we still have one suspect 
                        unaccounted for.

           Dublonski thinks about what that means.  Zalpowicz looks at 
           her, carefully.

                                 ZALPOWICZ (CONT’D)
                        Any thoughts on who it might be?

           Dublonski’s still putting the pieces together...

                                 ZALPOWICZ (CONT’D)
                        Mary?

           Dublonski snaps out of her trance, looks up at him.  Smirks.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        This is how you invent a villain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DUBLONSKI'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dublonski clicks on the fluorescents.  She takes stock -- the 
           pictures, the knick-knacks.  Home away from home.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Governments spend millions of 
                        dollars and man-hours hunting 
                        individual cyber criminals across 
                        the globe while their own programs 
                        are more dangerous than we could 
                        ever be.

           INT. ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A year-younger Peter and a year-younger Anna argue in her 
           kitchen --

                                 ANNA
                        Because it’s not your job to take 
                        on the NSA.

                                 PETER
                        It’s not a -- I haven’t had a job 
                        since high school.

                                 ANNA
                        Peter --

                                 PETER
                        They’re making a super weapon and 
                        passing it off as a wiretap.  We 
                        can’t just -- I got caught, okay?  
                        They’re coming.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        What’s the point of helping the FBI 
                        if I can’t do some real good?

           Anna sees the passionate plea on his face.  She relents.

           INT. ANNA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Later.  Peter sits alone in the kitchen, waiting.  Looking at 
           the clock, drumming his fingers.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        The trouble is that no one wants to 
                        lead a charge against procedure.  
                        Fight a war against policy.
                             (beat)
                        But that doesn’t mean you can’t 
                        trick them into doing it anyway.

           The door BURSTS OPEN and FBI agents swarm in SHOUTING.

           INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - BASEMENT ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Peter sits on the floor in Anna's basement, typing away at 
           his laptop.  He’s wearing the GPS MONITOR.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        So you invent a miscreant.  A 
                        terrorist.  A human target who 
                        represents the evil you’re trying to 
                        expose.

           CLOSE ON THE SCREEN as Peter types his user name: C-R-O-W-N.

           INT. DUSK NIGHTCLUB - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Teknine, Elix, Ramsey, Marchee, and Peter all listen to 
           “Crown” giving them instructions over the phone.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Then you recruit the dangerous, the 
                        true black hats.  The ones who want 
                        nothing more than to watch the 
                        world fall to pieces.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Peter points to CIRCLED SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS that Dublonski 
           holds out for him, identifying suspects.

           (In the timeline, this takes place before the scene where 
           Peter explains to Dublonski what he did to get arrested.)

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You wrap them up in a tight little 
                        package and steer the attack dogs 
                        right to them.

                        Without realizing it, the right 
                        hand is suddenly investigating the 
                        left.

           INT. BMW / EXT. SIDE ROAD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Back in the BMW Peter and Marchee stole.  He watches her 
           stare at the SHATTERED PHONE in her hands, REAL FEAR in her 
           eyes.  He makes a decision.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        But you made a mistake.  You cast 
                        too wide a net.  You snared 
                        innocents.  Victims.  And it’s too 
                        late to call it off.

           INT. CAESARS CASINO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           ON A MONITOR, Peter is standing next to Teknine, staring 
           directly into the SECURITY CAMERA.  Determined.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        So you decide to take control.

           Peter walks way from the camera.

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Anna stitches up Peter’s side --

                                 ANNA
                        You said you were going to do some 
                        real good.  Was that bullshit?

           INT. SHITTY HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Peter watches Marchee sleep in the moonlight.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You realize some things are more 
                        important than a crusade.  You 
                        change tactics.

           Peter gets out of bed --

           EXT. STREET OUTSIDE 7-ELEVEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Peter paces, new burner phone in his hand, debating whether 
           or not to make the call to Dublonski.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You protect the ones you care 
                        about, no matter what it costs.  No 
                        matter how long it takes.
           Peter raises the phone to his ear.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

           Quiet.  Still.  Light streams through the window.

           Marchee lays asleep, recovering from her injuries, handcuffed 
           to the hospital bed.  A NURSE is removing her IV.

           Marchee blinks awake and looks up at the nurse --

           It's Anna.  Neither says anything.  Anna gives Marchee a 
           slight smile, and then walks out of the room.

           Marchee looks down at her wrist --

           Anna unlocked the handcuff.

           Marchee cautiously gets out of bed, looks out the door.  
           Nurses are walking around, no one's paying her any attention.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Marchee pokes her head out the door to see an empty chair 
           where a guard should be.

           She walks down the hall, still in her robe.  Ignored.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Then, you disappear.

           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DUBLONSKI'S OFFICE - DAY

           Dublonski packs up her desk into boxes.  She removes pictures 
           from the walls, paperclips and rubber bands from drawers.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You get startup cash from an ATM.  
                        Get a fake ID.  Take a bus to 
                        Virginia.  Charter a flight to 
                        Maine.  Amtrak to Boston.  Then head 
                        to Europe -- Logan to Frankfurt, 
                        Munich to Milan, Sorrento to London, 
                        Liverpool to Copenhagen, Stockholm 
                        to Madrid, Barcelona to Rio, Sao 
                        Paulo back to Guayaquil, Ecuador.  
                        Make your trail so long and twisted 
                        no sane person would ever take the 
                        time to look for you.

           INT. SYSTEC OFFICE - STEVE FARROW'S OFFICE - DAY

           A few SUITS crowd the office of Steve Farrow, Peter's friend 
           who works in security for the stock market.  They're arguing 
           over a report while Steve tries in vain to defend himself.
                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You create a good day at the 
                        market.  Build a nest egg.  Invest 
                        wisely, securely, anonymously.

           INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Anna opens a PACKAGE on her kitchen table.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Wire money to family every month.  
                        When you can, reach out directly.

           Anna pulls a NEW LAPTOP out of the box.  A note on top --

           GIVE THIS TO MIKE IF HE KEEPS THE SWEARING DOWN.  -P

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Expect it to be hard.  Expect them 
                        not to understand, to scream, to 
                        yell, to cry.  Ask their 
                        forgiveness.  Do anything you can 
                        to help them.

           Another envelope.  Anna opens it --

           A $200,000 check from some foreign account.  In the "memo" 
           field: PRINCETON.  She turns it over -- a sticky note:

           GIVE THIS TO HIM REGARDLESS

           Anna tears up, overcome with emotion.

           INT. CYBERCRIME OFFICE - DUBLONSKI'S OFFICE - DAY

           Back in her office, Dublonski sits down at her computer.  All 
           her stuff has been packed in bankers boxes.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        Villains are useful.  Valuable.  
                        They put the world in focus.  Help 
                        you understand what’s most 
                        important.

           An IRC WINDOW pops up on Dublonski's screen --

           CROWN:  happy birthday

           Dublonski looks at the message.  Watches the cursor blink.

                                 PETER (V.O.)
                        You just have to remember: they’re 
                        never exactly who you think they are.

           With a sigh, Dublonski turns off her monitor and we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BEACHSIDE BAR - DAY

           ON A SCREEN: FBI_Dub has logged off.

           Peter looks up from his laptop, which sits on the bar.  He’s 
           tan, healthy, content.  He shuts his laptop and turns to his 
           left, where Marchee is sitting next to him.  Slight sunburn on 
           her pale skin, mostly-finished Mai Tai in front of her.

                                 PETER
                        You good?

                                 MARCHEE
                        No.  Hate this place.

           She slurps down the rest of her Mai Tai with a wink and 
           starts walking toward the water.  Peter turns to the 
           BARTENDER --

                                 PETER
                        Disculpe, me podria cuidar esto por 
                        momento, por favor?

           The bartender nods and puts the laptop under the bar.  Peter 
           turns and runs to catch up with Marchee, feet gliding over 
           the wet sand.

                                                              FADE OUT.
