           An autopsy is, by nature, graphic. The depictions herein,

           FADE IN ON:

           EXT. DOUGLAS HOME - TEXAS - AFTERNOON

           An old, split-level home in the Gothic revival style. All the 
           lights are OFF. It’s hard to see anything through the 
           windows.

           The shrill CRY of locusts disturbs the muggy Texas air.

           PUSH IN for a closer look when suddenly, from inside --

           A FLASH of LIGHT 

           Accompanied by the chilling WHINE of a camera flashbulb. It 
           illuminates the interior for a split second, revealing 
           SILHOUETTES walking around, searching.

           More flashes paint a strobe-like picture of activity inside. 
           As we inch closer to the open front door, with each flash -- 

           INTERCUT: CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS

           Each photo POPS on screen just long enough to shock --

           -- Claw marks on the inside of a door. A hand drawn circle on 
           the photo highlights FINGERNAILS and FLESH embedded in the 
           wood grain.

           -- Bloody handprints on a cracked window.

           -- A wall covered in crimson blood stains.

           -- A middle-aged wife, CAROL, splayed out on a bed, mouth 
           agape. Her expression isn’t far from Munch’s “The Scream.”

           -- A middle-aged husband, PAUL, hanging off the bed, draped 
           atop Carol’s body. Stab wounds riddle his torso. A GUN lies 
           on the floor near his clenched fist, just out of reach.

           -- A blood trail down a hallway, leading us to -- 

           -- A third BODY, dead on the ground.

           -- A CLOSE UP reveals the face of ALVAREZ. An arrow denotes 
           the BULLET WOUND in his temple. 

           We push in on the dead man’s face. The picture slowly gives 
           way to reality --
           INT. DOUGLAS HOME - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           SHERIFF BURKE (50’s) a wiry bundle of nerves, chews tobacco 
           as he watches a FORENSIC TECH photograph Alvarez’s corpse. 

           Around him, a few other OFFICERS scour the scene. Aside from 
           the carnage, this house is pure Midwest Americana.

           A REPORTER, microphone in hand, CAMERAMAN behind him, sneaks 
           past the cluster of Officers --

                                 REPORTER
                        Sheriff Burke!

           Burke signals for the Officers to get rid of them. The 
           reporter and his cameraman are quickly “escorted” out, just 
           as another news van pulls up outside. 

           A mustached LIEUTENANT WADE, 40s, turns to Burke -- 

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                             (re: the reporters)
                        Gonna have to tell ‘em something.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        They can wait.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        Between us...?

           Burke looks around the scene, scrutinizing every detail. 
           Looking down at Alvarez, laying out his theory for Wade --

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        Alvarez here was working on the 
                        Douglas’s renovation. Had access to 
                        the house. Breaks in, wrong time. 
                        Doesn’t count on Paul and Carol 
                        fighting back. They do. 
                             (then)
                        Go upstairs and do a final sweep.

           Wade hurries up the stairs and out of sight. Suddenly, a 
           CRACKLE as a VOICE patches through over Burke’s RADIO:

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Boss, you need to come down here.

           INT. DOUGLAS HOME - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           FOLLOW Burke down a dark stairwell, into an unfinished 
           basement. From below, the WHINE of a camera flash -- 
           A small cluster of OFFICERS and FORENSIC TECHS point their 
           flashlights down a deep HOLE in the dirt floor. A few men 
           turn toward Burke, disturbed. The crowd parts. Burke looks 
           down into the pit, and now we see --

           THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN

           Beneath the blood and grime, porcelain skin, long red hair, 
           eyes WIDE OPEN, dead -- her body half exhumed. 

           A FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER steps down into the pit and takes 
           more photos. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                             (to the room)
                        We got an ID on her?

           Nobody responds. Burke stares into the young woman’s eyes. 
           The WHITES of her eyes are a cloudy, sickly GRAY. 

           Lt. Wade comes rushing down the stairs. He freezes at the 
           sight of the body.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        Who’s she?

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        For now, she’s a Jane Doe.
                             (then, off Wade)
                        You got something?

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        Nothing was stolen. Not a scratch 
                        on the outside of the house either. 
                        Doesn’t look like someone broke 
                        in... 

           He hesitates. Off Burke’s puzzled look -- 

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE (CONT’D)
                        Looks like they were trying to 
                        break out.

           As this revelation lands on Burke -- 

           The forensic photographer snaps a CLOSE-UP of Jane Doe. The 
           camera flash BLOOMS, bleaching the screen WHITE as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           The LIGHT of a dim fluorescent bulb hanging overhead. Moving 
           down, reveal we’re --
           INT. MORGUE - STAIRWELL - AFTERNOON

           We PUSH FORWARD slowly, down a dark, creaky stairwell, 
           descending deeper and deeper into the bowels of -- 

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           A windowless morgue. Lights FLICKER a jaundiced glow over 
           scuffed linoleum. Stale air DRONES through ancient vents. 

           The lonely corridor is lined with DOORS. The closest one 
           slightly ajar. We move toward it, pushing into --

           INT. MORGUE - STORAGE ROOM - AFTERNOON

           A dusty storage room packed with discarded morgue furniture 
           and equipment. In the center of the room, a dim LIGHT BULB 
           hangs from a flimsy string. It sways back and forth, ever so 
           slightly.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Further down the hallway, we pass by a rusty ELEVATOR door. 
           Up ahead --

           INT. MORGUE - OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           An office in disarray. In the corner, a desk drowning in 
           stacks of paperwork. On a mantel nearby, several framed 
           PHOTOGRAPHS, including -- 

           -- A ruggedly handsome MAN, 30s, dressed in full military 
           whites, at his WEDDING. His WIFE stands beside him, beautiful 
           in her white gown.

           -- The same couple, years later, standing in front of a 
           BUILDING, next to a SIGN which reads: “TILDEN MORGUE AND 
           CREMATORIUM.” We see the wife is now PREGNANT.

           -- The man and woman hold a cherubic BABY BOY in their arms. 
           Their expressions happy, their lives idyllic.

           -- The baby boy is now a TEENAGER. He’s with his parents. His 
           mother fawns over a Siamese KITTEN in her hands.

           -- The same boy at 18 years old. Beaming with youthful 
           confidence. He’s holding an ACCEPTANCE LETTER to the 
           PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAM at UT HOUSTON. His whole life in front of 
           him.
           -- The boy’s all grown up now, standing in front of the 
           morgue with ONLY his father. They’re both more solemn than in 
           any of the other photos.

           We glide past these photos and MOVE back to --

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           The hallway bends. A CONVEX MIRROR in the corner of the 
           ceiling reflects what the bend conceals from view. Around the 
           corner --

           An ADJACENT HALLWAY, several more DOORS on either side of it. 
           The nearest leads to --

           INT. MORGUE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           A drab, outdated, kitchen. The blue tint of the linoleum 
           casts a pall over the room.

           For a brief moment, we hear SCRATCHING from behind the walls. 
           Like an animal scurrying through the vents. 

           A faucet leaks into a grimy sink. Off of the slow DRIP DRIP --

           INT. MORGUE - CREMATORIUM - DAY

           A steel CREMATION OVEN inside this concrete-walled room, a 
           drawer jutting out from the center. A long EXHAUST CHIMNEY 
           extends vertically up from the oven to the ceiling.

           The constant HISS of a pilot light echoes softly. As we PUSH 
           FORWARD, a new sound joins in... Music? Softly, but then -- 

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Louder, as we PUSH down the hall. It’s classic rock. The rush 
           of RUNNING WATER joins the cacophony.

           Then, the crisp SNAP of latex --

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

           -- as GLOVES are snapped on. STAY TIGHT on the HANDS. These 
           hands are our guide -- what they touch, we see:

           Burnt skin. Crooked fingers fused together. Calloused feet. 
           Curled lips. Milky, cataractal eyes. 
           All belong to an old, black man. His name is OTIS HOWARD, and 
           mercifully, he’s dead. 

           And that faint rock song we heard before? It’s Creedence -- 
           “BORN ON THE BAYOU.” Only now it’s blasting.

           We catch glimpses of the two men conducting the autopsy --

           TOMMY TILDEN, 50s. A hard man with a low country charm you 
           only earn from decades of rolling with the punches. The kind 
           of charm you use to keep people from getting too close.  

           Next to him --

           AUSTIN TILDEN, 25, Tommy’s son. His boyish good looks can’t 
           hide a sensitivity and emotional wisdom beyond his years. 

           We recognize them as the father and son from the photographs. 

           Tommy’s in his element here, his passion evident in every 
           move he makes. But for Austin this is a job. He’s trying hard 
           to love it, and only half-succeeding.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS as they perform the various stages of an 
           autopsy on Otis:

           TOOLS -- both surgical and kitchen-grade -- are plucked from 
           a stainless-steel bin.

           ON TOMMY, expressionless, as he makes an INCISION, a Y-Cut, 
           REVEALING -- 

           A HEART, nestled between -- 

           TWO LUNGS, both charred BLACK. Meantime:

           A DIGITAL MINI-DV CAMERA 

           Captures the autopsy from a nearby tripod. The shot static, 
           unblinking. From a distance we witness --

           Other ORGANS -- each one REMOVED and WEIGHED on a pull-scale. 

           Tommy and Austin mark the weights and observations on a large 
           DRY ERASE BOARD on the wall. A jumble of numbers.

           Samples are sliced off of each organ and dropped into 
           formalin-filled mason jars. The jars are then placed into --

           A cluttered, industrial sized REFRIGERATOR. The shelves 
           packed with fingers, jaws, brain tissue, all similarly 
           suspended in formalin. 

           Back on Tommy and Austin as they begin to explore --
           Otis’s BRAIN. Austin slices a tissue sample, examines it 
           under a MICROSCOPE. 

           A CRACK as Tommy twists Otis’s head. He notes a small 
           FRACTURE at the back of the dead man’s skull. 

           The remainder of the organs are tied up in red plastic bags 
           and placed back into the open chest cavity.

           Used tools are tossed into a wash basin. Gloves snap off, 
           hands are wiped clean.

           The autopsy is FINISHED. We FLOAT ABOVE, revealing --

           THE AUTOPSY ROOM

           In all its glory. 

           Otis’s body is splayed out on an L-SHAPED OPERATING TABLE. 

           The back wall is lined with COLD STORAGE DRAWERS for other 
           bodies. 

           A large BUG ZAPPER is mounted on the adjacent wall, blue 
           fluorescent tube lights run its length. 

           As Austin finishes scrubbing his hands:

                                 TOMMY
                        Cause of death?

           A BEAT as Austin mulls this over. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Suffocation.

           Tommy looks down at the body. We see how he analyzes bodies, 
           focusing on --

           -- Otis’s arms, legs, and chest. Covered in third degree 
           burns. 

           -- Otis’s fingers, fused together from the fire.

                                 TOMMY
                        You’re telling me the smoke killed 
                        Mr. Howard?

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m not. He is.

           Tommy smiles. He loves arguing about this stuff. And he 
           especially loves seeing his son rise to the challenge.
           Austin points out several different sections of the body --

           -- Otis’s throat, lungs, the inside of his nasal cavity. All 
           blackened and charred from smoke inhalation.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Damaged nasal passage, damaged 
                        throat, damaged lungs -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        Damaged is one thing. But 
                        incompatible with life?

                                 AUSTIN
                             (thrown)
                        You’re telling me that’s not the 
                        C.O.D.? 

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m saying look before you leap.
                             (then)
                        Where’d the police find his body?

                                 AUSTIN
                        In his kitchen.

                                 TOMMY
                        House is on fire. Front door’s 
                        thirty feet away. And he’s not 
                        trying to get out?

           Austin looks back down at Otis and reconsiders. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        His lungs are damaged. But not 
                        nearly enough. He stopped breathing 
                        before that fire really got going. 

           Austin knows he’s missing something, but is stumped. Tommy 
           twists Mr. Howard’s head and points out the FRACTURE he found 
           at the base of his skull.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        See? Right underneath the occipital 
                        --

                                 AUSTIN
                        -- depressed skull fracture. 
                             (of course)
                        That explains the coning in his 
                        brain. 
                             (putting it together)
                        An intracranial hematoma. That’s 
                        what did it. Not the smoke. 
                                 TOMMY
                        Bingo. 
                             (then)
                        Every body has a secret. Some just 
                        keep their secrets better than 
                        others.

           Austin shakes his head. Frustrated. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Or some people are just better at 
                        finding them.

                                 TOMMY
                        You did good. You’ll get there.

           Austin looks away uncomfortably. Then down at Otis’s body --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Nobody’s even claimed him yet. He 
                        died because he was alone.

                                 TOMMY
                        He died because he fell and hit his 
                        head.
                             (then)
                        No sense in focusing on things you 
                        can’t change, son.

           Austin’s cell phone BUZZES. He takes it out of his pocket, 
           reads a TEXT, smiles. Tommy notices.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You going out tonight?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Emma wants to see a movie down at 
                        the El Dorado.

                                 TOMMY
                        That shithole’s still open?

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s the only theater in town, Dad. 
                        When was the last time you even saw 
                        a movie?

           Tommy smiles, trying to remember --

                                 TOMMY
                        She has Alzheimer’s, he builds her 
                        the house --
                                 AUSTIN
                        The Notebook?

                                 TOMMY
                             (with a nod)
                        Your mother made me go see it with 
                        her for her birthday. Fell asleep 
                        five minutes in.

           Austin and Tommy both laugh. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Took a while to crawl out of the 
                        doghouse from that one.

           Tommy’s laughter fades, replaced by a sadness in his eyes. 
           Austin’s about to say something, but Tommy abruptly tosses 
           Austin a PLASTIC TARP.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You alright finishing this up solo?  
                        I could use a smoke.

           Austin nods, Tommy leaves. Austin looks down at Otis. 
           Lifeless, milky white eyes stare back at him. As Austin 
           throws the TARP over Otis’s body --

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Tommy walks from one end of the morgue to the other, turning 
           down the two long hallways until he reaches the --

           STAIRWELL. Steep and two-level. The one we descended earlier. 

           Tommy climbs the stairs. His steps reverberate in this echo 
           chamber. He reaches a pair of STORM DOORS at the top and 
           pushes them open. 

           EXT. MORGUE - DUSK

           Tommy steps outside. Behind him we SEE the building from the 
           photos. An old sign reads: “TILDEN MORGUE AND CREMATORIUM.”

           Tommy looks out at the woods all around him. A thick haze 
           drifts through the trees, soaking up the last rays of 
           sunlight.

           Beneath the shadow of a LARGE OAK TREE, Tommy lights a 
           cigarette and takes a long drag.

           BLACK
           Somewhere, the steady THRUM of a freezer fan resonates. A 
           metallic CLANK -- and WHOOSH -- we’re SLIDING OUT, staring up 
           at the ceiling of:

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - DUSK

           One sliding drawer pulled out from the bank of steel crypts 
           lining the back of the room. Waiting for a resident.

           ON AUSTIN as he hoists Otis Howard onto the sliding tray and 
           pushes him back into the cold crypt. It CLANGS shut, joining 
           the wall of square metal doors arranged in a 4x4 grid. 

           Austin writes onto a small LABEL CARD -- “Howard, Otis. COD: 
           Intercerebral hemorrhage.” As he writes, he hears a 
           SCRATCHING behind the wall. Ignores it. 

           Austin picks up the label card and moves toward Mr. Howard’s 
           drawer. Moving across the grid, we notice the names of some 
           of the other bodies, other completed autopsies --

           -- Daniels, Irene. COD: Scleroderma.

           -- Tannis, Louis. COD: Strychnine Poisoning.

           Austin slides the label card into Howard’s drawer, just as --

           MOVEMENT across the room distracts him. Coming from the same 
           place as the scratching.

           From an open VENT in the wall, something emerging --

           A Siamese cat, STANLEY, leaps down in front of Austin. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Stanley.

           Austin notices Stanley’s holding something in his mouth. 
           Austin crouches down, sees it’s --

           A baby possum. Dead and mangled. Stanley drops the animal at 
           Austin’s feet. A gift. Austin’s disgusted. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Get outta here.

           Austin pulls a small RED BALL of YARN from the cabinet, 
           tosses it into the hall. Stanley runs out after it. 

           Once Stanley’s gone, Austin drops the dead possum in a 
           biohazard trash bin, then scrubs his hands in the sink. 

           Austin hears FOOTSTEPS out in the hall. He calls out:
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Stanley got another one. 

           No response. Then the sound of a door slowly CREAKING open. 
           Austin looks out to the hall -- nothing there. The hell? 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Austin steps out. At the end of the hall, he looks at the --

           CONVEX MIRROR

           No sign of anyone in its reflection. Austin walks down the 
           hall toward the elevator. Listening. Just his footsteps.

           He rounds the bend, looks down the adjacent hall to see -- 

           Nothing. 

           He peeks in the kitchen. Nothing. 

           Austin walks into the office. Flips on the lights -- empty.

           UNSEEN BY AUSTIN, directly behind him -- A SHADOW moving 
           quickly. He turns. Nothing. 

           He slowly backs out of the office as, from behind --

           TWO HANDS

           grab his shoulders, hard. Austin, startled, spins -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jesus Christ --

           Coming face to face with EMMA, Austin’s girlfriend. Twenty-
           three, tan, hipster bangs, a cursive “E” tattooed on her 
           forearm -- and a great laugh, currently at Austin’s expense. 

                                 EMMA
                        Wait, hold that pose. I gotta 
                        Instagram that.

                                 AUSTIN
                        How’d you get down here?

                                 EMMA
                        Key was in the elevator.

           Emma looks around, taking in everything around her --
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Gotta say, not what I was 
                        expecting. 

           -- especially a yellowed PICTURE, framed on the wall. The 
           Tilden morgue, circa 1919.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        You said it was old, but... wow.

           Austin’s annoyed and slightly nervous that Emma’s down here.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I said I’d meet you out front.

                                 EMMA
                        I got tired of waiting.

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Austin snakes around the Operating Table in the center of the 
           room. He hangs up his lab coat, grabs his jacket. Emma’s 
           right behind him, taking in the room.

                                 AUSTIN
                        My dad doesn’t like people down 
                        here. We talked about this --

                                 EMMA
                        You’ve seen me at my job, why can’t 
                        I see you at yours?

                                 AUSTIN
                        You work at a book store.

           Austin heads for the door, but Emma doesn’t want to go. She 
           hones in on the COLD STORAGE DRAWERS.

                                 EMMA
                        Can I see one?

                                 AUSTIN
                        No, you can’t see one.  

                                 EMMA
                        Why not?

                                 AUSTIN
                        You just can’t. My Dad would kill 
                        me.

                                 TOMMY (O.S.)
                        No I wouldn’t.
           Austin and Emma look up to see Tommy standing in the 
           entryway.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (to Tommy)
                        Are you serious?

                                 TOMMY
                             (to Emma)
                        Are you?

                                 EMMA
                        Hell yeah.

                                 TOMMY
                        If you think you can handle it --

                                 EMMA
                        I’m tougher than I look.

                                 TOMMY
                        I’ll take your word for it.
                             (then, re: drawers)
                        Go ahead. Pick one.

           Austin’s uncomfortable. Tommy shoots him a wink: it’s OK. 

           Emma scans the drawers, ultimately pointing to one on the 
           end.

           Austin pulls out a tray, revealing IRENE DANIELS, 80s, her 
           mouth and eyes SEWN SHUT.

                                 EMMA
                        Not that one, the one next to it.

                                 AUSTIN
                        A body’s a body.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, but I picked that one.

           Austin hesitates for a beat, then slides Irene back and opens 
           the next drawer -- “Tannis, Louis. COD: Strychnine 
           Poisoning.” -- a middle-aged MAN with a WHITE VEIL covering 
           his face.

           A breathless moment as Emma takes in the body in front of 
           her. Tied around Louis’s ankle is a SMALL BELL.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What’s that for?
                                 TOMMY
                        To make sure he’s dead.

           Emma’s confused. Tommy obliges her with brio, as if he were 
           telling a campfire tale --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Used to be a time when it was hard 
                        to tell a comatose person from a 
                        dead one, so coroners tied bells to 
                        every body in the morgue. If they 
                        heard a ting... Well, they’d know 
                        someone down there wasn’t quite 
                        ready to move on.

                                 EMMA
                        So why do you have one?

                                 TOMMY
                        I’m a bit of a traditionalist.

           Emma looks up at Louis’s veiled face.

                                 EMMA
                        Why’d you cover his face?

                                 TOMMY
                        Wasn’t much of a face left to 
                        cover. Point blank shotgun blasts 
                        tend to do that. 

                                 EMMA
                        Who shot him?

                                 TOMMY
                        We thought he did it to himself. 
                        Until we found strychnine in his 
                        system. 

           Tommy gestures to Louis’s STITCHED UP STOMACH --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Judging by the progress it’d made 
                        in his blood stream, he’d been dead 
                        over twenty-four hours by the time 
                        somebody blew his face off.

                                 EMMA
                        Why would someone do that?

                                 TOMMY
                        You sound like your boyfriend.
                             (then)
                        Leave the why to cops and shrinks. 
                                 TOMMY (CONT'D)
                        We’re just here to find cause of 
                        death. No more, no less.

           Transfixed by the veil, Emma reaches for it. Austin grabs her 
           wrist, startling her.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You don’t want to see that --

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s alright. 

           Austin looks at Tommy -- what the hell is he thinking?

           Emma’s hand inches closer to Louis’s face. She’s really going 
           for it. Steeling herself, she starts to lift the veil. And as 
           we’re about to see Louis’s mangled face --

           TING. TING. 

           The sound of the bell makes Emma jump back.

           ON TOMMY. Hand JINGLING the bell on Louis’ foot. He cracks a 
           smile. Austin laughs. Emma shakes her head, embarrassed, but 
           eventually laughing it off with them.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Austin and Emma head down the hall, away from the autopsy 
           room, toward the elevator. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        You should have seen your face.

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t wait to see yours when 
                        you’re not having sex tonight.

           Austin takes Emma’s hand, tender, affectionate.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Not even if I ply you with popcorn 
                        and sour patch kids? 

           Austin kisses her hand chivalrously.

                                 EMMA
                             (after a beat)
                        You’re lucky you’re cute.

           Just as they approach the elevator -- the old doors rumble 
           and burst open, releasing -- 
           SHERIFF BURKE like a bat out of hell. He nearly mows down 
           Emma with the GURNEY he’s pushing. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                             (to Austin)
                        Where’s your Dad?

           Burke can’t hide his nervous energy. Austin clocks the flecks 
           of blood on his uniform, the sweat on his brow, the BODY BAG 
           on the gurney.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Sheriff? What happened?

           Burke’s hesitant to answer, shooting a furtive look at Emma. 

                                 TOMMY (O.S.)
                        Bring it back here, Sheldon.

           Austin steps aside as Burke wheels the gurney toward Tommy, 
           who’s standing at the end of the hall.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad, if you need me to stay --

           Tommy waves Austin off.

                                 TOMMY
                        Don’t worry about it. You two go  
                        see that movie.

           Burke and Tommy round the corner and head to the autopsy 
           room. Austin watches, torn -- 

           As Emma presses the elevator button, chomping at the bit to 
           get out of there. The elevator doors open and she steps in. 
           Austin steps in after her. The old doors judder CLOSED.

           INT. MORGUE - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           A dim bulb barely lights the old elevator as it slowly 
           ascends, CREAKING and RATTLING the whole time. Emma looks 
           over at Austin -- he’s clearly conflicted. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re allowed to see a movie. 
                        Don’t look so guilty.

           Austin doesn’t respond. This isn’t the first time Emma’s had 
           to deal with this. Then:

                                 AUSTIN
                        You see the look on Burke’s face? 
                                 EMMA
                        Austin.

                                 AUSTIN
                        He wouldn’t be here this late if it 
                        wasn’t important --

                                 EMMA
                        Austin.

           The elevator lurches upwards, arriving at the GROUND FLOOR. 
           The doors OPEN, leading to a small foyer, and the outdoors 
           beyond. Emma steps out. Austin doesn’t. She stares him down.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (after a beat)
                        I can’t ditch him.

                                 EMMA
                        So you’re ditching me. Again.

           Austin’s silence says it all. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What’s he going to do when you go 
                        back to school?
                             (beat, off Austin)
                        You haven’t told him yet, have you?

           Austin avoids eye contact. The elevator doors begin to close, 
           and Emma puts out a hand, pressing them back open.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        You are still planning on going 
                        back, right?

                                 AUSTIN
                        He... needs me.

           Emma pauses, chooses her next words carefully.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s been two years. Your Dad can 
                        take care of himself. He’s fine.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (snapping)
                        And how would you know?

           Emma backs off, knows not to push further. The doors try and 
           close again -- this time Austin stops them. 
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        This won’t take long. Come back in 
                        a few hours, we’ll catch the 
                        midnight show, grab a drink at 
                        Thornton’s.

           Emma stares at Austin stone-faced. Austin smiles sheepishly, 
           grasping at straws --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Two drinks?
                             (then, off Emma’s stare)
                        C’mon. Eleven o’clock. I promise.
                             (breaking through)
                        Smile means yes. I know it’s in 
                        there...

           Emma can’t help but smile. Still, she plays coy.

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe.

           Austin smiles back at her. As the rusty elevator doors rumble 
           again, and CLICK closed, severing their line of sight, we 
           MATCH TO --

           A BODY BAG

           slowly being UNZIPPED. Darkness parting, glimpses of snow-
           white skin finally revealing --

           THE BODY OF JANE DOE.

           Beautiful. Pristine. Dead.

                                                           PULL OUT TO:

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

           Sheriff Burke finishes unzipping the bag, revealing the fully 
           nude corpse to Tommy. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        Found her in the basement of the 
                        Douglas place. No ID, no prints in 
                        the system. Nobody has a clue who 
                        she is.

                                 TOMMY
                        Don’t suppose you know how she 
                        wound up there.

           A feral HISSING sound draws their attention to -- 
           STANLEY

           Perched on a nearby cabinet, teeth bared, hair raised, as he 
           looks down at Jane Doe. Tommy sweeps Stanley off the cabinet, 
           shoos him out of the room. Annoyed --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Damn thing gets meaner by the day.

           Burke shows Tommy a dossier of CRIME SCENE PHOTOS:

           -- Paul and Carol Douglas, dead.

           -- Miguel Alvarez, dead.

           -- The body of Jane Doe half-buried in the pit beneath the 
           Douglas house.

           As Tommy flips through the pictures --

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        El Norte there was part of the 
                        construction crew. My best guess? 
                        He killed our Jane Doe. Needed a 
                        place to dump the body. Figured he 
                        was already digging a hole in the 
                        Douglas’s basement. Paul and Carol 
                        catch him in the act. Everybody 
                        ends up dead.

           Burke hears a very faint SCRATCHING behind the walls. Ignores 
           it. 

           Tommy hands the dossier back to Burke.

                                 TOMMY
                        Why didn’t you bring the other 
                        bodies?

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        You saw the photos.
                             (then)
                        Autopsies would be... unproductive. 

                                 AUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Still, would’ve been nice to 
                        inspect the crime scene.

           Burke and Tommy turn to see Austin standing in the doorway. 
           Austin and Tommy share a look.
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Burke)
                        Should have called us before you 
                        moved the body.

           Burke shoots a look to Tommy -- is Austin really questioning 
           his authority? Tommy shrugs. Austin’s right. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        I got news vans camped out front of 
                        the station. I got four people dead 
                        and I got no goddamn clue how any 
                        of it connects. So why don’t you 
                        spare me the lecture on protocol --

                                 TOMMY
                        Nobody’s trying to piss in your 
                        grits here, Shel -- 

           Burke gestures down to Jane Doe. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        I can sell a four-five-nine. I can 
                        give ‘em a story about a 
                        disgruntled Mexican and a B and E 
                        gone haywire.
                             (then)
                        What I can’t sell is her. I need to 
                        know how she died. Who she is. What 
                        she ate for breakfast --

           The sound of the SCRATCHING persists, louder now.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (CONT’D)
                        What, do you got rats down here?

                                 TOMMY
                        Possums. Exterminator’s come three 
                        times, can’t get rid of them.
                             (re: Jane Doe)
                        So what’s the timeline?

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        Tonight.

           Tommy and Austin look at each other, conferring. Tommy nods 
           to Burke. They’re in. Burke, relieved, shakes Tommy’s hand --

           Then EXITS, already on his walkie-talkie as he heads down the 
           hall. Tommy and Austin watch him go.

                                 TOMMY
                        You didn’t have to come back.
                                 AUSTIN
                        And let you have all the fun? Not a 
                        chance.

           Tommy smiles. Grateful. 

           Tommy and Austin turn and stare down at the body of Jane Doe 
           lying on the slab. Time to get started.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - LATER

           Classic rock from the radio plays over --

           A series of QUICK SHOTS. We watch as Tommy and Austin take 
           Jane Doe through the early stages of the autopsy --

           First to a SCALE, where the body’s weighed. Then to a WASH 
           BASIN, where it’s cleaned. And finally, to the slatted 
           OPERATING TABLE in the center of the room.

           Austin switches on the MINI-DV CAMERA, adjusts it to frame 
           the work space. Moving into the CAMERA’S POV:

                                 TOMMY
                             (to mini-dv camera)
                        This is the autopsy of an 
                        unidentified female, henceforth 
                        known as Jane Doe. Cause of death 
                        unknown.
                             (beat)
                        Performing the autopsy will be 
                        myself, Tommy Tilden, attending 
                        coroner. I will be assisted by 
                        Austin Tilden, certified medical 
                        technician.

           SNAP BACK to normal POV, Tommy still talking to the camera.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        This autopsy will be conducted in 
                        four stages. We will begin with the 
                        external evaluation, followed by an 
                        evaluation of the heart and lungs, 
                        then the digestive organs, and 
                        finally, the brain.

           ON THE RADIO, a weather report comes on. Faint enough that it 
           blends into the background. 
                                 WEATHERMAN (V.O.)
                             (thru radio)
                        Storm front coming up from the 
                        gulf... Rain’s expected to last 
                        through to tomorrow morning...

           Austin snaps CLOSE-UPS of Jane Doe’s distinguishing features 
           with an old-school POLAROID CAMERA.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Subject appears to be in her mid to 
                        late 20’s. Caucasian.

           Austin takes shots of her ARMS and LEGS.  

           Austin tacks each photo up on a CORK BOARD nearby, creating a 
           pictorial road map of the autopsy as he and Tommy progress.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Skin appears normal, no outward 
                        signs of bleeding or bruising. No 
                        scarring. No distinctive external 
                        markings.

           Austin moves toward Jane Doe’s face, snaps a photo --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hair, red. Eyes --

           Austin peels back an eyelid. Jane’s GRAY EYE stares right at 
           him. He lifts the other eyelid --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Gray?

           Tommy looks into Jane’s eyes, intrigued.

                                 TOMMY
                        Don’t see clouding like that unless 
                        a body’s been dead for days.
                             (then)
                        But there’s no lividity.

           Austin bends Jane Doe’s limbs.

                                 AUSTIN
                        No rigor mortis either. When do you 
                        figure she died?

           Tommy runs his bare hands over Jane’s pristine skin.

                                 TOMMY
                        She’s colder than the ambient 
                        temperature --
                                 AUSTIN
                        Conditions at the scene?

                                 TOMMY
                        Could be confounding factors.

           Austin presses on Jane Doe’s torso, his eyes drawn to her 
           narrow WAIST.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Look how small her waist is. 
                        Doesn’t fit the rest of her frame.

                                 TOMMY
                        Could be congenital. We won’t know 
                        until we open her up. Mark it on 
                        the board, we’ll come back to it.

           Austin walks over to the large DRY ERASE BOARD, next to the 
           cork board. Imprinted on it, an ANATOMY CHART. 

           As Austin marks up the chart, Tommy examines Jane’s WRISTS. 
           As he turns them, the sound of CRACKING beneath the skin. 
           Fragments of bone GRATING against each other.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Her wrists are fractured.

           Austin presses on Jane’s ankles. Ripples of broken bones 
           shifting beneath her skin. More GRATING, CRACKING --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Ankles, too.
                             (then)
                        How do you break your wrists and 
                        ankles without any outward signs --

                                 TOMMY
                        I see it all the time. Simple 
                        fractures -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Simple? Her joints are shattered.

           Austin denotes the fractures on Jane Doe’s wrists and ankles. 
           Meanwhile -- 

           Tommy uses a small tool -- a FILE -- to scrape a dark MUD-
           like substance from underneath Jane Doe’s FINGERNAILS. He 
           holds the file up to the light, confused.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What is that, dirt?
           Tommy rolls the substance between his fingers. It CLUMPS into 
           a small bead.

                                 TOMMY
                             (shaking his head)
                        It’s heavier. Denser. This is peat. 
                        Haven’t seen this stuff in ages.

           Austin circles around Jane’s body, notices the same soil 
           underneath her toe nails -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s under the toe nails too. 

           Tommy runs his hand through Jane’s hair, small particles of 
           the peat cling to his gloved fingers. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Trace amounts in her hair. She’s 
                        covered in it.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Like she might have been buried in 
                        it...?
                             (then, off Tommy)
                        Where do you find peat around here?

                                 TOMMY
                        You can buy it at a nursery. But 
                        naturally, in the ground? You’d 
                        have to go north. New England.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Think that’s where she’s from?

           Austin writes “New England?” on the Dry Erase Board. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Possibly. Or she could have just 
                        had an interest in horticulture.

           Tommy grabs a small PEN LIGHT. He bends down, shines the 
           light up Jane Doe’s nasal passage. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Nasal cavity presents no signs of 
                        inflammation, no fluid, no foreign 
                        substances.

           Tommy shines the light into Jane Doe’s left ear, then right --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Ear canals are clear.
           Austin pries open Jane Doe’s JAW as Tommy uses the pen light 
           to peer down her throat. 

           His eyes narrow. Seeing something.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Can’t say I was expecting that.

           Tommy moves aside to give Austin a clear look, shining the 
           light inside JANE DOE'S MOUTH -- 

           Her tongue is gone. A ragged stump of flesh is what’s left. 

           Austin tries to remain clinical.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (to mini-DV camera)
                        Tongue has been -- severed.

                                 TOMMY
                        Lacerations are crude, non-
                        surgical. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Could have bitten it off.  OD’d on 
                        something, tensed up --

                                 TOMMY
                        But these aren’t bite marks. See 
                        the striations?
                             (beat)
                        Looks like it was ripped out.

           Tommy marks the anatomy chart. His eyes dart from Jane Doe’s 
           tongue to her wrists, her ankles, her face. A theory 
           beginning to take shape --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen something like this 
                        before. About fifteen years back.
                             (then)
                        Human trafficking. Around Dallas. 
                        Two girls. Hands and feet bound 
                        tight to keep them from running. 
                        Cut out their tongues for making 
                        too much noise.

           Austin snaps a still picture. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        You think this was some sort of 
                        prostitution thing? A sex crime?
                                 TOMMY
                        Can’t rule it out.

           Austin’s about to snap another picture, when --

           Jane Doe’s NOSE TWITCHES.

           Austin lowers the camera, not sure if he imagined it. Just 
           when he’s ready to dismiss it --

           It twitches again. He leans in closer --

           A drop of blood trickles out of her nose.

           Tommy notices it too. Before either of them can say a word --

           A FLY

           Crawls out of the right nostril, engorged with BLOOD. It 
           scurries about Jane Doe’s upper lip, then buzzes away. Austin 
           swats it away as it flits about the room -- 

           Tommy reaches for a PERIODONTAL PROBE and continues examining 
           the inside of Jane Doe’s mouth.

           He notices a GAP where a rear tooth should be.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        She’s missing a molar on her left 
                        side. Take some impressions.

           At the other end of the room -- ZZZZZ -- the bug flies into 
           the zapper, dead. 

           Austin takes an old, steel MOUTH GUARD from the tray. As he 
           fills it with molding clay --

           Tommy’s probe picks out a thin, flaxen STRAND from deep in 
           Jane’s throat. Looks like a hair, but thicker. 

           Tommy holds it up to the light. What is this thing?

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE STRAND, MAGNIFIED

           beneath a microscope lens. It looks like a twisted bundle of 
           tiny cords. 

                                 AUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Looks like some kind of fabric.

           Austin pulls away from the microscope. Thinking. 
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe she was gagged?

                                 TOMMY
                        Bag it. We’ll send it out with 
                        toxicology.

           Austin places the fiber in a plastic bag, labels it, then 
           puts it in a tray with other samples waiting to be sent out. 

           From OUTSIDE, muffled by the walls, a rumble of THUNDER. 

           Tommy moves on, focusing on Jane’s thighs and groin --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        No external seminal fluid present.
                             (then)
                        Grab me a swab?

           Austin prepares a SWAB, and brings it over, hands it to 
           Tommy. We STAY ON AUSTIN as Tommy continues the exam.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        She’s torn up inside. There are 
                        ridges. Grooves in the tissue.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Abrasions?

                                 TOMMY
                             (nodding)
                        Cuts. Deliberate.

           Austin looks over Jane Doe’s body, as Tommy’s theory 
           percolates in his mind.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Severed tongue, shattered joints,  
                        vaginal trauma, the theory tracks --

                                 TOMMY
                        Still don’t have a concrete C.O.D. 
                        We got a ways to go.

           Austin looks up at a CLOCK hanging on the wall -- 9:45 PM. He 
           sighs. This is going to take longer than he thought.

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tommy speaks directly into the mini-DV camera --
                                 TOMMY
                        We’ll now proceed with the internal 
                        examination, starting with the 
                        heart and lungs.

           He turns to look at Jane and grabs a RUBBER BRICK from 
           beneath the operating table.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Help me with the block.

           Austin lifts the body. Tommy slides the block under her. The 
           object pushes Jane’s chest up and out, causing her neck and 
           arms to fall back. 

           Above them, from outside, Tommy and Austin can hear HEAVY 
           RAIN hitting the morgue. A Texas downpour on the way. 

           Austin hands Tommy a LARGE BLADE. Sharp, glinting.

           As Tommy prepares to use the blade, Austin looks up at Jane 
           Doe. At her EYES, gray and unblinking.

           The overhead lights FLICKER for an instant --

           And the radio fritzes out. STATIC filling the air. 

           Austin spins the dial, trying to find a station. Nothing 
           coming in at first --

           Until he finds a signal in the noise: the first few bars of a 
           1950’s “aw shucks” TUNE: 

           Open up your heart... and let the sun... shine... in...

           Tommy performs a Y-CUT on Jane Doe, beginning the internal 
           examination phase of the autopsy.

           On the radio, the song continues: 

           Mama told us something... that all of us should know... it’s 
           all about the devil and we learned to hate him so...

           As he cuts, Tommy looks up at Austin, what the hell is this 
           music? Austin gets the cue. He scans the airwaves, landing on 
           another classic rock station. 

           Tommy completes the Y-cut --

           As deep red fluid SEEPS out of the incision and drains off 
           through the slats in the table. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Never seen one bleed like that.
                                 TOMMY
                        Caused by a build up of pressure. 
                        Rare, but not unheard of.

           Austin takes a sample of Jane’s blood in a TEST TUBE. Places 
           it in the fridge, nestled between two BIOHAZARD BAGS. 

           Tommy PEELS back Jane Doe’s SKIN, pulling it aside to get to 
           the muscle beneath -- but he’s immediately struck by -- 

           DARKENED MARKS 

           Scattered inside the skin that previously covered her exposed 
           RIB CAGE. Like lesions or the bruising on a banana peel. Dark 
           brown, almost black. Spread out hive-like, without any 
           pattern.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What is that?

           Tommy looks at the marks, tries to make sense of them. Austin 
           slices off a small sample of skin.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Melanoma, maybe?

                                 TOMMY
                        On the inside? I wouldn’t bet the 
                        farm. But let’s see what the lab 
                        comes back with.

           Austin bottles the sample, labels it, starts to walk toward 
           the refrigerator. But something stops him cold.

           The refrigerator is bleeding.

           Blood seeps from the edge of the door, dripping down to the 
           floor, where a small amount has pooled. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Can you hand me the rib cutter?

           But Austin’s locked in on the fridge. He reaches out for the 
           door handle, almost afraid to open it --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                             (annoyed)
                        Today?

           Austin steels himself, opens the fridge to find --

           The biohazard bags around Jane Doe’s blood sample. One of 
           them is LEAKING.
           Austin exhales. But his relief quickly fades, knowing he has 
           to clean up the mess.

           Tommy turns and sees the bloody floor --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        What’d you do?

           Austin grabs the leaky bag out of the refrigerator, turns 
           around, shows it to Tommy as he drops it into the sink. He 
           then starts to clean up the blood with a cloth.

           Tommy grabs the RIB CUTTER from a nearby tray, takes it back 
           over to the operating table. 

           All around, the walls begin to ECHO softly with the sound of 
           driving rain rattling the pipes.

           Tommy hesitates, notices Jane’s ribs are constricted, cinched 
           in. He looks over at Austin.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You were right. Her waist doesn’t 
                        fit her frame. And it’s not 
                        congenital.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Then what is it?

                                 TOMMY
                        These bones were deliberately 
                        constricted. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        How does that even happen?

           Tommy shakes his head, can’t believe he’s about to say it --

                                 TOMMY
                        Well, if you wear one long 
                        enough... a corset.

                                 AUSTIN
                        A corset? You mean... a corset 
                        corset? 
                             (off of Tommy’s look)
                        Didn’t those go out of style a few 
                        hundred years ago?

                                 TOMMY
                        To each their own, I guess.

           We HEAR Tommy use the rib cutter to SNAP through the sternum. 
           The first thing they SEE -- 
           LUNGS. They’re BLACKENED as if by smoke inhalation. 

                                 AUSTIN
                             (taken aback)
                        What the --

           Tommy’s surprised too, but tries to remain clinical.

                                 TOMMY
                        Lungs severely blackened. Damage 
                        covers approximately ninety five 
                        percent of the surface area. 

           Tommy collects a small tissue sample from one of the lungs --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Wouldn’t have taken her for a 
                        smoker.

           Tommy examines the cross section of lung up close.

                                 TOMMY
                        Tissue’s almost entirely necrotic. 
                        She could have smoked ten packs a 
                        day for thirty years, it wouldn’t 
                        explain this.

                                 AUSTIN
                        But it killed her... However it 
                        happened...
                             (then, off Tommy)
                        Right?

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s possible. This kind of lung 
                        damage, though, I’d expect the body 
                        to be covered in third degree 
                        burns.

           Tommy tries to make sense of this disconnect. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        It’s like finding a bullet in the 
                        brain with no gunshot wound.

           The sound of SCRATCHING trickles in from down the hall. 

           Tommy removes and examines the HEART. INFLAMED SCARS line the 
           surface tissue. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Her heart’s marked up. Almost looks 
                        like it’s been cut.
                                 AUSTIN
                        Not just her heart.

           Austin gestures to the ORGANS still inside the body. Her 
           liver. Kidneys. Spleen. Thick raised lines mar the tissue. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think that is? Genetic 
                        defect?

           Tommy squints, taking a closer look.  

                                 TOMMY
                        If it was genetic, there’d be some 
                        sort of pattern. These are random. 
                        Look more like scar tissue.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Scar tissue?
                             (then)
                        From what?

           Tommy steps back, looks at Jane’s body. Gears shifting --

           As a dull THUD echoes off the walls outside the autopsy room. 
           Austin glances around -- what the hell was that? 

           But Tommy’s deep in thought, beginning to form a theory -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        Imagine all this internal trauma 
                        we’re seeing was reflected 
                        externally. Shattered wrists and 
                        ankles, fire-burned lungs, scarred 
                        organs. What would she look like?

                                 AUSTIN
                        She’d be mangled. Disfigured. 
                        Beyond recognition.
                             (beat)
                        But she’s not. She’s perfect.

                                 TOMMY
                        Which tells us...

           A beat as Austin thinks --

                                 AUSTIN
                        That someone did this very 
                        carefully...? 
                             (beat)
                        How the hell do you even do this?
           The lights FLICKER. A moment longer than before. Austin looks 
           up, noticing -- but Tommy’s on a roll.

                                 TOMMY
                        You want to kill someone, you shoot 
                        them. Or drown ‘em or poison ‘em, a 
                        million easy ways.

           Tommy looks over the scarred organs. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        But you don’t go to these lengths 
                        unless you want to make them 
                        suffer...

           SCRATCHING from down the hall -- louder, violent, more 
           feverish. Something clawing its way out from behind the wall. 

           Tommy and Austin turn as the sound crescendoes -- and 
           suddenly STOPS. They turn back -- and, after a beat --

           CRAAAASSSSSSH!

           A CLATTERING sound reverberates. Tommy and Austin look out 
           toward the hallway --

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’ll go.

           Austin peels off his gloves.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Austin moves down the hallway. It’s empty except for dense 
           patches of shadow that swallow up the meager light. 

           SCRAAAATCH. Like nails on metal. Austin follows the noise 
           further down the hall.

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Tommy considers Jane Doe’s SEVERED KIDNEY, his gloved fingers 
           brushing over the inflamed scars. He walks around Jane’s 
           body, taking in the rest of her organs. All scarred in the 
           same way. 

                                 TOMMY
                             (to Jane)
                        What happened to you?
           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Austin looks into the crematorium. Nothing there. He checks 
           the kitchen. Empty.

           As Austin rounds the bend at the end of the hall, out of the 
           corner of his eye he sees something in the CONVEX MIRROR.

           A SILHOUETTE. Standing still. 

           Austin freezes. Breath catching in his throat.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hello?

           No response. The SILHOUETTE doesn’t move -- 

           Still staring in the mirror, Austin takes a step forward, 
           peering around the bend, to find -- 

           An EMPTY hallway. It was just a shadow. A long beat, and --

           SCRAATTCHH. From just ahead. Coming from --

           INT. MORGUE - STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Austin feels his way to the middle of the storage room and 
           tugs the string on a HANGING LIGHT BULB. The light flicks on, 
           casting a faint glow over the piles of dusty junk scattered 
           throughout the room.

           Scratttchhh... Scratttchhh... 

           Austin searches for the source of the noise as cool air 
           WHISTLES through a large vent at the far end of the room. 

           A thin piece of BLUE TAPE is attached to the outside of the 
           grate. It flutters in the air stream.

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tommy paces around Jane’s body. Frustrated, he turns to the 
           dossier of crime scene photos, right where Burke left it. 
           Tommy opens it up, flips through the photos --

           Paul and Carol Douglas draped over each other, dead.

           Alvarez, dead.  

           Tommy absorbs the violence, searching for an answer these 
           photos don’t provide. He closes the dossier, returns to Jane.
           Tommy pulls back Jane’s skin -- he notices more of the bruise-
           like markings on the back of Jane’s CHEST CAVITY, previously 
           hidden by her heart.

           Tommy reaches to inspect the blotchy skin when suddenly --

           He winces, quickly draws his hands back. His right hand is 
           CUT, through the glove. Blood pools.

           Tommy looks back at the culprit: A JAGGED EDGE of RIB jutting 
           out from Jane’s torso. 

           Tommy moves over to the sink, tears off his gloves, plunges 
           his hands into the stream of water.

           INT. MORGUE - STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Austin listens for the scratching. But it’s stopped. About 
           ready to give up when -- 

           The air starts to SPUTTER. Something’s blocking the 
           ventilation system. Overhead, the hanging light bulb DIMS.

           Austin’s eyes fix on the vent. It sputters again and then --

           HRUMPH. The piece of blue tape goes limp. The air is OFF. 
           Austin stares up at the vent. Too high to reach. 

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           Tommy finishes scrubbing off his hand. As he watches the 
           BLOODY WATER spiral down the drain --

           HRUMPH. Tommy shuts off the water and looks up at the VENT.

           INT. MORGUE - STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Austin drags a rickety chair toward the silent vent. Climbs 
           up, the wood CREAKING beneath his weight. 

           Peering between the slats. The meager light barely intrudes, 
           but he can see a general SHAPE inside. Blocking the air. 

           Austin uses his fingers to unscrew the vent cover. Overhead, 
           the light bulb DIMS a bit more as the chair WOBBLES --

           Austin gets the two bottom screws off the grate, is about to 
           start unscrewing the ones at the top when --

           MOVEMENT and a GLINT of LIGHT from inside the vent distracts 
           him. He peers in closer. Then, within the darkness --
           EYES.

           Austin recoils, startled. The rickety chair teeters on it’s 
           uneven legs. As Austin reaches out for balance -- 

           His flailing hand KNOCKS the hanging light bulb, sending it 
           FLYING, shadows going wild -- as Austin CRASHES to the ground 
           and the bulb CRACKS against the wall, SHATTERING --

           The room goes dark.

           A beat. Austin, on the floor. In pain, but OK. Grunting, he 
           rolls over to see --

           Something in the light of the doorway: 

           FEET.

           Ghost pale. 

           Austin, on his knees, skitters backwards, spooked -- 

           As a LIGHT turns on.

           It’s TOMMY. The “bare feet” were just his white sneakers. 
           Standing next to a second hanging bulb, a fresh bandage on 
           his hand.

           He looks down at Austin, confused.

                                 TOMMY
                        The hell happened in here?

           Austin gets to his feet, brushing himself off. He picks up 
           the chair and climbs up again. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Something’s in the vent.

           Tommy hands Austin his pen light, which Austin shines into 
           the vent. Now able to see --

           RED YARN. Chewed. Torn. Austin pulls at it, drawing the yarn 
           into his hands. But as he goes --

           The yarn becomes sticky. Wet. And redder. BLOOD. Austin’s 
           eyes move down the length -- where the red yarn turns into 
           something else entirely --

           An open gash inside jet-black fur. A gnarled paw. A severed 
           tail. Light from outside the vent glints off of GLASSY FELINE 
           EYES. Austin realizes he’s looking at --
           STANLEY. What’s left of him. Blood pools around the gash 
           across his mid-section, as if he was attacked.

           Austin can’t bear to look at the eviscerated animal. He 
           climbs off the chair, turning back to Tommy. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Go back. I -- I’ve got this -- 

           But Tommy brushes by him. 

           Tommy peers in, sees Stanley splayed out. Only now do we 
           realize -- the cat is still alive, barely. Its breaths are 
           shallow, a painful death rattle.

           As he reaches deep into the duct, Tommy looks back at Austin. 
           Tommy feels around for a moment, then, suddenly, something 
           SNAPS. Stanley’s death rattle ceases instantaneously.

           CLOSE ON Tommy’s eyes. As they visibly sadden, we cut to --

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - LATER

           The CONVEX MIRROR. The warped REFLECTION of Tommy and Austin 
           walking down the hall. As they turn the bend --

           We SEE Tommy clasping a BLACK PLASTIC BAG, Stanley’s remains 
           contained inside.

           Tommy trudges toward the crematorium. Austin a step behind.

           INT. MORGUE - CREMATORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           A cast-iron OVEN DOOR opens up to a soot stained chamber.

           Tommy gently places the black bag inside, considers it for a 
           moment. Then, he slams the heavy door shut. 

           Tommy’s finger lingers over a button. When he presses it --

           Gas HISSES and pipes SHAKE as the beastly old oven awakens.

           INSIDE, low, yellow flames POP ON. 

           WHOOSH. A flash of fire reduces the black bag to ashes in a 
           matter of seconds.

           After the flames die down, the oven door opens. Through the 
           haze of heat, Tommy’s sad eyes take in all that’s left of 
           Stanley: a small, ashen pile.
                                 TOMMY
                        Can you give me a minute?

           Austin gets it. He turns and exits the crematorium --

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As Austin steps into the hall, his gaze is drawn back to the 
           convex mirror --

           But the hallway beyond is empty. Of course. Why wouldn’t it 
           be? A long beat -- then he turns away and walks toward the 
           autopsy room.

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

           The room is empty. Austin’s not there yet.

           Bloody latex gloves and scraps of paper towel near the sink. 
           Tools strewn about a tray. Jane Doe on the slab. The tiniest 
           stream of blood drips from her body. 

           The quiet scene is disturbed by an incessant BUZZ. A fly 
           lands on Jane Doe’s face. We MOVE IN for a closer look --

           The creature crawls onto Jane Doe’s glassy eye, then buzzes 
           away. In the BACKGROUND, we notice the mini-dv camera. 

           Suddenly, we SHIFT INTO the mini-dv POV -- 

           Everything feels more voyeuristic. The video feed GLITCHES 
           for a split second. In the corner of the frame --

           Austin enters. He washes his hands. Remnants of Tommy’s blood 
           at the bottom of the sink.

           We SHIFT OUT OF the mini-dv POV. 

           Austin grabs a fresh pair of gloves when --

           CREEEAAAAKKK

           The sound of a HINGE moving.

           Austin turns to face the wall of drawers behind him, sees -- 

           A MORGUE DRAWER slowly OPENING. 

           Austin stares at the drawer, at the abyss of blackness behind 
           it. He moves toward it. His footsteps slow, tentative. 

           The drawer swings open wider.
           Austin reaches for the door. Just as his fingers are about to 
           grab the handle --

                                 TOMMY (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Austin spins around to find Tommy standing in the doorway. He 
           catches his breath, startled. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        The drawer... must not have closed 
                        it all the way before.

           Austin turns back to the open drawer, slams it shut. Making 
           damned sure it’s closed this time.

           Tommy heads toward the sink. He and Austin washing their 
           hands, side by side, silent. Then:

                                 TOMMY
                        Stanley was a pain in the ass.
                             (off Austin’s smile)
                        But he was your mother’s. One of 
                        the few things of hers I had left. 

           Tommy’s words hang in the air. Austin searches for the right 
           response.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I miss her too --

                                 TOMMY
                        Let’s keep going.

           Tommy moves back to Jane Doe on the slab. Nothing else Austin 
           can do at this point except join in.

           Tommy addresses the mini-DV camera.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        This is stage three of the autopsy 
                        of Jane Doe. We’ll begin 
                        examination of the stomach and 
                        gastrointestinal system.

           Tommy walks to the other side of the exam table, making 
           precise cuts around Jane Doe’s STOMACH AREA.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad.
                             (then)
                        You can talk to me.
                                 TOMMY
                        Not keeping anything from you.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You put up this... act for people, 
                        but --  

                                 TOMMY
                             (firm)
                        I’m fine.

           The tense moment hangs in the air. 

           Tommy’s gloved hands catch onto something in Jane’s 
           intestinal tract. He pulls at it, holds it up to the light --

           A decayed green STALK. Wilted, violet PETALS hang off of it.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What is that, a flower?

           Tommy, wheels spinning, pulls a REFERENCE BOOK off a shelf. 
           Quickly scanning -- pictures of plants flipping by -- then:

                                 TOMMY
                             (with recognition)
                        Blackhedge. 

           Austin looks at the reference book over Tommy’s shoulder.

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s poisonous?

                                 TOMMY
                        Paralyzing agent. Probably explains 
                        the inflammation in her organs. 
                        Here’s the weird thing:

           He points to text next to the photo of the Blackhedge:

           Indigenous to Massachusetts. 

           On the board, Tommy draws a circle around “New England.”

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I’d say that settles it. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        But how’d she get down here? 

                                 TOMMY
                        One thing at a time. I’m just 
                        trying to find something that makes 
                        sense.
           Overhead, the lights flicker as the weather report fades back 
           in on the radio.

                                 WEATHERMAN (V.O.)
                        Gusts now being reported at up to 
                        sixty miles per hour, with rain 
                        expected to top three inches within 
                        the hour...

           A BEAT. Austin treads delicately -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        What if we just... finished this 
                        one up in the morning?

                                 TOMMY
                        Burke needs a C.O.D. tonight. We’re 
                        not even close.
                             (then, pointedly)
                        When I start something, I finish 
                        it.

           Austin wants to fire back -- but holds his tongue.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        You want to leave, leave. 

           Austin absorbs this. His father’s closed off, impenetrable. 

           A beat -- and then Austin snaps on his own gloves. He’s here 
           to work.

           Tommy, acknowledging, reaches into Jane Doe’s stomach, begins 
           feeling around -- 

           And his eyes brighten. He lifts something up from inside the 
           stomach --

           A SMALL ROUND PELLET

           No bigger than a golf ball.

           Tommy holds it up to the light, examining it closer. It’s 
           ridged. Tommy notices a tiny CRACK. He picks at it, surprised 
           to find --

           The pellet begins to UNRAVEL.

                                 AUSTIN
                        The hell...?

           As Tommy continues to unravel it, we realize it’s --
           A frayed section of FABRIC. The more Tommy pulls it apart, 
           the bigger it gets. When he finally unfurls it completely --

           Something CLATTERS to the ground. Lands right at Austin’s 
           feet. He looks down, picks it up. It’s a HUMAN TOOTH.

           Tommy and Austin share a look, unnerved by this discovery.

           MOMENTS LATER --

           The TOOTH lies in a small petri dish.

           Tommy and Austin examine the fully unraveled piece of fabric, 
           flattened out on a counter. About eight inches wide and half 
           as tall.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Looks like some kind of shroud.

           Tommy handles the shroud -- the texture brittle, the fabric 
           so frayed and thin that light easily penetrates it. 

                                 TOMMY
                        And old.

           He rubs a corner of the fabric between his fingers. The 
           fibers dissolve into powder. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Really old.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Stomach acids should have dissolved 
                        this thing. The fact that it’s 
                        intact at all is amazing.

           Austin pulls a desk lamp over to the fabric. Light spills 
           over it, revealing -- 

           A FADED DRAWING stained deep in the cloth. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What is that? 

           MOVING OVER the image as they inspect it closely -- 

           A WOMAN, in pain, bent backwards over a table -- a flower 
           clutched between her bared teeth -- 

           As a nightmarish demon ERUPTS from her hollow stomach. The 
           pale lines show remnants of its distorted face, black eyes -- 

           Encircling the image, a series of faded WORDS, hard to 
           decipher.
           Beneath this strange tableau, a cryptic signature: 

           LEV US XXXXVII

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        Leave us?

           Tommy narrows his gaze. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Looks like Latin. 

           Austin WRITES it all up on the big board. Taking a step back -
           - but he still can’t make sense of it.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m more of a Pig Latin guy. But 
                        these...
                             (looking at: XXXXVII)
                        ...have to be Roman Numerals. Adds 
                        up to... forty-seven? 

                                 TOMMY
                        You sure? I thought forty was “XL”?

           A beat. They’re stumped. But Austin suddenly gets an idea. He 
           heads to the fridge.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Austin grabs a sample out of the fridge -- the strand of 
           fabric they pulled from Jane Doe’s mouth earlier.

           Austin compares the fabric from the bag with the “shroud”. 
           It’s a MATCH. 

           But he’s not done yet.

           He grabs the TOOTH out of the Petri Dish. He opens up Jane’s 
           mouth --

           The tooth fits perfectly into where Jane was missing one.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (re: the shroud)
                        Someone forced her to swallow it. 
                        Forced her so hard she lost a 
                        tooth.

                                 TOMMY
                        And the drawing? 
                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s religious. Possibly 
                        ritualistic.

           Tommy looks at the shroud, at the image of the woman, bound 
           to an altar. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Every ritual has its own method. 
                        What M.O. have we seen so far?

           As Tommy gazes down at Jane Doe’s body, Austin heads to the 
           Dry Erase Board. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Whoever did this didn’t just want 
                        her dead. They wanted her dead in a 
                        specific way. 

           We see different sections of the body as Austin talks about 
           them --

                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        First, they bound her.

           -- We SEE Jane Doe’s WRISTS and ANKLES. Dangling. Broken. 
           Shattered.

                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        Then they ripped out her tongue.

           -- Close on Jane Doe’s OPEN MOUTH. Without a TONGUE. 

                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        Poisoned her. 

           -- We see the BLACKHEDGE flower lying in a sample tray.

                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        Forced her to swallow the cloth.

           -- We see the STRAND in Jane’s mouth. Then the SHROUD. And 
           her broken tooth. 

                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        Then the cuts... The internal 
                        mutilation...
                             (putting it together)
                        Stabs...

           -- The scarring on her HEART, KIDNEYS, other ORGANS.
                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        Then, if all that wasn’t enough, 
                        they burned her.

           -- On Jane Doe’s BLACKENED LUNGS.

           BACK ON AUSTIN

           Piecing it together. Energized.

                                 AUSTIN
                        She was a human sacrifice. 

           The WEATHERMAN chimes back in from the radio -- 

                                 WEATHERMAN (V.O.)
                        ...flash flood warning now in full 
                        effect for all of Hardin County, 
                        along with tornado sightings in 
                        Chandler and Noonday...

           Tommy’s clearly still troubled. Shaking his head --

                                 TOMMY
                        Impossible. 
                             (then)
                        How do you kill a person like that 
                        without leaving a trace on the 
                        outside? She doesn’t even have a 
                        goddamn broken nail. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Maybe if we find out why she was  
                        tortured --

                                 TOMMY
                        You want psychology, stick with the 
                        living. Down here, if you can’t see 
                        it, can’t touch it? It doesn’t 
                        matter. 

           From outside, we can hear the STORM growing more intense -- 
           THUNDER rumbles faintly from above. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        These bodies are not just C.O.D’s. 
                        They had lives.

           Tommy’s eyes drift back down to Jane’s body.

                                 WEATHERMAN (V.O.)
                        ... trust me when I tell you, this 
                        is not a storm you wanna get caught 
                        in, folks...
                                 AUSTIN
                        This happened to her for a reason.

                                 TOMMY
                        And what might that be? 
                             (holding up the shroud)
                        This?

           ON JANE’S GRAY EYES. 

           The radio STATICS OUT, but just for a moment. The voice 
           returns. But now it’s louder, its tone somehow... different. 
           As if it’s talking directly to them --

                                 WEATHERMAN (V.O.)
                        ...one thing’s for sure. You’re not 
                        going anywhere.

           Austin turns to Tommy. Did you hear that?

           ON THE RADIO

           A SONG begins to play. We recognize it.

           Mother told me something... that all of us should know...

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad... I think maybe we should get 
                        out of here.

           But Tommy’s not listening. He’s staring down at Jane’s open 
           chest cavity, seeing something he didn’t see before.

           It’s all about the devil... and I’ve learned to hate him 
           so...

           Tommy pulls back a FLAP of Jane Doe’s skin. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Help me with this.

           Resigned, Austin grabs a pair of FORCEPS, helps Tommy lift 
           back a larger section of Jane Doe’s skin.

           They say he causes trouble... When you let him in the room...

           They pull the flaps of skin all the way back, until they’re 
           spread flat on the table --

           Both Tommy and Austin’s faces suddenly go ashen.

                           TOMMY
                                                         AUSTIN
           My God.
                                              Holy shit.
           We RISE UP for a Birds-eye view of Jane Doe’s body. 

           Her skin is covered with the discolored marks Tommy and 
           Austin have been seeing all night.

           But they’re not just bruises. 

           From this angle, they connect, forming an unnatural PATTERN:

           An ancient, insidious SYMBOL. 

           Scrawled onto the inside of her skin.

           He will never ever leave you... If your heart is filled with 
           gloom...

           PUSH IN ON JANE’S EYES. Then --

           CREEEAAAAAAKKKK 

           The familiar sound of a DRAWER creaking open. Austin turns to 
           SEE --

           A DRAWER UNLATCHED, ever so slightly. 

           So let the sun... shine... in... face it with a grin...

           The lights FLICKER. Then, as Tommy and Austin stare at the 
           terrifying pattern etched into Jane Doe’s skin --

           Smilers never lose... and frowners never win...

           The overhead lights in the morgue SHATTER. Deafeningly loud 
           and shocking. Glass explodes in a violent burst, then --

           DARKNESS. The lights in the morgue SHUT OFF completely. A 
           moment of horrible, deafening silence.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad!
                             (beat)
                        Dad!

           Austin fumbles in his pocket, takes out his CELL PHONE. He 
           flips it open, there’s enough light from the small glow of 
           the phone for him to see --

           TOMMY. Staring at the wall. His face expressionless, frozen. 

           Slowly, Austin moves his phone, shining the small light onto 
           the wall where Tommy’s staring.

           Austin’s face drops.
           ALL OF THE MORGUE DRAWERS ARE WIDE OPEN.

           The TRAYS jut out, as if EJECTED. 

           There are no BODIES on them. They’re EMPTY.

           Austin, trembling, turns to Tommy. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        We gotta get out of here.

           But Tommy has checked out. Staring at the drawers, trying to 
           make sense of it all.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Dad!

           He GRABS his father’s arm, which SNAPS Tommy awake. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Let’s go.

           Austin grabs a FLASHLIGHT from a nearby cabinet. Turns it on.

           His hand trembles. The weak yellow beam of light shakes 
           wildly, illuminating everything and nothing at the same time.

           Tommy and Austin grope their way toward the door --

           Every sound impossibly loud in the darkness -- their 
           footsteps, their breathing -- the open drawers CLACKING on 
           their hinges -- 

           They find the door and stumble into:

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The hallway is pitch black, but for the weak beam of light.

           The only sounds are the wind and rain assaulting the morgue 
           from above. 

           Tommy and Austin move forward, slowly. Following the 
           flashlight’s beam.

           Austin points the flashlight left. Then, as he points it to 
           the right --

           A heavy GRUMBLING noise. The walls start to shake. Austin and 
           Tommy look at each other, frightened, unable to process --

           As the noise builds to a steady, mechanical GRRRRR -- 
           Lights BLINK ON throughout the morgue.

                                 TOMMY
                             (relieved)
                        The generator.

           But the lights struggle to stay on. Like flickering candles.

           Tommy and Austin walk toward the bend in the hallway. Heading 
           for the elevator.

           Austin puts out his hand, stopping his father. Looking up at 
           the convex mirror -- 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Just -- wait --

           Staring at it -- but nothing’s there. Safe. Pressing on, 
           heading to the elevator --

           Where Tommy hits the call button. Nothing happens.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        There’s not enough power.

           Tommy slaps the button again -- and again -- rising panic --

           Austin seizes Tommy’s hand. Stops him. Thinks he’s heard 
           something. 

           Silence. Then --

           A crashing BOOOOM from up above. 

           So heavy it shakes dust and debris loose from the ceiling. 

           Austin freezes. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What the --

           Tommy looks around. No movement. 

           A beat. Total silence. A plan:

                                 TOMMY
                             (whisper)
                        The stairs.

           Tommy rushes toward the stairwell, Austin a step back. 
           Glancing behind him as he goes. 
           INT. MORGUE - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tommy rushes up the stairs, straight for the exit, Austin 
           trailing. At the top of the spiral staircase, Tommy fumbles 
           with the lock for the STORM DOORS -- 

           As Austin peers over the railing, into the half-darkness 
           below, shadows just barely coalescing -- 

           Tommy pushes the doors up, but they WON’T OPEN. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Help me!

           Austin breaks away from the railing and rushes to help Tommy 
           push on the doors -- 

           Which CRACK open. But only an inch, GRINDING to a halt. 

           Through the narrow crack, RAIN pours in, splashing on Tommy 
           and Austin. Looking out into the night to see -- 

           The massive FALLEN OAK TREE, barricaded against the door. 
           Blocking their exit. The cause of the BOOM they heard in the 
           hallway. Rain pools on the floor --

           Tommy backs off and the doors fall shut. Austin pounds his 
           fist against the door in frustration. 

           No clue what to do. They’re literally stuck -- and then:

           Austin rips his cell phone from his pocket and dials 911. The 
           call takes a second, the cell dialing, waiting -- 

           And connecting. Austin brightens -- 

           But it cuts off. No signal. No bars. Austin searches 
           frantically for reception. Finally getting one bar, hitting 
           REDIAL. It RINGS! Then -- 

           Dies. Not the signal -- the power. It’s shot.  

                                 AUSTIN
                        Fuck!

           Austin tries turning it back on. But it’s no use.

                                 TOMMY
                        The office.
                             (off Austin)
                        The landline.

           Austin peers over the railing, into the half-darkness of the 
           stairwell below. Then back at Tommy.
           Neither of them wants to go first.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Tommy and Austin emerge from the stairwell. The office is 
           down the hall, before the bend.

           They move toward it, quickly but aware. 

           Austin’s footsteps echo. 

           Then Tommy’s footsteps, a few paces behind. Then --

           A THIRD set of footsteps.  

           Bare feet SLAPPING against the floor. Coming from somewhere 
           up ahead.  

           Tommy and Austin freeze. 

           The footsteps stop. 

           Confused and scared, Austin looks at Tommy.

           They eye the office door. As Austin takes a step toward it --

           The FOOTSTEPS.

           Louder, heavier, faster. But now they’re coming from 
           somewhere else.

           Tommy and Austin BURST INTO A RUN, heading for the door -- 

           The footsteps getting faster, closer. Right around the bend.

           Tommy throws open the door to the office -- 

           INT. MORGUE - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Both of them running inside as Tommy SLAMS the door shut 
           behind Austin and double locks it.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (breathing hard)
                        What the hell was that?

           Tommy doesn’t answer. He goes to his desk and picks up the 
           LAND LINE PHONE. There’s a dial tone. He punches buttons --

           RINGING. It’s working. 
                                 TOMMY
                        Thank god.

           Then:

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Hardin Coun -- eriff -- epartment --

           STATIC breaking up the operator’s words. A bad connection.

                                 TOMMY
                             (frantic; into phone)
                        This is Tommy Tilden. We need help. 
                        It’s an emergency --

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                             (through static)
                        I’m sorry -- trouble hearing --

                                 TOMMY
                             (loud, emphatic)
                        Put Burke on the phone!

           A brief SILENCE on the other end of the line. Then --

           TING.

           The sound of a bell.

           That bell.

           Coming from down the hall.

           Tommy and Austin look at the door.

           A voice draws Tommy’s attention back to the phone.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (V.O.)
                             (through static)
                        This is Burke.

                                 TOMMY
                        Sheldon, it’s Tommy. You need to 
                        get over here. NOW.

           Burke’s fragmented voice fights through static:

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (V.O.)
                        Tommy? -- you? -- can’t hear --

                                 TOMMY
                        Sheldon? ... Sheldon! ... We’re 
                        trapped down here, goddammit! 
                                 SHERIFF BURKE (V.O.)
                             (faint, fading)
                        Tommy...

           TING.

           Just steps away.

           Tommy tenses, glances back at the door. He speaks quietly, 
           but forcefully, into the phone:

                                 TOMMY 
                        Sheldon. Please. 

           But it’s just static on the other end. 

           Tommy clicks the phone off. He tries to click it back on, but 
           the line is DEAD. 

           All connection to the outside world severed. 

           Tommy and Austin share a look, taking this in.

           TING.

           Right outside the door.

           Austin slowly kneels down to the floor, looking through the 
           small space under the door, where he sees --

           A PAIR OF FEET

           Decayed, bloodless, dead. A small BELL tied around one ankle.

           Tommy blanches. 

           A BANG at the door. It RATTLES on its hinges. 

           Tommy and Austin jump back -- as another BANG -- harder, more 
           insistent -- shakes the wall. Tommy backing up now -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad!

           Austin’s at a filing cabinet, pushing hard. Tommy coming to 
           help, the two of them straining, the cabinet’s weight GOUGING 
           a furrow in the floor as they shove it against the door --

           The door handle starts to RATTLE violently. Then the whole 
           door starts to SHAKE. The cabinet, too --

           Tommy and Austin push back against the filing cabinet with 
           everything they’ve got, straining -- losing the battle --
           And then, suddenly, the pounding stops.

           Stillness. No ‘ting.’ No banging.

           But neither Tommy nor Austin trusts the silence. Austin’s 
           breath comes in short, quick bursts.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What -- the fuck -- is going on?

           Tommy tries to calm his son. To calm himself, too:

                                 TOMMY
                        Look at me. Austin, look at me.  

           But Austin’s not listening. He’s lost in his own thoughts.

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s her. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Her?

           Austin wavers. He almost doesn’t want to say --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jane Doe. 

                                 TOMMY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Everything was fine until Burke 
                        wheeled her through the door.

                                 TOMMY
                        Son --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Until we cut into her.

                                 TOMMY
                        You’re talking about a dead body --

                                 AUSTIN
                        No. Her injuries. Those... marks 
                        all over her. She is not just a 
                        dead body. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Then what the hell is she?

           Beat.
                                 AUSTIN
                        Something else.

           A long moment as this registers. Their silence broken as --

           Austin notices the bandage on Tommy’s hand. SOAKED through 
           with blood.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Your hand.

           Tommy sees the blood. Drops on the floor, on the filing 
           cabinet, on the walls. It’s everywhere. 

           His looks across the room, toward a small BATHROOM. Holding 
           his hand as he steps INSIDE, hitting the lights --

           Which don’t work. He flicks the switch -- nothing. But just 
           enough light spills in from the office to see the room.

           Tommy rinses his hand in the sink. The blood spirals down the 
           drain. 

           Behind Tommy, a toilet and a shower. 

           In the office, Austin leans against the file cabinet. Spent.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        We could have left. 

           Tommy doesn’t respond. He grabs a first aid kit from the 
           cabinet beneath the sink, pops it open.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to leave. 

           Still, Tommy’s silent. Austin leans forward, watching his 
           father wrap his hand in fresh gauze.

           THE SHOWER CURTAIN BEHIND TOMMY 

           suddenly moves, ever so slightly. Fluttering in a nonexistent 
           breeze. Austin, narrowing his eyes --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Dad...

           When Austin sees, behind the curtain, a SHADOW. Something 
           standing in the shower, right behind Tommy. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Dad!

           Tommy turns to Austin, his back toward the shower now -- 
           As the curtain is suddenly RIPPED off the rod, out at Tommy -- 

           Austin LUNGES FORWARD -- 

           As the bathroom door SLAMS CLOSED in his face. 

           From behind the door, Tommy SCREAMS.

           Austin RATTLES the door knob -- it’s locked. He POUNDS on the 
           door, trying to get into --

           THE BATHROOM

           In complete DARKNESS. Quick FLASHES -- 

           Tommy, THROWN headlong into the mirror. Assaulted by an 
           unseen force.

           Glass SHATTERS. Walls RUMBLE.

           Something SLASHES OUT, drawing blood -- Tommy gasps --

           IN THE OFFICE

           Austin hears all of it. He RAMS the bathroom door with his 
           shoulder. Trying to break it down.

           IN THE BATHROOM

           Tommy’s thrown to the floor. His head bounces hard off the 
           tile. Blood trickles down his forehead.

           Through the darkness he sees a glimpse of --

           GRAY EYES

           Tommy tries to get up, but A WITHERED HAND grabs him around 
           the neck and forces him back down. Tommy SCREAMS out in pain.

           OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM

           Austin CHARGES the door. The wood buckles.   

           He rams it again. Harder. His shoulder CRACKS, and he sinks 
           in pain. Gritting his teeth, Austin rears back and with one 
           final blow, BUSTS INTO:

           THE BATHROOM

           It’s in shambles. The mirror shattered on the wall. Streaks 
           of BLOOD smeared all over the sink. 

           Austin scans the room. Nothing. Then sees --
           Tommy. A broken, trembling heap on the floor. Austin rushes 
           to him. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What happened??

           Tommy doesn’t respond. He’s in shock.

           From behind them -- the sound of feet SLAPPING unnaturally 
           fast against linoleum, of something GRINDING, the office door 
           OPENING --

           Austin spins to find: 

           The filing cabinet’s been pushed aside. The door to the 
           office is WIDE OPEN. The hallway beyond, empty.

           Whatever was in there snuck right past them.

           Austin turns back to Tommy. He crouches down next to his 
           father, notices --

           PATCHES OF BLOOD. Seeping through the back of Tommy’s shirt. 

           Austin slowly peels the shirt up, exposing --

           CLAW MARKS sliced into Tommy’s back. A deep GASH along his 
           rib cage.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, god --

           He quickly grabs the first aid kit and starts disinfecting 
           the wound. Dressing it with the last of the gauze. Tommy, 
           wincing in pain. 

                                 TOMMY
                        They were... gray.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What?

                                 TOMMY
                        Its eyes. 
                             (then)
                        It had her eyes.

           Austin processes this. A thought forming in his head as he  
           helps Tommy to his feet. 

           Austin starts to walk Tommy to the door.

                                 AUSTIN
                        C’mon.
           Tommy grabs his arm -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        What are you doing?

                                 AUSTIN
                        She’s doing this to us. You nearly 
                        got killed in there. You said it 
                        yourself, that thing had her eyes. 
                        If I hadn’t gotten inside...
                             (beat)
                        If we wait, we’re dead.

           It lands on Tommy: they’re out of options. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        We have to get rid of her. 

                                 TOMMY
                        ...How?

           Austin considers this for a moment. Nothing coming -- 

           But then he’s got it.

           Austin nods to the open door, looking down the hall -- 
           drawing Tommy’s gaze to the convex mirror outside. In it’s 
           reflection, a familiar room just around the corner:

           The crematorium.

                                 AUSTIN
                        We’re going to burn her. 

           Tommy absorbs this, accepting it. 

           They both look toward the office door and hallway beyond. 
           Bracing themselves for what they have to do.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Tommy and Austin step out of the office. Keeping an eye on 
           the hall. Scanning rapidly. But first: 

           There’s something on the ground in front of them.

           Austin bends down to pick it up. It’s --

           A WHITE VEIL. The one that once covered the face of Louis, 
           the shotgun victim.

           The lights in the hallway flicker.
           Austin drops the veil; it flutters to the ground.

           He and Tommy look ahead, toward the convex mirror. 

           The path is clear. All the way to the autopsy room.

           Tommy and Austin make their way down the hall. 

           The sound of MOVEMENT from one of the rooms. Something 
           SKITTERING fast, rapid motion -- but then it’s gone.

           Tommy spots the FIRE ALARM on a nearby wall, an EMERGENCY AXE 
           behind protective glass. He rears back with his elbow --

           And SMASHES the glass. He pulls the fire alarm and --

           Nothing. No alarm. Silence. 

           Tommy grabs the FIRE AXE. Grips it tightly. Making their way 
           down the hall --

           Passing open doors as they go. Stepping to the far side of 
           the hall each time, as far away from the doors as they can.

           But each room is empty. Just the sounds of their breaths and 
           footsteps. They round the corner --

           And head toward the autopsy room at the end of the hall.

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

           Tommy and Austin re-enter the dimly lit room, the door 
           closing behind them.

           It’s just as they left it. The DRAWERS still open. In the 
           center of the room --

           JANE DOE. Gray eyes staring at the ceiling. A beat as they 
           stare at this dead, immobile thing, and then Austin notices 
           something else -- 

           IN THE TRAYS surrounding her body, everything they removed 
           from her is DECAYING. Starting to shrivel. To blacken. 

           As if decomposing right before our eyes. But Jane herself is 
           fine. Austin opens the refrigerator, pulling jars -- 

           The Jane Doe tissue samples inside are similarly decayed. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Everything we took out of her --
                                 TOMMY
                        Rapid decomp.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Like her body was preserving it. 

           A beat -- Austin and Tommy have no idea how to handle this --

           Austin makes a beeline for the operating table. Grabs hold of 
           one end of it, bends down to UNLOCK the WHEELS on the bottom.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Help me move her.

           Tommy grabs the other end of the table and together --

           They start to WHEEL Jane Doe out of the room. Austin pulls on 
           the door -- 

           It’s locked. 

           Austin twists the handle. But it won’t budge.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        No... No...

           Austin looks back at Jane Doe. Then at Tommy. The FIRE AXE in 
           his hand.

           Austin grabs the axe away from Tommy, raises it over his 
           head, BURIES IT into the door to the autopsy room.

           Then again. And again. Splinters flying.

           The axe carves out a small VERTICAL SLIT in the door frame. 

           Just enough to see a sliver of the hallway.

           As Austin lifts the axe again --

           A SHAPE fills the small vertical space, UP CLOSE. Through the 
           crack, we can barely make out -- 

           A sliver of AN OLD WOMAN’S MOUTH, inches away. Pale, gaunt. 
           SEWN SHUT, stitched up. 

           Even obscured, we recognize the mouth -- IRENE DANIELS. The 
           old woman Austin pulled out of the drawer earlier.

           Austin jumps back. Tommy sees her too.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        That’s --
                                 TOMMY
                        I know.

           Impossible, but there she is. Right behind the door. Austin 
           looks at Jane Doe, on the wheeled table. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        She’s trying to stop us. 

           He scans the room -- and a nearby COUNTER. His gaze falling 
           on jars of chemicals. Lined up in rows.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it.

           Austin switches gears, grabbing a plastic jar of ACETONE. 
           There’s a warning label: “HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.”

           Austin DOUSES Jane Doe’s body with acetone.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hand me your matches.

           But Tommy’s still the father. He lights the match himself --

           Which he uses to light the entire matchbook. Fire leaps into 
           the air, dancing around his hand. Tommy, still a bit unsure -- 

           Austin nods: do it.

           And Tommy tosses the flaming matchbook onto Jane Doe’s 
           acetone-soaked FLESH.

           She bursts into FLAMES

           Which CASCADE so high they lick the ceiling. The operating 
           table looks like a Roman candle. Tommy and Austin watch with 
           anticipation. 

           A noise behind them. They glance back at -- 

           The pale mouth, partially visible through the crack in the 
           doorway. Expressionless at first. But then -- 

           The lips curl into a horrifying smile. RIPPING OUT the 
           STITCHING holding her cheeks together. POP - POP - POP -

           Austin looks back. The flames are practically leaping off of 
           her body -- spreading around the room --

           Onto a pair of lab coats hung along the wall -- 

           Catching the corner of the cork board where the photos of the 
           autopsy are stuck. The images BURNING, CURLING -- 
           Tommy throws the board to the ground, trying to stamp out the 
           fire but he’s unsuccessful. As the flames head toward the row 
           of flammable chemicals, Tommy screams out at Austin -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        Behind you -- 

           Austin turns to see the lab fire extinguisher. Grabbing it 
           off the wall, hitting the trigger -- 

           Nothing comes out. He pulls again -- not working. The flames 
           are getting closer -- the place is going to blow -- 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        The tab! Pull the tab!

           Austin doesn’t get it, but Tommy grabs the extinguisher, 
           YANKS the pull-tab that gets it started, then SPRAYS --

           Dousing the flames in fire-retardant foam. The flames inching 
           up to those jars of chemicals --

           Just as Tommy DROWNS the flames in a wash of foam. 

           They look back to Jane Doe -- 

           As the flames dancing about her body slowly die down until 
           they extinguish completely on their own --

           Her body is unharmed.

           Skin unsinged, untainted, untouched.

                                 AUSTIN
                        No...

           Tommy stares down at Jane Doe with disbelief, realizing what 
           they’re up against. 

           Screaming out with frustration, Austin grabs a SCALPEL and 
           rears back to stab Jane Doe’s body. But Tommy steps in his 
           path, grabs his hand.

                                 TOMMY
                        Austin... 

           But Austin puts up a struggle. His anger overriding sense --

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Stop, son. 

           A beat -- and Austin drops the scalpel. It lands with a CLANG 
           onto the linoleum floor.
           Silence. The low lights overhead TWITCH.

           They stare down at Jane Doe’s body. Indestructible. A look of 
           hopelessness crosses both Tommy and Austin’s faces. Until --

           A distant RUMBLE from down the hall. Tommy listens closer, 
           realizes -- 

           It’s the sound of gears GRINDING. His face brightens.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        The elevator.

           Austin listens, hears the familiar --

           SCREECH of the elevator. Descending. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s working!

           Austin’s eyes dart to the DOOR of the autopsy room -- 

           The door’s still stuck, but Tommy PRIES the blade of the axe 
           between the door and the frame, pressing until the door SNAPS 
           OPEN.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY

           Tommy steps out into the hall, axe in hand. Austin follows. 
           Their steps cautious, their guard up.

           The THRASH of the storm can be heard overhead.

           A CHIME --

           They both look up into the convex mirror, in which they can 
           see --

           The tiny reflection of elevator doors OPENING.

           They make a run for it --

           Just as they round the corner, they see the doors start 
           CLOSING. They get within arm’s reach of the elevator when --

           CLICK. The doors SHUT.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Fuck!

           Austin slams the elevator CALL BUTTON over and over. Tommy 
           listens to the elevator’s gears grinding. He looks up.
                                 TOMMY
                        Gotta wait. Once it hits the top, 
                        it’ll come back down.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (petrified)
                        C’mon, c’mon --

           Austin pounds the call button.  

           Then, from down the hall -- 

           TING.

           Austin turns. His face goes white. Tommy follows Austin’s 
           eyes to --

           A SILHOUETTE. At the end of the hall.  

           Too far and too dark to distinguish, but one thing’s certain:

           It’s staring right at them.

           The elevator hits the top. Tommy slowly reaches over and 
           clicks the call button repeatedly.

           Down the corridor, only certain lights are working, creating 
           alternating BANDS of darkness and light between them and the 
           shadowy figure. For a moment, it disappears -- 

           And then reappears, just past the light. Closer. As if the 
           lights themselves are cooperating, keeping it constantly 
           obscured in darkness as it moves. 

           Thunder CRASHES as the elevator starts to descend. 

           Austin stares down the hall at the figure. Its movements are 
           unnatural, ghostly. Like an old videotape skipping frames. 

           As it drifts toward them --

           TING.

           -- the next band of light goes dark. The figure suddenly ten 
           feet closer.

           Austin recoils. Tommy’s fingers tighten around the axe.

                                 TOMMY
                        Get behind me.

           Metal scrapes against metal as the elevator nears.

           Tommy stares at the figure. 
           Austin SLAMS the call button. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        C’mon!

           The figure keeps drifting forward, disappearing into shadow --

           TING.

           -- then reappearing. Twenty feet closer.

           The elevator’s almost all the way down.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        C’mon goddammit! C’mon!

           TING. 

           Another band of light goes out. Thirty feet closer. 

           Still in shadow, but Tommy knows it’s --

           LOUIS TANNIS  

           The only body with a BELL tied around its ankle. 

           The elevator locks into place on the basement floor. DING. 
           The doors OPEN wide. Inside, darkness. The light is busted.

           Louis is mere feet away when --

           Tommy YANKS Austin into the pitch-black elevator.

           He frantically presses the UP button. 

           The elevator doors start to CLOSE and --

           Lock in place. A foot of space still between them. The low 
           lights from the hallway barely illuminated through the 
           opening. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Austin!

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m trying!

           Austin, mashing the button. Silence, and then -- 

           TING.

           Louis is right outside. They can’t see him, but they can HEAR 
           his horrible wheezing breaths. 
           Tommy’s fingers tighten around the handle of the axe. 

           Austin’s ripping at the elevator control panel, trying to get 
           it moving -- but nothing’s working -- 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Come on -- come on --

           TING! Impossibly close, right there -- 

           Tommy steps forward, ready to strike, as --

           A dark SHADOW LEAPS into the space between the open doors -- 
           about to pounce on them -- 

           Tommy SWINGS the axe --

           CRUNCH. It lands in a chest, solid and firm, a lethal blow.

           The body staggers backwards in the darkness, taking the 
           embedded axe with it --

           And hits the linoleum floor with a THUD.

           The tinging stops.

           The lights in the elevator TURN ON.

           A moment.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Did you --

                                 TOMMY
                        I think so.

           Austin leans against the wall. Tommy breathes heavily.

           A long beat as they recover.

           A RIVULET OF BLOOD

           trails between the open doors, into the elevator, snaking 
           toward Tommy’s feet. Leading back toward --

           A growing pool of blood just out in the hallway. Austin’s 
           eyes follow the path, toward the body --

           And the feet. But there is no bell on the ankle. And the feet 
           aren’t bare --

           They’re in sneakers.

           Austin’s eyes go wide.
                                 AUSTIN
                        No... no...

           Austin PULLS at the elevator doors, forcing them open -- 
           rushing out of the door -- 

           And falling to the ground at the side of the body. Tommy 
           steps out, sees THE BODY in front of Austin --

                                 TOMMY
                        My God.

           It’s Emma. 

           The axe lodged in her heart.

           Austin pulls the axe free. He cradles Emma in his arms -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Emma... Emma... 

           She’s coughing up her own blood -- fading fast --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hang on, baby... please...

           Emma looks up at Austin, confused and in pain -- 

           As her eyes go WIDE... and soften. Life leaves her. 

           Austin breaks down -- 

           Tommy, standing above it all, shell-shocked. Can’t believe 
           what he’s done. Can’t accept it.

                                 TOMMY
                        I... I didn’t know it was -- 

           Austin glares up at his father with rage, pain --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Didn’t you see her?!

                                 TOMMY
                        I -- it wasn’t... The bell -- you 
                        saw it too --

           A long beat. Austin cradles Emma to his chest. He breaks 
           down.

           Behind them, the elevator doors start to CLOSE. Tommy snaps 
           out of his shock, forcing them back open with his arms. 
                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Austin --

           Austin’s unresponsive. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                             (gently)
                        We have to go.

           Tommy has to pry him away from Emma. Austin doesn’t have the 
           strength to struggle. 

           Tommy grabs the bloody axe and pulls Austin, still watching 
           Emma’s lifeless body as Tommy drags him into --

           INT. MORGUE - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           The elevator shakes as Tommy and Austin get in. Tommy hits 
           the UP button --

           And this time it works. The doors close. Gears grind. The 
           elevator car SHUDDERS --

           As it starts to ascend. 

           It gets about three feet off the ground, then --

           It stops.

           Tommy hits the up button. Nothing happens.

           He hits it again. Nothing. 

                                 TOMMY
                        No... Please, no...

           Tommy hits the button over and over again. So hard it draws 
           blood from his knuckles.

           And still, the elevator does not move.

           Austin slinks down against the steel doors of the elevator, 
           buries his head in his hands. 

           A look of fear and resignation washes over Tommy.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MORGUE - ELEVATOR - LATER

           Tommy and Austin sit, backs against opposite walls. Three 
           feet away from each other, but worlds apart. Each lost in his 
           own grief. Bloodied axe at Tommy’s feet.

           Austin looks at his watch -- 11:17 PM. His eyes are dry, red, 
           drained of emotion. Completely numb.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I told her to come back for me.

           It’s the only thought in his mind, and he can’t shake it. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I told her to come back. 

           Every breath Tommy takes makes him wince. He lifts his shirt, 
           inspecting the gash on his rib cage. The meager gauze, soaked 
           through with blood.

                                 TOMMY
                        You didn’t do this. 

           Tommy looks at the axe by his feet. His shoulders slump under 
           the weight of all his guilt.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry. I... I thought...

           But Austin’s anger is gone.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You didn’t know. You couldn’t have. 

           Tommy takes this in.

                                 TOMMY
                        That’s what everyone told me. About 
                        your mom.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad...

           Tommy wipes his bloody hands off onto his pants. Trying to 
           get them clean. Then:

                                 TOMMY
                        Know why I used to call your mom 
                        “Ray?”

           Austin looks up now. A side of Tommy he’s rarely seen. 
                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Ray of sunshine. She thought it was 
                        corny as shit. But it stuck.

           Tommy’s armor is off. He’s vulnerable.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        If I had known... I would have 
                        helped her. You know that, right?

           Austin doesn’t answer, his face unreadable.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        It’s just she was always so... 
                        bright... so happy... 
                             (then)
                        To think she was carrying around 
                        all that pain, that unhappiness, 
                        every day... I should’ve seen it. 
                        If I had, if I’d just asked, I 
                        could have helped her. But I 
                        didn’t. So she dealt with it 
                        herself.
                             (beat)
                        All my mistakes... you’ve had to 
                        pay for them.

           A long moment -- Austin doesn’t know what to say. Tommy, 
           letting it all wash over him. Defeated:

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Why doesn’t she just kill us 
                        already?

           Austin has no answer -- and then, suddenly, a light bulb goes 
           off for him:

                                 AUSTIN
                        Why doesn’t she?
                             (then)
                        All of this... for what?

                                 TOMMY
                        Who the hell knows?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Exactly. 

           Off Tommy’s quizzical look -- 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Something terrible happened to her, 
                        right? She was tortured, maybe even 
                        sacrificed. We don’t really know. 
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        We never figured it out.
                             (then)
                        She stopped us.

                                 TOMMY
                        What’re you getting at?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Maybe that’s the key. 

           Tommy’s not buying it. But Austin’s onto something:

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Think about it. This all started 
                        when she got here. And the deeper 
                        we went, the worse it got. The 
                        tongue, that shroud, those... Those 
                        symbols inside her skin -- each 
                        time we find something... it’s like 
                        she gets angrier. 
                             (beat)
                        Like there’s something she doesn’t 
                        want us to know.

           Off Tommy’s uneasy look, Austin’s not wrong --

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - THAT MOMENT

           CLOSE on JANE DOE. 

           Her dead eyes staring up at the ceiling. 

           We float past her, out of the autopsy room, into the --

           INT. MORGUE - CREMATORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           We PUSH IN slowly toward the large OVEN DOOR in the center of 
           the room. 

           Passing the CONTROL PANEL alongside the oven --

           Gas HISSES. Pipes SHAKE.

           INSIDE the oven, low, yellow flames POP ON. 

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. MORGUE - ELEVATOR - THAT MOMENT

           Tommy’s still skeptical.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Every body has a secret. You taught 
                        me that. She’s no exception.

           An impasse.

                                 TOMMY
                        We can’t go back in there.

                                 AUSTIN
                        We can’t stay here. 

                                 TOMMY
                        You saw what she did to the 
                        Douglases. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        That’s what I’m saying. We stay 
                        here, we end up just like ‘em.

                                 TOMMY
                        After everything that’s happened, 
                        how could you go back into that 
                        room?

           A moment.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You have a better plan?

           Tommy doesn’t. But he’s not ready to give in.

           INT. MORGUE - CREMATORIUM - THAT MOMENT

           The flames in the oven have changed color from yellow to 
           WHITE. 

           SMOKE begins to billow out from the oven. 

           It thickens and rushes toward us, filling the frame --  

           INT. MORGUE - ELEVATOR - THAT MOMENT

           Tommy’s running out of arguments. 
                                 AUSTIN
                        This is our only shot. We figure 
                        out how she died, maybe we figure 
                        out why she’s doing this to us. And 
                        we use it against her. Use it to 
                        get out of here. 

           A moment between Tommy and Austin. A ferocity of love and 
           respect in Austin’s eyes.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        This is what we do.

           A beat -- and Tommy reluctantly nods. Slowly gets up. Extends 
           his hand to Austin, helping him up. 

           They brace themselves. Standing to face the elevator doors. 
           Each grabbing a side --

           And PULLING HARD. The old metal doors slowly wrench apart. 

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The elevator is two feet off the ground. Tommy and Austin 
           step down and out.

           Emma’s body lies directly in front of them. Tommy takes off 
           his jacket, covers her with it.

           Tommy and Austin shift their eyes down toward the autopsy 
           room. 

           Thin wisps of SMOKE curl around the bend, creeping through 
           the air like gray snakes. Off Austin, confused --

           The sound of a distant RUMBLE around the bend. Tommy 
           recognizes the sound. Instantly worried.

                                 TOMMY
                        It’s coming from the crematorium.

           Tommy starts down the hall, but Austin stops him. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’ll go first.

           Austin extends his hand. Tommy hands him the axe.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Stay close to me.

           Tommy nods. Austin, axe in hand, steps in front of Tommy. 
           Their footsteps RING off of the cold floor.

           Austin looks toward the CONVEX MIRROR. A thick wall of smoke 
           obscures the entire adjacent hallway.

           Austin keeps walking. The smoke swallows him whole. Tommy 
           follows Austin into the thick haze. It’s like stepping into a 
           cloud. They cover their mouths and noses.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        You there?

                                 TOMMY
                        Right behind you.

           Indeed, Austin’s just in front of Tommy, but the smoke is so 
           thick he keeps fading in and out, only feet away.

           Ash burns Tommy’s lungs, stings his eyes. He can barely see -- 
           and then Austin disappears completely. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Austin?

           Just a COUGH in return. Tommy follows the sound. 

           AUSTIN, in his own smoky bubble, pushes forward. Axe raised 
           and ready. 

           Another RUMBLE from the crematorium as --

           CREEAAAK

           Through the haze, they can barely see -- the CREMATORIUM DOOR 
           inching open. And then, it just STOPS.

           Tommy and Austin freeze, afraid to move. But then, from 
           somewhere else unseen --

           CREEEEEAAAAAAK

           The sound of another door OPENING. 

           Tommy and Austin peer into the smoke.

           Then: a familiar noise. Bare skin SLAPPING linoleum. 

           The sound QUICKENS. FOOTSTEPS, coming from who knows where. 

           Something MOVES in front of Austin. He SWINGS the axe --

           But his wild strikes cut through nothing. He GRUNTS with the 
           effort. From behind:
                                 TOMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Something’s here.

           Vague SHAPES flit in and out of the smoke. Getting closer 
           with each pass, like dive-bombers coming in and taking off --

           A SILHOUETTE suddenly appears inches in front of Austin’s 
           face. 

           He SWINGS at the shape, but misses -- CLANK -- 

           The axe hits the wall. He tries to pull it back, but it’s 
           stuck there, embedded. As he struggles with it -- 

           Tommy feels something BRUSH past him. Looking around, trying 
           to find his son -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        Austin? 

           ON AUSTIN

           Still struggling with the axe --

           The vague SHAPE coming toward him through the smoke. 

           He pulls at the axe, manic, until finally it comes loose. 

           Austin draws back, about to strike, but as he does, something 
           behind him PULLS the axe in the other direction. 

           Austin STUMBLES backwards, the axe jerking loose, hitting the 
           ground with a CLANG. Austin quickly recovers, regains his 
           footing, looks around frantically --

           ON TOMMY

           Lost in the smoke. He sees a SILHOUETTE up ahead. It looks 
           like Austin. 

           Tommy runs toward him. The smoke thins the closer he gets.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Austin!

           Tommy puts his hand on the figure’s shoulder. His fingers 
           feel burnt skin. It flakes as he pulls back his hand. This 
           isn’t Austin.

           ON AUSTIN
           Nowhere near Tommy -- as he hears his father SCREAM. He feels 
           his way through the smoke, searching.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad!

           Searching. Searching. But he can’t find Tommy.

           Something THROWS Austin to the side. His neck snaps back as 
           his face smashes into the wall --

           ON TOMMY

           Running. Through the haze, something SLASHES his cheek. He 
           jerks away from it --

           As another SLASH takes a slice out of his arm --

           Tommy swinging back wildly, blindly. Another SLASH, parallel 
           gashes opening up along his chest -- 

           And two more on each leg. He DROPS to the floor, losing 
           strength -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        Austin...

           Another SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward him through the smoke.

           Tommy girds himself. The figure moves closer. 

           Tommy takes a step back. Then another. His feet CRUNCHING on 
           the broken glass from the fire alarm.

           He bends down and grabs a long shard, wielding it like a 
           knife. Thrusting it out in front of him -- 

           His eyes glued on the encroaching figure, timing it so the 
           strike will land -- 

           But he doesn’t see: 

           Another shadow. Directly behind him. Tommy backs right into 
           it. Spins -- 

           And LUNGES with the shard, right where its neck would be --

           A HAND grabs his wrist, catching him hard and firm -- 

           The smoke clearing away, showing this new attacker:

           It’s Austin.
                                 AUSTIN
                             (coughing)
                        Dad! 

           Tommy drops the glass. Through the smoke we can barely make 
           out --

           The autopsy room. They’re mere steps away. They made it. 
           Doubling their speed, rushing the last ten feet --

           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

           Tommy and Austin fall into the autopsy room, slam the door 
           closed behind them.

           Austin grabs a steel gurney. He and Tommy wedge it between 
           the door and the wall. Barricading themselves inside.

           They look toward the center of the room --

           The trays surrounding the table are filled with desiccated, 
           decayed tissue. Her organs now completely decomposed. 

           But Jane Doe is on the operating table. Just as they left 
           her, the autopsy not quite finished.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You ready?

           Tommy’s answer is to take up his position on the far side of 
           the table. 

           Austin takes up his position at his father’s side. Just how 
           they’ve always done it. Then -- 

           QUICK SHOTS: 

           Tommy grabs a sharp BLADE --

           He makes an INCISION around the crown of Jane Doe’s head.

           Austin uses a surgical saw to CUT into her skull.

           FLIES come buzzing out as Austin cracks open the skull. Tommy 
           and Austin bat them away. They stare down at --

           Jane Doe’s BRAIN.

           Suddenly, the handle on the autopsy room door RATTLES 
           violently. 

           Tommy and Austin are running out of time.
           They look at the brain. On the surface --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Brain looks... normal.

                                 TOMMY
                        All her other organs are scarred. 
                        There’s got to be something. 

           Tommy cuts off a small PIECE of brain. 

           Austin grabs the MICROSCOPE.

           He slides the piece of brain matter under the microscope. 
           Puts his eye against the viewfinder, studying the tissue more 
           closely.

           Austin’s face drops.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        What is it? 

           But Austin can’t hear him. Too stunned by what he’s seeing.

                                 AUSTIN
                        That’s... impossible.

           Austin lifts his eye off the viewfinder. 

           Tommy moves Austin aside, looks through into the microscope 
           himself. And now we SEE --

           BRAIN CELLS. Under the scrutiny of the microscope. 

           But something’s off: 

           They’re moving. 

           Alive.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        How could she... 

           Tommy backs away from the microscope. Gears shifting.

           It suddenly comes into focus for him.

                                 TOMMY
                        That’s why we can’t find a cause of 
                        death. 
                             (then)
                        She’s still alive.

           Austin stares down at Jane Doe’s body. In disbelief.
                                 AUSTIN
                        What are you talking about? We lit 
                        her on fire. We took out her heart. 
                        How could she possibly be -- 

                                 TOMMY
                        There’s some... power. Energy. Call 
                        it what you want. Something’s... 
                        keeping her going.

           Austin anxiously searches the room. His eyes land on the 
           SHROUD. On the drawing of the woman and the howling figure 
           erupting from her stomach -- 

           And then the big board -- now CRACKED and BURNED -- 

           The material warping the LETTERS that Austin had transcribed 
           there from the shroud -- bringing some closer together, 
           others further apart -- 

           Giving him a new viewpoint on them:

           LEV   US XX XXVII

                                 AUSTIN
                        How would you read that? Not leave 
                        us...

           Tommy’s eyes glance over the faded letters -- trying to sound 
           it out -- Austin joining in --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Lev... us... 

                                 TOMMY
                        Lev-itic-us?

           Austin gets it -- quickly focusing on XX XXVII -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        You were right. It’s not forty 
                        seven. It’s two numbers...
                             (beat)
                        Twenty. Twenty-seven. Chapter and 
                        verse.

           Without missing a beat, Austin grabs a dusty book off the 
           shelf -- THE BIBLE. Practically ripping it open -- 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        “A man or woman who is a witch 
                        among you must be put to death... 
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Their blood will be on their own 
                        heads.”

           The words hang in the air for a long beat.

           Tommy stares back at the shroud, focusing on other letters, 
           barely visible at the bottom: MDCXCIII.

                                 TOMMY
                        If these are Roman Numerals, then 
                        they’d be...

                                 AUSTIN
                        Sixteen ninety three. 

           It’s all come together for him. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        New England. Seventeenth century. 
                        It all makes sense --

                                 TOMMY
                        You think she’s a witch?

                                 AUSTIN
                        That’s what they thought. That’s 
                        why they did this to her. 

           Austin glancing between Jane and the dry erase board, marked 
           up with everything they’ve observed:

           Her open mouth. Without a tongue. Missing a tooth.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        She was probably an innocent woman, 
                        like all the others. 

           Her wrists and ankles. Dangling. Broken. Shattered.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        But they thought she was evil. 

           Her blackened lungs. Her scarred organs. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        The only way to kill her... was the 
                        ritual.

           Her insides. Desecrated with insidious symbols.

                                 TOMMY
                        Whatever they did, it didn’t work. 
                                 AUSTIN
                        Or it backfired. They wound up 
                        creating something else. Something 
                        worse.

           Off Tommy’s look, Austin runs his fingers over the ghastly 
           SYMBOLS branded on the inside of Jane’s skin.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        These markings couldn’t possibly be 
                        man-made. If she was innocent, 
                        maybe the ritual invited something 
                        in instead.

           Tommy takes this in. He looks down at the scalpel in his 
           hand. The blood on his coat. All of the damage they’ve done 
           to her body. 

           He looks to Jane Doe’s face as he takes all of this in.

                                 TOMMY
                        Then everything they did -- 
                        everything we’ve done... 
                             (beat)
                        She can feel it. 

           FWOOOMP.

           The door to the room is nearly ripped off its frame.

           But Tommy is locked in on Jane Doe.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        She’s been suffering. For 
                        centuries. 

           Tommy takes a step closer to the once-beautiful, tortured 
           body on the table. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        That’s why she’s kept us alive. To 
                        torture us.
                             (beat)
                        This is her revenge. 
                             (fully dawning on him)
                        This is her ritual.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Why us?

           CLOSE ON the photos of the Douglas crime scene. Blood on the 
           walls, shattered windows -- 

           Not that different from the half-destroyed morgue. 
                                 TOMMY
                        Because we’re here. Just like the 
                        Douglases.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (getting it)
                        Who knows how many there were 
                        before us? Between here and 
                        Massachusetts?

           Tommy’s putting it together, figuring it all out:

                                 TOMMY
                        The ones who survived... they got 
                        rid of her. Buried her, as far away 
                        as possible.

                                 AUSTIN
                        But someone always found her. So 
                        she kept moving...

                                 TOMMY
                        Because no one ever looked closer. 
                        No one else could see what we can.

           Austin looks at Tommy. A long beat --

           Because he knows Tommy’s right. 

           But Tommy keeps looking at Jane. 

           Into her eyes.

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        This won’t stop. She’ll never be 
                        free until...

                                 AUSTIN
                        Until what? 

           Tommy stares into the grays of Jane Doe’s eyes. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Dad -- until what?

           Austin grabs Tommy by the shoulders, tries to shake him out 
           of his trance. But Tommy PUSHES HIM away, hard -- Austin 
           stumbling back, falling to the ground.

           CRACK.

           The door starts to give. It won’t hold much longer. 
           Tommy looks back at Jane doe, speaking directly to her now. 
           Compassion in his voice.

                                 TOMMY
                             (whispering)
                        Tell me what to do. I won’t fight 
                        you. Just don’t hurt him. He’s done 
                        nothing wrong.

           Austin, staring helplessly from the floor, quickly gets to 
           his feet.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What the hell are you doing? 

           Tommy ignores Austin. He leans closer, into Jane Doe’s face. 

                                 TOMMY
                             (whispering)
                        Let me help you.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Goddamn it, get away from her. 
                        Whatever you’re doing --

           Austin tries to lunge for his father, but it’s too late.

           CLOSE ON Tommy’s eyes -- 

           CLOSE ON Jane Doe’s eyes --

           Locked into each other.

           The lights flicker.

           A loud thunder clap shakes the walls of the morgue.

           Then, silence. Stillness.

           Tommy and Austin look at each other for a moment. 

           A long beat. Perfect quiet. Then -- 

           The color drains from Tommy’s face. He clutches his stomach, 
           nauseous. He starts to TREMBLE. His knees wobble. He’s 
           sweating.

           Austin runs to his side --

           As Tommy DOUBLES OVER, stumbling into the wall. 

           He looks up at Austin, pained. His eyes roll back in his 
           head. Before Austin can do anything --
           Tommy’s WRISTS CRACK. 

           His hands splay outwards. Yanked out of their sockets.

           The bones in his hands SNAP. Crushed.

           Tommy stares down at his hands, in shock --

           Just as: 

           Jane Doe’s wrists STRAIGHTEN.

           Austin goes to his father’s side, no idea what to do as:

           Tommy’s ANKLES BREAK. He falls to his knees. Screams out in 
           agony --

           As Jane Doe’s ankles CRACK back into place. Healed.

           Austin realizes what’s happening.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        God, no --

           Austin tries to help Tommy, but everywhere he tries to touch 
           brings a new scream of pain --

           Because it’s too late.

           Tommy clutches his STOMACH. In anguish. Convulsing as if he’s 
           being STABBED repeatedly. 

           Austin’s eyes dart back to Jane Doe’s body --

           The SCARRING on her organs begins to HEAL. From the stomach 
           all the way up to her heart.

           As her scarring dissipates, Tommy’s pain only gets worse. 
           Tears fill his eyes. He grasps onto Austin, hanging on for 
           his life. 

           As Tommy INHALES, gasping for breath --

                                 TOMMY
                        Kill...

           The BLACKNESS on Jane Doe’s LUNGS leeches away.

           Tommy CHOKES. Screams out in pain.

           His insides are literally on fire.

           Through shallow breaths, Tommy speaks to Austin -- his lips 
           pressed against Austin’s ear -- but it’s barely a sound --
                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Me...

           As a wisp of BLACK SMOKE billows up through Tommy’s throat, 
           out of his mouth. His lungs, charred.

           Austin holds his father close. Trying to comfort him. 

                                 TOMMY (CONT’D)
                        Do... it... before... I...

           The pain is too great --

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dad, please! Hang on... just hang 
                        on... 

           Tommy slumps in Austin’s arms -- Austin can’t hold him, and 
           Tommy crashes to the floor.

           Close on Tommy’s eyes, going WIDE.

           Close on Jane Doe’s eyes --

           As the GRAY fades away, leaving a gentle blue. 

           FWOOOMP! The door to the room BURSTS open. Austin spins as 
           smoke spills in -- 

           And Austin is THROWN to the ground from behind, SLAMMING his 
           head against the floor. A gash opens on his forehead --

           Austin looks up. Tommy kneels above him --

           His eyes are GRAY.

           Before Austin can react, Tommy thrusts his forearm against 
           Austin’s throat. Choking the life out of him.

           Killing his son.

           Austin tries to PUSH Tommy off of him, but he can’t. Tommy’s 
           inhumanly strong.

           Austin gasps for breath. Choking --

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Dad --

           But Tommy only presses harder against Austin’s throat. 

           Austin’s losing oxygen. He’s choking. He flails, tries to 
           slap Tommy’s arms away. But he can’t --
           His strength starts to dissipate. His limbs grow heavy. His 
           face turns blue. 

           Austin’s vision BLURS. Behind Tommy, he can barely make out --

           Obscure FIGURES, blurred and hidden in the smoke that has 
           filtered in from the hall.  

           The figures surround Austin as his father chokes him to 
           death, their silhouettes blocking out the light. Bringing 
           only darkness --

           Austin’s eyes fill with tears as he stops fighting. His arms 
           going limp by his sides. Accepting death.

           Tommy only presses harder, finishing him off -- 

           And then Tommy’s eyes go WIDE. He cranes his head back and 
           lets go of Austin.

           Austin GASPS, choking. Sitting up -- as we see --

           Austin’s hand gripping the bloody handle of a SCALPEL buried 
           in Tommy’s chest.

           Austin has STABBED Tommy in the heart.

           Tommy tips to one side -- and falls hard to the ground.

           The minute Tommy’s body hits the floor, in rapid order:

           The silhouettes all around him are swallowed back into the 
           smoke -- 

           As a morgue drawer SLAMS shut -- and then another -- and 
           another -- 

           The SMOKE in the autopsy room and the hallway is SUCKED UP 
           into the vents. 

           The sounds of the STORM cease.

           The LIGHTS in the morgue turn back on to full power.

           JANE DOE, eyes blue, on the slab. Lifeless, but completely 
           healed, pristine once again. At peace.

           It’s over.

           Austin looks down at Tommy, dead on the floor. Blood pooling 
           all around him.

           A moment of numb, exhausted shock --
           And then Austin lets it wash over him. Cradling his father to 
           his chest. At first just breathing hard --

           And then the breath becomes a sob, and then another --

           And he breaks down. Wailing with grief over what’s happened.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry... I’m so sorry...

           As Austin cries over his father’s body, rocking back and 
           forth.

           We begin to PULL BACK, leaving them alone, perhaps for the 
           last time...

           When --

           A SOUND from down the hall. Faint, barely audible.

           A VOICE.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Tommy! Austin! You in there?

           Austin lifts up his head. He knows this voice. 

                                 AUSTIN
                             (barely audible)
                        Burke?

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Anyone there?

                                 AUSTIN
                             (regaining his voice)
                        Burke!

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Austin?

           Austin lays Tommy’s body down. He struggles to his feet, 
           covered in blood.

           He can’t walk, can barely limp as he exits the autopsy room.

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The hallway is fully lit now. Nothing hiding in the shadows.

           Austin walks down the hall. Hand against the wall, a trail of 
           blood smearing the concrete.
                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Austin, you down there?

           Austin follows the sound of Burke’s voice. It’s coming from 
           the top of the stairs. But before he can get there --

           He sees Emma’s body on the ground by the elevator. He stops. 
           The toll this evening has taken written all over his face.

           Finally, he continues down the hall...

           INT. MORGUE - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Austin begins to climb the stairs --

           Burke’s voice clearer now as he shouts down to Austin from 
           the other side of the storm doors.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Storm knocked a tree down. It’s 
                        blocking your doors. We’re moving 
                        it right now, alright? Hang in 
                        there. You with me?

           Austin walks up the stairs slowly.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m here.

           BEEP. BEEP. The sound of a CRANE moving the tree up above.

           We hear the tree LIFT from atop the storm doors as Austin 
           nears the top of the stairs.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Almost there, buddy. You’re going 
                        to be alright.

           Austin arrives at the top of the stairs.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Just open up the door now.

           He PUSHES against the storm doors. They budge a tiny bit.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Should open on up now --

           Austin pushes against the doors again. But they won’t open up 
           any more.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I can’t -- it won’t --
                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Try again, son.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m trying, it’s stuck.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Just open up --

                                 AUSTIN
                        I can’t!

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                        Open up.

           From the other side of the doors, Austin hears... laughter?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Burke? What’s --

           Louder laughter, morphing into a familiar tune...

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (O.S.)
                             (singing softly)
                        Open up... your heart...

           As Austin backs up in horror --

           That’s not Burke. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE (CONT’D)
                        ...and let the... sun... shine... 
                        in...

           Austin backs away further from the storm doors, his feet at 
           the edge of the top step.

           Burke’s laughter ECHOING, becoming high-pitched, impossibly 
           inhuman.

           Austin’s face goes ashen. The light leaving his eyes as he 
           realizes that there is no escape. 

           The storm doors RATTLE VIOLENTLY from outside --

           Austin recoils, stepping back, missing a stair -- no time to 
           right himself as he falls backward -- 

           CRASHING down the staircase, his body twisting as it plummets 
           into the gloom --

           Hitting the bottom with a

           CRACK.
           The sound of bone SNAPPING.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WHITE.

           A LONG SILENCE. 

           And then --

           The chilling WHINE of a CAMERA FLASH as we fade back up. 
           Along with each subsequent whine, we see -- 

           Flashes of CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS.

           -- BLOOD smeared on walls and hallway floors.

           -- A BATHROOM, torn to shreds.

           -- A DOOR splintered with AXE MARKS.

           -- Tommy, in the autopsy room. Blood soaked through his 
           clothes. His eyes back to normal, no longer gray. 

           -- Austin, at the bottom of the stairs. His neck twisted 
           almost 180 degrees. 

           Both men, dead. Eerily reminiscent of the Douglases. 

           A final FLASH takes us to --

           INT. MORGUE - STAIRWELL - DAY

           Sheriff Burke stands at the bottom of the stairwell, watching 
           as Tommy and Austin’s bodies, zipped into translucent plastic 
           BODY BAGS, are wheeled past on gurneys, toward the elevator. 

           INT. MORGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Burke walks down the lit corridor, dodging a few OFFICERS and 
           FORENSIC TECHS. He observes as they snap photos of the damage 
           in the hallway -- 

           Blood smears on the ground. Doors battered in. Jagged 
           indentations in the wall.

           Burke shakes his head, continues moving toward the autopsy 
           room. 
           INT. MORGUE - AUTOPSY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Burke stands near the entrance and surveys the room. 

           A CLUSTER OF OFFICERS hover around the operating table; 
           OTHERS search the room for evidence. 

           Lieutenant Wade lifts the CHARRED CORK BOARD off the floor, 
           stares at the POLAROIDS tacked to it, all of them curled and 
           melted. Indecipherable.

           A few OFFICERS pull bodies from the drawers along the far 
           wall. The bodies are loaded onto gurneys and wheeled out of 
           the room, one by one.

           Burke steps aside as the bodies are wheeled past him:

           Irene Daniels, stitches intact. Louis Tannis, veil in place. 
           Otis Howard, untouched. All exactly as they’d started out.

           Lieutenant Wade breaks free from the other officers, 
           approaches Burke.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        Just got off the phone with Tyler 
                        county. They’re clearing out some 
                        space for us.

           He nods toward the BODIES that are being wheeled out.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE (CONT’D)
                        No signs of forced entry.

           A voice calls out to Burke from the other end of the room.

                                 OFFICER COOPER (O.S.)
                        Sheriff? The boys found this. 

           Burke looks over as OFFICER COOPER, late 30s, approaches, 
           MINI-DV camera in hand. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE 
                        Anything useful on it? 

           Cooper shakes his head as he turns the camera for Burke to 
           see -- it’s charred, half-melted -- fucked.

                                 BURKE
                        The hell happened down here?

           Fed up, Burke turns to the autopsy table. The cluster of 
           Officers disperses, and Burke gets a clear view of --

           Jane Doe. On the slab.
           No incisions. No blood. No different than when he left her.

           Burke is stumped. Wade walks up next to him.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        What do you want to do with her?

           Two Forensic Techs ZIP Jane Doe into a translucent body bag 
           and hoist her wrapped body onto a gurney. 

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                             (after a beat)
                        Get her out of here.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        Already got a car waiting. There’s 
                        that funeral home over on Ruxton --

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        I want her out of my county. Get 
                        her down to the UT Med center in 
                        Houston. Ward Lamon’ll deal with 
                        her.

           Jane Doe is wheeled out of the autopsy room. Burke left in 
           there, staring at the destruction. Baffled. 

           EXT. MORGUE - DAY

           A beautiful day. The sun is SHINING. 

           The large OAK TREE looms over the storm doors, INTACT.

           It never fell.

           No indication there was ever ANY storm.

           POLICE TAPE cordons off the morgue on all sides. Several 
           PEOPLE mill about the perimeter trying to get a peek at 
           what’s going on.

           Burke and Wade look on from a distance as Cooper and other 
           Officers load BODIES into the back of a police van. Jane Doe 
           is loaded into a separate police vehicle.

           A NEWS VAN pulls up outside the perimeter. We recognize the 
           Reporter and Cameraman from the Douglas house as they barrel 
           out of the van.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                        Two one-eight-sevens in two days. 
                        Both of them families. 
                             (then, re: news van)
                                 LIEUTENANT WADE (CONT'D)
                        They’re not going to leave without 
                        an explanation.

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                        Then they’re gonna be here a while.
                             (off Wade’s look)
                        Unless you’ve got one for them.

                                 LIEUTENANT WADE
                             (hesitates, then)
                        Austin’s prints were all over that 
                        scalpel. Tommy’s blood’s all over 
                        Austin. Looks an awful lot like --

                                 SHERIFF BURKE
                             (stern)
                        I’ve known this family twenty 
                        years. However it looks, that ain’t 
                        it. 

           But before Wade can say anything else --

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sheriff Burke!

           Burke looks up. His face falls. Just when things couldn’t get 
           worse...

           We follow a WOMAN’S LEGS from behind, running toward the 
           scene. As she crosses the police tape and approaches Burke, 
           we REVEAL --

           EMMA. Very much alive.

           And extremely alarmed by the scene.

                                 EMMA
                        What happened?? Where’s Austin?

           Burke doesn’t know how to tell her. He glances at the police 
           van. She follows his look --

           As the last two bodies -- Tommy and Austin -- are loaded in.

           She SHRIEKS. A soul-piercing cry.

           Emma buries her head in Burke’s chest, sobbing. Burke tries 
           to console her as best he can.

           The police van pulls out, followed by the vehicle carrying 
           Jane Doe. The two vehicles head in separate directions.

           We slowly RISE above the morgue, above the neighborhood, 
           everything shrinking as we pull further and further away.
           As Emma’s CRIES ring out, we CUT TO --

           INT. POLICE VEHICLE - BACK ROAD - LATER

           Loaded into THE BACK SEAT:

           JANE DOE’S BODY

           in a translucent body bag. Shifting with every bump in the 
           road.

           IN THE FRONT SEAT

           Officer Cooper drives, cell phone to his ear, mid-
           conversation.

                                 OFFICER COOPER 
                             (into phone)
                        ... what are you... no, baby, 
                        listen, they were not guilt 
                        flowers... I sent them because I 
                        love you...

           ON THE RADIO, a Christian station lightly playing.

                                 OFFICER COOPER (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        ...I love you and when I get back 
                        from Houston I’m gonna show you 
                        just how much... hell yes, that’s a 
                        promise...

           Static breaks up the Evangelist’s sermon. The static clears. 
           A song comes on. 

           We recognize it.

           She said he causes trouble... when you let him in the room... 

           As the song plays, we slowly MOVE toward the back of the van.

           Pushing toward --

           Jane Doe. 

           He will never ever leave you... if your heart is filled with 
           gloom...

           We see her face. Her eyes. Gray again.

           Then, slowly move down --

           So let the sun... shine... in...
           Past her chest, her stomach.

           Face it with a grin...

           To her thighs. Her knees. 

           Smilers never lose... and frowners never win...

           Inching toward her feet.

           So let the sun... shine... in... 

           Down to her toes. 

           Face it with a grin...

           Her feet fill the frame.

           A TAG tied around one of her toes, labeled: 

           DOE, JANE. CAUSE OF DEATH: UNKNOWN. 

           We HOLD there. A very long beat.

           And as the song crescendos --

           Open up your heart and let the sun... shine... in...

           Her TOE TWITCHES.

                                                                 BLACK.
