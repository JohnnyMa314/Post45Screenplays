           CHYRON: MONDAY, OCTOBER 21ST

           An ocean of NEWS VANS; rows upon rows; tightly packed. Every
           major outlet and then some. Local. National. International.

           SWEATY CAMERAMEN cue TELEGENIC TALKING HEADS; the fourth

           A stew of VOICES, each louder than the next, each a

           other’s existence, report what is widely known in every

                        leads Republican Senator Roger

                        can’t stand up straight. Congress
                        is doing a split in quicksand and

           A DEAFENING ROAR from inside the stadium.

                        Sterling, on the other hand, is
                        free to explore the best ideas from
                        both sides of the aisle because he
                        doesn’t sit in either one; he
                        stands proudly in the middle.

           INT. BUSCH STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           We swoop over an army of PASSIONATE CITIZENS. Every
           demographic HOWLING with adulation, admiration, hope.

           More than mere cheerleaders, these are champions of a
           movement; ready to follow Sterling into the proverbial
           burning building.

           We catch a glimpse of his majestic smile on the jumbo-tron
           before panning down to an oversize stage dwarfed by the
           oversize stage-presence of the man himself. Confident, not
           arrogant. Erudite, not pedantic. Genuine, not soft.

           Sterling quiets the crowd with a steady palm. Then speaks in
           a direct, candid tone -- more commonly reserved for a
           lifelong friend than a sold-out stadium of strangers.

                                 NATE STERLING
                        I have good news and I have bad
                        news. Which would you like first?

           Transfixed. Silent. Confused. Waiting.

                                 VOICE
                        BAD!

           Several more calls of "BAD" reach crescendo until the entire
           crowd BOOS in unison.

                                 NATE STERLING
                        Right. Always the bad first. Well,
                        here it is: My son Evan turned
                        twelve yesterday.

           Crowd, baffled. Where is he going with this?

                        chocolate frosted cake, do you know

                        I saw 9/11. I saw a misguided
                        invasion of Iraq. I saw a decade of
                        stagnation in Afghanistan. I saw
                        the worst recession since the Great
                        Depression. I saw ten percent
                        unemployment; a sixteen-trillion
                        dollar debt; a nuclear Iran
                        creeping around the corner; an
                        Israeli-Palestinian conflict with
                        no end in sight. Crumbling
                        education, innovation,
                        infrastructure. Skyrocketing health
                        care premiums, gas prices, sea
                        levels, world temperatures.
                        Cyberterrorism, hyper-partisan
                        gridlock, misinformation,
                        out-of-control lobbying, pollution,
                        corruption, poverty, and
                        socio-economic inequality. All in

                        It is a reality that more closely
                        resembles a dystopian science
                        fiction novel than a fairy tale.
                        Nonetheless, it’s the world in
                        which Evan has spent his childhood.

                        happened. The flames reignited.
                        Evan blew them out again. And

                        as he tried, he couldn’t blow those

                        think, three things. One: my wife

           Light laughter.

                        Two: we cannot erase the past, but
                        we can, we must, learn from it. And
                        most importantly, we can get our
                        flame back too.

           A swell of APPLAUSE ripples through the stadium. Energy,
           momentum -- palpable. We might just pull this thing off.

           Then, Sterling morphs into a televised version of himself.

           INT. WASHINGTON TRIBUNE HEADQUARTERS - D.C. - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           Watching Sterling’s speech on a small TV with his feet up on
           his desk, sits KEVIN CONRAD, 28.

           A Princeton Tigers pennant is pinned to the wall of Kevin’s
           fiercely organized cubicle. He compulsively thumbs a
           pocket-sized version of "The Prince" by Machiavelli as he
           sneers at the electrified reaction to Sterling’s rhetoric.

                              (hopeful)
                        Turnbull will close the gap. He’s
                        Reagan without the cowboy hat, for
                        fuck-sake.

           One cubicle down, engulfed in the manic newsroom at the
           height of election-induced chaos, surrounded by coffee
           stained drafts and documents, sits our protagonist...

           ELI BROOKS, 28, sharp, hungry, but green as Augusta.

           Frustrated by the one-way conversation, Kevin glances at Eli
           who types with the focus of a world-class chess champion.

           Eli ignores the jab. He’s in the zone.

                        you ever been in a fight? When was
                        the last time you just wound up and
                        cold cocked someone? High school?

           Kevin invades Eli’s space, rearranging pens and paper on his
           desk. Eli ignores Kevin’s attempt to ruffle his feathers.

                                 KEVIN (cont’d)
                        You’ve never thrown a punch in your
                        life, have you? I’m sitting next to
                        Ghandi reincarnate.
                              (grinding his knuckles)
                        Let me see you make a fist.

                                 ELI
                        Didn’t your mother ever teach you:
                        violence is never the answer?

           Eli is above Kevin’s childish prodding. But he’s also
           deflecting, because the truth is... Kevin is spot on. Eli
           has only thrown a punch in a daydream.

           Eli’s cell phone RINGS.

                                 ELI (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello?
                              (concerned)
                        Slow down.

           As Eli listens, his face turns ghost white.

           He hangs up and stares aimlessly into the tumult of the
           newsroom. His eyes draining of all vitality.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           CHYRON: SEVEN MONTHS EARLIER

           CHYRON: FRIDAY, MARCH 28TH

           Eli turns the key to his beaten up Ford Echo. The engine
           sparks but doesn’t hit. He SMACKS the steering wheel.

                                 ELI
                        Not again.

           Second try. Nothing. Third time’s a charm. He peels out.

           A notepad sitting on the passenger seat reads: "LOTTO
           WINNERS," with names and phone numbers. Scribbled at the
           top: the address for Mega Millions Lottery Headquarters.

           A homely, AFFABLE WOMAN lies on a hammock reading Hemingway.

                        One word: Time. I’m reading all the

           INT. CASINO - DAY

           A PUNK KID, 20, tattoos, tank top, flat-brimmed hat, plays
           Texas hold’em at the Bellagio with a giant stack of chips.

                                 PUNK KID (V.O.)
                        Nah, I love working for an

           The PUNK KID slides $100 under the skimpiest of thongs on a
           GORGEOUS STRIPPER riding him like a mechanical bull.

                        Well maybe not all of it.

           INT. MEGA MILLIONS LOTTERY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Eli takes a business card from a bubbly RECEPTIONIST and
           slides it into his wallet.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        There he goes right now.

           TOM MAYFIELD, 65, impeccably-dressed Director of Mega
           Millions, strides briskly past the desk. Eli hurries to
           catch him.

                                 ELI
                        Mr. Mayfield!

           Mayfield opens a blue and orange UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA
           umbrella in front of the sliding doors. Eli extends his
           hand. Mayfield eyes him suspiciously. Shakes begrudgingly.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Eli Brooks. Washington Tribune. I’m
                        doing a story on lotto winners and
                        I was wondering if I could ask--

                                 MAYFIELD
                        Sorry kid-- late for a meeting.

           Mayfield slides out the door into a windswept DOWNPOUR. Eli
           sticks to him like a leech, braving the storm.

                                 ELI
                        UVA, huh? You’re a Cavalier?

           Mayfield is a good ole boy. His tone softens at mention of
           his alma mater, but his pace quickens.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Class of 1970.

           Mayfield glances at Eli, enduring an assualt by the rain. A
           hint of sympathy. He extends the umbrella ever so slightly.

                                 MAYFIELD (cont’d)
                        One block to the metro. I’m happy
                        to spend it on small talk--

                                 ELI
                        How has the recession affected your
                        jackpots?

                                 MAYFIELD
                        Down across the board. But that’s
                        to be expected.

           WHASSHHH! Eli steps shin-deep into a muddy puddle. He shakes
           it off without breaking stride.

                                 ELI
                        Huh. I would have thought jackpots
                        would rise in a recession.

                                 MAYFIELD
                              (curious)
                        How so?

                                 ELI
                        Lot more desperate daydreamers.

           Mayfield shuffles down to the metro platform. Eli follows to
           escape the rain but stops short of boarding the train.

                                 MAYFIELD
                        If you’ve got to choose between a
                        lotto ticket and feeding your
                        child-- what are you gonna do?

           Doors close in Eli’s face. The train disappears. Eli pulls
           off his shoe, pours the muddy rain water onto the tracks.

           INT. ELI’S CAR - NIGHT

           Eli navigates the suburban side streets of Arlington, VA.

           Eli’s girlfriend, CAMILA HART, 27, sits in the passenger
           seat. An impassioned environmentalist in her third year at
           Georgetown Law, Camila is bright, optimistic, and engaging.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        "Babies" before dessert.

                                 CAMILA
                        Stop. It’s going to be fun.

           Eli parks outside a modest, two-story home; one paint job
           away from charming; a remnant of the vanishing middle class.

                                 CAMILA (cont’d)
                        Put me down for twenty on career
                        advice from your dad.

           As he opens the car door...

                                 ELI
                        Damn, that’s smart money.

           EXT. ELI’S PARENTS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS

           HAL BROOKS, 64, smokes a cigar on his porch in a tattered
           Redskins hat. He rubs a chronically aching hip with his
           large calloused hand. Dark wrinkles under sober eyes betray
           frustration with a dead-end job search at an age he always
           imagined would be devoted to fishing and golfing.

           Eli and Camila stroll up the front path, hand in hand. Hal
           embraces them in a warm bear hug. The door swings open.

           LYNN BROOKS, 60, proud, opinonated, shoos them inside.

                                 LYNN

                        out there. Take your shoes off.

           Lynn places her hands on Camila and Eli’s shoulders as she
           follows them to the dining room.

                                 LYNN (cont’d)
                        Now when are you two going to start

           Eli smiles at Camila; you can owe me.
           INT. ELI’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - LATER

           The bittersweet celebration for Eli’s third year at The
           Tribune doubles as a farewell dinner for his sister...

           LIEUTENANT PENNY BROOKS, 25, to be shipped off to Kandahar
           Province, Afghanistan for her second tour of duty.

           Lynn raises her glass of red. A toast.

                                 LYNN
                        To my children: one makes the news,

                        column. Keep those capitol
                        hillbillies honest, the dopes.

           Eli steals a glance at Camila, who smiles with the
           satisfaction of squaring up the bet.

                                 ELI

                        say is, you’ve already surpassed
                        our wildest expectations.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Hal, Penny, and Camila settle into old, cozy armchairs. Eli
           preps the fireplace. Lynn refills wine glasses.

                        My thesis adviser and Sterling were
                        neighbors back when they both
                        taught at Harvard.

           With the fire lit, Eli turns to the room.

                        He recommended Camila for a job on

                        for the next twelve months. Why
                        waste it speculating about a guy
                        whose chances of sitting in the
                        Oval Office are slim to none?

                        Yeah, there is. I want you home,
                        Penny. I want Mom’s classroom to
                        have desks with four legs. I want
                        Camila to have the funds to save
                        our planet from Armageddon. I want

                        back. Or better yet, a new one. I
                        want to report on a President that
                        can do more than read bad poetry
                        from a teleprompter. Imagine that?

           INT. PENNY’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - LATER

           Clothing meticulously laid out on her bed; Penny packs. Eli
           studies an old picture of him and Penny as kids, showing off
           their snow fort after a blizzard; arms around each other,
           innocent smiles plastered on their faces.

           A heavy silence looms. Eli lays his elbow on Penny’s desk.

                                 ELI
                        C’mon.

           Penny smiles, rises to the challenge. They clasp hands.

                                 PENNY
                        You do know I’ve been to boot camp
                        since our last match. Not to
                        mention outposts in Taliban
                        infested mountains.

                                 ELI
                        Yeah, and I’ve been to sleep away
                        camp in the Berkshires. What’s the
                        difference?

           Penny laughs. Initiates the arm wrestling match. Surprised
           by her strength, Eli pushes back with full force. Then
           slowly backs off, ultimately letting her win.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I didn’t.

                        Bullshit. That smile.

                                 ELI
                        What?

                                 PENNY
                        You’re the worst liar.

           Penny’s laugh is infectious. She returns to packing. The
           siblings each search for the right words but are met with a
           somber silence. Eli turns to leave, reaches the doorway.

                                 ELI
                        Don’t tell my sister I said this,
                        but I’m really going to miss her.

           Without looking up from packing, a faint, solemn, but loving
           smile grows on Penny’s face.

           INT. WASHINGTON TRIBUNE - STAFF MEETING - MORNING

           GORDON WHITE, 75, surly, Editor-In-Chief of the Tribune,
           hunches over the head of a conference table. Built like a
           former power forward; face speckled red from decades of
           single malt scotch; advancing age no match for his temper.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        What’s the difference between us
                        and the Baltimore Examiner?

           Nobody has the balls to answer the rhetorical question.

                        Nobody? How about the Boston Post?

           With each publication, Gordon makes threatening eye contact
           with a different reporter.

                                 GORDON WHITE (cont’d)
                        The Los Angeles Herald? Phoenix

                        Star? The New York Fuckin’ Sun?!

           He lingers on the last reporter, forcing an answer.

           Gordon SLAMS the table.

                        The only reason we’re not worm feed

                        keep swimming, we die.

           Gordon glares at a NERDY REPORTER, hiding in the second row.

                                 GORDON WHITE (cont’d)

                        We swim fast!

           The room holds it’s breath.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        What do you think this is, a
                        fucking half-time pep talk? Give me

           Gordon glares at the Reporter like he’s the lowest form of
           evolution. With unnerving silence he lets him sweat it out.

                        You’re fired. Pack up your stuff,

           In the deafening silence that follows, Eli sees it; the
           opportunity to raise his hand. Cowering in the back of the
           room, he summons his courage and clears his throat. Junior
           beat reporters don’t speak in these meetings.

           Until now.

                        What if we lead with Nate Sterling?

           Heads turn. Eli steps cautiously out of the herd. Gordon
           eyes him suspiciously.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Wave’s coming with this guy. Might
                        as well paddle out to the break.

           Beads of sweat form on his palms and forehead. Gordon’s
           glare burns a hole in his self-confidence.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        Who are you?

                        Tell me why I should waste my front
                        page on this nobody?

                                 ELI
                        Are you referring to me or
                        Sterling, sir?

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        Both.

           Laughter from the VETERAN REPORTERS.

                        The Post and the Globe are treating
                        Sterling like a flash in the pan.
                        If we short him we’ll be kicking
                        ourselves later. If we’re first to
                        the party, we might sell enough
                        papers to give the Vietnamese
                        children an extra ten minutes on
                        their lunch break.

           Muffled gasps.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        You willing to bet your job on this
                        wet dream of yours?

           High on adrenaline, Eli doubles down.

                                 ELI
                        With all due respect, sir, the way
                        you’re talking we might all be out

                        Hail Mary, but he beats laying down
                        and taking the sack.

           Gordon takes a moment. Fooled by Eli’s false bravado, a
           slight smile sneaks through his steely glare.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        Fuck it. How can I fold when a tyro
                        goes all in?

           Gordon looks to RICK ACKERMAN, 52, Senior News Reporter.

                                 GORDON WHITE (cont’d)
                        Ackerman, take the reins. Pick your

                        I’ll take Conrad.

           Kevin fights to contain his excitement. Eli fights to
           contain his jealousy, the wind knocked out of his sails.

                                 GORDON WHITE

                        odds than that, sir.

           Gordon smirks.

                                 GORDON WHITE

           Ackerman winks at Eli, stone-faced.
           INT. WASHINGTON TRIBUNE - HALLWAY - POST MEETING

           Kevin drapes his arm around Eli.

                        whites. My pastels tend to run.

           NICHOLAS O’SHEA, 60, Senior Op-Ed Columnist, impressed with
           Eli’s performance, throws his arm over Eli’s other shoulder.

                                 NICK O’SHEA

           Nick considers this. Then...

                        ever written.

           Nick turns and briskly walks away. Eli stands there, trying
           to process what just happened. Confused. But elated.
           INT. THE MONOCLE - NIGHT

           Trendy, upscale dinner spot on the Hill. Many a political
           alliance forged over these table cloths.

           Eli sits opposite Nicholas O’Shea, rearranging his place
           setting with nervous excitement. The MANAGER approaches.

                        What can I get you, sir?

           Nick yields to Eli, who glances over the menu, masking his
           shock at the prices.

           Nick is offended by Eli’s order.

           A hushed commotion interrupts Eli’s query as SENATOR ROGER
           TURNBULL, 66, early favorite to win the Republican primary,
           strolls in, flanked by STAFFERS and HANGERS-ON.

           Eli is star-struck by the larger-than-life presence of the
           long-time conservative stalwart. Turnbull spots O’Shea from
           across the restaurant, smiles.

                        Hold on to your slacks.

           Turnbull saunters over, shaking a few hands along the way.
           He stares Eli dead in the eye.

                        Funny how often history repeats

                        Stormtroopers have the balls to

                        when the smoke clears to shoot the

                              (overly cheesy)
                        I’ve already won the lottery. I’ve
                        got you!

           Camila grabs the pillow, whacks Eli in the face.

                                 CAMILA
                        How come you’re never this sweet
                        when you’re sober?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ELI
                        Koalas are sweet. I’m a lion. I’m a
                        gorilla. I’m--

                        CAMILA
                                                          ELI
           A chipmunk.
                                                --King Kong!

           Camila laughs in Eli’s face.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        You know what happens to little
                        girls that laugh at King Kong?

           Eli pounds his chest, grunting. In one fell swoop, he shoves
           Camila’s books off the bed. Camila inches backwards. Eli
           crawls on top of her. She playfully resists; giggles as Eli
           kisses her neck down to her collar-bone.

           The lotto drawing flashes on the TV. Camila grabs the
           remote, turns up the volume, and consults her ticket.

                                 LOTTO PRESENTER
                        First ball up, is 4. And the next,
                        is 34. And the next, is 22. And the
                        next, is 13. And the last is 3.

           Camila crumbles her ticket and shoves it in between Eli’s
           lips. He takes it in his mouth and pops it out at Camila.

                                 CAMILA
                        Private island would have been too
                        lonely anyway.

           They cuddle affectionately, face to face.

                                 ELI
                        If we were washed away on a desert
                        island for the rest of our lives.
                        And had nothing. No house, no
                        friends, no money, no phone, no
                        newspapers. Nothing but you and me.
                        I would be okay with that.

                                 CAMILA
                        We would starve.

                                 ELI
                        I would cut off my leg and cook it
                        for you.

           Camila touches her nose to Eli’s.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CAMILA
                        You love me.

           She kisses him. Soft. Unconditional.

                                 ELI
                        You love me.

           Then, Eli spots a book dangling off the side of the bed. He
           grabs it, opens it, and playfully reads in Camila’s voice.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Fracking, the act of blasting a mix
                        of water, sand, and chemicals
                        underground to force natural gas...

           Camila steals the book, straddles Eli, tosses it over her
           shoulder, lets her hair down, and slides off her glasses.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        God, you’re so beautiful.

           The first kiss was tender; this one is animalistic. The
           passion mounts, until...

           "BREAKING NEWS," flashes across the television. Footage of
           Nate Sterling. Camila grabs the remote, turns up the volume.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        I’m canceling cable tomorrow.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        Nate Sterling declared his
                        candidacy for President of the
                        United States this evening, on a
                        tree stump in rural Iowa...

           Eli and Camila share a look of raw euphoria. Eli fishes his
           cell phone and wallet from his pocket and slides out the
           card Turnbull gave him at dinner. He dials.

                                 CAMILA
                        It’s 11pm. Who are you calling?

           Focused, Eli ignores Camila. Turnbull answers.

                                 ELI (INTO PHONE)
                        Senator Turnbull. Eli Brooks,
                        Washington Tribune.

           Camila rolls her eyes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Yeah, O’Shea’s guy. I’m sorry to
                        call so late, but I was wondering
                        if you might share your thoughts on
                        Nate Sterling entering the race.

           Camila is downright bewildered.

                                 ELI (INTO PHONE) (cont’d)
                        Right now? Um, yes, of course. I’ll
                        be there as fast as you can say
                        ’filibuster.’

           Eli hangs up.

                                 ELI
                        I can’t believe I just said that.

           He grabs his keys and starts for the door.

                                 CAMILA
                        Eli! What’s going on?

                                 ELI
                        I’ve got an interview with Roger
                        Turnbull.

                                 CAMILA
                        Stop messing around.

                                 ELI
                        Gotta go.

           Camila studies Eli’s face. No curl at the tip of his lips.

                                 CAMILA
                        Wait, you’re serious?!

                                 ELI
                        I’m terrified.

           Eli heads towards the door.

                                 CAMILA
                        You’re drunk!

                                 ELI
                        Never stopped Van Morrison.

                                 CAMILA
                        You’re a reporter not a rock star.

           Eli winks. Camila springs to action, dashes to the bathroom.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ELI
                        I don’t have time--

                        NOW! And give me the keys.

           Eli tosses her the keys and strips frantically.

           INT. CAMILA’S CAR - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Camila weaves through traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue as Eli
           chugs instant coffee and buttons his shirt.

                                 CAMILA
                        You need to get some real
                        substance. You know how these guys
                        are with their talking points.

           Eli nods as he tinkers with his DIGITAL RECORDING DEVICE.
           Camila pulls in front of the Russell Senate Office Building.

                                 CAMILA (cont’d)
                        I love you. Don’t fuck this up.

                                 ELI
                        Thanks for the pep talk.

           INT. RUSSELL SENATE OFFICE BUILDING - MIDNIGHT

           Empty halls. Eli reaches Turnbull’s office, knocks.

                                 TURNBULL
                        Door’s open.

           Turnbull sits at his mahogany desk, reading glasses at the
           tip of his nose, fountain pen in hand, editing a document.

                                 TURNBULL (cont’d)
                        Mr. Future. Welcome.

                Turnbull gestures to the chair opposite him. Eli sits.

                                 ELI
                        Senator. I appreciate--

                                 TUNRBULL
                        Roger. Don’t mention it.

           CONTINUED:

           Eli pulls the recording device from his coat pocket;
           butterflies taking the place of his buzz.

                                 ELI
                        I’d like to start by asking you--

                                 TURNBULL
                        Peaceful, isn’t it?

                                 ELI
                        I’m sorry?

                                 TURNBULL
                        This is when the real work gets
                        done. No ribbon to cut or baby to
                        hold. I’m a night owl, Eli. And a
                        morning lark. Gotta be both to
                        succeed in this business.

                                 ELI
                        Business?

                                 TURNBULL
                              (smirks)
                        That’s right. You Tribunistas are
                        under the impression it’s a
                        charity.

                                 ELI
                        May I ask why you want to be CEO of
                        a business 16 trillion in the red?

                                 TURNBULL
                        It has its perks.

           Turnbull winks. Eli clicks on his recording device.

                                 ELI
                        I’m sorry Senator, but would you
                        mind elaborating on these "perks?"

           Turnbull laughs.

                                 TURNBULL
                        I keep forgetting, you’re just a
                        cub. Let me explain to you how this
                        works. I’m a politician with a
                        whole lot of character. What does
                        that mean?

                                 ELI
                        You should be in the Smithsonian?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 TURNBULL
                        You’re a funny kid. O’Shea’s got
                        good taste in minions.
                              (patronizing)
                        It means that some things I say
                        are...
                              (using air quotes)
                        ..."on the record." Lots of cameras
                        and microphones are usually a good
                        indicator. Now, when I speak in
                        private, much of what I say is "off
                        the record." You may hear these
                        words; chuckle in response if you
                        so choose; but what you may not do
                        is print them. If you do, I forget
                        that you exist. For me, one less
                        parasite to feed. But for a young
                        reporter trying to make a name for
                        himself during eight years of a
                        Turnbull administration... a death
                        sentence. But I like you, so I’ll
                        help you out. When the paper weight
                        is closer to you...

           Turnbulls SLIDES a dense glass paperweight towards Eli.

                                 TURNBULL
                        ... "on the record."
                              (beat)
                        When it is closer to me...

           BANG!

                        ... "off the record."

           A chill runs down Eli’s spine. He regains his composure,
           reaches across the desk, and slides the paperweight back.

                                 ELI
                        What is your reaction to Nate
                        Sterling entering the race?

           Turnbull glances at Eli’s recording device.

                                 TURNBULL
                        I look forward to a healthy, robust
                        debate about the the future of our
                        great nation. I’m not too familiar
                        with Mr. Sterling personally but
                        anyone who aspires to serve his
                        country, be him a teacher,
                        Lieutenant, or President. They’re
                        okay by me.

                        It doesn’t worry you that forty
                        percent of the country now identify
                        themselves as Independents.

                        Ross Perot was the most successful
                        independent candidate in American
                        history. You know how he did it?

                        He appealed to the center with a
                        platform that was fiscally
                        conservative yet socially liberal--

                                 ELI
                        People respond to common sense and
                        bipartisanship.

                                 TURNBULL
                        People respond to yard signs and
                        attack ads. Moral of the story, if
                        you have a net worth of four
                        billion you can afford nineteen
                        percent of the popular vote. Do you
                        know how many electoral college
                        votes he won? I’ll give you a hint.

                                 ELI
                        Let’s talk about the FSCA. Does it
                        not strike you as more than
                        coincidental that you championed
                        this bill just before--

                                 ELI
                        And then chose to forgo public
                        financing. A first grader could
                        connect the dots.

                                 TURNBULL
                        And what exactly would that first
                        grader find?

                                 ELI
                        That’s the rub. Nothing, thanks to
                        your bill. Some would say you’re
                        putting the Oval Office up for
                        silent auction.

                        Presidents are elected by votes not

                        How many votes can you buy with a

                                 TURNBULL
                        None.

                                 ELI
                        But you can buy a hell of a lot of
                        yard signs and attack ads.

                        What’s legal is legal.

           Eli is unimpressed. He presses on.

                        How would you describe your

                                 TURNBULL
                        It’s not breaking news that Harvey
                        was a Senior Advisor for years.

                                 TURNBULL
                        I’m bored. Why don’t we talk tax
                        reform? How I wanna put a few extra
                        bucks in your pocket so you can
                        afford to shine up those shoes.

           Eli glances at his peeling, scuffed shoes.

                                 ELI
                        Why’d you invite me here tonight?

                                 TURNBULL
                        Nick was right. You can sling these
                        hard balls after half a bottle, you
                        just might have a future.

                        it’s to keep your friends close.

                        And seeing as how you’ll be
                        ghostwriting the most widely read
                        column in the country for the next
                        few weeks, I figured we might get
                        to know each other.

           Eli is shocked. How does he know?

                                 TURNBULL (cont’d)
                        Reporters use their eyes and ears,
                        but they only have two of each.

           Holy shit. Eli tries to compose himself.

                        By some shockingly absurd twist of
                        fate, the twenty-eight year-old
                        beat reporter sitting before me has
                        been granted a modicum of influence
                        over the ballot box. I simply

                        the many powers bestowed upon the
                        executive branch, both formal and
                        informal. One of which is the
                        ability to make or break a young
                        journalist’s career.

                        That’s for you to decide now isn’t
                        it?

           Eli tries to take back control of the conversation.

                                 ELI
                        There are reports that RightWay
                        has raised upwards of two hundred
                        million in just three months. Won’t
                        that give the rich unfair influence
                        over a Turnbull administration?

                        Then you’re not half as smart as

           Turnbull turns the paper weight over in his hands like he
           would a stress ball.

                        the same. Both might get me off on
                        a good day-- but if you think they
                        so much as sway my stance on the

                        Wasilla, Alaska, then you haven’t
                        done your homework.

           Turnbull’s tone turns deadly serious; almost sinister.

                        Money is a means to an end. Those

                        it, come crawling to the government
                        with their hands outstretched like
                        crack fiends. Sterling and Archer
                        want to feed that addiction.
                        They’re enablers. Way I see it--
                        only way to give those people back
                        a shred of dignity is to slap the
                        government check out their hand so
                        they’ll get off their ass and fight
                        for it like the rest of us.

           Eli is frozen by Turbull’s fierce, draconian glare. Turnbull
           tosses the paper weight to Eli, who fumbles it.

                        win. I believe him. I don’t know if
                        I would be any help, but I’d
                        certainly like to try.

           Thompson looks up from the resume, ponders for a moment.

           Camila is caught off guard.

                        I know you mentioned volunteer
                        work. I need you 100 hours a week.

                        I’d love to, Mr. Thompson, but I’m
                        finishing my thesis at Georgetown
                        and I have a job lined up at the

           Camila stands, beaming.

                        It’s a pleasure to meet you.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Camila just accepted a position as

                        environmental platform. Currently
                        it’s not much more than an
                        outline-- need you to flesh it
                        out-- put some meat on the bones.
                        I’ll be back from New Hampshire in
                        a week. Let’s get a sit-down on the

           Camila is over the moon. Nate is charmed by Camila’s
           transparent elation. He flashes a winning smile.

           Thompson smiles, knowing he’s just sealed the deal.

           INT. ELI’S PARENT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Eli unloads a stack of "Death of a Salesman" paperbacks from
           a Barnes and Noble shopping bag onto the kitchen table.

                                 LYNN
                        What’s this?

                                 ELI
                        It was just a matter of time before
                        you spent the last of my
                        inheritance on new books for your
                        kids. Figured I’d beat you to it
                        this time.

                                 LYNN
                              (moved)
                        You didn’t have to do that. I know
                        they’re underpaying you--

                                 ELI
                        Used the gift card you gave me for
                        my birthday.
                              (off Lynn’s look)
                        Don’t worry, got one for myself.

           Eli holds "A Declaration of Independents," by Nate Sterling.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Figured I’d get a clean first
                        edition. Hopefully it will be worth
                        something someday.

           Lynn forces a smile. Eli detects sadness behind glassy eyes.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        What’s up, mom?

                                 LYNN
                        It’s nothing.

                                 ELI
                        It’s not nothing. I’m an adult. You
                        don’t have to protect--

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 LYNN
                        The house.

           This catches Eli by surprise; it lands like a bullet.

                                 ELI
                        You told us we were doing fine.

                                 LYNN
                        I didn’t want to worry you. Lord
                        knows Penny has enough on her mind,
                        and you’re working so hard--

                                 ELI
                        Grandpa built this house!

           This fact cuts too deep for Lynn to acknowledge.

                                 LYNN
                        Your father’s worked too hard. He
                        doesn’t deserve this.

           We hear Hal’s CREAKING steps descend the stairs. Eli looks
           as if he’s had the wind knocked out of him.

           Hal shuffles into the kitchen in a white undershirt. Too
           proud to bring up the unfortunate news, he slaps on a smile.

                                 HAL
                        Hey bud! Didn’t know you were
                        stopping by.

                                 ELI
                        Take it off the market.

                                 LYNN
                        Eli!

                                 ELI
                        Why’d you lie to me?

                                 HAL
                              (demoralized)
                        We didn’t lie. We just--

                                 ELI
                        Penny grew up in the same room you
                        did. I won’t let her come back to
                        anything different.

           Eli walks out, leaving Hal slumped against the kitchen
           counter. Lynn picks up "Death of a Salesman." She considers
           it for a moment before sliding it back into the bag.
           INT. WASHINGTON TRIBUNE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Kevin flirts with JENNY KLINE, 25, an impressionable young
           reporter with a body that could put airbrushers out of work.
           Stealing a glance at Kevin’s wedding band, Eli shakes his
           head in disapproval.

           Eli compares two highlighted spreadsheets. He studies a
           black and white printout of an old University of Virginia
           FRATERNITY COMPOSITE. Something clicks. He starts towards
           Nick’s office.

                        Young boys in ancient Greece had
                        "mentors" too.

           Eli ignores Kevin. Walks on.

                              (masking jealousy)
                        Just say no!

           INT. NICK’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli shuts the door harder than intended. Nick is reading a
           draft of Eli’s ghostwritten column in disbelief.

                                 ELI
                        Nick. You’re not going to believe--

           Nick SMACKS the draft against his desk. We get the sense he
           would do the same with Eli’s face if the blinds were shut.

                                 NICK
                        What the fuck is this?!

           Eli braces for a scolding. Instead, Nick stares daggers.
           Motionless. The calm before the storm.

                                 ELI
                        It’s all true. I have it on tape.

           Nick reaches behind him, swipes his PULITZER PRIZE off the
           shelf and SLAMS it on his desk.

                                 NICK

                        I’d give him the the seismic

                        You talk about the old-school with
                        an air of contempt. But show me two
                        congressmen on opposite sides of
                        the aisle today that share a

           it, but secures it, clutching it like it’s the holy grail.

           Eli tries to snatch a column out of thin air. He types and

           Eli glances at the clock. Begins to sweat. Types the title:

                        The Republicans are having a hard
                        time getting their members to act
                        as a unit instead of like a bunch
                        of six-year-olds playing anarchist
                        soccer; three teams, two goals, you
                        decide...

           Rachel’s volume drops to make way for GLENN BECK.

                                 GLENN BECK
                        Good for you, you have a heart, you
                        can be a liberal. Now, couple your
                        heart with your brain, and you can
                        be a conservative.

                                                the same reason they
                                                promote the rights of
                                                adulterers, pornographers,

                                                instinctively root
                                                for anarchy against

           Over the last 30 odd years
           the Democrats have moved
           to the right and the right
           has moved into a mental
           hospital. They’re a bunch
           of religious lunatics,
           flat-earthers, and civil
           war reenactors, who
           mostly communicate by AM
           Radio and call themselves
           Republicans.

           The screen is split into 16 talking heads. We slowly bring
           the volume up on each and every rant until we’re bombarded
           with overwhelming gibberish.

           Like The Beatles’ "A Day In The Life" the montage builds to
           a FRENETIC CRESCENDO. The cacophony stops on a dime as we
           smash cut back to Eli’s cubicle.

           INT. ELI’S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

           Eli jerks back, startled at Kevin reading over his shoulder.

                                 ELI
                        What the fuck, Kevin?

                        You’re an idiot.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’s not human interest.

           Eli tries to cover.

                                 ELI
                        Alright, listen. Please keep this

                        ring came with a buyback guarantee.

           Kevin has no comeback. He steals a glance at Jenny.

                        Don’t have to be an investigative
                        reporter to crack that one.

           Fury and resentment pile on top of Kevin’s jealousy.

                        same.

           Eli holds his judgmental glare an extra beat before standing
           and heading to Nick’s office.

           INT. NICK’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nick speaks gregariously on the phone. Eli hands him the new
           column and Nick skims it while wrapping up his conversation.

                                 NICK (INTO PHONE)
                        Thank you, Jim. But you’ll be

           Eli processes the compelling motive.

           Nick prints a word document from his computer and hands it
           to Eli. It’s a resume with ELI BROOKS, bold and centered. It

                        when Meyers & Goldstein calls for
                        references.

           Eli is confused. Nick picks up the phone, lowers his voice.

                                 NICK (cont’d)

                        Yes, this is Mr. Shankman. The
                        kid’s a prodigy. You want to double

                        ’head and hire that young man!’
           Eli’s eyes wander to Nick’s diploma, mounted and framed on
           the wall behind him. It reads "Major in Journalism, Minor in
           the Dramatic Arts." Eli shakes his head in disbelief.

           INT. ELI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eli studies "Accounting for Dummies," at the kitchen table.
           Camila returns from a long day at campaign headquarters. Eli
           quickly slides the accounting book into his briefcase.

                        Just be that all-star.

           INT. MEYERS & GOLDSTEIN OFFICES - DAY

           Eli interviews with JIM FLORENCE, who is in hysterics. We
           can tell that Eli is killing it, but the sound is muted.

                                 ELI (V.O.)

                        You’ve got vacation time saved up.

           Jim shakes Eli’s hand, offering him the job.

           INT. MEYERS & GOLDSTEIN OFFICES - DAY

           Eli is given his security clearence on a lanyard.

                        wait and see what changes. If they
                        have nothing to hide they’ll have
                        no reason to come after you. If
                        they do, well...

           Nick doesn’t finish the thought.

           INT. MEYERS & GOLDSTEIN OFFICES - NIGHT

           Eli appears to be leaving for the night but instead ducks
           into a corner office. He tries the file cabinets; locked;
           the computer; password protected. Frustrated, he sneaks out.

           CHYRON: THURSDAY, JULY 10TH

           SPENCER EINHORN, 48, walks out of his corner office and into
           the elevator. Eli checks his watch. It’s lunch. He slides
           in, unnoticed. This time the files are open and the computer
           unlocked. Eli pops in a flashdrive and raids the hard
           drive-- anxiously glancing at the door every few seconds.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                        True. But you catch them red handed
                        and with this one story, your
                        career reaches heights it couldn’t
                        approach if you toiled for fifty
                        years in the trenches. Heights I
                        can’t imagine in my wildest
                        dreams.
           INT. BULLFEATHERS RESTUARANT - DAY

           Nick is mid-interview with Nate Sterling over a lunch of
           burgers and fries. It’s casual. They laugh like old friends.

                        I’m serious, Nick. Nothing about me
                        is off the record. I’m an open
                        book. Just because I listen to
                        different ideas, crazy as they may
                        be-- doesn’t mean I adhere to any
                        one doctrine. Everyone’s got
                        something to say. And some of what
                        anyone says might have some merit.
                        You never know where you might find
                        the spark of the next great idea.

           Nick is awestruck by Sterling’s candor.

                        you only sing in one choir your
                        whole life, you’re only listening

           INT. MEYERS & GOLDSTEIN OFFICES - LATER

           Spencer Einhorn steps off the elevator and walks slowly back
           to his office, chatting with a colleague. Eli peaks out of
           the office, spots Einhorn. He’s trapped.

           Eli panics. Dashes to the window. Looks down thirty floors
           to the hard pavement below. He throws open a closet. It’s
           filled with boxes. Einhorn’s footsteps inch closer.

           Eli dives under the massive hardwood desk just as Einhorn
           enters. Einhorn takes a seat at the desk, feet digging into
           carpet millimeters from Eli’s crouched body.

           Then, a cell phone RINGS. Eli glances at his. Nothing.

                        from practice but I gotta drop him
                        home and head right back in-- Yeah,
                        it’s killing me-- Love you too.

           Einhorn hangs up, stands, and walks out of the office.

           INT. NICK’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Eli enters, shuts the blinds, and SLAMS a giant stack of
           paper on Nick’s desk: Emails, expense reports, profit and

                        dollars is no modest sum and it’s

           Nick stares at the donor list, clearly eying a donation
           amount of seven hundred thousand next to Bob Foster’s name.

                        I’m sorry. Richard is it?-- Did you
                        say five hundred? I donated seven
                        hundred K.

           Nick crosses John Foster off the list. He checks out.

                        Oh yes, so sorry, seven hundred.

           Nick extends the receiver as Bob Foster blabbers on.

                        Nothing yet.

           Bob Foster has stopped blabbering. Nick un-mutes.

                        certainly pass these up the chain.

                        We’re going to take back our

                        part to your continued support.

           INT. NICK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Disheveled and exhausted from another all-nighter, Nick and
           Eli wear the expressions of gold panners with empty pans.
           Neither will admit it but desperation and doubt has set in.

           And then, after months of searching, Eli picks up a scent.
           His weary eyes grow wide as he studies an email from Tom
           Mayfield to Spencer Einhorn, which praises the excellent job
           the caterer did on Mega Millions Fourth of July party.

           Attached is a detailed invoice for "Patriot Catering, Inc."
           Mayfield has signed the email, "compliments to the chef."

                                 ELI
                        Does it make any sense for the CEO
                        of Mega Millions to send an expense
                        report for an office holiday party
                        to a Partner at Meyers and
                        Goldstein?

                                 NICK
                        No. They pay summer interns ten
                        grand to take care of those menial
                        tasks. Why?

           Eli dashes to the trash can. He dumps the "trash" on the
           floor and fishes through the sea of paper on all fours.

           Nick eyes Eli curiously.

           Eli finds an email previously discarded as trivial: An
           expense report for a President’s Day Luncheon. Sure enough,
           "Patriot Catering" invoice attached. "Compliments to the
           Chef." He shuffles, digs and finds: Memorial Day party.
           "Patriot Catering" invoice. "Compliments to the Chef."

           Eli pulls a business card out of his wallet: It’s the
           receptionist from Mega Million’s. He dials:

                                 ELI (INTO PHONE)
                        Hi, I was a plus one at your Fourth
                        of July party and I think my money
                        clip fell out of my pocket. Oh, you
                        didn’t?-- No party?
                              (smiles)
                        I’m sorry, I must have the wrong
                        number.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Holy shit. Eli shoves everything off the desk except for the
           patriot catering invoices and a calculator. He punches in
           numbers from the invoices. Hits equal. We see and hear:

                                 ELI
                        $576,000.

           Eli moves to the white board and frantically erases
           everything. He scribbles calculations as he thinks outloud.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Average MegaMillions jackpot is
                        twenty million. In recessions,
                        jackpots increase by fifteen
                        percent, which means the average
                        jackpot should currently be...

                                 NICK
                        Twenty-three million.

           Eli’s calculation lags slightly behind Nick’s mental math.

                                 ELI
                        Correct. But it’s holding steady at
                        seventeen million.

                                 NICK
                        That’s a gap of six million per
                        drawing over the last forty-eight
                        weeks of recession.

                                 ELI
                        With two drawings a week-- we’re
                        talking about...

           Eli multiplies six by forty-eight by two: Writes 576
           million. He holds up the calculator-- still showing 576,000.

                        ELI
                                                          NICK
           Bingo.
                                                Holy shit.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        For every ten thousand dollars
                        laundered through Patriot
                        Catering--

                                 NICK
                        The invoices show a buck.

           That’s the hiding spot. That’s the scheme.

           Eli rips the address off the invoice and grabs his coat.
           EXT. PATRIOT CATERING - MORNING

           A stoned, pony-tailed, COLLEGE KID, slumps behind the
           counter. A handful of COOKS race around the flaming kitchen
           behind him. Eli examines the menu board; makes "small talk."

                                 ELI
                        Haven’t seen you guys around. How
                        long you been in business?

                        What’s the occasion?

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        They’re all the same to me. Same
                        bacon wrapped scallops. Same monkey
                        suit. Same rich folks boring up the
                        place. So, what can I do you for?

                                 ELI
                        Throwing my wife a birthday party.
                        Can I take a menu home? Should run
                        it by the Mrs-- no telling how many
                        of her girlfriends are gluten free
                        vegans, or God knows what.

           The College Student hands Eli a menu.

                        Number’s up top. Call after your
                        consultation.

           Eli nods, heads for the door. Spins around before he exits.

                                 ELI
                        Hey, is this place family owned?

                        Nope. Dude named Dean owns it.

                                 COLLEGE KID
                        Dean’s never here. Comes around
                        once a month at most-- checks the
                        books, counts his money, and bails.

           INT. STERLING CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

           Nate Sterling stands behind a makeshift podium. Ron Thompson
           and a few SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISORS sit in front of him.
           Camila stands in the back with several CAMPAIGN STAFFERS.

                                 STERLING
                        Donella Meadows, a pioneer of
                        environmental science, when asked
                        if we have enough time to prevent
                        catastrophe, would always say ’we
                        have exactly enough time-- starting
                        now.’

           Camila mouths the quote along with Sterling; the admiration
           in her eyes bordering on idolatry. Ron Thompson, mock
           moderator, asks the next prep question.

                                 RON THOMPSON
                        Trust in government is at an
                        all-time low. Only six percent of
                        Americans approve of Congress while
                        the vast majority believe that
                        money in politics is crippling our
                        democracy. Can you, and will you,
                        restore trust and accountability?

           Sterling’s tone is strong, direct, and matter-of-fact.

                                 STERLING
                        Simply put: The American people are
                        sick and tired of two-faced,
                        holier-than-thou, career Washington
                        insiders, speaking out of both
                        sides of their mouths like
                        glorified ventriloquists...

           The shocked faces of Sterling’s staffers morph into...
           INT. JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           CHYRON: MONDAY, OCTOBER 14TH

           ... Shocked faces in the audience at the Third Presidential
           Debate. Wow. The gloves have come off!

                                 STERLING

                        priority" of the Senate Minority
                        Leader is to make the opposing
                        party a one-term president... at a
                        time when thousands of our own
                        fight for democracy abroad and
                        millions at home can’t find honest
                        work-- frankly, it’s deplorable.

           Sterling lays bare D.C.’s skewed system of incentives.

                        Congressmen are being held hostage

                        party who they rely on to win
                        primaries and raise millions and
                        I’m the only candidate that can set
                        them free! Why? Because my
                        administration-- unaffiliated, and
                        thus unhindered, by any party line,
                        will have the freedom to pursue the
                        best course of action on every
                        issue-- sometimes more liberal,
                        sometimes more conservative, and
                        most of the time a mix of both.
                              (beat)
                        And in turn, our Senators and
                        Congressmen won’t have to choose
                        between what’s best for their
                        country and what’s best for their
                        re-election campaign. They’ll be
                        off the hook, free to vote for what
                        they truly believe in.

           Faces in the hall are pondering if not already convinced.

                        Some profound. Some a matter of
                        life and death. America needs a
                        leader who makes these decisions
                        based on rock solid values and
                        unwavering integrity, not political
                        convenience.

           Turnbull sizes up an uneasy David Archer.

                                 ROGER TURNBULL (cont’d)
                        When David Archer first ran for
                        Governor of Michigan, he believed
                        marriage was between a man and a
                        woman. Now that he’s safely in his
                        second term-- he seems hell bent on
                        destroying the institution. He
                        voted for the war in Iraq as a
                        Congressman-- today, mention the
                        United State’s role in any foreign
                        conflict and watch him run for the
                        hills. And don’t even get me
                        started on his utter disregard for
                        the Second Amendment.

           Turnbull diverts his ire towards Sterling.

                                 ROGER TURNBULL (cont’d)
                        Now, I can’t in good conscience say
                        the same for Professor Sterling--
                        but then again, I can’t say
                        anything of the Professor. He has
                        no record. No experience. Don’t get
                        me wrong, I’m not saying that the
                        decision to pass or fail an
                        eighteen year old freshman in
                        Civics 101 should be taken lightly.
                        But we’re talking about the
                        decision to send eighteen-year-old
                        boys off to volatile war-zones.

                        Governor Archer, Senator Turnbull
                        has accused you of running for the
                        hills in the face of foreign
                        conflict. Meanwhile Iran’s nuclear
                        ambitions inch closer to reality.

                        How would you respond to Senator
                        Turnbull’s attack, and more
                        importantly, how would you respond
                        to an Iran that might someday have
                        the ability to launch an attack
                        against America?

                                 GOVERNOR ARCHER
                        I won’t insult the American people
                        by spending even one breath on the
                        triviality of Senator Turnbull’s
                        attack on me when the second attack
                        you’ve mentioned is infinitely more
                        real and important. I want to make
                        this very clear. My administration
                        will not, under any circumstances,
                        tolerate a nuclear Iran. I will not
                        hesitate to employ military force
                        to prevent the biggest threat to
                        our safety from coming to fruition.

           Senator Turnbull breaks in.

                                 SENATOR TURNBULL
                        I’ve been saying just that ever
                        since the I.A.E.A. reported Iran’s
                        research into nuclear weapons in
                        2011. You, Governor, have been
                        touting back room pow-wows with
                        Hassan Rohhani until just now. Glad
                        you’ve finally come around. Must
                        have seen the latest opinion polls.
                        Any way the wind blows.

                        With all due respect, Senator, this
                        isn’t a schoolyard scuffle. We
                        can’t just bully our way--

                                 TURNBULL
                        With all due respect, Professor,
                        you have spent your entire career
                        in a cushy teacher’s lounge. By the
                        looks of it, I’ll bet you’ve never
                        thrown a punch in your life.

           It’s turning contentious but Candy let’s it go. If anything,

                        fighter in the world because he can
                        punch the hardest. Tyson is in his
                        forties, Foreman in his sixties-- I
                        bet they both still punch harder.
                        But Pacquiao-- he studies his
                        opponents; tirelessly gathers intel
                        so he can see the fight through
                        their eyes. He trains harder;
                        develops a clear and superior game
                        plan with an experienced and loyal
                        team in his corner. And when the
                        time comes to slide under the ropes
                        and into the ring, it’s his
                        footwork, not his fists, that put
                        him in position for the knockout.

                        politicos. Almost came to blows
                        over LBJ’s "Great Society."

                        So when did Mayfield become a
                        Republican?
                              (off Conway’s confusion)
                        I checked the public record for the
                        voting history of everyone on the
                        composite. Mayfield voted in the
                        Republican primary. He’s an
                        elephant.

                        You must have the wrong Tom
                        Mayflield. He’s a lifelong
                        Independent. Always prided himself
                        on not being a member of either
                        "cult" as he’d call it. Tommy is a
                        social liberal-- was a big
                        supporter of the Civil Rights Act,
                        War on Poverty-- but he came up
                        through the Comm School so
                        fiscally, he’s a free market guy.

                        This Mayfield character seems like
                        one of Turnbull’s earliest foils.
                        Every news outlet in the country
                        has been running debate analysis
                        for the past two days. It was stale
                        after the second hour. But
                        Turnbull’s first debate-- one that
                        took place with his head in the
                        dryer-- it’s what a man says when
                        nobody can hear him that truly
                        fascinates me. That’s a story.

           Conway seems satisfied.

                        Last political rant from Tommy came
                        in an email-- read more like a
                        novel. Had a link to The
                        Declaration of Independents the
                        week it came out. Happy for the
                        guy. Finally got someone on the
                        national stage he can get behind.

           INT. NICK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Nick abuses his calculator, crunching numbers over an
           avalanche of RightWay documents. Eli storms in.

                        Tom Mayfield is a lifelong
                        Independent. Hates Turnbull’s guts.
                        He registered as a Republican a
                        month after Sterling’s book hit the
                        best sellers list. Figured people
                        like us picked up a scent, it’d
                        steer us off the trail from the

                                 ELI
                        Don’t you dare try to justify--

                                 CAMILA
                        HE’S WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS!

                                 ELI
                        A LIAR IS THE LAST THING THIS
                        COUNTRY NEEDS! Liars fucked this
                        country up in the first place. Iraq
                        has stockpiles of WMD’s at the
                        ready; these CDC’s are foolproof;
                        housing prices will just keep
                        rising. Lobbyists, pundits,
                        preachers... we have billion dollar
                        industries that run on lies!

                                 CAMILA
                        What is it that you want, Eli?!

                                 ELI
                        All I want, for once in my life, is
                        for someone to tell me the fucking
                        truth.

           A hint of sympathy in Camila’s eyes.

                                 CAMILA
                        The truth doesn’t exist, Eli.
                        Search for it too long, you’ll get
                        lost in reality.

           Eli lets this settle. Then...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ELI
                        I’m publishing the story with or
                        without your help.

           Camila considers this, then pushes back; quiet but harsh.

                                 CAMILA
                        What about me? Do you care--

                                 ELI
                        Camila--

                                 CAMILA
                        You publish this story I don’t want
                        anything to do with you.

                                 ELI
                        That’s not fair.

                                 CAMILA
                        Love fades. Values don’t.

           Eli’s expression is pure heartbreak. He grabs a jacket off
           the table and SLAMS the door behind him on the way out.

                                 CAMILA
                        That’s my jacket!

           The door swings back open. Eli throws Camila’s jacket hard
           at the chair and misses. He grabs his own jacket, and again,
           SLAMS the door behind him.

           EXT. ELI AND CAMILA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Eli fishes a white plastic security KEY CARD out of his
           pocket. It reads: Sterling Campaign Headquarters - Camila
           Hart. He pulls Camila’s campaign CREDENTIALS out of the
           other pocket. Bingo.

           INT. ELI’S CAR - NIGHT

           Eli races down K street through POURING RAIN. He dials Nick.

                                 ELI (ON PHONE)
                        Meet me at Recessions. Basement
                        dive, two blocks northwest of
                        Farragut Square. I have something.
           INT. RECESSIONS - LATER

           No serious politico would be caught dead in this grimy bar.
           Even if they were, the CRACK of billiard balls and OFF-KEY
           karaoke weave a sound proof cocoon around each booth.

           It’s not lost on us that drunk American University SORORITY
           GIRLS are butchering "We Didn’t Start the Fire."

           Eli anxiously TAPS Camila’s key card on the table. He
           glances at his cell: 11:44pm. He places the phone on the
           table, grabs a napkin and BLOWS his runny nose. Eli is
           coming down with a nasty cold.

           Nick slides into the cocoon. Eli slides him the key card.

                                 ELI
                        I’m going tonight.

           Nick shakes his head like a disapproving father.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                          I won’t get caught.

                                 NICK
                        That might be verbatim what Nixon’s
                        crooks told themselves in ’74, just
                        before they pulled ski masks over
                        their heads.

           Eli pulls Camila’s credentials from his pocket and puts it
           around his neck.

                                 ELI

                        measure?

           Eli smiles with the confidence and energy of a man with
           nothing left to lose.

                        in an hour.

           Shit, he’s right. Eli gets up to leave. Determined. He turns
           back to Nick, thinks for a moment.

                                 ELI
                        Why’d you ask me to ghostwrite your

           Eli waits for an answer.
           hurries out of the bar, forgetting his phone on the table.

           It RINGS. Camila is on the caller ID. Torn, Nick answers on
           the last ring.

                                 NICK
                        Nicholas O’Shea.

           INTERCUT with Camila recklessly speeding towards Ballston.
           She yells into speaker phone.

                        Put Eli on the phone, please. It’s
                        his girlfriend.

           Nick thinks quick. He channels his drama minor and pretends
           to talk to Eli, loud enough for Camila to overhear.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Nick holds the phone out to the drunk sorority girls,
           belting the latest Taylor Swift.

                                 CAMILA
                        Shit.

           Camila hangs a sudden, TIRE-SCREECHING, U-turn as her car
           cuts right in front of...

           INT. ELI’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Eli’s Ford Echo! Inches from T-Boning him into the
           afterlife. But Eli swerves onto the sidewalk, narrowly
           misses a PEDESTRIAN, and takes out a few NEWSPAPER RACKS,
           before swerving back and racing on.

                                 ELI

                        FUCK!

           EXT. STERLING CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           We watch Eli’s car from afar as it pulls up and parks a
           block from headquarters. Eli slumps in his seat, canvassing
           the entrance. He COUGHS. We can see his breath.
           INT. RECESSIONS - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           We watch from afar as Camila storms up to Nick. No Eli. She
           becomes hysterical. We can’t make out words over the raucous
           bar, but it’s heated. Nick slowly manages to calm her down.

           EXT. STERLING CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Eli walks past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, casually flashing
           Camila’s credentials, picture facing in. Satisfied, they let
           him pass. He slides the key card into the door.

           INT. STERLING CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Two WEARY VOLUNTEERS walk towards the exit. Eli never breaks
           stride, slapping on a confident smile as he passes them. He
           arrives at Sterling’s office. The door is closed. He glances
           left, then right, down the empty hall.

           Just as his hand is about to grasp the knob, it turns! Eli
           zips his jacket over Camila’s credentials as the door swings
           open. He stands face to face with a startled Ron Thompson.

                                 RON THOMPSON
                        Jesus, you scared the shit out of
                        me, kid. Wait, I know you?

                                 ELI
                        Camila Hart’s boyfriend.

                                 RON THOMPSON
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ELI
                        Camila hasn’t come home. I figured
                        she was working late, but-- do you
                        know where I might find her?

                                 RON THOMPSON
                        Everything alright?

                                 ELI
                        Oh, yeah. It’s just-- my mother.
                        She’s... not doing so well.

           Ron buys it.

                                 RON THOMPSON
                        Sorry to hear that.
                              (beat)
                        If she’s still here she’ll be down
                        the hall, third door on the right.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 ELI
                        Thank you.

           When Eli arrives at the third door on the right, he turns
           back to see Thompson leaving the building, coat in hand.
           Once Thompson is out the door, Eli does a 180 and returns to
           Sterling’s office. He peaks inside. Empty. He tiptoes in.

           INT. STERLING’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Eli combs Sterling’s desk. A draft of the Busch Stadium
           rally speech sits adjacent framed pictures of his family.

           Off screen, we hear a toilet FLUSH. Eli freezes, looks to a
           door inside the office, apparently leading to a private
           bathroom. Eli ducks under the desk as the door CREAKS open.

           FOOTSTEPS creep closer. Sterling takes a seat.

           His feet come to rest inches from Eli who crouches against
           the back of the desk. A twitch of his foot and contact will
           be made. Are you fucking kidding me? Again?

           But Sterling is a steady man. No nervous foot tapping.

           Eli has a tingle on his nose. He scratches. His nose runs
           like the Nile. He feels a sneeze coming on, manages to hold
           it in. Then another. Holds it in. But the unfortunate thing
           about sneezes is... they always come in threes...

           CHAAAACHOOOOO!

           Sterling pops his head under the desk, spots Eli, jolts back
           and falls off his chair.

                                 STERLING
                        SECURITY!

                        world about the lottery.

           Sterling is about to scream for security again.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Think before you scream. The story
                        is written and ready to go to

           Before Sterling can answer, Camila barges in the room,
           soaking wet and raving.

                        For one, we both lack experience.

           Nick lurks in the shadow of the doorway; still as stone.
           Shocked, Sterling walks towards Nick with his palm extended.

           Eli turns his pockets inside out and let’s Camila search
           him. Satisfied, she turns to Nick.

                                 NICK
                        That won’t be necessary.

           Nick shoots Sterling a condesceding look, but ultimately
           gives in. Camila searches him.

                        found the smoking gun. But, as my

                        scavenger hunt to find proof of
                        your involvement. And as you well
                        know, once you plant a juicy idea
                        in the American consciousness,
                        they’ll believe it whether it’s
                        true or not. The allegation itself
                        knocks you out of the White House.
                        You will be disgraced. You will
                        spend the next couple years in
                        court and the next couple decades
                        after that in jail. These are all
                        facts. So the way I see it, if you

                        loyalty lie with the truth? Or with
                        the consequences of the truth?

           Sterling wipes sweat from his brow. His eyes dart back and
           forth, desperate to turn this around.

           We can’t tell if Nick is giving the offer serious

                        If I wasn’t so inexperienced I’d
                        think you were using a commissioned
                        officer as collateral in a bribe.

                                 STERLING
                        I’d call it an agreement among
                        friends. All you have to do is
                        forget this conversation ever
                        happened.

                        We’re all on the same team, Eli.

                                 NICK
                        There we have it. All cards on the
                        table. So, what’s the move?

           After a long, loaded silence, Eli stands and walks out.

                                 NICK (cont’d)
                        The man has spoken.

           INT. TRIBUNE HEADQUARTERS - ELI’S CUBICLE - LATER

           Eli types feverishly. The clock reads 4:04am.

           EXT. ELI’S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

           Eli walks up the path to his apartment in the dark.

           INT. ELI’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Adrenaline waning, Eli opens the door. The place is trashed.

           Kitchen table flipped over, glass vases smashed, pictures
           ripped out of frames, clothes everywhere. Eli’s fight or
           flight instincts kick in. He slides cautiously to the
           kitchen. Grabs a BUTCHER’S KNIFE.

                                 ELI
                        Hello? Anyone here?-- Camila?

           No answer. He tip-toes through the rest of the apartment.
           Nothing. Out of the corner of his eye... a flashlight beam.

           A KNOCK.

                                 DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir?

           Eli whips around. It’s a BEAT COP. Eli SIGHS relief.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        We got a call for a noise
                        disturbance.

                                 ELI
                        Thank God you’re here--

           The cop steps into the apartment and shuts the door . Then,
           he pulls his gun from the holster and raises it at Eli.

           Eli drops the butchers knife, back peddles, and trips over
           the couch, and raises his hands, palms out.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        Whoa, whoa, what-- who are you?

                                 BEAT COP
                        That’s for you to decide now isn’t
                        it? I could be the only man to know

                              (beat)
                        Then again, maybe I’m a figment of

                              (stepping towards Eli)
                        So, tell me, Eli, which one am I? I
                        get paid either way.

                                 ELI
                        The story is with a friend who has
                        strict orders to publish it if he
                        can’t get in touch with me by
                        midnight tomorrow.

                                 BEAT COP
                        You’re not much of a poker player
                        are you?

                                 ELI
                        There’s only one way to tell which
                        one of us is bluffing.

                                 BEAT COP
                        And what would that be?

           Eli gathers all the courage he didn’t know he had. The
           barrel of the gun tracking him as he moves slowly to the
           front door and opens it.

                                 ELI
                        Get the fuck out of my apartment.

           The cop tilts his head slightly, considering Eli’s bold
           move. Then, he lunges at Eli, SLAMMING the door shut, and
           lodging the barrel firmly against Eli’s adam’s apple.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Eli GASPS for breath. Choking. Seconds are hours.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                              (through gritted teeth)
                        And do me a favor. Give my
                        compliments to the Chef.

           The cop PISTOL-WHIPS Eli across the face. Eli falls to his
           knees. The cops towers over him.

                                 BEAT COP
                        Give me a reason to come back. Next
                        time I won’t be so gentle.

           Blood drips from Eli’s lip. The cop KICKS him hard in the
           gut, grins smugly, opens the door, and walks into the night.

           INT. ELI’S CAR - BELTWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Eli races down the highway, holding his ribs, trembling.

           INT. ELI’S PARENT’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Eli swings opens the door. Camila sits beside Lynn and Hal.

                                 LYNN
                        Eli! Your eye?!

           Eli locks the door behind him. He frantically pulls a couch
           in front of the door and rushes around the living room,
           closing all blinds as he peaks out the windows, paranoid.

           Eli helps his parents off their armchairs.

                                 ELI
                        We need to get out of here.

                                 HAL
                        Eli, calm down. Camila told us--

                                 ELI
                        DON’T BELIEVE A WORD CAMILA SAYS!

           Eli stares down Camila, breathing heavily. Camila smiles.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        What the fuck are you smiling
                        about?!

           Hal and Lynn are shocked by Eli’s erratic behavior. Then,
           Camila pulls Eli’s recording device out of her bra.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I had to commit or your face would

           INT. RECESSIONS - NIGHT

           Camila sits across from Nick. Dripping wet and distressed.

                                 NICK
                        Do you love him?

           Camila doesn’t answer.

                                 NICK (cont’d)
                        I’ve learned a thing or two in my
                        six decades on this planet. But the
                        most meaningful lesson-- didn’t
                        learn it until this year.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Camila listens intently.

                        Money, influence; they’re nice.

                        But none of it matters-- none of it
                        is real-- unless you have someone
                        to share it with.

           A tear mixes with the drops of rain on Camila’s face. But
           before she can allow herself to take it to heart...

                                 CAMILA
                        Why’d you take Eli under your wing?

           Nick takes a long, slow, sip; finishing his beer.

                                 NICK
                        Would you believe me if I said I
                        saw a little of myself in him?

           Eli is moved halfway to tears. Camila hands Eli the
           recording device.

                                 ELI
                        Does this mean you want me to

           Overwhelmed and exhausted, he collapses into the couch.

                                 ELI
                        I don’t know what the right
                        decision is anymore.
           INT. BUSCH STADIUM, ST. LOUIS - NIGHT

           CHYRON: MONDAY, OCTOBER 21ST

           We have finally arrived back at the first scene. Nate
           Sterling speaks with extraordinary passion and emotion.

                                 STERLING
                        ... we cannot erase the past, but
                        we can, we must, learn from it.

           He stares directly into the camera, as if pleading with Eli
           to take his words to heart.

           INT. TRIBUNE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Eli watches the tiny TV in Kevin’s cubicle. He considers the
           speech, then shakes it off and turns back to his computer.

           He uploads the audio file from the recording device as Kevin
           continues to watch Sterling’s speech in the background, feet
           up on his desk, completely oblivious.

           Eli’s cell phone RINGS.

                                 ELI
                        Hello?
                              (concerned)
                        Slow down.

           As Eli listens, his face turns ghost white. He hangs up and
           stares aimlessly into the tumult of the newsroom. His eyes
           draining of all vitality.

           For a moment, he is paralyzed with shock. Then, he springs
           into action. He saves the story, along with the audio
           evidence, to a flash-drive and hurries to Gordon White’s
           office. Empty.

           He barges into Nick’s office. Also, NOT there.

           Eli dashes back to his cubicle and grabs his jacket. He
           looks like he’s in a trance.

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s up with you, man?

           But Eli is already out the door.

           We stay with Kevin. What was that all about? He glances
           about the office, then slides into Eli’s cubicle and flips
           on the monitor.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           In the shock of the moment, running on no sleep, Eli failed
           to log out or shut down his computer. Kevin reads the story.
           Naturally, he’s astonished.

           He surveys the floor. Hundreds of reporters all too busy to
           notice anything out of the ordinary. Kevin slips in his own
           flashdrive and saves the story along with all the carefully
           organized evidence. He logs out and flips off the monitor.

           INT. ELI’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - DAY

           Heartbroken family and friends pay respects at a Shiva call
           for Lieutenant Penny Brooks, killed in action.

           Lynn uses her hosting duties as distraction but we sense her
           utter hollowness. Hal is unable to control his emotions.

           Eli sits in the corner, trembling uncontrollably. His shirt
           untucked and his tie hanging low, he stares ahead into
           nothing, disheveled and numb. Camila sits next to him with
           her hand on his back. Neither speak. Kevin approaches.

                                 KEVIN
                        Eli... I’m so sorry.

           It’s unclear if Eli even registers Kevin’s presence. He’s
           paralyzed. Lost. Kevin fidgets uncomfortably.

                                 KEVIN (cont’d)
                        Senseless war.

           Eli looks at his dad, slumped in a chair; broken; surrounded
           by friends but looking through them. Then to his mom,
           forcing a lifeless smile. It’s emotionally soul-crushing.

                                 ELI
                              (through tears)
                        We’ll be out soon. Sterling will
                        bring Penny’s friends home--

           Holy shit. He’s going to sit on the story.

           INT. WASHINGTON TRIBUNE HEADQUARTERS - EVENING

           It’s a madhouse. No sleep allowed.

           Kevin stands outside Gordon White’s office, flash-drive in
           hand. He takes a deep breath, walks in.

                                 KEVIN
                        Excuse me, Mr. White. Can I have a
                        minute of your time?

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        No.

                                 KEVIN
                        I have something you’re going--

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        Who do you think you are marching
                        in here--

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m your savior.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        Excuse me?

           Kevin sticks the flash drive into Gordon’s computer.

                                 GORDON WHITE (cont’d)
                        What the hell are you--

                                 KEVIN
                        Open it.

           Gordon opens the file and begrudgingly reads the article. He
           clicks on the audio file. We hear STERLING’S VOICE.

           Gordon’s eyes light up like the fourth of July.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        Who else knows?

           Kevin hesitates.

                                 KEVIN
                        Nobody.

                                 GORDON WHITE
                        You just saved this paper, son.
                        Hell, you just changed the course
                        of history.

           Kevin fights to contain his excitement.
           INT. PENNY’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Eli lies in Penny’s bed, motionless, curled up in the fetal
           position. His puffy eyes scan the framed photos on the wall.

           EXT. ELI’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - MORNING

           Eli opens the front door to the sunrise. He grabs the
           Tribune off the stoop. The front page headline reads:

           STERLING EXTENDS LEAD AFTER STIRRING RALLY IN CLEVELAND

           His cell phone RINGS. Caller ID reads: Kevin Conrad. Eli
           answers. Before he can even say hello...

                                 KEVIN
                        Where are you?

                                 ELI
                        My parents’ house.

                                 KEVIN
                        Meet me at the IHOP on Delaware in
                        twenty minutes.

                                 ELI
                        It’s 7am!

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s an emergency.

                                 ELI
                        What’s this about?

                                 KEVIN
                        I was fired.

                                 ELI
                        What? Why?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because I used the names Nate
                        Sterling and Tom Mayfield in the
                        same sentence.

           Eli’s eyes go wide with shock. Kevin hangs up.
           INT. IHOP BOOTH - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           Two cups of coffee on the table. Eli sits alone, impatient.
           Kevin slides across from Eli, frantic.

                                 ELI
                              (whispering aggressively)
                        How the fuck do you know--

                                 KEVIN
                        The other night, when you got...
                        the call-- you left in a hurry-- I
                        knew something was up.
                              (beat)
                        I logged into your computer and
                        read the whole thing.

           Rage boiling over Eli’s eyes.

                                 KEVIN (cont’d)
                        I would never steal it-- but then
                        at the Shiva call I realized you
                        were going to sit on it and--
                        goddamnit Eli, Turnbull needs to
                        win! He’s the best man for--

                                 ELI
                              (fuming)
                        You changed the byline and gave the
                        story to Gordon White?

           Kevin nods-- half ashamed, half justified in his actions.

                                 KEVIN
                        Gordon flipped for it. Said I’d
                        wake up to a headline that would
                        change the course of history.
                        Instead I woke up to an email
                        informing me that the Tribune was
                        terminating my contract. Rushed to
                        the office and security wouldn’t
                        even let me in the building. I
                        called Jenny and she said an IT guy
                        had cleared out my computer.

           Eli thinks out loud. Cogs turning. Anger mounting.

                                 ELI
                              (of course)
                        He killed the story to save his own
                        ass.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 KEVIN
                        Why would he--

                                 ELI
                        CEO of Viacom-- what’s his name--
                        Andrew Bennett. Big Sterling
                        supporter. Viacom owns the Tribune.
                        Gordon prints the story and
                        Sterling loses because of it--
                        Bennett orders Gordon’s head on a
                        platter. He kills the story and
                        Sterling wins... guess which paper
                        has a direct line to the Oval
                        Office.

                                 KEVIN
                              (losing his shit)
                        Gordon’s playing politics dirtier
                        than the fucking politicians.

           Eli stands abruptly. He takes a few steps toward the door
           then swings back around.

                                 ELI
                        I almost forgot.

           Eli slides a ten out of his wallet, his fingers trembling
           from the avalanche of emotion snowballing from his sister’s
           death, the crushing stress of his decision, and the fury at
           Kevin’s betrayal.

                                 KEVIN
                        Eli, I got it. It’s the least--

           THWACK! Eli SOCKS Kevin across the face with a closed fist.

           It lands hard and square, drawing blood. Eli tosses the ten
           on the table, covering the coffees.

                                 ELI
                        You’re unemployed. It wouldn’t be
                        right.

           INT. WASHINGTON TRIBUNE HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           Eli navigates the maze of cubicles. A couple colleagues nod
           hello but most are too busy to look up from their computers.

           He arrives at his desk and pulls up the story. Begins typing
           like mad to update it. Election coverage plays on every TV.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Lynn writes an essay question on the chalkboard. With her
           back to the class of inner-city NINTH GRADERS, she takes a
           deep breath, fighting to hold it together.

           The desks are wobbly, the books tattered, the wallpaper
           crumbling, and the computer at the front, 10 years old.

                                 LYNN
                        Why does Willie Lowman reject
                        Charley’s job offer?

           INT. WALMART - OFFICE - DAY

           Hal sits opposite a WALMART STORE MANAGER. His disheveled
           hair and wrinkled shirt betrays his lack of enthusiasm for
           the job prospect.

                                 WALMART STORE MANAGER
                        Why are you interested in working
                        for WALMART?

           Hal’s sunken eyes look through him; searching for an answer.

           INT. ELI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Camila sits up in bed reading in article in the American
           Scientist entitled "HOW LATE IS TOO LATE?" over pictures of
           a blazing sun, melting ice caps, and a rising thermometer.

           Eli lies under the covers with his back to Camila,
           pretending to sleep. But his eyes are open. Red. Puffy.
           Exhausted but unable to shut. Desperately thinking.

           INT. ELI’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - PENNY’S ROOM - EVENING

           Eli sits at Penny’s desk. His hands lie gently on the spot
           where the arm wrestling match took place.

           He solemly gazes up at the picture of him and Penny as kids;
           showing off their snow fort after a blizzard.

           INT. NICK’S OFFICE - MORNING

           CHYRON: MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4TH: ONE DAY UNTIL ELECTION

           Eli enters. He looks terrible; wholly torn up by the events
           of the past week and magnitude of the decision. He places
           his flash-drive with the story on Nick’s desk.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ELI
                        Are you in?

           Nick takes off his reading glasses, picks up the flashdrive.
           Oddly, and suddenly, Nick bursts into laughter.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        What’s so funny?

           It’s gallows humor. Nick too, is entirely overwhelmed. He
           catches his breath, pulls himself together, and turns the
           flash-drive over in his hand.

                                 NICK
                        The weight of the world lies in the
                        palm of my hand.
                              (beat)
                        I guess, I thought it’d be a bit
                        heavier.

           Then, he tosses the flash-drive back to Eli.

                                 NICK (cont’d)
                        It’s your story.

                                 ELI
                        I stumbled upon it, yes. But if you
                        didn’t guide me, if you didn’t get
                        me into Meyers and Goldstein--

                                 NICK
                        You would have gotten in some other
                        way.

                                 ELI
                        If you want out, just say it.

                                 NICK
                        I doubted you. You fought through
                        the doubt and took me for the ride.
                        I didn’t provide anything you
                        didn’t already--

                                 ELI
                        You can now!

                                 NICK
                        What?

                                 ELI
                        Credibility. Sterling was right.
                        Nobody knows my name. We’ve got
                        less than twenty-four hours to the

                        election. I publish this myself, it
                        won’t get any traction. But coming
                        from Nicholas O’Shea, it’s on every
                        front page and television network
                        within minutes. We need to do this
                        together.

           Eli senses Nick coming around. He doubles down.

                                 ELI (cont’d)
                        And after we shock the world, we
                        set up our own shop. No editor or
                        parent corporation telling us what
                        we can and can’t print. A
                        publication that answers to nothing
                        but the truth.

                                 NICK
                        What would we call it?

           A moment, as Eli considers.

                                 ELI
                        The Independent.

                        The Independent.

           We see life returning to eyes that were once bitter and
           jaded. An offer of a new mountain peak for a climber that
           thought he’d scaled them all.

           Then, suddenly, Nick opens a drawer in his desk and pulls
           out the copy of ELI’S ORIGINAL COLUMN with Turnbull’s "off
           the record" remarks about the struggling poor in America.

                                 NICK (cont’d)
                        Nothing but the truth, huh?

           Eli smiles ear to ear.

                        You got a digital copy of this

           Eli pops the flash-drive into Nick’s computer.

                        The audio file is on here too.

           Nick attaches the Turnbull column to a blank outgoing email.

                        help them; Turnbull thinks they
                        should shut up and help themselves.

           Nick attaches the Sterling story to the same email.

           Nick attaches the Sterling audio file to the email.

           Nick drags his entire ADDRESS BOOK into the address box.

           Forty-two years of contacts.

           Thousands of the biggest names in media.

           Eli and Nick share a look of mutual respect, friendship, and
           now, professional partnership. They are finally at peace
           with their ultimate decision.

           Eli leans over the computer. He deletes Nick’s Tribune
           signature and replaces it with "The Independent." Below that
           he types "Nicholas O’Shea & Eli Brooks, Editors-in-Chief."

                                 ELI
                        You do the honors.

           Nick smiles, shakes his head.

                                 NICK
                        That’s your privilege.

           A deep breath. Then. Eli hits send. A beat, as the
           earth-shatering significance of that simple click of the
           mouse, begins to settle in.

                                 ELI
                        Now what?

                                 NICK
                        Now, we wait for the tsunami.

           Silence. The clock ticks.

           Then, through the glass wall... one by one... stunned faces
           and shocked eyes turn towards Nick’s office.

           The PHONE RINGS. The second line. And the third.

                                 NICK (cont’d)
                        What do you say we get out of here?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ELI
                        And go where?

                                 NICK
                        Watch the fireworks from the Hill.

           They exit Nick’s office and stroll through the maze of
           colleagues and cubicles. All eyes are on them. Mouths agape.

           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - DAY

           Nick and Eli stroll towards Capitol Hill. From a bird’s eye
           view we see the feeding frenzy closing in.

           Reporters of all stripes rush with cameras and microphones,
           tripping over each other to get the first interview as we...

           FADE OUT
