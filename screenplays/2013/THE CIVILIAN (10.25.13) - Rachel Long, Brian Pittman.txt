           Traditional mission parameters for a covert operative involve 
           fabricating a cover identity to infiltrate terrorist cells. 

           But, in the modern era of information transparency and pervasive 
           technology, that methodology has proven antiquated, leading to 
           the deaths of many agents.

           In 2008, the U.S. government instituted a radical new 
           infiltration technique employed by Department Thirty, a Top 
           Secret division of the Pentagon. 

           With such extreme tactics came new risk. However, that risk no 
           longer implicates the spy; the danger now falls upon...

           EXT. SAHARA DESERT - DAWN - TODAY

           Biblical. Infinite horizon. Salmon-hued sand. Cerulean skies. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: WESTERN SAHARA

           CLOSE ON HANDGUN: Tied to a TRACKER’S WAIST.

           A TRACKER, hidden under a turban and blue billowing fabric, 
           sits regally on his white camel. He follows CAMEL TRACKS in 
           the sand toward the crest of a DUNE and descends to a 

           DESERT ROAD

           Sweltering. The remains of a DRONE STRIKE litter the road. 

           ARMED ISLAMIC MILITANTS sift through charred cars, scorched 
           earth and twisted metal. Several try to retrieve a torched 
           SURFACE-TO-AIR LAUNCHER. 

           Armed Militants become aware of the Tracker. Stop. Aim. 

           The Tracker makes no attempt to flee. He raises his hand.    
           A gesture. His HANDGUN stays hidden.

           The MILITANT LEADER has fair eyes like the Tracker’s. He 
           returns the Tracker’s gesture. Lowers his weapon and motions 
           to a MOUND some 200 yards in the distance. 

           The Tracker moves on. Unmolested. 

           He passes a debris field. A scorched human hand protrudes 
           from the sand, still holding part of a steering wheel. 

           The “MOUND” is a male camel, bellowing painfully, back leg 
           sheared off by a nearby blackened projectile.

           Tracker raises his HANDGUN -- beat -- and SHOOTS THE CAMEL. 

           Ends its misery. Disturbs a thousand flies. The Tracker then 
           sees what he came for: a small boy slumped in the sand. This 
           is NUSRAT, 8, near death, metal shard embedded in his foot. 

           The Tracker lifts the boy. Reclaims him from the desert.

           EXT. SAHARAWI REFUGEE CAMP - WESTERN SAHARA - NIGHT - LATER

           The camp is vast. AMPUTEE CHILDREN play soccer on crutches. 
           Veiled women, bake bread in the sand near a 

           MEDICAL CLINIC

           A sign reads “No Guns Beyond Here” in several languages.
           The Tracker, Nusrat in his arms, heads to the door. SAHARAWI 
           NURSES, veiled, ferret Nusrat quickly inside. 

           OUTDOOR “SHOWER” - MEDICAL COMPOUND - LATER

           The Tracker unwraps himself. Fabric drops.

           Feet step into a bucket. The Tracker, nude, dumps a second 
           bucket of water over him, catching the water in the bucket at 
           his feet. Water is more prized than gold in the Sahara.

           He repeats this process, washing with the same dismal water. 

           Slowly, we realize, the Tracker is tan, fit, and...

           AMERICAN. 

           Meet DR. EVAN CRAVE, ageless. He fights the good fight saving 
           his patients, but wishes he could do more. 

           CLOSE ON: SCALPEL

           As it presses into the leg of Nusrat. His foot is swollen 
           with gangrene. He WINCES when the scalpel prods his shin.

           We are in...

           INT. CLINIC - SAHARAWI REFUGE CAMP - NIGHT

           CRAVE, now in scrubs, with his HANDGUN slung in a shoulder 
           strap, bends so he is on Nusrat’s level. Speaks Spanish, the 
           Saharawi’s second language.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        You can keep the leg, but the drone 
                        has claimed your foot. 

           Nusrat cries. Nusrat’s MOTHER, shrouded, prays in Arabic. His 
           younger siblings sit under Nusrat’s hospital bed.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re scared but a month 
                        from now, this will be a memory. 

                                 NUSRAT (SPANISH)
                        I don’t want to die. 

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        I won’t let you.

           Crave reveals a car made out of a COCA-COLA CAN. 
                                 CRAVE (SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        For tomorrow.

                                 NUSRAT (SPANISH)
                        Tomorrow?

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        We have races every day after 
                        lunch. Maybe you’ll beat your 
                        brother.

           Crave motions to nurses. They move Nusrat to a stretcher. 
           Nusrat’s Mother tugs on Crave.

                                 NUSRAT’S MOTHER (SPANISH)
                        I warned him about the drones. 

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        It wasn’t his fault. He was far 
                        from the road. 

                                 NUSRAT’S MOTHER (SPANISH)
                        Not far enough. 

           LATER

           Nusrat sleeps. His amputated stump, wrapped. Near him is 
           HUSSEIN, 69, legless in an old wheelchair, who helps CRAVE 
           make more Coca-Cola cars as they keep vigil. 

           A frustrated Crave pushes too hard, accidently crushing the 
           can he’s transforming into a toy car. THWACK! He throws it 
           against the wall. It lands near other crushed cans.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        The drones. That pilot has no idea 
                        what he’s done.

           JOYSTICK ONE has hacked into the Reaper’s surveillance feed. 
           Records it to a DVD. ON SCREEN: The Sahara.

           REAPERS taxi on shimmering runways. These steel dragonflies

           AN MQ-9 PILOT, “KENO,” 28, mans a console below screens 
           showing the Sahara. At his fingers: Keyboards, joystick. By 
           his side sits his SENSOR OPERATOR, toggling controls to the 
           drone’s GORGON EYE (hi-tech surveillance cameras).

                        What field?

           Vast seas of sand sleep under stars. A remote airstrip 
           appears amid the dune fields. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: THE SAHARA, MOROCCO

           The Reaper lands. Wheels touch sand.

                        Rover me to ground link.

                        Ground link nonresponsive. Just 
                        head in.

           A gate opens to a small camouflaged airfield. The drone 
           enters. A Caucasian FIGURE in a Baltimore Ravens cap 
           (FIGURE/RAVENS CAP) emerges from a sand hide. He follows the 
           drone through. Stealth.

           AT AIRSTRIP

           The drone passes other UAVs. Its Gorgon Eye searches for 
           FIGURE/RAVENS CAP. Finds him at a DRONE. His face hidden. 

           AT FIGURE/RAVENS CAP

           He opens the drone’s nose. Reveals controls and a folded 
           American flag. Affixes a DEVICE. Moves to the next one.

                        Mission command, you got an 
                        unidentified individual inside a 
                        clandestine airfield.

           The sound of GUNFIRE. THREE CAMO NAVY SEALS enter and open 
           fire from behind UAVs. BLAM! FIGURE/RAVENS CAP returns fire. 
           Keno’s eyes snare his screen. The gunfight unfolds.

                        Situation hostile. Unknown ground

           One SEAL FALLS DEAD in clear view of Keno’s Reaper. 

           Keno sees FALLEN SOLDIER on his screen: Eyes open. Dead.

                        an eye in the sky. 

           But it’s too late. The fire fight’s already over. The other 
           TWO SEALS have fallen in the background. Presumed dead.

           FIGURE/RAVENS CAP cuts a hole in a fence. Escapes. GONE. 

           Moments later: The night ERUPTS as 20 DRONES EXPLODE. Giant 
           flame plumes FLARE UP and burn the stars. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           CLOSE ON: FIGURE/RAVENS CAP displayed on a screen.

           CIA AGENTS exchange loud greetings, cluster in groups. But 
           the room instantly STILLS when Tolliver enters. Agents grab 
           seats as he strides to the front where he changes the image 
           from FIGURE/RAVENS CAP to the FALLEN SOLDIER in the sand.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        For this American serviceman, 
                        yesterday started out as any other. 
                        He got up. Ate his Raisin Bran. 
                        Went to work. Only for him, it was 
                        the last time. In the next 12 
                        hours, days, weeks, as we work this 
                        case together, don’t forget that.

           Tolliver flips through the surveillance footage.
                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        This is what we know. At 2100 hours 
                        an MQ-9 Reaper was conducting a 
                        surveillance mission when they 
                        experienced a shadow. They landed 
                        at our Moroccan airfield. But our 
                        Reapers are not in Morocco. By our 
                        records, this field was unmanned 
                        and unoccupied. 

           Tolliver hands a file to an agent we will know as HASKINS, 
           28, smart and hungry.

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Haskins, find out who was squatting 
                        on CTC real estate. Somebody was 
                        running a black op that lost three 
                        men and $300 million in toys, let’s 
                        find out who. 

           Tolliver flips to an image of FIGURE/RAVENS CAP. Face unseen.

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        As for our “Raven,” he’ll look like 
                        a civilian. Hiding in plain sight. 
                        Peace Corps, United Nations or some 
                        leftist NGO is what he’ll be using 
                        for cover. That’s the theory. So 
                        get me a list of names that fit the 
                        profile and get Cybercommand to run 
                        an algo on suspicious travel, cross 
                        check. 
                             (beat)
                        He couldn’t have done this alone. 
                        Let’s find out who he’s working 
                        with and what’s coming next.

           The room instantly bustles in a FLURRY OF ACTIVITY as agents 
           get to work. Desk-bound heroes on the charge. 

           EXT. SAHARAWI REFUGEE CAMP - AFTERNOON - LATER 

           The camp buzzes with activity. Veiled women, amputee young 
           men and children put every bucket, pot, cup out in the sand. 

           AT MEDICAL CLINIC

           Crave wheels Nusrat, recovering, into the courtyard where 
           other patients wait. Each carries a pot or bucket. All their 
           bandages are wrapped in repurposed plastic bags.

           They all stare skyward. Sweat dripping down their faces. 
           Waiting. Hoping. 

           And there it is: The first few RAIN DROPS of the season 
           speckle the sand. Kids thrust out their tongues. Exuberant.
           Finally: A torrent of rain soaks the camp. The Saharawis 
           stand in the rain and praise Allah, indigo dye leaking from 
           their veils.

           AT MEDICAL CLINIC

           Nusrat and the other patients laugh in the rain as it fills 
           buckets. Nurses look on, making sure bandages stay dry. 

           BEHIND MEDICAL COMPOUND

           Crave, lies in the wet sand, giving himself up to the rain. 
           He has freed his camel, which enjoys a puddle. Heaven. 

           INT. CLINIC - NIGHT - LATER

           The rain stopped. Patients are now dry and sleeping in bed. 
           Wet clothes hang on an indoor clothes line. 

           Crave mops up water when Hussein, in his old wheelchair, 
           enters in a panic.

                                 HUSSEIN (SPANISH)
                        There is a car with no headlights! 

           Crave exits. Unholsters his gun. Chambers a round. 

           EXT. CLINIC - NIGHT

           A Land Rover parks. A FIGURE exits the car and heads to the

           FRONT ENTRANCE

           THE FIGURE steps in and WHAM! finds himself on the ground in 
           a CHOKE HOLD with a gun to his head and CRAVE on top of him. 

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Who are you?

                                 FIGURE (SPANISH)
                        U.N.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Then you know not to approach camp 
                        after curfew. 

                                 FIGURE
                        I speak English. I have a message 
                        from your mother. 

                                 CRAVE
                        She’s dead. 
                                 FIGURE
                        From someone named Anne. She said 
                        your father had a stroke. He’s at 
                        Walter Reed ICU in D.C. Right 
                        brain. Left side.

           Crave eases up. The figure is AHMED, 26, in hospital scrubs. 

                                 CRAVE
                        No headlights?

                                 AHMED
                        I did not want to wake the camp. 

           Crave holsters his gun. 

                                 AHMED (CONT’D)
                        She is worried. Your father’s heart 
                        condition. She said if you have 
                        plans to bury the hatchet, you 
                        might want to do so before she 
                        buries him.

           Stroke. Crave buttons up his emotions. Enters the clinic. 
           Ahmed follows.

                                 CRAVE
                        Sorry for the greeting, but it’s 
                        necessary. We’ve been raided twice. 

                                 AHMED
                        We emailed and called and...

                                 CRAVE
                        No service out here. 

                                 AHMED
                        I am Ahmed. Your replacement. You 
                        have been given two weeks off.

           Crave picks up his mop. Continues. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m not leaving. You missed the 
                        rain. But if you need a shower, 
                        don’t worry, there’s plenty of 
                        water. 

           CLOSE ON: 

           REAPER SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: FIGURE/RAVENS CAP at a drone. 
           His face hidden...
           INT. HIGH DESERT CAVE - SOMEWHERE - SOMETIME

           ...As it’s watched on a portable DVD player by IBRAHIM “NADR” 
           SHAH, 50, a man who lives by the law of the desert. He clips 
           the wings of a partridge as he watches the DVD. The room is 
           full of birds in domed wicker cages. 

           ALI, 30, Islamic militant, stands nearby. They speak Arabic.

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        He destroyed all 20. 

           Nadr stares at burnt skeletons of 20 DRONES on screen.

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        How did we get this? 

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        We hacked surveillance feeds. He 
                        killed at least one. If you look 
                        here, maybe these two, as well.

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        Which friend is this?

           Ali returns to the footage of the FIGURE/RAVENS CAP.

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        The American doctor.
                             (English)
                        He goes by Scalpel. 

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        I need his name.

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        We are working to determine his 
                        identity and location. I do not 
                        have an account name, but I have 
                        wire instructions.

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        Then send him our appreciation. 

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        It’s not what we asked. 

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        I will ask him again. This time 
                        personally. Bring him to me. 

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        Here? 

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        It is the cost of doing business, 
                        but I will not pay as much as him.
                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        But uncle, you trust a man who 
                        betrays his country?

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        Trust I do without and that does me 
                        well. You have five days. Find him 
                        and we have our home run. 

           EXT. SAHARAWI REFUGEE CAMP - EARLY MORNING

           Crave (wearing a RAVENS CAP) helps AMPUTEE BOYS milk a camel. 
           It’s athletic work. Legless Hussein, in wheelchair, watches. 

           Crave finally gets the camel to kneel. Feels Hussein’s stare. 

                                 HUSSEIN (SPANISH SAYING)
                        A father is a father.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Not mine. He’s hardcore Navy. Means 
                        he’s not a modern man. Sees the 
                        world as us versus them. Sees me on 
                        the wrong side.

                                 HUSSEIN (SPANISH)
                        He’s not expecting you to save him. 

           Crave won’t own up to the truth Hussein just exposed.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        It’s simply a bad time to go. 
                        Anywhere. 

                                 HUSSEIN (SPANISH)
                        It is true, for us, you are the 
                        last Coca-Cola in the desert. But a 
                        man who dies without his son, dies 
                        miserably. Go to your father.

           Crave sits on the ground. Exhausted. Considering.

           INT. CRAVE’S SMALL QUARTERS - LATER

           Spartan except for 100 crayon pictures that paper the wall, 
           from his young patients. The beginnings of Coca-Cola cars.

           Crave opens a drawer. Flips through photos. Finds one of him 
           and his FATHER. Tucks it into his passport. Grabs his bag.

           EXT. MEDICAL CLINIC - LATER

           Crave schleps a carry-on to the Land Rover. Finds Nusrat, 
           Hussein and many children waiting to see him off. 
           Nusrat hands him a woven bracelet made of old plastic strips. 

                                 NUSRAT (SPANISH)
                        It is the colors of our flag.  

           Crave wears the bracelet. Touched. Messes Nusrat’s hair.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Be good, if you listen to your 
                        nurses, then maybe I’ll return with 
                        soccer balls and a new net. 

           The kids cheer as he enters the car. Some hold Coca-Cola can 
           cars and wave. Crave realizes how much he loves this place. 

           EXT. SANDY ROAD - TINDOUF - AFTERNOON

           More an outpost than airport. Two sand strips stand in as 
           tarmac. Small planes cluster by a building. Nomads sell water 
           from brass cups. 

           The Land Rover drives as a small plane ALMOST LANDS ON TOP OF 
           IT. Road, sand, sky, all seems to blend here. 

           INT. TINDOUF AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

           A UNIFORMED OFFICER checks Crave’s U.S. passport. Reads his 
           name: EVAN CRAVE. He types the PASSPORT NUMBER in a terminal. 

           AN UNSEEN SURVEILLANCE CAMERA snaps a photo of Crave. 

                                 UNIFORMED OFFICER (SPANISH)
                        The plane is late. 

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        How late?

                                 UNIFORMED OFFICER (SPANISH)
                        We will know when it arrives.

           Crave takes a seat near locals. Tries his cell. No service. 

           INT. OFFICE - LANGLEY - DAY - SOON AFTER

           CLOSE ON: FIGURE/RAVENS CAP displayed on a screen.

           CIA work an elaborate EVIDENCE GRID. Tolliver studies 
           FIGURE/RAVENS CAP when HASKINS approaches with folders.

                        his name is Evan Crave. 

           Haskins hands him surveillance photos of Crave at Tindouf 
           airport and FIGURE/RAVENS CAP. Bold letters: “73% match.”

                                 HASKINS (CONT’D)
                        He’s a doctor at the Saharawi 
                        Refugee Camp. He’s done stints in 
                        Uganda, Somalia, Mozambique and 
                        Ethiopia. Worked for various NGOs. 
                        He’s now contracting with the U.N. 
                        Fits the profile.

                        We have a name and a 73 percent 
                        chance this is the guy, but DOJ 
                        needs more to pull the trigger.

           Haskins hands him a folder like it’s the coup d'état.

                                 HASKINS
                        Compliments of the encryption gang.

           Tolliver flips through the papers. Reads. It’s in Arabic.

                                 HASKINS (CONT’D)
                        Bank of Oman made a transfer 
                        through Lithuanian back channels to 
                        Crave’s personal account in London. 

           Haskins points to a number and date. 

                                 HASKINS (CONT’D)
                        This is equivalent of $2 million 
                        U.S., transfer date is twenty-four 
                        hours after the attack.

           Tolliver RUSHES toward the evidence grid. Haskins follows.

                        Where’s Crave now?

           Haskins picks up to the nearest phone. Goes on speaker.

                        connected him to Nadr Shah.  

           Tolliver remotes a screen. Several photos of NADR SHAH 
           appear. One of them reads: HIGH VALUE INDIVIDUAL (HVI). 
           Tolliver motions to officers in the back.

           Tolliver flips through more photos: Car bombs at schools. 
           Corpses. It’s a collage of carnage.

                        Nadr Shah is hellbent on destroying

                        repeating the phrase “home run.” 
                        Evan Crave is the break we are 
                        looking for.

           Tolliver looks at his men. 

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        He is to be made to cooperate. 

           CLOSE ON EVIDENCE GRID: FIGURE/RAVENS CAP.
           INT. CUSTOMS - MADRID INTL. AIRPORT (MAD) - DAY 

           Crave walks into culture shock: Lines. Luggage. He hands over 
           his passport. The official SCANS it. Reads his screen. Hits a 
           PANIC BUZZER under his desk. Casually. 

           Suddenly: SOLDIERS with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS ring Crave.

                                 CRAVE
                        Is there a problem? 

           SOLDIER ONE SLAMS him to the ground. SOLDIER TWO restrains 
           Crave. DRAGS him down a hallway. 

           INT. SECURITY CENTER - MAD - SAME TIME

           SECURITY ONE holds a dossier with Crave’s pic and name. He 
           matches it to Crave’s passport. SECURITY TWO mans a phone and 
           watches SURVEILLANCE SCREENS depicting airport HALLWAYS.

                                 SECURITY TWO (INTO PHONE, SPANISH)
                        We’re in possession of Evan Crave. 

           INT. CELL - MAD - DAY

           The soldiers drag Crave to a sterile, cramped cell. Soldier 
           One shoves Crave in and SLAMS him into a wall as Soldier Two 
           confines him to a chair in TRANSPORT CONSTRAINTS (WRIST/ANKLE 
           CUFFS joined by a chain). 

                                 CRAVE
                        I demand to speak with the U.S. 
                        embassy. 

           Soldiers One SUCKER PUNCHES Crave and they exit.

           LATER

           Crave’s foot taps. Enter JOSE GARCIA, 40s, accent, Euro suit. 
           He carries Crave’s flight carry-on and a folder.

                                 GARCIA
                        This is the manifest from today’s 
                        flight. Find your name.

           Crave scans it. Sees “Evan Crave” and “No show.” 

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        You never arrived in Madrid. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’d like to speak with a 
                        representative from my embassy. 
                                 GARCIA
                        But you’re not here.  

                                 CRAVE
                        Wherever I am, I’m always a U.S. 
                        citizen. I request counsel from the 
                        U.S. embassy, which is my right per 
                        the treaty between our countries. 

           Garcia flips out his diplomatic passport. 

                                 GARCIA
                        I am Jose Garcia of the U.S. 
                        Embassy in Madrid. I am your 
                        counsel. 

           Garcia fans 8x10s. The remains of 20 DRONES litter the sand.

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        MQ-9 Reapers. The reason the United 
                        States hasn’t suffered a 
                        catastrophic terrorist attack in 
                        years. Yet you destroyed twenty of 
                        them, killing at least three 
                        soldiers in the process. 

           Garcia shows him the surveillance image of FALLEN SOLDIER.

                                 CRAVE
                        No. Absolutely not. You’ve got the 
                        wrong man. I’m a doctor. I don’t 
                        kill people. I try to save them. 

                                 GARCIA
                        But you carry a gun.

                                 CRAVE
                        To protect my clinic. I work at the 
                        Saharawi Refugee Camp...

                                 GARCIA
                        Morocco considers the Saharawi 
                        people terrorists. 

                                 CRAVE
                        They’re refugees.

                                 GARCIA
                        Who are often victims of drone 
                        attacks, no?

           Crave’s eyes flicker with anger. That hit a nerve. Garcia 
           sits on the edge of the table. Tries a new approach.

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never seen the aftermath of a 
                        drone attack. I wouldn’t care to. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        But you don’t have that choice. You 
                        face the war against terror on the 
                        civilian level. The casualty level. 
                        I can’t imagine the horror. I bet 
                        you’d do anything to make it stop. 

           Crave connects the dots. Sees where this is going. 

                                 CRAVE
                        It’s true. I’ve been very vocal 
                        concerning my feelings about drones 
                        and the civilian casualties. 
                        But I wouldn’t do something like 
                        this. And I can prove it. I’ve been 
                        at the camp for months. I’ve never 
                        left.

                                 GARCIA
                        Except three days ago when you  
                        took a quick day-in-day-out trip to 
                        Tangiers. 

           Garcia shows him a flight manifest. Crave can’t fathom how 
           his name is staring back at him on the page.

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        And last month, Tehran, Madrid, 
                        Uzbekistan and Beirut. 

                                 CRAVE
                        That’s just not true. Check my 
                        passport. 

                                 GARCIA
                        American or Moroccan? 

                                 CRAVE
                        I don’t have a Moroccan passport. 

           Garcia shows him a copy of his Moroccan passport. With his 
           photo. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        That’s not mine. 

           Garcia reveals surveillance pics of FIGURE/RAVENS CAP. 

                                 GARCIA
                        You hit every surveillance camera 
                        at the airfield but this one.

                                 CRAVE
                        No. That’s not me. 

           Garcia SLAMS CRAVE’S HEAD into the table!
           He gives Crave a moment to recover and then opens Crave’s 
           carry-on. Pulls out a Ravens baseball cap. Similar to the one 
           in the photo. 

           Crave, nose spotted in blood, eyes the ballcap. He’s in 
           trouble. Deep. Deep trouble. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Listen. I’ve been set up! 

                                 GARCIA
                        No, you’ve been paid for services 
                        rendered. Two million dollars sent 
                        to your HSBC account. 

                                 CRAVE
                        The one in London? I closed it. 

           Garcia pulls out a bank statement featuring Crave’s name and 
           a WHOPPING deposit.

                                 GARCIA
                        We traced it to Cygnus Imports. A 
                        shell company linked to Nadr Shah. 
                        Tell me, why does a terrorist owe 
                        you money? 

                                 CRAVE
                        How many ways do I have to say 
                        this? There’s been. A. Mistake. 
                        Someone is framing me! 

                                 GARCIA
                        Are you saying you’re a victim?

                                 CRAVE
                        Yes. 

                                 GARCIA
                        You don't sound like one.  

           Garcia takes out a digital pocket recorder. Presses play. 
           Crave is arrested by SCREAMS OF HORROR. That’s children.

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        This was recorded by a police 
                        scanner at the Hertfordshire School 
                        in central London moments after a 
                        car bomb exploded during recess.  

           The sound of HYSTERICAL CRYING. Teachers in a panic.

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        Many members of the UK Parliament 
                        send their children there. They 
                        were voting on the UK drone program 
                        the next day. It was postponed.
           SIRENS now wail over the screams and crying. 

                                 GARCIA (CONT’D)
                        Six kids died. Thirty were injured. 
                        This is work of the man who just 
                        sent you a wire for $2 million. 
                        This is what victims sound like. 

           Garcia turns off the digital recorder. Crave scans the 
           evidence before him. Reads it like a disease. 

                                 CRAVE
                        OK. I’ll tell you what I know. But 
                        I need you to listen.

           Garcia cues his digital recorder. Presses play. 

                                 GARCIA
                        What do you know? 

                                 CRAVE
                        I know I’ve been set up. Think 
                        about it. I oppose the drone 
                        program. I’m a physician off the 
                        grid in a region devastated by it. 
                        I must fit a unique profile. I 
                        don’t know why I was set up. But I 
                        know who you can ask. That guy. 
                        That guy under the baseball cap.
                             (beat)
                        He knows why.

           Garcia flips off his recorder. Exhales.

                                 GARCIA
                        The next person you talk to doesn’t 
                        speak. He uses his hands. Fists. 
                        Razors. It would have been better 
                        to work with me. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Liliana Medina. She’s here, with 
                        the U.N., in Madrid. Ask her about 
                        me. And then ask yourself, do you 
                        really have the right man?  

           Garcia realizes he’s at a dead end.

                                 GARCIA
                        I don’t have anybody. Because 
                        you’re headed to Slovakia and we 
                        never met. 

           Garcia leaves. Crave sits back. Devastated.

           His world upside down, the crushing unreality of the 
           situation takes over. Panic grips Crave.
           INT. CELL - MAD - LATER

           Crave sits, chained, head hung low. The door opens abruptly. 
           SOLDIER THREE enters. Crave’s chin shoots up. Soldier carries 
           two items feared by terror suspects: DUCT TAPE. BLACK HOOD. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Somebody set me up. My father is in 
                        the hospital. I need to call him. 
                        Please help me.

           Soldier Three slips an EAR PIECE in HIS EAR.  

                                 SOLDIER THREE
                        For travel.

           Soldier Three DUCT TAPES his mouth. Crave resists. But is 
           overcome. Soldier Three HOODS HIM and EXITS. 

           Hooded Crave takes panic breaths in the darkness.

           He REACHES for the hood when SNAP! The CHAIN connecting the 
           ankle and wrist cuffs stops him short. 

           He can’t raise his hands above his chest. 

           INT. IBERIA AIRLINES TERMINAL - MAD - LATER

           SEXY LEGS of FLIGHT ATTENDANTS as they roll their carry-ons 
           behind pilots. Soldiers pass in the opposite direction.  

           One of them is SOLDIER THREE. He palms an ACCESS CARD to the 
           owner of the sexiest legs of the bunch. Both keep walking. 

           INT. SECURITY CENTER - LATER

           The screen is now FLECKED with BLOOD. Security Guards lie 
           dead at the feet of the Iberia Flight Attendant, who SCANS A 
           MATRIX OF SCREENS displaying the vast airport’s innards.

           Meet ELLE, 28, European stunner with an accent. Lethal. She 
           speaks into a HEADSET to the figure on main screen:

           HOODED CRAVE. 

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET)
                        Evan. What have you done?

           Elle strips out of her Iberia Airlines uniform. 

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        I told you not to go back to the 
                        desert. Will you listen to me now? 

           IN CRAVE’S CELL
           Hooded Crave reacts to the WILLOWY VOICE in his ear. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The soldier gave you an earpiece so 
                        you can hear me. He couldn’t fix 
                        your constraints without 
                        compromising himself. I’ll guide 
                        you out. You need to trust me.

           He hears the SOUND of a door clicking open. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The door is now open. Go!

           Crave doesn’t move.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t, they will make you 
                        disappear. Go! Let me save you. 

           ...Crave, in hooded darkness, shuffles into a

           HALLWAY 

           Crave stops. Exposed. Chained at wrists and ankles. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Run. 

           He runs blind. Right into a WALL.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Too far. There’s a door to the 
                        right. It’s unlocked. 

           He scrapes right. Feels with cuffed hands. Opens the door.

           INT. AIR CARGO AREA

           Crave enters a poorly-lit concrete space, the airport 
           warehouse few travelers ever see. A FAR DOOR SLAMS OPEN. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.)
                        Don’t move!

           Crave edges against a wall as TWO SECURITY GUARDS enter then 
           exit down a far hall. They just miss seeing him. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        OK. Go straight. Hurry.

           Crave rushes ahead when a SCREECH rips the silence. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        A door. I opened it. GO! 
           Crave runs TOWARD THE SOUND through the roll-up DOORS.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t run!

           Too late! Crave hits a plastic wall and FALLS ONTO --

           INT. BAGGAGE PROCESSING

           Crave LANDS on a CONVEYER BELT. A MAZE of sorting ramps and 
           belts stretches before him. But he can’t see a damn thing!

                                 ELLE (O.S.)
                        Hold tight.

           An ALARM rings. The belt LURCHES like a roller-coaster.   
           BAM! CRAVE HITS HIS HEAD on a low ramp. Falls into LUGGAGE. 
           Crouches as he ZAGS through this chutes-and-ladders maze. 

           BACK IN SECURITY CENTER

           Elle, eyes locked on screen displaying Crave, is almost out 
           of her attendant uniform when --

           THE DOOR OPENS!

           SECURITY FOUR carries coffee. He sees his DEAD COLLEAGUES. 
           Elle instantly SIDEKICKS him and chokes him out with a JUDO 
           GRIP. He counters and FLIPS her into the SECURITY SCREENS.

           AT CRAVE - BAGGAGE PROCESSING

           He hears the fight. Holds on for dear life but has no idea 
           he’s 20 feet above the concrete floor. 

           Then he hears the PZZZT of a GUNSHOT (silencer).

           BACK IN SECURITY CENTER

           Elle stands over SECURITY FOUR. Bullet in his brain.

           Elle notices:

           ALL SCREENS ARE NOW BLANK.

           Elle briskly types into the security keyboard.

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        Where are you? 

           INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - MAD - CONTINUOUS

           SECURITY patrol. TRAVELERS watch luggage slide down ramps. 
           BACK ON CONVEYOR MAZE: 

           Crave heads for a RAMP. Hears TRAVELER’S VOICES up ahead. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.)
                        You were supposed to jump before 
                        baggage claim! 

           Crave TIPS to the baggage claim curtains. At the last second, 
           before he slides into public detection, he JUMPS! 

           FREE-FALLS and SLAMS to the unseen floor 15 feet below. LANDS 
           HARD.

           INT. CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Garcia enters with ARMED CONTRACTORS. Crave is gone.

                                 GARCIA (SPANISH)
                        Fuck!

           He stares up at a surveillance CAMERA. Runs out the door.

           INT. SECURITY CENTER

           The screens are still blank. Elle resets them. Hears an 
           ALARM. 

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET)
                        If you’re still with me, find the 
                        door. NOW!

           AT CRAVE

           He stands. Hurt. Slower now. He steps right, into a WALL. 
           Adjusts. Finds a DOOR. Enters the 

           AIR CARGO AREA

           Crave stands above grated stairs. The door SLAMS behind him. 
           He tries to open it. But there’s no handle. His only choice 
           is to move forward. Below him: PARKED FIATS. 

           Crave inches down the stairs to the bottom. Bumps into a car.

           BACK IN SECURITY CENTER

           Elle finally boots the screens to life. Sees Crave.

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        Pute! Not there. You’re in the 
                        wrong place.  

           ALARM still blaring. Game over.
           Then she notices the FIATS. Looks to a nearby screen 
           displaying a cargo area with stacked crates and ULDs.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN CRAVE AND ELLE

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Get in the car. 

           A car? Are you serious? 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now. We’re running out of time! 

           Crave fumbles with the handle. Slides in the driver’s seat. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Find the push button.  

           Crave gropes the dash. Finds the button. The Fiat STARTS.

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        I need you to turn the car around. 
                        But you must do exactly what I say. 
                        Put it in drive. 

           Crave GRINDS the gears in his restraints. Finds drive.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Turn right.

           Crave turns the wheel with cuffed hands and blind.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Give it gas. Slow.

           The Fiat BUMPS but then pulls from the others.

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        Stop. Put it in reverse.

           Crave stops. GRINDS GEARS again. Finds reverse.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Pull the parking brake. 

           Crave pulls it.  

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Pour on the gas. 

           Crave gives it more gas. TIRES SMOKE.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Release the brake. NOW!

           Crave breathes. Then does it.
           The FIAT SHOOTS BACKWARD.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        TURN RIGHT. AND BRAKE!

           Crave WHIPS it. YANKS the brake. The Fiat SLIDES into a 
           SWEEPING REVERSE 180 in the tight space, barely missing the 
           other cars. The Fiat now faces a WALL. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        DRIVE. GAS!

           Crave SLAMS it into drive -- 

           THE FIAT RAMS THROUGH THE WALL. Airbags deploy. The Fiat 
           stops. Crave exhales like a man with a broken rib. He is in:

           A CAVERNOUS AIR CARGO AREA

           It’s lined with Unit Load Devices (ULDs) on pallets. 

                                 ELLE (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        You’re there. Get out.

           Dazed. Crave exits. Stumbles down aisles of ULDs.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Find the open container. 

           Crave shoulders against containers. They all feel closed. 
           Then he hears the faint voices of SOLDIERS closing in.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Try the other side. 

           Crave walks across the aisle. Finds the OPEN ULD. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the trick. The lever is on 
                        the outside. Once you press it, you 
                        must get inside before it shuts. 

           Crave searches for the lever. Accidently triggers it but 
           DIVES INSIDE BEFORE IT BITES HIM IN HALF. 

           The container shuts, door embossed with an EMBASSY SEAL. 
           Large letters read “DIPLOMATIC BAG” in several languages.

                                 ELLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Not a sound. I’m coming for you. 

           Another alarm BLARES from a distant terminal. 
           INT. SECURITY CENTER - MAD - NIGHT

           Garcia and company burst in. See security bodies, broken 
           screens. No Elle. Garcia KICKS a monitor at his feet. It 
           flickers. Shows the Fiat in Air Cargo. 

           EXT. CARGO EXIT - MAD - NIGHT

           An EMBASSY AIDE drives a ULD on a minitruck to a guarded 
           exit. He flashes embassy credentials at an ARMED GUARD when 
           GARCIA and SECURITY cut it off. 

                                 GARCIA (SPANISH)
                        Open it up. 

                                 EMBASSY AIDE (SPANISH)
                        This is property of the French 
                        Embassy in Madrid and --

                                 GARCIA (SPANISH)
                        Open it...or send it back! 

           Embassy Aide exits the truck. Flips the lever on the ULD. 

           REVEALS ONLY

           A small designer DOG in a small designer case with his name, 
           “HOMER,” engraved on it. The dog barks like little dogs do.

           ON GARCIA’S FACE: ANGER. HE’S BEEN HAD.

           INT. TOLLIVER’S OFFICE - LANGLEY - HIS DAY 

           Tolliver SLAMS the phone down. Looks at Haskins. 

                                 TOLLIVER 
                        Evan Crave is at large and a threat 
                        to National Security. I want him on 
                        the kill list. Who do we use in 
                        Madrid?

           An AGENT walks to a white board full of Middle Eastern names. 
           Writes “Evan Crave” near the top. 

                                 AGENT ONE
                        Recces. We used them last month. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        Get ‘em on the line. And somebody 
                        get the security feeds from the 
                        airport. Find me every diplomatic 
                        bag that left MAD. He left a trail, 
                        let’s pick it up.
           EXT. AUTOVIA 44 - LA MANCHA - SPAIN - NIGHT

           A different embassy truck drives through the countryside. 
           Elle is behind the wheel. 

           INSIDE ULD 

           Crave lies fetal. Bracing in darkness. Hooded and ALONE.

                                                                 BLACK.

           INT. LA MANCHA WINERY - NIGHT

           The embassy truck hides in a warehouse. Wine barrels and 
           casks fill this rustic space. Elle opens the “Diplomatic 
           Bag”/ULD. Sees Hooded Crave. 

                                 ELLE 
                        My love, your hands. 

           Elle uses bolt cutters to free him. First the wrist cuffs. 
           Then the ankles. Crave rubs his wrists. 

           She lifts his hood. He’s bloody. Elle sees Crave for the 
           first time. As he does with her. He’s grateful. When

           BAM!

           Like a covert operative, Elle takes Crave down in three 
           moves. Crave is too slow to retaliate. Too disoriented.

           Crave finds himself on the ground with Elle atop him. Her  
           GUN in the back of his neck. 

           Elle RIPS OFF his mouth tape. 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Who are you? 

                                 CRAVE
                        Evan Crave. 

                                 ELLE
                        What is your real name?

                                 CRAVE
                        That is my real name. 

                                 ELLE
                        Where’s Evan?

           Crave pushes himself up, flips and PINS Elle. He KNOCKS her 
           gun out of reach. Elle counters with a vicious MMA chokehold. 
           Crave grabs her hands to pry free.

                                 CRAVE
                        I am Evan.
           Crave breaks free. Dives for the gun. But Elle pulls him back 
           and LOCKS HER LEGS around his KNEES. She bends him like a bow 
           with a shoulder lock. They’re entwined like bitter lovers.

           CRAVE IS COMPLETELY CONTAINED. IN HER GRIP.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m a doctor at the Saharawi 
                        Refugee Camp. I left because my 
                        father is in the hospital. 

           Crave STRAINS. Eyes on gun. Turning red.

                                 ELLE
                        Evan doesn’t speak with his father. 
                        Not since his mother died. 

           Crave HEADBUTTS her. Escapes. But she’s instantly on him 
           again with an EZEKIEL CHOKE. Forearm to neck. Eye to eye. 
           They’re close enough to kiss. Hair in her face.

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m Evan Crave. 

                                 ELLE
                        What is April 10th? 

                                 CRAVE
                        The day I was supposed to get 
                        married. 

           Crave counters the choke. Opens her legs. Folds her over. 
           ARMBARS the shit out of her. 

                                 ELLE
                        Liliana?

                        My childhood dog.

           Crave RELEASES to GRAB for the gun. Fool.

           Elle buries her head into Crave. TAKEDOWN. Crave gasps. Elle 
           begins “ground and pound” as Crave protects his head. 

                                 ELLE
                        You stole his identity. 

           Elle pauses, trying to control her anger. Crave gets it.
                                 CRAVE
                        He stole mine. That’s it. That’s 
                        what happened! 

           Crave finally understands.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        He stole MY IDENTITY.

           Elle DIVES for the GUN. Holds it on him. She stares down the 
           sight, finger tense over the trigger. Crave, still wracked by 
           the revelation, doesn't break her stare. Hands up, defensive. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Whoever he is. He lied to you. But 
                        I'm telling you the truth. I. Am. 
                        Evan Crave. The man you know by 
                        that name. Stole. My. Identity. I 
                        need to find out why. 

           Elle studies him. Hair trigger under her index. When

           SUDDENLY WINE BOTTLES ERUPT. GUNFIRE RAKES THE WINERY.

           Elle dives UNDER THE TRUCK and emerges with a modified AR15. 
           BLAM! Elle blows off the warehouse door with a BEOWULF round. 

           HEADLIGHTS

           Stream in. A silhouette looms. REVEAL RECCE ONE (South 
           African Recon, pron. WRECK-ee). He holds a FULL AUTO M16. 
           Lets it RIP. More wine BOTTLES EXPLODE. 

           Crave ROLLS under the embassy truck. 

           UNDER TRUCK

           Crave panics. Breathes. Sees plastic-wrapped guns taped to 
           the axle. The undercarriage holds ELLE’S ARSENAL. He pulls a 
           HUGE GUN down. He rips open the plastic. Aims.

           RECCE TWO is in his zero. 

           Suave. In control. Crave FIRES.

           Click. Shit! Got to load it! 

           Crave pulls down plastic-wrapped ammo. Different calibers. 
           Confusing piles. Opens one. It doesn’t fit. Crave fumbles. 

           MEANWHILE

           RECCE TWO handles a machine gun. He’s only a few feet away.

                                 RECCE TWO (ACCENT)
                        Come out, Crave. We’ll let her 
                        live.
           Recce Two LIGHTS UP the truck with semiautomatic fire until 
           BLAM! A BEOWULF BLAST BLOWS him back. 

           What happens next is a blur:

           -- Elle rolls away as more BOTTLES EXPLODE. 

           -- Recce One runs out of ammo. Takes cover to reload.

           -- Elle stands. FIRES. Hits a barrel stand above him. 

                                 RECCE ONE (ACCENT)
                        Would’ve expected a bullseye from 
                        you, Ellie-girl. 

           But it was a bullseye. The STAND COLLAPSES. Releases wine 
           barrels. They TUMBLE on him like boulders.

           AT CRAVE - UNDER TRUCK

           Bullets ricochet off FERMENTATION TANKS. One whizzes by 
           Crave! He finally loads the sub-auto but FIRES WILDLY. Elle 
           watches. Crave hits nothing. 

           AT RECCE THREE AND FOUR 

           They OPEN FIRE. Elle runs. Slips on the WINE-SOAKED FLOOR. 
           She fires as she lands. RECCE THREE falls DEAD. Elle reloads. 
           Looks up as RECCE FOUR fires -- into her side. 

           SHE’S HIT.

           Elle keeps firing. Point blank CHEST SHOTS. Recce Four 
           HURTLES BACK. Elle limps to her feet when RECCE FIVE grabs 
           her by the hair. Shoves a gun in her mouth. Burns her lip.

                                 RECCE FIVE (ACCENT)
                        Like that?

           CLICK! He’s out of ammo. Elle heel-hooks him. He falls. Sees 
           BLOOD at her hip and strikes her wound. She doubles over. 

           AT CRAVE

           He sees Recce Five rain blows on Elle. Recce Five grabs her 
           hair. He DRAGS her across GLASS. 

           But holds only a wig. 

           ELLE’S

           natural hair flows as she unloads a SPRAWL-AND-BRAWL COMBO. 
           Recce Five finds himself on his back staring up at the 
           ceiling. Dazed. Then: BAM! She shoots him DEAD IN THE CHEST.

           AT CRAVE
           He sees ELLE as she is: An elite killer. 

           Elle, on empty, limps to a side exit. 

           Crave spots a BERETTA-STYLE HANDGUN under the truck. Loads 
           it. Follows Elle. Passes dead Recces. Glass. Blood. Wine.

           Gun out. Terrified. Head on a swivel. Was all this over him?

           AT SIDE EXIT

           Elle expects return fire. Finds only an idling EUROVAN. 

           EXT. LA MANCHA WINERY - NIGHT

           Elle scans the perimeter. Then heads for the van when BLAM! 
           SHE’S HIT. In the arm. The shot spins her. She falls. 

           RECCE SIX aims for her head. 

                                 RECCE SIX (ACCENT)
                        Lights out.

           AT SIDE EXIT

           Crave SHOOTS Recce Six in the knee before he can finish Elle 
           off. The Recce screams. Holds his leg. Drops his weapon. 

                                 CRAVE
                        That’s your patella.

           Crave approaches, kicks Recce Six’s gun away.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Reconstructive surgery takes two 
                        hours. Three day hospital stay. 
                        Recovery, four weeks.

           Crave aims at Recce Six’s ankle.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        If I nail your fibula, you’re 
                        looking at multiple surgeries. 
                        Walk. Yes. Run. Never. 
                             (beat)
                        Now, why are you trying to kill me?

                                 RECCE SIX (ACCENT)
                        The price on your head is five 
                        hundred thousand. 

                                 CRAVE
                        From who?

           Recce Six doesn’t answer. 
                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Give me something more than your 
                        ankle.

           Recce Six LUNGES for Crave.

           BLAM!

           Takes it in the head. DEAD RECCE. Elle holds the gun. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        He was unarmed. 

                                 ELLE
                        He would have killed you with his 
                        bare hands. South African Recon.  
                        CIA’s go-to private contractors. 

           She now aims at Crave. Crave aims at her. Standoff.

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Where is Evan? I won’t ask again.

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m Evan Crave. I can prove it. I’m 
                        a doctor and you’re bleeding. 

           Crave lowers his gun. But Elle ignores the blood. 

                                 ELLE
                        Anyone can play doctor. How do I 
                        know you didn’t buy the identity on 
                        the black market? 

           Crave is lost. Hears SIRENS. Thinks fast.

                                 CRAVE
                        Liliana. My ex-fiance. She could 
                        prove who I am. She’s in Madrid. He 
                        told you about her?

           Elle is unreadable. A total pro.

                                 ELLE
                        Drive. 

           Crave rushes to the idling Eurovan. Elle enters the back. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SPAIN - NIGHT

           The Eurovan speeds to the highway ahead.
           INT. EUROVAN - AUTOVIA 44 - SPAIN - NIGHT

           Crave drives, anxious as hell. Full of questions. Follows the 
           white lines as SIRENS soon flash by toward the winery. Elle 
           tends her side. It’s a SERIOUS WOUND. Her arm, less so. 

                                 CRAVE
                        You CIA? Are you a spy?

                                 ELLE
                             (ignoring him)
                        Do not go to her apartment. She 
                        will be watched. Her phone will be 
                        tapped. Go to her work. That’s 
                        where we might find our window. 

                                 CRAVE
                        She won’t be there.

                                 ELLE
                        She will be in the morning.

                                 CRAVE (WOUND)
                        You might not last that long.

           Elle aims the gun. 

                                 ELLE
                        And you neither. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Who do you work for? What side are 
                        you on? I need to know. 

                                 ELLE
                        Your government has sixteen 
                        different intelligence divisions. 
                        I’m an asset to some. An operative 
                        to others. 

                                 CRAVE
                        What does that mean?

                                 ELLE
                        I have access. But I do not know 
                        what the CIA wanted. I only knew 
                        that Evan Crave was in custody. I 
                        was working under protocol to 
                        extract him if he were apprehended. 
                        Why were they holding you? 

                                 CRAVE
                        They said I killed three men and 
                        destroyed twenty drones in an 
                        airfield in Morocco. I didn’t do 
                        it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CRAVE (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        Your Evan is a terrorist. 

                                 ELLE
                        No. He’s a covert operative of your 
                        government. He catches terrorists. 
                        So do I.

                                 CRAVE
                        He sets them up. Because I’m 
                        suddenly worth five hundred 
                        thousand dollars. 

                                 ELLE
                        But that would mean he set me up, 
                        too. And that, he would not do.

           Crave notices she wears an ENGAGEMENT RING. Says nothing. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Can you call him? 

                                 ELLE
                        He calls me. And I have not heard 
                        from him in weeks. 

                                 CRAVE
                        What kind of relationship is that?

                                 ELLE
                        One that works. 

                                 CRAVE
                        You understand that you’re engaged 
                        to a man and you don’t know his 
                        real name.

           Elle studies Crave.  

                                 ELLE
                        I know her. Liliana. We never met. 
                        But I followed her once. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Why?

                                 ELLE
                        I wanted to see the woman that 
                        broke his heart. 

                                 CRAVE
                        My heart. She broke my heart. I’m 
                        Evan. 

                                 ELLE
                        But I will call you Crave. 
                                 CRAVE
                        And what does he call you?

                                 ELLE
                        Elle. 

                                 CRAVE
                        But that’s not your real name? 

           Elle half-smiles. Crave eyes the speeding asphalt. His world 
           shattered.

           EXT. U.N. FIELD OFFICE - MADRID - MORNING

           A RENAULT pulls into a personal parking spot. LILIANA steps 
           out, 30, pretty tempest in an exec pantsuit.

           INT. EUROVAN - CONTINUOUS

           Crave and Elle watch Liliana walk into the office. Crave is 
           about to open his door when Elle stops him.
                                 ELLE
                        The Mercedes. Do you see it? 

           Crave scans the parking lot. Spots the Mercedes. Tinted 
           windows. Then sees GARCIA exit. He walks to Liliana. Flashes 
           his credentials as he whisks her inside the building.  

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Go to sleep. I’ll keep watch. 

           Crave gets comfortable. But there is no way he’s sleeping.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MADRID - LATER - NIGHT

           Liliana walks across the empty lot. On her cell. She enters 
           the Renault, starts it and exits to merge onto a freeway. 

           The Mercedes FOLLOWS a few cars back.

           INSIDE RENAULT - MOVING

           Liliana hangs up her cell. Plays with the radio. SCREAMS when 
           she sees CRAVE IN HER REARVIEW. 

                                 LILIANA
                        EVAN!

                                 CRAVE
                        Keep driving. 

           Elle reveals herself in the backseat. Gun visible.

                                 ELLE
                        You are being followed. Don’t turn 
                        around. Keep talking on your cell. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Do what she says. 

           Elle and Crave slip down in the seat. Liliana drives. Sees 
           the Mercedes in the mirror. Holds her cell to her ear.

                                 LILIANA
                        Evan, you killed people. I can’t 
                        help you. No, they’ll arrest me. I 
                        can’t be involved. 

                                 CRAVE
                        It wasn’t me. I was set up. 

                                 LILIANA
                        Really. Because the way you talked 
                        sometimes. You hate the drones. You 
                        always have.  
                                 CRAVE
                        Did you tell them that?

           Liliana’s look: Of course she did. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        But you said I haven’t left the 
                        camp in nine months. Right?

                                 LILIANA
                        How would I know? You don’t have 
                        service.

                                 CRAVE
                        Look at me. I’m a surgeon in the 
                        field. I get angry when people die 
                        and no one cares. But the man you 
                        knew, would he act on it? 

           Liliana is tormented by the question, but not the answer.

                                 LILIANA
                        No. No, he never would. 

           Crave looks at Elle. She puts her gun away. He is Evan Crave.

                                 ELLE
                        I believe you. 

                                 LILIANA
                        Who is she?

                                 CRAVE
                        She knows the man who stole my 
                        identity. We need to find him.

                                 LILIANA
                        Who?

                                 CRAVE
                             (remembering)
                        Dirty Harry. Liliana, did you ever 
                        talk about me with someone?

                                 LILIANA
                        My family. My friends. My 
                        coworkers. You were a part of my 
                        life for a long time.  

           Elle gets where Crave is going with this.

                                 ELLE
                        A stranger? American. Blond hair. 
                        Blue eyes. Charming. Something 
                        military about him, but you could 
                        never put your finger on it... 
                                 LILIANA
                             (thinks)
                        In Mali. There was a man like that. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Did you sleep with him?

                                 ELLE
                        Yes. Did you?

           Liliana won't even dignify that with a response.

                                 LILIANA
                        He was my patient. Dengue fever. 
                        Mild, but he spent about two weeks 
                        under my care. 

                                 ELLE
                        How do you know he had Dengue? 

                                 LILIANA
                        It was in his chart. 

                                 ELLE
                        Did you test him?

                                 LILIANA
                        You can not fake Dengue. 

           Lilian suddenly remembers. 

                                 LILIANA (CONT’D)
                        He did not have the rash. That was 
                        odd. Often it presents with a rash.

                                 CRAVE
                        When was this? 

                                 LILIANA
                        September of last year. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Do you remember his name? 

                                 LILIANA
                        Scott. He said he was with the 
                        Peace Corps. Scott Whitman. 

                                 ELLE
                        Are you in contact with him?

                                 LILIANA
                        No. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Do you have his number?
                                 LILIANA
                        He was my patient. He got well. He 
                        left. We did not become pen pals.

                                 CRAVE
                        Why did you talk about me? 

                                 LILIANA
                        You were my fiance. I was planning 
                        a wedding. We talked. All the time. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Where does he live? Where was he 
                        stationed? Where was he from?

           Liliana doesn’t know.

                                 ELLE
                        Maybe you talked. He listened. Blow 
                        the next light so we can get out. 
                        We need to go. 

           Liliana checks her rearview. Sees the Mercedes.

           When the next light flashes ORANGE, Liliana FLOORS IT. The 
           RENAULT lunges through the RED light. The Mercedes revs to 
           keep up but SQUEALS TO A STOP as CROSS TRAFFIC CUTS IT OFF. 

           AT RENAULT

           Liliana speeds. Pulls over blocks away. Elle slips out. 
           Liliana keeps her eyes on her rearview. Very nervous. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Why did you call off the wedding? 
                        You never told me. 

                                 LILIANA
                        Because I wanted to make a 
                        difference. 

                                 CRAVE
                        And I’m not? 

                                 LILIANA
                        I don’t want to save a patient. I 
                        want to save an entire people. That 
                        can not be done from North Africa. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Yes. You need an office. And a 
                        personal parking spot. 

           She finally looks at him. Her eyes betraying latent emotion. 
                                 LILIANA
                        For a moment today, I was happy for 
                        you. I thought, finally, you did 
                        something real about the bullshit.

                                 CRAVE
                        My patients are bullshit?

                                 LILIANA
                        What put them there is. But don’t 
                        worry, Evan. You’ll be back at the 
                        camp soon enough, where you can 
                        treat the symptoms while I fight to 
                        treat the disease.

                                 CRAVE
                        Doesn’t make you better than me. 
                        Just safer.

           Crave exits. Liliana peels out. Pissed. Crave doesn’t have 
           time to react. He takes cover.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Elle and Crave crouch behind a parked car as the Renault 
           merges with traffic. Liliana doesn’t look back. 

           They watch the MERCEDES pass by. Tail shaken. Elle checks the 
           street. Empty. Walks back the way they came. 

           That’s when Crave notices Elle’s blood on her shirt. It jars 
           him. She’s in trouble. Crave takes off his jacket. Offers it.  

           She puts it on. In pain but trying to hide it.

                                 CRAVE
                        You need a hospital. 

                                 ELLE
                        That’s where they will be looking.

                                 CRAVE
                        But we have his name. Scott 
                        Whitman. 

                                 ELLE
                        No, no. That’s not his name. It’s 
                        another cover. 

                                 CRAVE
                        He stole multiple identities?

                                 ELLE
                        He’ll do whatever the mission 
                        demands. 
                                 CRAVE
                        So what’s his mission?

           Elle considers this. 

                                 ELLE
                        He’s working on something big. If 
                        he stole your identity, then he 
                        needs a cover that couldn’t be 
                        blown. And if he’s risking a 
                        civilian identity, then the threat 
                        must be imminent.

                                 CRAVE
                        I need it back. It’s my life he’s 
                        taken!

                                 ELLE
                        I understand. I broke you out of 
                        CIA custody. I’m marked. He knows 
                        that. He has to clear both our 
                        names. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Or kill me?

                                 ELLE
                        I will not let him kill you. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Really? Because that’s a pretty big 
                        rock on your finger. 

           Elle seems to retreat inside for the first time.

                                 ELLE
                        The night I fell for him, was the 
                        night he told me about Uganda. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I was in Uganda.

                                 ELLE
                        Yes. You were kidnapped and 
                        tortured for three days. On the 
                        fourth, tribal leaders negotiated 
                        your release with cattle. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Cattle? Someone gave them AKs.

                                 ELLE
                        Still, the U.N. had a flight ready 
                        to take you home but you went back 
                        to the hospital, the one that sold 
                        you out, and delivered the baby of 
                        a patient. Both survived.
                                 CRAVE
                        I made her a promise.

           Elle makes sure they are not being followed. 

                                 ELLE
                        I know everything about you, even 
                        though we have never met. Keep me 
                        alive. And I promise I will keep 
                        you alive. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Then I need a hospital. But only to 
                        pick up supplies. Or you’re not 
                        going to make it.

           Elle nods. Realizes she may already be on borrowed time.

           INT. PRAYER ROOM - HIGH DESERT CAVE - TIME UNKNOWN

           Nadr is in the middle of prayers. He finishes. Rolls his 
           carpet. Leans it near his machine gun. Exits into a hall.

           Ali approaches, hands Nadr a folder. It contains the passport 
           photo of Evan Crave. Our Crave.

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        Scalpel is currently a doctor at 
                        the Saharawi Refugee Camp. His name 
                        is Evan Crave.  

           Nadr glances at the photo.

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        And where did you get this?

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        The CIA is after him. They sent our 
                        friends from South Africa. I told 
                        them I would pay double, but he is 
                        not in their custody. 

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        How do we know this isn’t a trap?

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        Hafid confirmed. This is Scalpel. 
                        They met years ago in Quarzazate. 

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        Why?

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        Scalpel provided him information on 
                        the Reaper that crashed in the 
                        Western Sahara. 
                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        The one we sold to Iran. 
                             (beat)
                        Does Hafid have any reason to lie? 
                        Are you watching his accounts?

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        He has received no payments. He has 
                        kept his routines. And he is loyal 
                        to our cause. 

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        If he is not, it is you who pays. 

                                 ALI (ARABIC)
                        Yes, uncle. We will find him.

                                 NADR (ARABIC)
                        Find him soon. We are running out 
                        of time. Doctors don’t like to be 
                        away from their patients. 

           Ali nods in understanding. Turns and exits, leaving Nadr.

           INT. VAN - PARKING - HOSPITAL - MADRID - NIGHT

           Crave and Elle sit in the van with a view of a hospital. 

                                 ELLE
                        Press may not be running our photos 
                        yet, but you can be sure all police 
                        and security have been briefed. 
                        They will be looking for you. 

                                 CRAVE
                        If there is anything I can do, it’s 
                        sneak into a hospital.

           EXT. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - HOSPITAL - MADRID - NIGHT - LATER

           ARMED GUARDS eye patients closely as they enter. Crave 
           retreats inconspicuously and circles the building to

           A SIDE ENTRANCE

           Deserted. Crave tries IT. But the door must be opened from 
           the inside. He waits. In vain. 

           AT VAN - LATER

           Crave taps the door. Elle, pale, roused from sleep, opens it. 

                                 ELLE
                        Change of heart?
                                 CRAVE
                        I need your shirt. 

           EXT. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - HOSPITAL - LATER

           Ambulances soon arrive with sirens blaring. EMTs and aides 
           rush to wheel CAR ACCIDENT VICTIMS into the guarded entrance. 

           Crave, with Elle’s bloody shirt around his head so he looks 
           like an accident victim, runs to a gurney that holds a VICTIM 
           with long, beautiful hair.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        I’m here, baby. I’m right here. 

           Crave sees the victim has a BEARD. She is a he. Great.  

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna be OK now. 

           BEARD, dazed, tries to swat Crave away. 

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                             (to EMTs)
                        He hates hospitals. 

                                 EMT (SPANISH)
                        Follow us in. You need your head 
                        looked at, as well.  

           Crave helps roll the gurney past GUARDS and their BIG GUNS. 

           INT. EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - HOSPITAL

           EMTs, VICTIMS, DOCTORS swirl in a maelstrom of activity and 
           sound. Crave slips away in the chaos. 

           Crave passes patient rooms. Finds a supply closet. Enters.

           INSIDE SUPPLY CLOSET

           Crave sees nothing useful. Just cleaning supplies. Rummages. 
           Passes a phone. Crave does the unthinkable. He dials. 

           INT. PCU - WALTER REED - WASHINGTON D.C. - SAME TIME

           A nest of IVs connect to CRAVE’S FATHER, GORDON, 60s. He 
           wears a USS COLE NAVY CAP. His cell rings. FBI hand it over.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Keep him on the phone. 

           FBI fill his room with trace equipment. They record the call. 
           BACK TO SUPPLY CLOSET

           Crave listens. Ringing. And then he hears the weakest voice 
           from the strongest man he knows. 

                                 GORDON (V.O.)
                        Hello.

           Crave’s face registers: Pain. Regret. 

                                 GORDON (V.O.)
                        Evan. 

           Crave sighs. Relieved that his father’s still alive. He sees 
           a bin of laundry containing soiled SCRUBS. He pulls himself 
           together. Hangs up.

           BACK TO PCU

           FBI AGENTS RIP OFF their headphones. Shake heads. No trace.

           INT. EUROVAN - SAME TIME 

           Elle finds the courage to check her wound. It looks bad. 
           Infected. She glances at herself in the rearview. Concerned. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           DOCTORS take an elevator. All wear scrubs and white lab 
           coats. The doors open on floor two. No one exits. 

           Crave, in surgical mask and blood-stained scrubs, enters. A 
           DOCTOR notices the blood. 

                                 DOCTOR (SPANISH)
                        Butcher’s bill?

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Cholecystectomy. 

                                 DOCTOR (SPANISH)
                        They’re making us do gallbladders 
                        on two? Since when? 

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Next, we will be giving 
                        hysterectomies in the parking lot. 

                                 DOCTOR TWO (SPANISH)
                        I’ve already delivered a baby 
                        there. 

           Several doctors laugh. The elevator door opens. They exit. 
           One flips a security card, letting everyone inside the ICU.
           INSIDE ICU

           Dim lights. Somber. Crave spots a free nurse’s station. He 
           grabs a SAMPLE BAG. Fills it with bandages and antiseptic. 
           He’s about to leave. But sees a COMPUTER TERMINAL. 

           He taps the keyboard. The screen wakes. His head swivels. 
           Clear. Crave executes a records search for: “SCOTT WHITMAN.” 

           A screen asks him for a birthday. Dammit! Then Crave hits a 
           drop down menu. Finds a search option. Keys in: “DENGUE.” 
           Within moments, reams of data fill the screen. Jackpot.

           Crave hits the print key. Grabs the PRINTOUTS. Looks up. Sees 
           a CNI NOTICE with his photo on a bulletin board. Takes it and  
           sneaks into a 

           PATIENT ROOM

           Crave opens a cabinet. Takes scalpels. Hypos. A vial. But now 
           his bag is too full. Too obvious. Sees the patient’s duffel. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - MAIN FLOOR - HOSPITAL - SOON AFTER

           The elevator opens. Crave, in patient’s clothes, hat and 
           carrying the duffel, exits to a hall where POLICE inspect 
           doctors and patients. They’re searching for Crave.

           A POLICE OFFICER looks toward Crave. But Crave turns to a 
           bulletin board. PINS UP the CNI NOTICE up. From the back, he 
           looks like a concerned citizen. The police pass on by. 

           AT PARKING LOT

           Crave rushes to the van. But it’s gone. ELLE LEFT HIM. 

           Crave searches. Alone. No one left to trust.

           He suddenly feels overcome with uncertainty. WHEN

           An AUDI pulls up. Elle’s inside. She unlocks his door.

                                 ELLE
                        Had to switch. This is more my 
                        style.  

           Crave breathes in relief. Gets in the car. 

           INT. BACK SEAT - AUDI - PARKED OFF HIGHWAY - NIGHT - LATER

           Elle flips through the PRINTOUTS as Crave works on her side 
           wound. Bloodied bandages are everywhere.
                                 ELLE
                             (re: Whitman papers)
                        How did you know?

           Crave pulls Elle’s pants down over her hip. Sticks her in the 
           ass with a hypo. Elle hides her embarrassment.

                                 CRAVE
                        The European Center for Disease 
                        Prevention works with the U.N. 
                        Liliana was required to inform them 
                        about Dengue. 

                                 ELLE
                        No. He would have changed it. This 
                        is sloppy. He is not sloppy. 

                                 CRAVE
                        That’s the beauty of socialist 
                        medicine. A master record is owned 
                        by the medical establishment. Not 
                        the patient. He wouldn’t know that.

           Elle examines papers. Notices something. Shows Crave. 

                                 ELLE
                        Look at this. He is O positive here 
                        and AB here.

                                 CRAVE
                        We have proof he’s two different 
                        people. 

                                 ELLE
                        We have proof we’re on the right 
                        track. This is good work, for a 
                        civilian. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Can’t this clear our names? 

                                 ELLE
                        You are a wanted terrorist on the 
                        run and I’m an accomplice. We can’t 
                        call anyone until we have more than 
                        one name with two blood types. 

           Crave stops working on Elle. Looks grim. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I gave you a serious antibiotic. 
                        And I packed the wound. But you 
                        need surgery. No way around it.

                                 ELLE
                        How long?
                                 CRAVE
                        You’ve got a day. Maybe two. After 
                        that, you won’t have a choice. 

           Crave wraps Elle tight. Elle flashes him papers. 

                                 ELLE
                        There are several addresses. One in 
                        Paris, one Florida, but the one in 
                        Ceuta. That’s where we’re headed. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Ceuta? Is that Spain? 

                                 ELLE
                        It’s a Spanish colony in North 
                        Africa. Borders Morocco. Favorite 
                        spot of smugglers, criminals...

                                 CRAVE
                        And spies. 

                                 ELLE
                        We can take the ferry. We do not 
                        need ID. Only disguises. 

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL LOT - PORT - SPAIN - MORNING

           The Audi has been abandoned in a parking lot slick with 
           puddles. A FERRY HORN sounds.

           EXT. FERRY - MEDITERRANEAN SEA - MORNING

           A ferry speeds through chop on the Strait of Gibraltar. 

           INSIDE

           The ferry is packed. Muslim men and women, a few Europeans. 
           Rain splatters the windows. A TV SCREEN blares news. Shows 
           floods in Morocco and Algeria.   

           BELOW TVs: Crave, wool HAT, looking like a Euro tourist. 
           Elle, now dressed as a shrouded Muslim woman. 

           EXT. CEUTA - SPAIN/MOROCCO - NOON

           It’s RAINING. Water forms urban rivers in this postage stamp 
           sized city owned by Spain but affixed to a corner of Morocco. 
           Passengers disembark the ferry. Crave walks along with drunk 
           Spaniards and blends in. Elle, shrouded, walks ahead.
           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - CEUTA - LATER

           Elle walks past an apartment complex. Studies a second floor 
           apartment. They case the front and then back of the complex.

           SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT

           Crave tries to BANG the door in. Elle stops him. Picks the 
           lock. Slips open the door.

           INT. CEUTA APARTMENT

           Elle peers in. Steps on mail. The place is full of furniture, 
           dust and boxes featuring Chinese writing. Otherwise, no signs 
           of life. She opens the fridge. Rotten food. 

           Crave sees a large mirror. He lifts it off the wall. Voila! 
           REVEALS A SAFE. 

                                 ELLE
                        Do. Not. Touch. It. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Why not?

                                 ELLE
                        Too obvious. It’s rigged. At least 
                        that is what I would do. 

           Elle opens the Chinese boxes. Reveals COUNTERFEIT EURORAIL 
           PASSES. Considers this. Elle moves furniture, still looking.

                                 CRAVE
                        What am I looking for?

                                 ELLE
                        Sometimes we are sent information 
                        and then instructed to destroy it. 
                        Sometimes, we don’t. Leverage. It 
                        always comes in handy.

                                 CRAVE
                        Whose apartment is this?

                                 ELLE
                        Depends. This is one of Whitman’s 
                        registered addresses. But did Evan 
                        assume his name or assume his life? 

           Crave spies a tropical plant. Strange: It’s the only life 
           left in the place. Knocks it over. Nothing but a dirt mess. 
           Then he notices the corner of an envelope. He pulls it out. 
           Inside: A U.S. passport, cell phone and a stack of euros. 

                                 CRAVE (TO ELLE)
                        Leverage. 
           Crave opens the passport. Elle scans it.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Scott Whitman. 

                                 ELLE
                        No. That’s my Evan. 

           Crave stares at Elle’s Evan. He sees a better version of 
           himself. The kind of man that could keep a woman like Elle.

           Crave POWERS on the phone. It displays only four icons: EC. 
           SW. MS. RI. Elle points to the EC icon. Crave opens it. It’s 
           an Evan Crave dossier: His photo. Facts. His entire life. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Oh, my God. Jesus. 

           He flips through the screens of his personal details.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        That’s my account in London. 

           Crave enlarges a logo on the document. It reads “TOP SECRET.” 
           “SAP.” And then: “Department Thirty.” 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        What’s Department Thirty? 

                                 ELLE
                        I’ve never heard of it. 

           Crave clicks on the SW icon. It opens to a file and a photo 
           of the real “Scott Whitman.” Different from the passport. 

                                 CRAVE
                        And that’s the real Scott Whitman.

           Crave opens the other folders. Every dossier is stamped: 
           “Department Thirty.” “Top Secret.” “SAP.” Elle points to a 
           very small logo. She enlarges it. It reads: “SOCOM.”

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)

                        Who steal civilian identities. 

           Suddenly, the PHONE CRASHES. The icons FREEZE.

                                 ELLE
                        He knows we found his phone. It 
                        must have triggered an alert. 

           Then the phone RINGS. Elle looks at Crave. Another ring. She 
           answers. 

                                 ELLE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 

           INT. FORWARD OPERATING BASE - SAHARA - SAME TIME

           JOHN DORIAN, military. Sexy, suave, deadly. He’s in a sandy 
           military tent with gear: Rugged laptops, guns, sat phones. 
           This is Elle’s “EVAN CRAVE.”

           Dorian watches a screen depicting his cell phone. Icons are 
           being DELETED in front of him. 

                                 ELLE (O.S.)
                        Is that you?

           Dorian’s face is wrought with emotion at hearing her voice. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN DORIAN AND ELLE

                                 ELLE  (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        It is not the lies, it is the 
                        silence that makes me angry. 

                                 DORIAN (HEADSET)
                        I love you.

                                 ELLE (INTO PHONE)
                        Then tell me your real name. 

                                 DORIAN (HEADSET)
                        We know the attack will be on U.S. 
                        soil. We know it is three days from 
                        now. But we don’t know where or 
                        how.

                        I need you to bring Crave back to 
                        the Saharawi camp. I’ll meet you 
                        there.

                                 ELLE (INTO PHONE, AWAY FROM CRAVE)
                        Not if you’ll hurt him. 

                                 DORIAN (HEADSET)
                        Get him to the camp, and you’ll be 
                        part of the team that stops the 
                        attack and captures Nadr Shah. 

           Dorian hangs up. 

           BACK IN APARTMENT

           Crave studies Elle. She tries the phone. It’s been BRICKED. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Did he tell you his name?

           Elle gathers herself. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Can we call the CIA now? I have the 
                        passport with his picture. I have 
                        the page with two blood types. 

                                 ELLE
                        But the phone has been erased. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I saw the program, Department 
                        Thirty. 

                                 ELLE
                        No. Department Thirty is top 
                        secret. SAP. Special Access 
                        Program. Whatever it is, few people 
                        know, and those who do will protect 
                        it. 

                                 CRAVE
                        So what did he suggest?

                                 ELLE
                        He wants me to bring you back to 
                        the camp. Your camp.  

                                 CRAVE
                        It’s a trap. I’m no spy, but he’s 
                        dirty. You love him so you can’t 
                        see it. But the thing is, you don’t 
                        know a single thing about him. He 
                        didn’t even tell you his name.

           Elle is emotionally exhausted. 
                                 ELLE
                        He doesn’t have to.

           Heads to the boxes. Opens them. 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Months ago, I was part of a team. 
                        We foiled a terrorist plot against 
                        L’Estadi Camp Nou, a stadium in 
                        Barcelona. You could say we saved 
                        80,000 people, some from death, 
                        some from trauma, all from pain. 

           Elle opens more boxes. Looking for something. 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Everyone I worked with told me a 
                        different story. None of us was who 
                        we said. Despite our covers, our 
                        deception, we trusted each other. 
                        In the end, we uncovered the 
                        mastermind. It was Nadr Shah. We 
                        think he’s hiding in Yemen, but we 
                        nailed his triggermen, his bomb 
                        makers, his watchers. Twelve 
                        people, in custody. Still spilling 
                        their secrets to your government.

           Elle finds what she’s looking for: Sheaves of COUNTERFEIT 
           TICKETS of some kind. 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Identities are clothes we wear,  
                        not who we are. The stories we tell 
                        about ourselves? Fiction. But our 
                        actions, that’s our truth. We are 
                        what we do. 

                                 CRAVE
                        And what has he done?

                                 ELLE
                        He is the one who brought the team 
                        together. 

           Crave considers this revelation. Can he trust this man?

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need his name. If he didn’t 
                        tell me, it was to protect us both. 
                        But I do know him. And you? I know 
                        everything about you except for 
                        this: Which way will you run? 

           Elle hands him Whitman’s passport and the money. 
                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Because I’m headed to the camp.

                                 CRAVE
                        What do you think happened to Scott 
                        Whitman?

           Elle shows Crave fake Camp Nou stadium tickets.

                                 ELLE
                        Whitman was a counterfeiter. He had 
                        fake tickets to the stadium. He was 
                        compromised, so Evan used him.  

                                 CRAVE
                        Do you think he’s dead?

                                 ELLE
                        If he is, it is because he did not 
                        have me. Do you want your name 
                        back?

           Crave collapses in a chair. Exhausted. Considers his lack of 
           options. Finds himself looking into Elle’s face. There is 
           something about her that he trusts.

                                 CRAVE
                        How do we get across the border?

                                 ELLE
                        By doing exactly what I say. 
                        Starting with keeping your hat on 
                        and head down. 

           EXT. CEUTA - MOROCCAN BORDER - DAY- LATER 

           Hundreds of Muslim women amass TO CROSS THE BORDER. Old. 
           Hunched. They look like human mules, carrying contraband.

           Elle, shrouded, waits in line with the SWARM of Muslim women. 
           Several ducttape diapers/socks/underwear to themselves. 
           Others load goods into sheets slung as backpacks. 

           CRAVE STANDS IN LINE by a wall with Islamic graffiti. He 
           wears the wool hat, head down, to avoid cameras. Further back 
           is Elle, with her own pack. Crave waits to pass through a 
           turnstile as police help overloaded women.

           INT. METAL ALLEY - CEUTA - MOROCCAN BORDER

           The women are forced to form a single line. They SURGE to the 
           border as MOROCCAN POLICE yell at them to hurry through. 

           AT TURNSTILE
           The gateway to Morocco. Moroccan flags flap all along the 
           fence. Strangely, the police don’t check any Muslim women for 
           passports. But they do palm dirham (Moroccan currency).

                                 MOROCCAN POLICE (FRENCH)
                        Keep it moving! 

           Crave passes the officer, who stops him with a billy club.

                        Identification. 

           Crave digs for SCOTT WHITMAN’S PASSPORT. Sweats. Holds up the 
           line of Muslim women. He hands over the passport. The officer 
           opens it to a E500 banknote. Takes it. Stamps the passport. 

                                 MOROCCAN (FRENCH)
                        Go! Go! Hurry up. 

           Crave enters Morocco. 

           EXT. CEUTA - MOROCCO - DAY

           The women fan out to wagons and wheelbarrows. It’s a tsunami 
           of people and cheap goods. A FENCED REFUGEE CAMP has been set 
           up nearby. Refugees wave dirham to buy diapers, alcohol. 

           Crave sees a YOUNG MOTHER with a wailing and barely-dressed 
           BABY. He takes off his hat and puts it on the baby’s head.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Fever. He needs a doctor. 

           Crave LOOKS UP. Searches for help.

                        I need a translator. Can someone 
                        speak Arabic?

           But no one answers. Just a sea of desolate souls. 

           ON SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE: CEUTA - BORDER CROSSING

           INT. COUNTER TERRORISM AUDITORIUM - LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS

           On a single screen: FACIAL REC HOLDS ON CRAVE. 

           TOLLIVER, pale from a caffeine all-nighter, slowly wakes. He 
           scans screens. Then stops. One of the screens shows a FACIAL 
           REC ALERT. Tolliver scoots up. Wide awake now. Hits keys 
           until ALL SCREENS flip to Crave at CEUTA BORDER CROSSING. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        Motherfucker. I got you.
           Other agents take notice. Activity BUZZES BACK TO LIFE. 

           Tolliver watches ON SCREEN as ELLE leads Crave to a row of 
           vehicles. Facial Rec can’t ID her. Her head is always down.  

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Get me the “Chair Force” at Creech.

           EXT. CEUTA - MOROCCO - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elle tugs on Crave. 

                                 ELLE
                        Head down!

           Elle gives him a discreet KISS so he has to tuck his chin. 
           Surprised, he mistakes the advance. Kisses her back. Elle 
           pulls back.

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        No. Keep your chin down. Where’s 
                        your hat?

                                 CRAVE
                        That baby is very sick. 

                                 ELLE
                        Forget it. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Were you born without a heart?

                                 ELLE
                        Without a desire to die. 

           Elle scans a line of cars. GETAWAY DRIVERS in their turbos 
           waiting for drugs. Old trucks being loaded with merchandise. 

           She sees a 1980 LAND ROVER ONE-TEN, rusty but reliable. A 
           young driver, ABDULLA, 21, leans on it.

                                 ELLE (FRENCH) (CONT’D)
                        How much for this rusty old thing? 
                        Euros, not dirham. 

                                 ABDULLA (FRENCH)
                        This was a sheik’s personal car. He 
                        had her rebuilt. All after-market. 

           INT. COUNTER TERRORISM AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Rain spackles drone cameras. Tolliver puts on a headset. 
                                 TOLLIVER (HEADSET)
                        Ajax. No civilians. High value 
                        targets only.

           INT. CREECH GROUND CONTROL - LAS VEGAS - CONTINUOUS

           PILOT MQ-9 “AJAX,” flight suit, watches his console: screens 
           show the CEUTA/MOROCCO border crossing. 

           At his fingers: keyboards, joystick and a DARLING PHOTO of 
           his kids. Next to him sits the SENSOR OPERATOR, “BIRDSEYE.”   

           ON SCREEN: Abdulla points out the winch, snorkel, tires.

                                 AJAX (HEADSET)
                        Sir, if they get into the car, we 
                        could lose them. 

                                 TOLLIVER (O.S.)
                        No civilian casualties. Morocco 
                        wants to keep its relationship with 
                        Uncle Sam in the closet.

           Ajax EASES UP the joystick. Circles for another view. 

                                 TOLLIVER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Clean shot only.

           ON SCREEN: ABDULLA TAPS THE HOOD.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 ABDULLA (FRENCH)
                        She is ugly, but she will not die 
                        in the sirocco wind, or drown in 
                        the desert. 10,000 euros. 

           Elle hands him two stacks of COUNTERFEIT bills. Enters the 
           driver’s side. Abdulla counts the money. Hides it. 

                                 ABDULLA (FRENCH) (CONT’D)
                        Five thousand for the gas. 

           Elle points a gun at him. He steps away with a smile. Crave 
           enters the passenger’s side. 

           INT. COUNTER TERRORISM AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           SURVEILLANCE SCREEN: Rain dots the camera showing the ONE-TEN 
           driving in traffic. Signs stand guard at FLOODED ROADSIDES.

                                 TOLLIVER (HEADSET)
                        Ajax, follow.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN CT AUDITORIUM/CREECH/MOROCCO
           Rain coats the highway. The traffic eases, but Elle drives 
           the One-Ten right up the ass of a PEUGEOT. 

           IN ONE-TEN

           Elle holds her side. Doesn’t let Crave see she’s bleeding. 
           Crave grips the passenger door. Bracing.

                                 CRAVE
                        I don’t know where you learned how 
                        to drive, but you could give him a 
                        little room. 

                                 ELLE
                        And give the CIA a clean target? 
                        We are blown.

                                 CRAVE
                        How could they know I crossed the 
                        border? 

                                 ELLE
                        I told you to keep your head down 
                        You looked up. Your face. That’s 
                        all they need. Drones. 

           BACK AT CREECH

           Ajax maneuvers his drone. 

                                 AJAX (HEADSET) 
                        I do not have a clean shot, over. 

           BACK IN ONE-TEN

           It Tails the Peugeot. Crave does the math. 

                                 CRAVE
                        So what, they shoot us?

                                 ELLE
                        Yes.  

                                 CRAVE
                        When do I get to prove my 
                        innocence? 

                                 ELLE
                        Suspected terrorists are never 
                        innocent. 

           The Peugeot takes an exit. The One-Ten continues. ALONE. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m an American citizen. 
                                 ELLE
                        On their kill list. 

                                 CRAVE
                        But the Pentagon... 

                                 ELLE
                        Is not the CIA. They’re rivals. 
                        They use each other.

           Elle is frantic, frustrated and scared. 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        They don’t meet for coffee and talk 
                        about what they are up to. If the 
                        Pentagon needs to protect 
                        Department Thirty or whatever 
                        mission Evan is on
                             (beat)
                        we’ll be dead the moment they get a 
                        clean shot. 

           Elle careens down the highway. WEAVES RIGHT. LEFT. But can’t 
           evade the laser dot that “sparkles” the roof of the One-Ten. 

           BACK IN CT AUDITORIUM

           Tolliver watches screens with a LOCK ON THE ONE-TEN.

                                 HASKINS
                        SIR! WAIT! 

           Tolliver steps to Haskins’ laptop streaming drone footage. 
           Haskins sticks a Post-It with an arrow pointing to the 
           TOOLBAR. It occasionally flashes like it’s possessed. The 
           Post-It reads: SOCOM. 

                                 TOLLIVER (HEADSET) 
                        Ajax, hold.  

           Tolliver takes off his headset. 

                                 HASKINS (WHISPER)
                        Pentagon’s watching, sir. Don’t 
                        they have their own drones? Why  
                        piggyback? Is this above-board?

                                 TOLLIVER (WHISPER)
                        Approved by Pennsylvania Avenue. 
                        Evan Crave is a terrorist.

                                 HASKINS (WHISPER)
                        Then why are we under surveillance?

           BACK AT CREECH

           Ajax has a CLEAN SHOT. 
                                 AJAX (HEADSET) 
                        The window is closing, sir. 

           BACK IN CT AUDITORIUM

           Tolliver watches the ONE-TEN DRIVE ERRATICALLY. Glances at 
           Haskins’ screen. Toolbar: still possessed. 

                                 TOLLIVER (HEADSET) 
                        Do it.

           BACK AT CREECH

           Ajax hits the “fire” button. Silence. Nothing happens. He 
           reads an ERROR ALERT on his screen. Then it LOCKS.

           BACK IN CT AUDITORIUM

           Tolliver stares at the ONE-TEN: Still driving. 

                                 TOLLIVER (HEADSET) (CONT’D)
                        Why aren’t they twisted and 
                        burning?

                                 AJAX (O.S.)
                        Error message. Drone’s disabled. 
                        You got any enemies at the 
                        Pentagon, sir? ‘Cause they just 
                        hijacked your op.

                                 TOLLIVER 
                             (to Haskins)
                        Why are they protecting a known 
                        terrorist? 

           Haskins can’t answer. Tolliver contains his rage. Stays 
           tactical.

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        We need an on-site ground team. 
                        Prepped and armed. Who do we use in 
                        Morocco?

                                 HASKINS
                        Omar. But he’s messy. Expensive.

                        Ajax, keep visual. For now. 

           Tolliver grabs his jacket. Tosses his headset. 

                                 TOLLIVER (TO HASKINS) (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go old school. Send Omar in. 
                        When he engages, take Creech 
                        offline. I don’t want the Pentagon 
                        hijacking Omar.  
                                 HASKINS
                        Where are you going, sir?

                                 TOLLIVER (WALKING AWAY)
                        To get our op back.

           BACK IN ONE-TEN 

           Crave spots a Mercedes ahead. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Right there! Hurry. 

           Elle revs it to the Mercedes. RIDES ITS ASS. Safe. Smiles. 
           For the first time, Crave notices her smile. 

           ESTABLISHING - PENTAGON - DAY - LATER

           The surreal 9/11 memorial is prominent. Awe inspiring. 
           Terrorism is personal here. 

           INT. LOBBY - PENTAGON

           AIRFORCE GEN. PATRICK KANTOR, 55, the Don Corleone of 
           intelligence. He walks to an exit as Tolliver approaches.

           SUPERIMPOSE: GENERAL KANTOR, COMMANDER, JOINT SPECIAL 
           OPERATIONS COMMAND (JSOC). 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        General Kantor. Ogden Tolliver. 
                        Counter Terrorism. 

           General Kantor smiles politely, but walks on past. 

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        I doubt this is your wife. 

           Kantor stops. Tolliver holds up his smartphone that shows a 
           photo of Kantor and a STYLISH ESCORT entering a hotel room. 

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        You spy on us. We spy on you. Who 
                        is Evan Crave?

                                 KANTOR
                        Never heard of him.

           Kantor sends a text to someone. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        I had him dead to rights and you 
                        tied my hands. 
                                 KANTOR
                        Wasn’t us. Try NSA. Cybercommand. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        You’re running an op. I’m running 
                        an op. Why not work in concert? We 
                        are on the same side.

                                 KANTOR
                        If I need something from the CIA, 
                        I’ll take it. And don’t worry about 
                        that photo. It’s being deleted. 

           Kantor exits. Tolliver simmers from the cold shoulder. 
           Glances at his phone. The photo is GONE.

           EXT. MUHAMMED AVE. - QUARZAZATE - RAINY DAY

           The One-Ten and other cars pass through a domed gate into 
           this ancient fortified city. FLOODED LANES are closed.

           BEHIND THEM: A DARK SUV

           OMAR, soldier of fortune with a 5 o’clock shadow, drives the 
           SUV. PHOTOS OF CRAVE are taped to the SUV dashboard along 
           with an aerial photo of the One-Ten. THUGS in the backseat. 

           The ONE-TEN heads to a crowded medina as GUTTERS SPOUT WATER. 
           Elle navigates traffic and large puddles. 

           INT. ONE-TEN

           Elle drives. No longer shrouded in her Muslim outfit. 

                                 ELLE
                        We need new a car.

           INSIDE DARK SUV

           Crosshairs on Elle. But traffic shifts. And the shot’s gone.

           INSIDE ONE-TEN

           Crave glances at her. Holds her wrist. She thinks he’s 
           holding her hand. Then realizes he’s just checking her pulse.

                                 CRAVE
                        Pulse is low. Are you dizzy? 

           Elle’s about to answer when she spots the SUV. It sprouts 
           UZIS. Elle SWERVES UP a NARROW ALLEY gushing rainwater. 

                                 ELLE
                        Get down!
           The SUV follows. BULLETS RIVET THE ONE-TEN. THE GUNMEN pull 
           back into the SUV as it SCRAPES alley walls. A THUG climbs 
           the sunroof like a surfer. SURFER THUG fires: BLAM! BLAM! 

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN SOUK - QUARZAZATE

           The One-Ten BLASTS from the alley into a souk. 

           A crowd parts. MASON JARS and FRUIT PYRAMIDS EXPLODE AGAINST 
           THE ONE-TEN as Elle punches it and EMERGES onto a main road. 

           CRACK! A MOTORCYCLIST upends over the windshield. 

                                 ELLE
                        Twenty seven. 

           Elle doesn’t stop. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Twenty seven?

                                 ELLE
                        Number of civilians.

                                 CRAVE
                        That you’ve hurt?

                                 ELLE (TROUBLED)
                        Killed. In the line of duty.

           Crave turns. Sees the biker stand up and flip them off. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Twenty six.

           BLAM! BLAM! 

           THEY TAKE FIRE as the SUV roars onto the road. In a flash:

           -- Elle YANKS the PARKING BRAKE! 

           -- The SUV RAMS into the One-Ten. 

           -- The SUV FLIPS and SKIDS to a stop. The One-Ten gets away.

           The gunmen exit the wreckage. They WAVE UZIS and commandeer 
           the two best passing cars: A Range Rover (OMAR) and a POLO.

           Elle BEELINES the One-Ten for the WALLS OF QUARZAZATE and an 
           arched exit wide enough only for carts. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        We won’t fit. ELLE! 

           Elle UPSHIFTS and BLASTS THROUGH.
           The One-Ten loses paint but SPITS into the watery red earth 
           around the city. Elle slowly merges on a FRONTAGE ROAD along 
           a SWOLLEN RIVER. She drives toward the distant mountains.

           EXT. FLOODED VALLEY - DAY - LATER

           The scenery has shifted. Terraced villages hug the hills at 
           the base of the Atlas Mountains. Water cascades in impromptu 
           FLASH FLOODS. 

           Elle drives past until the road is cut off by THE RIVER. She 
           TRIES TO REVERSE, but sees the Range Rover behind them.

                                 CRAVE
                        I’ve done floods. 

           Crave exits. Unhooks the winch. Wades in. DISAPPEARS in the 
           murky water. 

           Elle touches her side. Looks at her fingers: Blood. She’s 
           bleeding through her bandages. She scans the water. Worried. 
           THEN CRAVE POPS UP on the far bank. He ties off the winch. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Hit it.

           Elle hits the winch switch and the One-Ten LURCHES forward. 
           It PLOWS UNDERWATER just as the Range Rover opens fire.

           INSIDE ONE-TEN

           GUNFIRE TRACERS zip past the ONE-TEN underwater. Elle 
           swallows hard as water pours in from the BULLET HOLES. 

           But then the One-Ten EMERGES on the far bank. Crave hits the 
           cable retract and jumps back in. 

           Omar EMPTIES HIS CLIP as the One-Ten drives off. He points 
           his Uzi at the Polo. Gestures it across. The Polo edges into 
           the river, SUBMERGES THEN SINKS. Gunmen crawl out. 

           WHEELS CRUSH the roof as the Range Rover uses the Polo as a 
           BRIDGE. The Polo gunmen are DRAGGED downriver. Screaming.

           EXT. MUD FLATS - LATER

           Tires SPIN in a POTHOLE. Crave jumps out. Loops around the 
           front. Hangs from driver’s side door like a counterweight. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Go. GO!

           The One-Ten LAUNCHES FREE. Crave rides on the side. 
                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Stay left. 

           AT RANGE ROVER

           It follows far behind. Inside: Omar talks on a sat phone. 

                                 OMAR (ARABIC)
                        Send me something that flies. NOW!  

           EXT. BRIDGE - FLOODED VILLAGE - LATER

           Elle drives the One-Ten across a nearly FLOODED BRIDGE as 
           Crave rides shotgun. The bridge is still makable. Barely. The 
           Range Rover FOLLOWS. Powers forward. RAMS THE ONE-TEN! 

           The One-Ten slicks sideways, spins and then SLAMS INTO THE 
           RAILINGS. The bridge BUCKLES. Shifts. Elle looks up. She sees 
           they’re NOW FACING THE RANGE ROVER. 

           Elle guns it. The Range Rover guns it. The two vehicles lock 
           horns like mountain goats. Metal groans. Engines smoke WHEN

           THE ENTIRE PLATFORM SLIPS OFF ITS PYLONS!

           Both cars float downriver on the bridge as it slowly SINKS.

           Elle reverses, pulls the parking brake and executes a 180, 
           SLIDING THE ONE-TEN in the slurry until they face forward. 

                                 ELLE
                        Hold on. 

                                 CRAVE
                        No. Don’t! 

           She REVS it and tries for shore. 

           The One-Ten launches. Crave holds his arm across her. 
           Protective. They go AIRBORNE.

           Too short! The One-Ten bellies into the RAPIDS. SPLASH!

           SPUTTER! SPUTTER! The One-Ten SPINS in the CURRENT. Followed 
           by the RANGE ROVER. Gunmen climb on the roof and AIM when

           SLAM! THE RANGE ROVER hits a tree. SHOTS FIRE skyward.

           The vehicles SPIN like Disney Teacups and SLAM into each 
           other repeatedly: Tsunami bumper cars in a deadly shootout. 

           INSIDE ONE-TEN

           Water is KNEE-DEEP and seeping in.
                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        We got to bail!

           Elle and Crave crawl out and LEAP for a SUNKEN VAN. Crave 
           lands hard. Elle nearly makes it. She’s suddenly GRIPPED by 
           the current when Crave PULLS HER ABOARD. They scan the flood 
           debris for a way out. Nothing but dead cars. Dead trees and:

           An abandoned pickup towing a PANGA BOAT.

           -- They HOPSCOTCH over car roofs to the panga. 

           -- The gunmen follow. Shots ZIP past.

           -- Crave and Elle jump into the PANGA.

           Elle unties it. Crave yanks the 75HP outboard cord. Nothing. 
           SHOTS ZING. Crave YANKS the cord again and it ROARS TO LIFE. 

           Meanwhile: OMAR, stands on his Range Rover, looking skwyard. 
           A HELICOPTER comes into view and SWOOPS IN to pick him up.

           EXT. FLOODED VILLAGE - LATER

           Crave MOTORS the panga in flooded streets that look like 
           canals when a PULSING SOUND BUILDS: WHUMP-WHUMP-WHUMP!

           THE HELICOPTER

           RISES above the arches like it’s Hamburger Hill. 

           Omar aims a SIX-BARRELLED M-134 from the chopper. 

           A BUZZSAW ROAR drowns out the THUMPING ROTORS.

           -- 7.62 mm bullets

           -- RIP the water’s surface and

           -- SNAKE toward the panga!

           Crave WHIRLS the panga and LAUNCHES it down a set of stairs 
           in a life-or-death log ride over category 5 rapids. The prop 
           CHEWS cobblestones as the panga CHUTES into an alley.

           The chopper ROARS OVERHEAD when Elle sees:

           ECU: AWNINGS hanging over balconies, above the water line.

           The chopper CIRCLES IN for the kill shot WHEN ELLE JAMS the 
           outboard mount so it LOCKS and turns hard left for an AWNING. 

           Elle PUSHES CRAVE out and leaps in after him. 

           THEY SINK LIKE STONES AS
           The panga LAUNCHES OFF the AWNING. Airborne.

           AT CHOPPER

           The panga CLIPS its landing struts. Omar’s face flashes 
           shock. He should have seen this coming. The chopper SLAMS 
           into the alley behind Crave and Elle, and EXPLODES! Its ROTOR 
           SHEARS OFF and boomerangs toward them. The BLADES WHIRL. At 
           the last second:

           Crave YANKS Elle into a partially submerged doorway as

           THE ROTOR WHIPS UPON THEM. 

           Elle and Crave hold each other AND their breath as the rotor 
           tears past them into a submerged parked car and THUNKS to a 
           dead stop.

           That’s when Crave notices CRIMSON in the water. ELLE’S BLOOD. 
           He swims them to surface.

           Crave helps her to a second floor balcony above the water 
           line. He lifts her shirt and sees her wound. It gushes blood. 

                                 ELLE
                        I’m not going to make it.

                                 CRAVE
                        You’ve got me. The camp isn’t that 
                        far now. 

                                 ELLE
                        That’s what scares me. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Do you trust him? 

                                 ELLE
                        Not since I met you. 

           Crave tries to stem the fountain of blood. Holds her.

           INT. PCU - WALTER REED - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT - LATER

           GORDON, still in his USS COLE NAVY CAP. Still hounded by FBI. 
           Hears his cell ring. 

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Get him to talk. And keep him 
                        talking. 

           Gordon nods to the FBI, still crowding the trace equipment. 
           EXT. CAFE - ZAGORA - MOROCCO - NIGHT

           Crave is on the last pay phone in the universe. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN CRAVE AND HIS FATHER 

                                 CRAVE
                        Dad? 

                                 GORDON CRAVE
                        Navy saved me. Got me great 
                        doctors. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Thank God. I was always hoping we 
                        could reconnect. 

                                 GORDON CRAVE
                        I can’t get you out of this.

                                 CRAVE
                        It’s not what it seems. 

                                 GORDON CRAVE
                        It’s never been with you. But this 
                        time you dishonored the family 
                        name. And that can’t be undone. 

                                 CRAVE
                        None of it is true. I’ve seen 
                        documents for a program called 
                        Department Thirty. It’s run by 
                        Special Operations Command. I think 
                        they’re stealing identities. 

           FBI nods to Gordon. They have the TRACE.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        They stole mine. I fit the profile 
                        they needed. The only proof I have 
                        is a passport for a Scott Whitman 
                        but with someone else’s photo. 

                                 GORDON CRAVE
                        You’re beyond my reach, Evan. I’m 
                        sorry. Turn yourself in. We can 
                        talk then. Surrender.

                                 CRAVE
                        They set me up. If you don’t hear 
                        from me again, I wanted you to know 
                        that was why. 

           Crave’s father hangs up, broken but not showing it.

                                 FBI
                        NO! No. 
                                 GORDON CRAVE (TO FBI)
                        You got what you need. Now get out.

           His audible heartbeat lapses into extrasystoles, causing his 
           EKG to ring. Hospital staff RUSH IN TO TEND HIM.

           EXT. CAFE - ZAGORA - MOROCCO - NIGHT

           Crave resets the receiver. Absorbs the possibility he may 
           never see his father again. The emotions grip Crave. He gives 
           himself to them. Tucks his head until the moment passes.

           Then he pulls himself together. Looks to Elle. She's passed 
           out. Crave gently wakes her. Elle, groggy, tries to stand.

           Crave lifts her up and simply carries her.

           INT. TOLLIVER’S OFFICE - LANGLEY - LATER

           Tolliver sits in the dark. Haskins stands in the door.

                                 HASKINS
                        FBI called. Traced a call to 
                        Zagora. A hundred miles from the 
                        Saharawi Refugee Camp.  

                                 TOLLIVER
                        I told you he’d call his dad.

                                 HASKINS
                        Sounds desperate.

           Tolliver prods Haskins with a look. 

                                 HASKINS (CONT’D)
                        He said Special Operations Command 
                        is stealing civilian identities for 
                        something called Department Thirty. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        But he doesn’t have proof. 

                                 HASKINS
                        Has a passport for someone named 
                        Scott Whitman. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        One of ours?

                                 HASKINS
                        No. Criminal turned confidential 
                        informant. Last year he was put 
                        into Witness Protection. 
                                 TOLLIVER
                        What agency was running him?

                                 HASKINS
                        Don’t know. File vanished. But did 
                        some more research on Evan Crave. 
                        Comes from a long line of military 
                        men. He’s had an ancestor in almost 
                        every war going back to the first 
                        Battle of Bull Run. Many decorated.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        Proves the point. There’s a black 
                        sheep in every family.

                        Why?

                                 TOLLIVER
                        We’re going to Vegas. Track Crave 
                        from the Creech Control, while the 
                        Pentagon piggybacks your laptop.  

                                 HASKINS
                        You think there’s something to what  
                        Crave’s saying?

                                 TOLLIVER
                        You know why I do my job? I do it 
                        because I believe in it. Thing is, 
                        Crave believes in his job, too. So 
                        it’s not that he killed three men 
                        or destroyed twenty drones. Or 
                        evaded Recces, or ditched Omar. No, 
                        it’s never about what he’s done. 
                        It’s always about what he’s going 
                        to do next. Doesn’t matter what he 
                        says. Our job doesn’t change. We 
                        stop him. 

           EXT. TIZI N’TICHKA PASS - MOROCCO - NIGHT - LATER

           A Moroccan bus travels through the Atlas Mountains. 

           INT. BUS - MOVING - TIZI N’TICHKA PASS

           Berbers and livestock squeeze inside. Elle and Crave are 
           huddled in the back. She SHIVERS. Crave keeps her warm. 
           Elle stares at the diamond ring on her finger. She slips it 
           off. Pockets it. Crave doesn’t see. 

                                 ELLE
                        What do you tell your patients when 
                        they are frightened? 

                                 CRAVE
                        I lie. Tell them they’re in good 
                        hands. 

                                 ELLE
                        And they’re not? 

                                 CRAVE
                        It’s not up to me. I wish it were. 
                        That’s the hardest part. I can’t 
                        save anyone. I can only influence 
                        the outcome. 

           Crave looks at Elle. She looks fragile. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        The worst cases, I make them these 
                        stupid little cars out of Coca-Cola 
                        cans. A new toy for tomorrow. But 
                        not everyone gets to play.

                                 ELLE
                        Don’t make one for me.

           She puts her head on his shoulder. He lets her. Then he 
           notices. She’s taken off her engagement ring. 

           EXT. WESTERN SAHARA - DESERT - NEXT DAY

           Stillness. The Sahara cooks in the afternoon sun. No 
           vegetation. A vast sea of loneliness stretches to the

           SAHARAWI REFUGEE CAMP

           Where shades of salmon-colored tents and dunes melt into the 
           landscape. Camels hide under each other’s shade as a MODIFIED 
           DUMPTRUCK enters camp full of potatoes. Refugees gather. 

           INT. CAB - DUMP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Crave helps Elle out and uses the GROWING CROWD as cover. 

           ALTERNATE POV: Someone watches through binocs as Crave 
           carries Elle, but then VANISHES INTO THE CROWD.
           INT. HUSSEIN’S TENT - DAY - LATER

           Hussein watches grandsons play with Coca-Cola can cars. Crave 
           carries Elle in. No time for greetings.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        I need the operating room prepped. 
                        Can you find Ahmed? 

                                 HUSSEIN (SPANISH)
                        He left. Frightened by an American.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        Where is this American now?

                                 HUSSEIN (SPANISH)
                        I don’t know. Can she wait until 
                        night? Then no one will know you 
                        are here. 

           Crave wets a towel and wipes Elle’s FEVERISH face. Nods.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS - SAHARAWI REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT

           TWENTY-ONE vehicles approach camp. Lights off. They don’t 
           want to wake anybody. Park at a distance.

           NADR’S COMMANDOS exit. They look like hipster Arab Spring 
           rebels: Skinny jeans, scarves, scruff, Kalashnikovs. A few 
           smoke Marlboros. Their embers bob through the camp.

           INT. SURGERY ROOM - SAHARAWI MEDICAL CLINIC - NIGHT

           The lights are dim. Elle is connected to IVs and is under 
           anesthesia. A NURSE wears a headlamp (only light on Elle).

           Crave cleans Elle’s wound. Hussein preps at a sink.

           A FIGURE steps in. Crave sees ONLY THE GUN. 

           Here stands JOHN DORIAN (from page 51). Crave sees him: 
           Taller. Muscular. Larger in life than Whitman’s passport 
           photo could have suggested. Imposing in tactical gear. 

           Hussein nods. This is the American of which he spoke. 

                                 DORIAN
                        When did she get hit?

                                 CRAVE
                        Three days go. Saving my life. 
                        Because she thought I was you. 

                                 DORIAN
                        She was my contingency plan. 
                                 CRAVE
                        She thinks she’s more than that.

           Dorian takes her hand tenderly. Hurt to see her hurt. Notices 
           she’s not wearing her ring. Lets that in.

                                 DORIAN
                        Will she live?

                                 CRAVE
                        Depends. Are you going to kill me?

           Dorian tucks his gun in his belt. Kisses Elle’s forehead. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Then scrub up. 

                                 DORIAN
                        I’m not a doctor. 

                                 CRAVE
                        And I’m not a spy.
                             (beat)
                        I need another set of hands.

           Crave motions to Hussein. He scrubs and gloves Dorian. The 
           nurse shows Dorian how to hold a sponge as she clamps. 

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        I got the bullet out. We’ll know in 
                        24 hours if she’s septic. Blood 
                        poisoning. Do you have a name, 
                        besides mine? 

           Dorian sizes him up. Knows he deserved that. He stiffens and 
           the soldier in him takes over. 

                                 DORIAN
                        My name is John Dorian. My birthday 
                        is June 2, 1976. My mother’s maiden 
                        name is White. My pin is 1824.

                                 CRAVE
                        Doesn’t prove who you are.

                                 DORIAN
                        We don’t carry ID. Our faces are 
                        off the grid. SOCOM. Special 
                        Operations Command. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Where’s your uniform?

                                 DORIAN
                        On the inside. Keeps it clean.
                                 CRAVE
                        Who are we? Are we still a 
                        democracy? Am I still free enough 
                        to ask that question? Because if 
                        you can take my identity, I’m not a 
                        civilian, I’m a hostage.

                                 DORIAN
                        For a couple more days. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Why? You need to destroy some more 
                        drones and kill more people?

                                 DORIAN
                        We used one faulty MQ-9 Reaper and 
                        19 made-for-Hollywood specials. 

           CLOSE ON: FALLEN SOLDIER’S EYES

           BACK TO AIRFIELD (PAGE 6)

           HIS POV: FIGURE/RAVENS CAP is JOHN DORIAN. 

           Dorian steps to the side, leading the Gorgon Eye of Keno’s 
           Reaper away. When the coast is clear, Fallen Soldier and two 
           SPECIAL OPS rise from the dead. Wipe off fake blood/sand. 
           Help finish the sabotage.

                                 DORIAN (V.O.)
                        They were my guys. 

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 DORIAN 
                        They’re fine. We used blanks. The 
                        whole thing was staged for Nadr 
                        Shah, a very high value individual.

                                 CRAVE
                        We? You mean Department Thirty? Is 
                        that who set me up?

           Dorian is impressed. 

                                 DORIAN
                        The art of war is deception and 
                        sometimes it’s necessary to deceive 
                        both sides. A terrorist will only 
                        trust someone the CIA doesn’t.

                                 CRAVE
                        I almost died. Does my life mean 
                        nothing to you? 

                                 DORIAN
                        You owed me. 
           Crave looks at Dorian. Dubious.

                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        Uganda. Who do you think delivered 
                        the AKs? And it was almost 
                        impossible to get a C130, but you 
                        had the balls to go back to the 
                        clinic. Where, somehow, for the 
                        next six months, you weren’t killed 
                        or kidnapped. Explain that to me?

                                 CRAVE
                        I was careful. 

                                 DORIAN
                        Come on, man. 

           Crave’s ego suffers a blow. 

                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        In Somalia, the rebels never 
                        breached the walls to your clinic. 
                        Who do you think held them back? 
                             (beat)
                        You have been protected. 

           Crave absorbs the extent to which he's been used. 

                                 CRAVE
                        And Scott Whitman? What happened to 
                        him? 

                                 DORIAN
                        He got the American dream by 
                        preserving it for others. 

                                 CRAVE
                        The American dream, what is that, a 
                        euphemism for funeral?

                                 DORIAN
                        Whitman’s alive. Big house. Big 
                        pool. Sleeping soundly knowing he 
                        is a patriot of the highest order. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Not bad for a counterfeiter. What 
                        about a renowned field surgeon, or 
                        is Department Thirty taking credit 
                        for my reputation, too? 

                                 DORIAN
                        That’s why you’re so valuable. And 
                        now, both of our work is paying 
                        dividends. Nadr Shah has invited 
                        Evan Crave for a sit-down. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DORIAN (CONT'D)
                        An invitation over five years and 
                        nine deceased intelligence officers 
                        in the making.

           Dorian watches as Crave comes to some kind of decision. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Go ahead. Use my name. But I want 
                        it back when you’re done.  
                             (to nurse, Spanish)
                        I’m going to close. 

           The nurse counts sponges and nods to Crave. He begins to 
           close Elle up. Dorian half-smiles. The irony hurts --

                                 DORIAN
                        When you left camp unexpectedly, 
                        you started a chain of events that 
                        landed your photo in Nadr Shah’s 
                        hands. 

                                 CRAVE
                        How was it supposed to work?

           Dorian sits, exhausted by the colossal fuck up to his 
           gorgeous plan.

                                 DORIAN
                        You would have been taken to 
                        safety. My photo would have then 
                        been leaked to the CIA, they would 
                        have put me, as Evan Crave, an 
                        American doctor fed up with the 
                        drone program, on the kill list, 
                        causing Nadr to rise to the bait. 

                                 CRAVE
                        So then it’s all over? 

           Dorian takes a moment to focus himself.

                                 DORIAN
                        I was known as Scalpel. But I 
                        impersonated your background. 

           Dorian shows him a photo on his smart phone of HAFID. 

                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        This is Hafid. 

           EXT. QUARZAZATE - PAST - DAY

           Dorian, longer hair, impersonates Crave as a doctor. He 
           oversees the inoculation of children. Meets HAFID in line. 
           Both walk for a moment to an olive grove.
                                 DORIAN (V.O.)
                        You met in Quarzazate. He wanted a 
                        drone. You told him about one that 
                        crashed in the Sahara. He offered 
                        you money. You didn’t accept.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 DORIAN
                        Hafid is now our asset. He was 
                        shown your photo and vouched for 
                        you. It was all we could do to 
                        salvage the mission. 

                                 CRAVE
                        What do you mean he vouched for me?

                                 DORIAN
                        And this is Jalil. Two weeks ago, 
                        you met in Chefchaoen.

           EXT. CHEFCHAOEN - MOROCCO - PAST - TWILIGHT

           Dorian walks through the blue casbah past a man wrangling 
           goats down an ancient staircase. When the goats are gone, a 
           centuries-old door opens to reveal JALIL.

                                 DORIAN (V.O.)
                        He asked you to infiltrate a 
                        clandestine Moroccan airfield and 
                        infect the drones with a virus.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Crave massages Elle’s legs (prevents blood clots). Tries to 
           charm her out of her anesthesia. She slowly opens her eyes. 
           Crave lifts her like a broken bird. The nurse helps.

                                 DORIAN
                        He offered you $2 million. You 
                        refused, but a week later, you 
                        destroyed all the drones with C4. 
                        He was arrested with a load of 
                        heroin, and is now imprisoned in 
                        Turkey. He won’t be there.

                                 CRAVE
                        Won’t be where? What are you asking 
                        me to do? 

                                 DORIAN
                        Just be yourself. 

           Crave is caught by a growing panic in his throat. 
                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        All we need is for you to lead us 
                        to Nadr Shah. 

           Dorian pulls out a small medical pin. It’s the caduceus 
           staff: Do no harm. 

                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        Tracking device. Walk in, duck when 
                        you hear automatic fire. 

           Crave doesn’t take it. Dorian stuffs it in Crave’s pocket. 
           Elle watches, but can’t speak. She shivers.

                                 CRAVE
                        I can’t do it. 

                                 DORIAN
                        Do what? I’ve done all the heavy 
                        lifting. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m just a doctor. 

                                 DORIAN
                        Who’s been drafted in service to 
                        your country. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Drafted? I’m neutral.

           Dorian looks around the primitive O.R. Picks up a bone saw. 
           Looks at the blade.

                                 DORIAN
                        I respect your work. But I’m 
                        offering you a better job. One 
                        where you can save one thousand. 
                        Two thousand. Ten thousand. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I won’t make it out alive. 

                                 DORIAN
                        You’ll survive because you’re not 
                        one of us. You’re a trojan horse.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                             (to nurse)
                        Keep her warm.  

           Elle reaches for Crave. Grasps him. He squeezes her hand.  

                                 DORIAN
                        Nadr’s men are in the camp. You 
                        want to fight a little. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DORIAN (CONT'D)
                        You’re not quite on their side. At 
                        least, that’s how I played it. 

                                 CRAVE
                        Fuck you. 

                                 DORIAN
                        Walter Reed. We flew in the head of 
                        neurosurgery at Beth Israel and the 
                        best cardiologist from Johns 
                        Hopkins. Your father’s in good 
                        hands. You don’t want that to 
                        change. 

           Crave releases Elle’s hand. Goes to exit... 

           Only to WHIRL and THROW A PUNCH. But his FIST doesn’t 
           connect. Crave sees a BLUR and is SLAMMED against a wall. He 
           recovers. Tries to connect. Kicks. Elbows. All misses.

                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        You are not gonna win a fight 
                        against me. 

                                 ELLE
                        Crave!

           Dorian turns to Elle. Bad move. It’s the break Crave needed. 
           CRACK! He NAILS Dorian with a right to the JAW.

           Dorian steps back. Jarred for a moment. He holds his face. 
           Like a man who hasn’t been punched in a long time. 

           Crave straightens his scrubs. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I didn’t need to win. I just needed 
                        that. 

           Elle tries to speak as Crave exits, but she’s still gripped 
           by anesthesia. 

           INT. CRAVE’S SMALL QUARTERS - DAWN - SOON AFTER

           Crave enters his room. Sits on his bed. Rolls the caduceus 
           pin between fingers. Deciding. He hears the sound of a dog 
           BARKING. Listens on alert. A YELP. Then no more barking.

           BACK IN MEDICAL CLINIC

           The nurse covers Elle with blankets. Elle can barely talk. 

                                 DORIAN
                        Elle. You’re safe. I’m here. 
                                 ELLE (WHISPER)
                        Don’t send him. 

                                 DORIAN
                        The die has already been cast.

                                 ELLE
                        But you’ll have an extraction team, 
                        you’ll save him, right?

           Dorian’s eyes say it all. No.

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        No. No. You’re sending a drone? 

                                 DORIAN
                        If you knew what I knew, Elle... 
                        Nadr has another stadium in his 
                        sights. We don’t know where. But 
                        we’re running out of time.

           Elle is too weak to yell out loud.

                                 ELLE 
                        CRAVE!

           The nurse calms her. Dorian hears ARABIC WHISPERS in a hall. 
           Pulls his gun. Elle tries to rise, but collapses. 

           Dorian peers down a dark hall leading to patient rooms. 
           Nothing stirs. Dorian hits the lights. They’ve been cut!

           BACK IN CRAVE’S QUARTERS

           Crave rolls the caduceus pin in his fingers. Hears Arabic 
           voices outside. Opens a forgotten drawer. Finds a framed 
           photo of his FATHER IN UNIFORM. He clears a space and then 
           displays it. 

           CLOSE ON: HIS FATHER’S RIBBONS.

           Crave decides this is his moment to make a difference. He 
           pins on the caduceus. Stands. Swallows hard. Then he steps 
           out. A lamb to the slaughter.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           NADR’S COMMANDOS smoke hash. Check their guns. Crave enters.

                                 CRAVE (SPANISH)
                        This is a United Nations facility 

           Nadr’s Commandos turn. Crave smiles warmly. They smile back. 
           Then check a photocopy of his picture. Perfect match.
                                 CRAVE (SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        No guns are allowed. I am Dr. Evan 
                        Crave. How can I help you?

           SLAM! Crave is beaten, gagged and DRAGGED OFF. 

           INT. HALLWAY - MEDICAL CLINIC - DAWN

           Dorian steps into a community patient room.  

           A COCA-COLA CAR rolls to him with a LIVE GRENADE riding 
           shotgun. Dorian dives. It BLOWS. WINDOWS SHATTER. DEBRIS 
           RAINS. Dorian ducks through flames. GUN in hand, he BLASTS 
           three Nadr Commandos in as many shots as they burst in. 

           EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Nadr’s Commandos DRAG Crave to the row of 21 waiting black 
           pickups, Lincolns, SUVs. All with tinted windows.

           INSIDE ANONYMOUS SUV

           Nadr Commando smokes. He smiles at Crave and then SLAMS HIM 
           WITH A RIFLE BUTT. Crave is instantly out cold. KO’d.

           BACK IN MEDICAL CLINIC

           Dorian runs back to Elle’s room. The nurse and Hussein have 
           been SHOT DEAD. Elle is gone. Dorian hears cars driving off.

                                 DORIAN

           Crave, under a blanket, strapped to a gurney, IV and heart

           Crave catches a glimpse of first class: SHEIKS enjoying girls 
           in bikinis, music, drugs. It’s like Vegas on a plane. 
           Anesthesiologist wakes. Adjusts Crave’s dose. Crave is out

           has he been out? Where are his clothes? His caduceus pin? 

           The door opens. Two figures enter. Meet KHALID and YUSEF, 
           30s, beast and brawn. Khalid connects a hose to a faucet as 
           Yusef stands behind Crave. Then Khalid:

           SHOVES THE RUNNING HOSE in Crave’s mouth. 

           Yusef holds the hose in. Crave slowly drowns.

           LATER

           Alone, Crave pukes water until he dry heaves. He SHIVERS like 
           a hypothermia victim. 

           INT. HALL - CREECH CONTROL - LAS VEGAS - SOON AFTER

           KENO and his SENSOR OPERATOR (from page 4) enter the hall 
           with “Top Gun” swagger. Ajax eyes them as they stroll past. 
                                 AJAX
                        What’s up with the strut?

           KENO flips off the Nadr Shah wall photo. 

                                 KENO
                        Special Ops is nailing this fucker 
                        today. Huge op going down in Yemen. 
                        And we got a front row seat.

                        Rover on over.

                        Leave me a back door and I will. 

           EXT. RIVER - YEMEN - TWILIGHT - LATER

           SIX APACHE CHOPPERS sweep over the water. The two-crew 
           gunships flex rockets and carry NAVY SEALS RIDING EXTRACTION 
           STYLE on the outside. Secured by straps. Guns at the ready.

           DORIAN is on the lead gunship, also “ridin’ dirty” with the 
           operative known as FALLEN SOLDIER (page 6) on the other side. 
           The Sarawat Mountains loom ahead.  

           ALTERNATE AERIAL POV

           SUN GLINTS off a Reaper 5000 feet above the Apaches.

           INT. CREECH CONTROL - LAS VEGAS - CONTINUOUS

           Ajax ACCESSES Keno’s screen showing the Apaches. Behind him, 
           Tolliver and Haskins watch brave Special Ops “ridin’ dirty” 
           and closing in on a distant Sarawat mountain village.

           EXT. SARAWAT CAVE VILLAGE - YEMEN - NIGHT

           BATTLE-SCARRED HOVELS are built into the mountain. A high 
           cave overlooks a thatchwork of structures that look more like 
           a military training set than a functioning village.

           AT DOOR ONE

           NAVY SEALS wearing GoPro helmet cams BURST into a dwelling: 
           Empty. Neglected. They advance up steep alleys and stairways. 
           KICK IN other doors. All the dwellings are ABANDONED. 

           DORIAN, dressed in high-tech assault gear, follows. His eye 
           on the HIGH CAVE. In his hand: His smart phone screen shows a 
           glowing beacon. Crave and Elle are close. So is Nadr. 
           WHEN CRACK!

           AN INCOMING BULLET STRIKES near the SEALS. Seals DIVE INTO 
           defensive positions. They do not return fire. 

           BACK - INT. TORTURE ROOM - HIGH DESERT CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Khalid speaks Arabic like he’s telling a story that Yusef 
           enjoys. CRAVE STRUGGLES as they approach with the hose. 
           Khalid listens. Did he just hear something outside the room?

           EXT. HIGH CAVE - SARAWAT CAVE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Nadr’s Commandos guard the cave. They don’t see the NAVY 
           SEALS stealth behind them. Their THROATS are CUT. Silently. 

           Dorian holds his bowie knife to the last living Commando’s 
           neck as he prays to Allah. This gives Dorian pause. 

                                 DORIAN (ARABIC)
                        Why are you reciting the Martyr’s 
                        Prayer?

           LAST COMMANDO keeps praying. 

           AT ANCIENT CAVE DOOR

           NAVY SEALS FLANK IT. They attach a DEVICE. Take cover. The 
           door blows back soundlessly.

           INSIDE CAVE

           NAVY SEALS throw SMOKE GRENADES in. LASER SIGHTS crisscross 
           in the mist as they rush in to find: It’s empty. Nadr’s 
           Commandos were protecting...nothing.

           BACK TO DORIAN OUTSIDE CAVE

           Dorian SLITS the last Commando’s throat. Sees a Koran lying 
           at his feet. Realizes: 

                                 DORIAN (CONT’D)
                        AMBUSH! TAKE COVER. 

           INSIDE CAVE

           A NAVY SEAL sees CRAVE’S SCRUBS in a pile on a table. Then he 
           sees the Caduceus pin. FEELS something trigger underfoot. 

           BACK AT CREECH

           Tolliver and Haskins watch on screen as a RED INFERNO 
           explodes from the cave! Ajax slumps in his seat.
                                 AJAX
                        It was a trap. They’re gone.

                        WHERE’S EVAN CRAVE? WHERE’S NADR 
                        SHAH!? 

           Ajax listens in his headset.

                                 AJAX
                        Chatter says they weren’t there.

           Tolliver and Haskins sink in their chairs. Devastated.

           BACK IN TORTURE ROOM

           Khalid and Alex listen. Hear only silence. Khalid continues 
           his story in Arabic as he DROWNS Crave.

                                                                 BLACK.

           INT. TORTURE ROOM - HIGH DESERT CAVE - LATER - TIME UNKNOWN

           Crave, in Islamic pants, sports stubble. Wakes when water is 
           THROWN ON HIM. Khalid and Yusef drag Crave out.

           INT. POLY ROOM - HIGH DESERT CAVE - TIME UNKNOWN

           Crave is fastened to a chair. Weak and dehydrated. Khalid 
           works a POLYGRAPH as Yusef hooks Crave up to the device. 
           Khalid holds up the color red. Speaks accented English.

                                 KHALID
                        Is this the color red?

                                 CRAVE
                        Yes.

                                 KHALID
                        Am I speaking English?

                                 CRAVE
                        Yes. 

           Yusef records Crave’s responses with a pen and paper while 
           Khalid re-calibrates the machine before continuing...

                                 KHALID
                        Is this a pen?

                                 CRAVE
                        Yes. 

                                 KHALID
                        Is your name Evan Crave?
                                 CRAVE
                        Yes.

                                 KHALID
                        Do you work for the CIA?

                                 CRAVE
                        No.

                                 KHALID
                        Do you work for the U.S. military? 

                                 CRAVE
                        No.

                                 KHALID
                        Are you a member of Special 
                        Operations Command?

                                 CRAVE
                        No.

           Khalid holds a photo of General Kantor. 

                                 KHALID
                        Do you work for General Kantor? 

                                 CRAVE
                        No.

           Khalid holds up a PHOTO OF HAFID. Crave stares.

                                 KHALID
                        Do you know him? 

           INT. SURGERY ROOM - SAHARAWI MEDICAL CLINIC - PAST

           Dorian shows him a photo on his smart phone of Hafid.

                                 DORIAN
                        This is Hafid. 

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 KHALID
                        Have you met him?

           Crave thinks about how to answer without lying.

                                 CRAVE
                        His name is Hafid. 

           Nadr Shah enters with Ali. Nadr examines the poly. 

                                 KHALID (ARABIC)
                        He is Evan Crave. A civilian.
           Nadr speaks educated English to Crave. 

                                 NADR
                        Are you a doctor at the Saharawi 
                        Refugee Camp?

                                 CRAVE
                        Yes.

                                 NADR
                        Do you treat traitors?

                                 CRAVE
                        I treat everyone. 

           Nadr nods to Yusef. He pulls a gun. 

           BLOWS ALI’S LOWER JAW OFF. Blood splatters. Ali crumbles. 
           Khalid unbinds Crave, who barely breathes. He stares at Ali’s 
           halved face.

                                 NADR
                             (motions to Ali)
                        Then please treat him.

           Yusef hands Crave an insufficient medical kit. Crave is 
           already doing the ABCs. Ali’s airway is blocked by gore.

                                 CRAVE
                        Hold him down!

           Nadr gestures to Khalid and Yusef, who hold Ali down.

                                 NADR (IN ARABIC TO ALI)
                        I found your account in Panama. One 
                        too many wires from the U.S.

                                 CRAVE
                        Pen. The PEN! 

           Khalid hands it to him. Crave STABS the pen into Ali’s 
           trachea. Ali breathes. Barely. Crave works frantically to 
           stop the blood as Ali stares up at his uncle. 

           Terror in Ali’s DYING EYES. He tries to talk.

                                 NADR (IN ARABIC, PROVERB)
                        The talking is beyond talking. 

           Ali cries. Crave bandages him. Checks his pulse. 

                                 CRAVE 
                        Stable, but he needs a hospital. 

                                 NADR (IN ARABIC TO ALI)
                        You lie to my face, now die without 
                        one.
           Nadr nods to Yusef. He shoots Ali. FACESHOT. 

                                 NADR (CONT’D)
                        He was a traitor.

           Ali’s blood floods the room. His body spastic. Then still.

                                 NADR (ARABIC) (CONT’D)
                        Leave us.

           Yusef and Khalid drag Ali’s body out. Nadr and Crave are left 
           in the bloody room. Crave contains his panic. Poorly.

                                 NADR (CONT’D)
                        Sorry for your treatment. Often I 
                        am greeted by wolves in sheep’s 
                        clothing. 

           He gestures to a sink. Crave washes BLOOD off shaking hands.

                                 CRAVE
                        That’s how this all started. 

                                 NADR
                        This started when your country 
                        stopped fighting just wars and now--
                        just fights wars. 

           Nadr opens a portable DVD player. Nadr presses play.

                        Because you’ll have to. 

           Crave sits in a chair. Exhausted. Covered in blood.

                        Do you know what I want? I want

                        the Jihadis. Every time the U.S. 
                        kills one enemy, it gives birth to

           Nadr shows him a USB port.

                        It is a virus. I am told, once

                        government weeks to get the drone 
                        program back online. Imagine. A 
                        civilian imposed truce. A few weeks 
                        of solace in an undeclared war. A 
                        message of hope from your people to 
                        the people of the Middle East. It’s 
                        what you call a home run. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m not your man. 

           Nadr pulls out a photos of Crave with amputee children. 

                                 NADR
                        You save them. But you never can 
                        quite put them back together, can

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m a doctor. I took an oath. I do 
                        no harm. And that means I don’t 
                        align myself with terrorists.  

                                 NADR
                        How about spies?

           Nadr motions to a draped window. 

           REVEALS ELLE

           Beaten. Bloodied. Looks pale. Khalid holds a running hose. 
           Elle struggles, is FORCE-FED water. She drowns in the torture 
           chamber. Crave BANGS on the window, but she can’t hear him.

                        She failed her poly. 

           Elle passes out. Khalid props her up so she doesn’t choke on 
           her vomit. Then Khalid holds up amputation tools.

                        I won’t kill her. No, she will 
                        experience life, like one of your 
                        patients. Life without her tongue. 
                        Without her hands. Her feet. Her 
                        breasts. No, I won’t kill her. I 
                        will take her apart. Unless...

                        What hospital? A U.N. hospital? 

                                 NADR (REMEMBERS)
                        You don’t know where you are. 

           Nadr leads him through the high desert cave lined with GUARDS 
           in the process of packing or destroying files. He leads Crave 
           to a door. His men open it to a 

           STORM DRAIN TUNNEL.

           It’s lined with Nadr’s men. Devastatingly dark. Crave notices 
           trash. But it’s the BELLAGIO drink cup that unsettles him. He 
           glances at a concrete wall. Sees FALLOUT SHELTER SIGNS. 

                                 NADR (CONT’D)
                        The best place for me to hide is 
                        where they are not allowed to look. 
                        No, the Middle East is so full of 
                        surveillance, I can’t move. But 
                        here, I look like a guy who drives 
                        a taxi or cleans your floors.  

           Nadr walks him to an overlook. Crave looks through slats to:

           THE LAS VEGAS SKYLINE
           In the distance: NEON STRIP: EXCALIBUR, CIRCUS CIRCUS, MGM, 
           MANDALAY BAY, WYNN.

           Nadr has been in the U.S. the entire time.

           Apparently, the high desert cave was a fallout shelter 
           connected to a Nevada drain system. Crave feels very small.

                                 CRAVE
                        How will I get on this base?

                        How did you do it in Morocco?

                                 CRAVE
                        I want to talk to her. 

           INT. ELLE’S CELL - LATER

           Elle reacts to the door opening. She looks up with SWOLLEN 
           EYES. Sees Crave. Clean. Shaved. He just holds her. Khalid 
           and Yusef loom but give them space to talk.

                                 CRAVE
                        They set a trap. There was an 
                        explosion. No one’s coming for us.

                        He’s not dead.

                                 CRAVE
                        I saw it.  

                                 ELLE
                        Did you see his body?

                                 CRAVE
                        He’s gone. We’re on our own.

                                 ELLE
                        I didn’t even know his real name. 

                                 CRAVE
                        John Dorian. 

           Elle softly repeats the name to herself.

                        Nadr made me a deal. 

                                 ELLE
                        No. You’re not one of us. He’ll use 
                        you. You don’t know him. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I know you. 
                                 ELLE
                        Then let me go. 

           Elle moves toward Crave’s lips, but snuggles in his ear. 

                                 ELLE (SPANISH WHISPER) (CONT’D)
                        I speak some Arabic. Are we in 
                        Kuwait? They keep mentioning the 
                        minister of Kuwait. 

           Khalid, concerned about her whispers, pulls Crave back. 

                                 CRAVE
                        We’re in Las Vegas.

                                 ELLE
                        Why? What’s here? What does he 
                        want? No. Don’t do it! 

                                 CRAVE
                        He’ll kill you! 

                                 ELLE
                        I accept it! 

           Crave is dragged out by Khalid. 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Evan.

           She called him by his first name.

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        We are what we do. DO BETTER.

           INT. CREECH CONTROL - LAS VEGAS - MORNING 

           Drained. Ajax and Birdseye replay the NAVY SEAL/YEMEN 
           footage. Explosion on repeat. Relentless. Tolliver and 
           Haskins scan it with clenched fists.

                                 AJAX
                        Sir, we’ve been through it...

                        Try to identify them. Get me a 
                        name. 

           Birdseye returns to the footage of the Six Apaches. Has a 
           clear angle on FALLEN SOLDIER “ridin’ dirty.” 

           He zooms in to get a view of the standard military “name 
           tape” on Fallen Soldier’s uniform. Sees it’s black. Blank. 
                                 AJAX
                        No dice. Black ops. No names. 

           But something sends a chill up Tolliver’s spine.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        Zoom in.

           Birdseye zooms in. And then it hits Tolliver. Like a hammer. 

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Do you have the drone sabotage 
                        footage? Cue it up here.

           Birdseye pulls it up. Displays it on a different screen.  

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        There was a shot of a soldier. 

           Birdseye cues the shot (from page 6). Fallen Soldier is 
           clearly in the first footage AND in the second footage. 

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        It’s the same guy. He wasn’t killed 
                        in Morocco. Look. It’s a hoax. THEY 
                        SET US UP. 

           Haskins tries to catch his drift.

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, they got us twisting in the 
                        wind. Ajax, you ever hear of

                                 AJAX
                        SOCOM guys come in under that 
                        banner, but it’s all hush. 

           Tolliver taps the screen displaying the Apaches.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        Why would Nadr invite Crave in? 
                        Because we were chasing him.

                        silver?

           Tolliver sees a mini toy Vegas slot machine on a desk. Its 
           jackpot screen reads: BAR, BAR, then X. Realization strikes. 
           Tolliver heads to a whiteboard. Writes.
                                 TOLLIVER
                        X is an agent. XX is a double 
                        agent. XXX is a triple agent. 
                        Thirty. Department Thirty deals in 
                        triple agents. What do triple 
                        agents need? A cover identity that 
                        can’t be falsified.

           Haskins follows the math.

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        How many agents have we lost 
                        because the Internet exposed their 
                        covers? How many fake names were 
                        cracked by an online algorithm? 
                        Nothing has hurt the intelligence 
                        community more than a Google

                        They stole Crave’s identity.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        The Pentagon is using civilian 
                        cover identities. That’s how their 
                        agents are infiltrating terrorist 
                        organizations. Crave’s with Nadr. 
                        And if he’s a civilian, he’s in 
                        over his head. We got to find him 
                        before he does something stupid.

           Crave exits. The guard waves the taxi off. The guard eyes 
           Crave. Clean. Shaven. Suited. Military spy.

           INT. HALLWAY - MGM MANSION - SOON AFTER

           Nadr is now dressed as Rafi, complete in head wrap and 
           sunglasses. He exits the room, pretending to be on a CELL 
           PHONE. Secret Service usher him away.

           BACK AT CREECH

           Crave enters the Ground Control building and stares down the 
           hall. Several pilots are gathered around the poster of NADR 
           SHAH. They are defacing it. Crave passes. Pilots eye him. 

           A PILOT puts up his hand on Crave’s shoulder. 

                                 CRAVE (UNDER BREATH)

                        Never saw you. But give him hell.

           Crave winks. Walks down the hallway. Turns left.  

           EMPTY HALLWAY

           Crave pauses. Sweats. Jesus. He moves on down the Kubrick 
           hallway of doors. Crave looks for an empty room. Peers into 

           CONTROL ROOM EIGHT 

           Tolliver and Haskins scan screens of North African border 
           crossings as AJAX and BIRDSEYE adjust angles. 

           Crave moves on. Finds a deserted room and enters

           CONTROL ROOM ELEVEN

           Crave enters. Takes a pilot’s seat. Turns on the computer.  
           Pulls out the paper. Types in a username and PASSWORD. No 
           dice. Keys another. Nothing. Types another. Access granted! 
           He sees flight software start up. 

           Crave takes out the USB. Hesitates. Then inserts it. Nothing 
           happens for a moment. The computer freezes. Then CODE FLOODS 
           THE SCREEN. Crave pulls out the cell. Dials. Someone answers.

           A van stops. Elle is pushed to the sidewalk. She appears 
           beaten. Ragged. Looks up. Sees freedom. Yusef snaps a photo 
           from the van. SENDS IT. Then chucks the phone to her.

           AT CRAVE
           He gets a text. Sees Elle’s photo. Safe.

           Elle suffers what looks to others like a psychotic episode. 
           HOSPITAL AIDES approach.

           They grab and contain Elle. She resists. CLOSE ON: HYPO 
           biting into her arm. Instant chemical restraint. 

           BACK TO CRAVE

           Crave looks at the screen. The CODE STOPS SCROLLING. Text 
           flashes: “SIPRNet firewall accessed. Initiating override.”

           Crave reacts. Types into the keyboard to stop it. Nothing. 

           He yanks out the USB. Nothing. Too late. Crave pushes back 
           from the screen. SHAKEN. Something is terribly wrong. This is 
           no simple virus. 

           It’s a takeover. 

           Crave RUSHES from the room. Meanwhile:

           Nadr grabs the agent’s headset and pushes him in a stall.

           Tolliver sees an open emergency exit door. 

           AT TARMAC

           MORE PERSONNEL flood onto the airfield. The drones begin 
           firing. Hellfire missiles and short-range rockets turn Creech 
           AFB into a modern day desert Pearl Harbor:

           down, one by one. The sky is an exploding goat fuck.

           BACK AT TARMAC

           AIRMEN carry a few wounded men as Tolliver and Haskins run 
           into the BURNING WAR ZONE. Tolliver sees him first: 

           EVAN CRAVE on the tarmac, tending to an AIRMAN’S bleeding 
           arm. Tolliver TRAINS HIS GUN on Crave.

                                 CRAVE
                        Kuwait. Minister of Kuwait. That’s 
                        all I know.

                                 TOLLIVER
                             (to Haskins)
                        Check Diplomatic Secret Service. 

           Haskins mans his phone. We can’t hear what he says. 

                                 CRAVE
                        He was going to kill her. 

           Crave realizes the futility of explanation. He raises his 
           hands. Surrender.

                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        I was set up. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        So were we. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m not a terrorist. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        But you are now.  

           Tolliver watches Reapers get SHOT DOWN OVERHEAD. He sees TWO 
           OF THEM GET AWAY and arrow toward the VEGAS STRIP. 

           Tolliver’s expression: Worst is yet to come.

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Where are they headed?

                                 CRAVE
                        I don’t know. He said it was a 
                        virus to shut down the drones. But 
                        it was something else.

           Haskins interrupts --

                                 HASKINS
                        Sheik Rafi Amin. Minister of 
                        Kuwait. Mechanical. He’s still 
                        here. McCarran Airport, Gate 43. 
                        And get this, they just found a 
                        body in his MGM suite.
                                 TOLLIVER
                        Warn DSS. We need him alive. We 
                        need to know where the Reapers are 
                        headed. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’m the last person who’s seen him. 
                        I can identify him. Please.

           Tolliver USHERS CRAVE OFF THE TARMAC and to an Escalade.

           An ESCALADE chews asphalt. A siren FLASHES ON THE DASH.

           INSIDE ESCALADE

           Crave, in loose cuffs, sits in the back as Tolliver and 
           Haskins man their phones, drive and contain their panic.

                             (to Crave)
                        Did Nadr have laptops? Flight crew? 
                        Hackers? Satellites?

                                 CRAVE

                        Is that him?

           Nadr escapes off-screen, presumably to a car. 

           BACK IN ESCALADE

           Haskins holds his laptop up to Crave. The screen displays a 
           FREEZE-FRAME of Nadr at the airport. Haskins hits play. Crave 
           sees Yusef and Khalid in the SUV BEFORE NADR EXITS THE FRAME. 

                                 CRAVE
                        There. Those are his guys.

           Nadr drives. Yusef and Khalid load Uzis. Nadr’s cell is on

           The Escalade drives past sandy and barren North Vegas when 
           Crave sees DUST SWIRL. Is that a WHITE SUV? It disappears 
           near a drainage system. Reappears when it CRESTS a HILL.

                                 CRAVE
                        There! White SUV. North. This is 
                        where we were kept. He knows this 
                        area.

           The Escalade turns abruptly. Tires SPIT SAND as it bounds 
           OFFROAD. Haskins pulls out TWO M16s and a duffle of ammo. 

           BACK AT DODGER STADIUM

           KISS CAM: Couples smooch. Cameramen rush to a MALE FAN who 
           gets on his knee. He pulls out a small box.

           JUMBOTRON READS: WILL YOU MARRY ME? Female Fan nods yes. The

           INT. WHITE SUV - NEVADA - CONTINUOUS

           Nadr glances in his rearview. Sees a DUST SWIRL. Evidence of 
           a tail. He nods to Khalid, who unrolls the window. Sits on 
           the door frame, Arab Spring style, and aims his UZI. 

           INT. TOLLIVER’S ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

           The Escalade SLALOMS by sandtraps, ATV ruts. But the White

           Tolliver and Haskins are on their cell headsets. 
                                 TOLLIVER (CELL)

                        roads to the border. 

           Tolliver ends the call. Gets someone on speed dial.

           Screens show possible DRONE TARGETS along the West Coast as 
           an ALARM SOUNDS in the background. Kantor picks up a secure 
           line, his eyes glued to the command center screens. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN TOLLIVER AND KANTOR

                                 TOLLIVER
                        You fucked up, Kantor. You see, 
                        this is what happens when the 
                        Pentagon runs intelligence. 
                        Civilians die. 

           Kantor exhales hard. 

                                 KANTOR
                        An attack on U.S. soil by its own 
                        drones will destroy the program.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        It will destroy a helluva lot more 
                        than the goddamn program. Where are 
                        the rogue drones now?

                                 KANTOR
                        Two MQ-9 Reapers were spotted over 
                        Apple Valley, California. Does 
                        Crave know where they’re headed?

                                 TOLLIVER
                        No. We got to knock out their 
                        ground control. Do you have drones 
                        operating over the Middle East?

           TOLLIVER crests a hill 

           ...AMBUSH...

           WHITE SUV faces them. BULLETS bite into the Escalade. 

           Crave ducks. Haskins NAILS Khalid. But takes one in the neck. 
           Windshield blown. Tolliver is RIDDLED. Crave watches BULLETS 
           CHEW through upholstery. TEAR into flesh. Hopeless. 
           THEN THE BULLETS STOP.

           The sound of the SUV TAKING OFF. 

           Crave surveys the damage: He’s hit in the shoulder. Still 
           cuffed. Then hears Haskins’ death rattle. He sees Tolliver is 
           BLEEDING. Injured but saved by the bulletproof vest under his 
           suit.

           Crave pulls Tolliver from the driver’s seat. Helps him to the 
           backseat and then climbs in behind the wheel. 

                                 TOLLIVER (CONT’D)
                        HASKINS. Oh God. Oh shit.

           Crave drives with CUFFED hands. The Escalade KICKS UP a plume 
           of sand over Khalid’s body and FISHTAILS in pursuit. 

           EXT. CAMPSITE - SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS - SOON AFTER

           A boy remotes a toy R/C plane over a hill. It disappears. The

           A REAPER DRONE AS IT SCREAMS by overhead. The boy stares. 

           EXT. WHITE SUV - NORTH VEGAS - SOON AFTER

           Nadr careens up an incline as Yusef hangs out of the 
           passenger’s side window. His Uzi SCANS FOR A TARGET. 

           AT CRAVE

           He takes a straightaway below the SUV. Picks up speed. Sand 
           BILLOWS. He RODEOS UPHILL at the SUV, spewing smoke and oil. 

           The Escalade SLAMS the SUV. Yusef DROPS HIS UZI and tries to 
           hold on. But he slips between the vehicles. Nadr SIDESWIPES 
           the Escalade anyway: SPLAT!

           Crave PULLS EVEN with the Escalade. 

                                 CRAVE (TO NADR)
                        Where are they headed?! 

           Nadr FIRES at Crave. Crave ducks. Pulls a Fiat deja vu and: 

           -- YANKS the brake. WHIPS the wheel. 

           -- The Escalade slides into a REVERSE 180.

           The Escalade now races BACKWARD beside the White SUV so Crave 
           and Nadr stare at each other. Sixty miles an hour over desert 
           washouts. DOORJAMB TO DOORJAMB. Facing opposite directions!   

           Driving blind. Crave SLAMS HIS DRIVER’S DOOR into Nadr’s semi-
           auto just as it OPENS FIRE. Gunfire RIPS Nadr’s roof. 
                                 CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Where are the drones headed?!

           Crave SWIPES the SUV. Nadr over-corrects and the SUV FLIPS. 
           The IMPACT hurls Nadr from the SUV. Both cars roll to a STOP. 

           Crave exits. Runs. Wobbles. BLOOD DRIPPING. 

           AT NADR: He’s a crumpled mess. Head wound. Bloody.

           Wounded Tolliver STAGGERS over with a GUN. Stands over Nadr. 

                                 NADR
                        After ten years playing games in 
                        the Middle East, the U.S. will 
                        experience another home game of 
                        epic proportion. 

           Tolliver sees a CELL in the sand. (The one Nadr used to call 
           the YEMEN LAIR.) Nadr DIVES for it. Tolliver beats him to it.

                                 TOLLIVER
                        You called them. Didn’t you? You 
                        called your ground control.

           Tolliver hands CRAVE THE GUN and heads back to the Escalade. 
           He searches for his cell. Puts it to his ear. 

                                 TOLLIVER (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Kantor. Yeah, I’m fucking still 
                        here. I have Nadr’s cell! 

           He connects Nadr’s phone to Haskins’ blood splattered laptop.

                                 TOLLIVER (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Piggyback into Haskins’ laptop. 
                        Read it. Nadr called his ground 
                        control. Last call was placed to 
                        YEMEN. Here’s the number.

           BACK AT CRAVE

           Nadr throws sand at Crave’s face and ATTACKS. The gun spins 
           free. Nadr SNATCHES it. They grapple until Crave CHOKES him 
           out with CUFFED HANDS. Nadr DROPS THE GUN. Crave dives for 
           it. Grabs it and AIMS.

                                 NADR
                        Do no harm.

           Crave sees the moment for what it is. It’s his moment to make 
           a real difference. HE SHOOTS NADR IN THE HEAD. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I just did. 

           Crave turns to Tolliver. But he’s passed out. 
           Crave drops to his knees like an exhausted marathon runner. 
           Emotionally spent. Takes in the infinite horizon. Breathes.

                                 TRANSLATOR (MIMICS NADR)
                        Can you see the target?

                                 JOYSTICK ONE (O.S., ARABIC)
                        It is almost at Dodger Stadium. 
                        Decelerating to drop payload.

           Translator writes “Dodger Stadium” on a piece of paper. Hands 
           it over. Kantor reacts 

           AS

           The GPS screen finally LOCKS ON THE LOCATION IN YEMEN.

                                 TRANSLATOR (MIMICS NADR)
                        Will you pray with me, brother?

           BACK AT TECHNO LAIR

           Joystick One prays. Followed by others. 
           EST. GULF OF OMAN - CONTINUOUS

           OLD GLORY, BIG AND BOLD waves from the USS RAMAGE. SIRENS 
           BLARE as a missile TURRET calibrates. Written on the turret: 
           “To Terrorists, with love. The United States.” 

           Boom! A TOMAHAWK rockets into the air. Then another. 

           BACK AT DODGER STADIUM

           The DRONE ZEROS the “crown of L.A.” in its crosshairs. 

           BACK AT TECHNO LAIR

           Joystick Terrorists finish the prayer. On their screens: 
           DODGER STADIUM. Joystick One moves his finger over the FIRING 
           BUTTON -- WHEN A SOUND BUILDS LIKE A JET MAKING A LOW PASS. 

           EXT. TECHNO LAIR - CONTINUOUS

           BOOOOOOOM! The Tomahawks strike and erupt. The techno lair 
           INCINERATES IN A FIREBALL.

           INT. CREECH GROUND CONTROL - LAS VEGAS - CONTINUOUS

           Ajax watches his screen boot to life. SEES DODGER STADIUM.  

                                 AJAX
                        Got visual. Hijack link is down. 
                        Reapers returning to home position. 

           PILOTS AND SENSOR OPERATORS REJOICE!

           BACK AT DEPARTMENT THIRTY

           Screens depict the BURNING TECHNO LAIR. Like soldiers fresh 
           from battle, Kantor and his staff finally sit down. 

           They celebrate with nothing more than a deep breath.

           BACK AT DODGER STADIUM

           The DRONES BANK OVER THE STADIUM as they’re recalled. Fans, 
           players look up like it’s a planned patriotic moment.

           AERIAL VIEW OF ESCALADE - VEGAS DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Crave works on wounded Tolliver as a HELICOPTER APPROACHES. A 
           breathtaking desert skyline bleeds into the fading horizon.

                                                               FADE OUT
           EXT. PENTAGON - NIGHT

           The 9/11 memorial glows. Lit up like a beacon.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - PENTAGON - NIGHT

           General Kantor sits across from Crave, who wears a bandage. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I just want my name back. 

                                 KANTOR
                        It’s not yours anymore. It belongs 
                        to Department Thirty. 

           Kantor closes an Evan Crave file. Crave hangs his head. His 
           old life gone forever. 

                                 KANTOR (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. We’ll find you a nice 
                        position stateside. You have my 
                        word. You’ll be doing good work. 

           Crave finally levels his chin. There's now a different look 
           in his eye. Something building. A new purpose. 

                                 CRAVE
                        And I want my work to matter. 

                                 KANTOR
                        It will. But what matters most is 
                        that you protect Department Thirty. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I’ll protect it. But it costs me. 
                        The kids at the camp are expecting 
                        me to return with soccer balls. 

                                 KANTOR
                        How many?

           Crave finally gets to one-up Kantor.

                                 CRAVE
                        And a CT Scan. And Meningitis 
                        vaccines. Generators.

                                 KANTOR (SIGHS)
                        Send me a list. 

           Kantor hands him a new ID. It reads “DREW TAYLOR.”

                                 CRAVE
                        Have you found her? I don’t want to 
                        disappear without saying goodbye.
                                 KANTOR
                        Facial Rec couldn’t ID her from the 
                        hospital surveillance. There is no 
                        operative named Elle on file. 

                                 CRAVE
                        I feel like you’re lying to me. 

                                 KANTOR
                        Well, it’s not personal. 

           Kantor notices two people approaching his office.

                                 KANTOR (CONT’D)
                        Here they are.

           Tolliver (crutches) and SECRETARY OF DEFENSE REYNOLDS, 60, 
           distinguished and decorated, arrive. 

                                 TOLLIVER
                        Evan Crave, this is the Secretary 
                        of Defense, George Reynolds. 

           Reynolds shakes his hand. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        On behalf of SOCOM and the CIA, we 
                        award you the highest decoration in 
                        the intelligence service, the 
                        Distinguished Intelligence Cross.

           Crave holds the medal in his hand. Thumbs its gold sheen.

                                 KANTOR
                        Please accept this award for your 
                        voluntary act of extraordinary 
                        heroism and exemplary valor in life 
                        threatening conditions. 

           Crave is at a loss for words. And then: He’s even more 
           surprised WHEN Reynolds takes the medal back. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        As Department Thirty and now Evan 
                        Crave are top secret, no record of 
                        this award will exist.

                                 KANTOR
                        We’ll keep it on file for you. 
                        Thank you for your service. 

           Crave is stunned. Who are these guys?

           INT. PATIENT ROOM - WALTER REED - D.C. - LATER - NIGHT

           GORDON CRAVE sleeps. Still wears his USS COLE baseball cap. 
           Crave enters. Scans his chart. Flips through it. Then sees 
           TEN FRAMED PHOTOS OF HIMSELF at various ages placed around 
           his father’s room. Some include his dad in a NAVAL UNIFORM.

           His father wakes. He grabs Crave’s hand, tries to sit up. He 
           motions for Crave to come closer. 

                                 GORDON CRAVE
                        An Agent Tolliver came by.

           Crave’s father slurs like a stroke victim. 

                                 GORDON CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        Told me about your award. 
                             (pause)
                        That’s like the Medal of Honor. 

           Crave’s father cries. Crave chokes back tears.

                                 GORDON CRAVE (CONT’D)
                        He couldn’t tell me what you did. 
                        But he said it was important.
                             (beat)
                        I love you, son.

                                 CRAVE
                        I love you, too.

           Crave grips his father’s hand.

           EXT. MEDICAL CLINIC - SAHARAWI REFUGEE CAMP - SAHARA - DAY

           A C130 does a fly by. CARE PACKAGES float under parachutes. 
           NUSRAT watches a net of soccer balls land nearby. 

           PULL BACK to a sky of floating crates over the camp. Crave’s 
           version of desert rain. Children CHEER. 

           INT. JOHN MUIR MEDICAL CENTER - WALNUT CREEK, CA - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: SIX MONTHS LATER

           Crave, now DREW TAYLOR, is dressed in scrubs. He approaches 
           DR. GROSS, 50, snob, texting.

                                 CRAVE AS DREW TAYLOR
                        Dr. Gross, I’m Drew Taylor. Your 
                        tech for today’s appendectomy. 

           Dr. Gross doesn’t looks up. Keeps texting. Walks away.

                                 DR. GROSS
                        That doesn’t make us friends. 

           Crave stands in the hall. Ignored. 
           IN OPERATING ROOM - LATER

           Dr. Gross works on a patient. Nurses surround him. Crave, on 
           the far outside, is tasked only with handing out scalpels. 

           IN CAFETERIA - LATER

           Crave watches a soundless TV. The news plays the latest 
           terrorist attack in Mali. Crave touches the BRACELET on his 
           wrist. Made by Nusrat. The only reminder of his old life.

           EXT. BUS STOP - NEAR HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

           Crave, in scrubs, waits for a bus. An empty Coca-Cola can in 
           the gutter. He picks it up when an ESCALADE pulls over. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, do you know where the 
                        restaurant, Centemani is? 

                                 CRAVE
                        Never heard of it. 

           Crave ignores the car. 

           Until he places the voice. 

           He looks in and then sees her: ELLE. The moment is palpable.

                                 ELLE
                        It’s in Istanbul, Evan. 

           Elle hands him a passport. 

           He opens it. Reads “Evan Crave.” 

                                 ELLE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to have dinner? I 
                        made us a reservation.

                                 CRAVE (PASSPORT)
                        Did you get my name back? 

                                 ELLE
                        For a week. Maybe two. One of 
                        Dorian’s assets is looking for 
                        Scalpel. Department Thirty needs 
                        your help.

           Crave considers her.

                                 CRAVE
                        That the only reason you’re here? 

           Elle doesn’t answer. Crave walks back to the bus stop. 
           But only to get his backpack. Elle smiles. 

           INSIDE CAR

           Crave buckles up. Their eyes meet . . . 

                                 ELLE
                        Are you ready to be Evan Crave 
                        again?

           Beat.

                                 CRAVE
                        I never stopped. 

           The look on his face says it all: Bring it on -- 

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
