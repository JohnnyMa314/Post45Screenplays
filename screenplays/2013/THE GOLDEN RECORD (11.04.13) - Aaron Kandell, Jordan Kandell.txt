           Stark, framed by black. Just a podium with NASA’s iconic logo. 
           And a WOMAN (65) who shyly takes the mic. Gathers herself like 
           a lighthouse awaiting a storm. Then looks up... right at US.

                                 WOMAN
                        Many believe that science kills 
                        romance. That the search for truth 
                        diminishes our world of wonder. I 
                        know because I once shared this view. 
                        But that was before I met Carl.

           She breaks off, a private moment of reflection. Who she is and 
           where we are remain a mystery. All we know is she is beautiful 
           impassioned, eloquent. When she speaks it’s like a confession.

                                 WOMAN 
                        We can’t circle back, but we can 
                        remember. Time is not a wheel but a 
                        heartbeat. Everything we made and 
                        everything we lost. This is my 
                        memory, but it’s about something 
                        more: a mission. A golden record. And 
                        the greatest love I know.

           She stares into camera. And as she slowly smiles...
                                                       FADE TO:

           PROFOUND DARKNESS

           Punctuated by ten thousand pinpoints of light. A sprawling 
           kaleidoscope of suns, worlds, stars, at the center of which--

           OUR PALE BLUE DOT

           Glimmers like a precious jewel. Fifty million miles out it’s 
           smaller than a marble. All life, all history, our entire world 
           nothing more than a sapphire speck on the vast cosmic ocean.

           AND PULLING BACK

           We realize it’s really A REFLECTION in the metal of an antique 
           spaceship. VIKING 1. Its name inscribed below a American flag.  

                                 A VOICE (CARL’S)
                        Are we alone in the universe?

           The Viking orbiter spins, revealing MARS: red sand seas 
           beckoning below. A probe detaches; begins a fiery descent.

                                 THE VOICE
                        Today we take a giant leap toward 
                        answering mankind’s biggest question.
           Safely through the martian atmosphere, a mushroom parachute 
           opens and a VW bus sized lander separates from its aeroshell. 
           Retrorockets slow the lander’s final approach to the surface.

                                 THE VOICE
                        Will we find life on other worlds?

           TOUCHDOWN! Viking 1 settles like a leaf onto alien soil: man’s 
           1st mark on a planet not our own. A robotic camera snaps a 
           PHOTO. An antenna aims at the distant dust mote we call Earth.

           A PRIMETIME NEWS BROADCAST 

           Of 41 year old CARL SAGAN: in trademark turtleneck sweater,  
           broadcasting from NASA Mission Control. Hair sideswept across 
           his prominent forehead, thick eyebrows accentuating his almost 
           boyish, unconventional good looks. VOICE like a rolling wave.

                                 CARL
                        The images you are seeing now are the 
                        first ever from the surface of Mars. 

           A second shot of the Red Planet FILLS FRAME. Flickering as--

           INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           TIMOTHY FERRIS (32) leans in and SLAPS the side of his 1976 
           trinitron TV. Suited up in a tux, Tim is the dashing Science 
           Editor for Rolling Stone. He fast-scrawls notes on a flip-pad. 

                                 TIM
                        Ann, are you seeing this?

           ANN DRUYAN: aspiring author, activist and absolute knockout 
           with Farah Fawcett hair enters, checking her watch. A woman in 
           a man’s world she owns herself completely; holds nothing back. 

                                 ANN
                        What’s with Carl Sagan and the 
                        turtlenecks? Seriously, it’s May.

                                 TIM
                        I finally land an exclusive with the 
                        most famous scientist in the world 
                        and you’re stuck on his sweater?    

           He cranes to watch the TV but Ann blocks his view.
        New York Times, July 20, 1976

                        You’re making me meet your parents, 
                        don’t make me look bad being late.

                                 TIM
                        You look great.

           He takes her in his arms and kisses her. Simultaneously 
           maneuvering her ever so subtly so he can still see the set. 

                                 ANN
                        You know in Eskimo culture it’s a 
                        criminal act to kiss with eyes open. 

                                 TIM
                        If that were true they’d have a lot 
                        more broken noses. Seriously though--

           He rubs his nose lightly against hers, an Eskimo kiss.

                                 TIM
                        I need to cover this for my magazine.

                                 ANN
                        But first you’ve got a deadline with 
                        me. C’mon, Sagan isn’t going anywhere- 

           She drags him out the door. As it shuts we push INTO THE TV... 
           video growing larger, more vibrant; Carl shedding pixels, 
           COMING TO LIFE as we morph right through the screen into-- 

           INT. NASA’S JET PROPULSION LAB (JPL) - PASADENA

           The brain center of NASA Mission Control. Carl stands before a 
           CBS News crew, overlooking a room of jubilant scientists.

                                 CARL
                        Mark this moment: July 20th, 1976. 
                        The day man for the first time 
                        reached another world: our closest 
                        neighbor in a vast cosmos. From NASA 
                        mission control, I’m Carl Sagan. 

           The cameras go dark. The instant he’s off-air the room erupts: 
           champagne, applause and handshakes all around. Carl’s team 
           rush in to congratulate him, but he heads past them, to lift-- 

           NICK SAGAN: his precocious, 6 year old son. A mini-Carl.

                                 CARL
                        There’s my little spaceman. Tell me, 
                        Copernicus what do you think of Mars?

                                 NICK
                        It looks like Arizona. 
           Carl laughs, flies his son around like a rocket.

                                 NICK
                        And where’s all the Martians?

                                 CARL
                        We only just landed! We’ll find them. 

                                 NICK
                        And what if they eat your ship, dad?

                                 CARL
                        We’ll take a picture of them doing 
                        it. Which will prove they exist.

           He locks eyes with the one man in the room not celebrating...

           MEET BRUCE MURRAY 

           JPL’s Mission Director and Carl’s most outspoken critic.

                                 BRUCE
                        You should teach your son real 
                        science, Sagan, not science fiction. 
                        You keep telling everyone we’ll find 
                        life on Mars, you only set them up 
                        for disappointment.

                                 CARL
                        You don’t know that we won’t, Bruce.

                                 BRUCE
                        There’s no evidence yet that we will.
                        Life beyond Earth is a lovely idea, 
                        but that’s all it is. An idea. 

                                 CARL
                        Like putting a man on the moon? Like 
                        landing on Mars?

           He points to the images just coming in from the Mars lander.

                                 CARL
                        It’s the craziest, most impossible 
                        ideas that tend to change our world.

                                 BRUCE
                        Passion is one thing, Carl, but don’t 
                        let your obsession ruin you. Because 
                        NASA won’t be there when you fall.

           He masks his threat with a smile that does nothing to hide the 
           rivalry. LINDA SALZMAN, Carl’s bombshell blonde wife, cuts in.
        The New Yorker, June 20th, 1976. 
                                 LINDA
                        Sorry to break up the festivities, 
                        but Carl’s running late for Carson.

           Before Carl can argue further, she pulls him and Nick away.

                                 CARL
                        Just as the gloves were coming off.

                                 LINDA
                        What would you do without me?

                                 CARL
                        Win more arguments probably.

                                 LINDA
                        As brilliant as you are, it’s unwise 
                        to win every battle. Especially 
                        against your boss. 

           Like a dog to a higher pitch, Carl hears her tone’s subtlety.

                                 CARL
                        We talking about Bruce or you and me?

                                 LINDA
                        With me you’re always losing.

           She shoves a schedule into his hands and marches him out an 
           exit to a waiting limo. As they climb in the CAMERA PANS PAST--

           EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - MATCH-CUT 

           And continues panning to the other end of the limo -- where 
           Ann and Tim climb out: LA morphed to NYC. Ann grins at Tim.

                                 ANN
                        So this is why we’re all glammed up.

           She heads for the marquee but Tim blocks her. He’s nervous. 

                                 TIM
                        Annie, I need to tell you something.

           He never calls her Annie. And she knows instantly:

                                 ANN
                        We’re not meeting your parents. 

           Tim shakes his head. Ann is NOT pleased.

                                 ANN
                        So why the hell did you drag me here!
                                 TIM
                        I asked the driver to take us to the 
                        most romantic place in New York, but 
                        since he didn’t speak English--    

           He pulls out a ring. Actually more like a large pebble bound 
           by rusty paperclips into a sort of DIY band. Ann stares at it. 

           What the hell is that?

                                 TIM
                        It’s the biggest rock I could find.  

           He slips it on her finger as a sewer vent billows smog nearby.

                                 TIM
                        I think we should get married.

           You’re kidding.

                                 TIM
                        I’m serious.

           You’re proposing next to a sewer.

                                 TIM
                        You want me to get on one knee?

           He starts to bend down but Ann quickly pulls him back up.

                                 ANN
                        I don’t want any more fumes going to 
                        your head.

                                 TIM
                        I mean it Annie, marry me. I know 
                        it’s only been a year but honestly--

           He points at himself like a game show hostess would a prize.

                                 TIM
                        Who are you gonna find that’s better? 

                                 ANN
                        Boy you really know how to sweep a 
                        girl off her feet.

           Tim takes the cue. Hefting her ungracefully into his arms.

                                 TIM
                        Did I forget to mention I love you.

           He leans in for the kiss but she stops his lips with her hand.

                                 TIM
                        Is that a no?
           She looks into his eyes, a long contemplative beat. 

                                 ANN
                        No.

                                 TIM
                        To the marriage or--

           She kisses him.

                                 ANN
                        No to the “no”.

           Tim laughs relieved. Twirls her. Romantic despite the setting.

                                 ANN
                        Now please carry me away from here.  
                        It smells like shit.

           Lips locked he hauls her back into the limo as we SWITCH BACK--

           INT. LIMO - HOLLYWOOD 

           To Linda and Carl. Who’s gazing deep in thought at the stars 
           twinkling to life outside his window, Nick asleep in his lap.

                                 LINDA 
                        If you can pull your head out of the 
                        clouds I could use you here on Earth.

           Linda rolls his window up, opens his overambitious schedule.

                                 LINDA
                        Our redeye gets into JFK at 8. You’re 
                        meeting Random House at 10. Here’s 
                        the manuscript to proof on the plane.

           She gives him his unbound book: The Dragons of Eden.

                                 LINDA 
                        After that you’ve an interview for 
                        Rolling Stone. And PBS wants a time 
                        to discuss the Cosmos miniseries.

                                 CARL
                        Schedule it for when we return to LA.

                                 LINDA
                        And your family... when’s a good time 
                        to pencil them in?

           Carl sighs. Rubs his forehead, suddenly very tired.

                                 CARL
                        I was right, you are mad at me.
                                 LINDA
                        No I’m exhausted. And lonely. If you 
                        aren’t crusading for NASA, you’re off 
                        writing your next opus, teaching too 
                        many classes at Cornell, or booked on 
                        TV. There’s no space for Nick or me.

                                 CARL
                        Everything I do is for you and Nick. 
                        That’s why you’re here with me. 

           He ruffles his sleeping son’s hair. Linda’s a pot on high heat-

                                 LINDA
                        As your secretary, maid, editor, 
                        chef... everything BUT your wife.

           Carl cups her face, a tender moment, genuine and heartfelt.

                                 CARL
                        You’re my gravity. 

                                 LINDA
                        Then why does it feel like we’re out 
                        of orbit?

           The limo pulls to a stop outside The Tonight Show studio. 

                                 CARL
                        I’ll do better. Tell me what you need-

           He takes her hand, calmly. She's simmering. So much unsaid...

                                 LINDA
                        (instead)
                        Go on, you can’t be late for Carson.

           Carl slides to the door. Pauses. Leans back and kisses Linda, 
           cold, cursory. And as he opens the door and exits--

           INT. TIM’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Another door SLAMS open, and Tim stumbles in. Still carrying 
           Ann. Still passionately kissing. She full-body straddles him. 
           Two bound magnets. Mouths melted together. Clothes coming off. 
           They fall backwards over the couch, out of view, to the floor.

        Carl on Carson in 1978. A regular guest, he appeared 26 times between 1973-1986. 
           JOHNNY CARSON enters in black turtle neck and Carl Sagan wig. 

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        (a spot-on impersonation)
                        Why thank you, Ed. Good to be back.

                                 ED MCMAHON
                        Is it possible, doctor, to sum up 
                        briefly the vastness of the universe?

                                 JOHNNY CARSON
                        (stressing each syllable)
                        The universe is made up of billions 
                        and biiiillyuns of galaxies...

           Tim’s head appears as the audience bursts into laughter.

                                 TIM
                        I have to write this into my article.

           He reaches for a pen. Ann’s hand rises, pulls Tim back down.

                                                   SMASH TO BLACK
           INT. TIM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Light streams in. Tim awakes on the floor. Sits up to find Ann 
           in a suit, clacking away at a typewriter. 

                                 TIM
                        Morning man pants. You’re up early. 

                                 ANN
                        Or late. Since I didn’t sleep at all.

           She slams the last key. Triumphantly yanks the page out and 
           drops it with a flourish on top an unbound manuscript. It’s 
           the title page to her first novel: A Famous Broken Heart. 

                                 TIM
                        Is that...

                                 ANN
                        I finally finished it. My 1st novel. 
                        Feels like I just summited Everest.

                                 TIM
                        And how’s the view?

           She grins down at him on the floor. 

                                 ANN
                        Disappointing. 

           He laughs, pulls her in as she gathers her purse and keys.
                                 TIM
                        What’s the rush I don’t work till 10. 

                                 ANN
                        It’s 11. And I’m late for my big 
                        publisher’s meeting.

                                 TIM
                        I thought you said it was next week.

                                 ANN
                        I said that last week now it’s today. 

                                 TIM
                        Don’t worry they’re gonna love it.

                                 ANN
                        Not everyone’s as easily seduced as 
                        you. You interviewing Sagan today?

                                 TIM
                        Tonight at Nora’s. Come with me.

                                 ANN
                        I can’t. I’m on double-shift at the 
                        bookstore, then the museum.

                                 TIM
                        Reschedule. I really want you to meet 
                        Carl. He’s the most--

                                 ANN
                        Incredible man you’ve ever met. I 
                        know. I’ll see if I can make it.

           She kisses him quickly on the lips, like a manic hummingbird.
                                 TIM
                        That’s all I get?

                                 ANN
                        You’ve got me forever, what more do 
                        you want?

           She kisses him again, this time on the cheek. He goes for more 
           but Ann’s already fluttering out the door. As it closes--

                                 TIM
                        There goes the future Miss Timothy 
                        Ferris TITAN of the literary world!

           EXT. RANDOM HOUSE TOWER - NYC - DAY

           PAN DOWN from the banner on the world’s largest publishing 
           house to find Carl and Linda swinging Nick between them.
                                 CARL
                        Ok Nicarus, I need my arms back now.

                                 NICK
                        (clinging to him)
                        Can’t I come to your meeting, Dad?

                                 CARL
                        I’d rather go with you, FAO Schwartz 
                        is way more fun than publisher notes.

                                 NICK
                        Why, they gonna tear you a new one?

           Carl shoots Linda a look: who taught him that?

                                 LINDA
                        See what happens when you’re away, he 
                        spends too much time with Frank.

           She means Frank Drake, Carl’s best friend who we’ll soon meet.

                                 LINDA
                        You sure you want to do this book?

                                 CARL
                        You still think it’s a risk?

                                 LINDA
                        I think you’ll either win the 
                        Pulitzer or ruin your career.

                                 CARL 
                        According to Bruce and half the 
                        science world I’m doing that already. 

                                 LINDA
                        Why stop now?

           Her sarcasm hints at the edge of a deeper issue here.

                                 CARL
                        When you believe something deeply, 
                        you have to follow it wherever it 
                        leads. Even if that’s off a cliff. 

                                 LINDA
                        Funny, you said the same thing when 
                        you married me.

                                 CARL
                        And was I wrong?

                                 LINDA
                        Depends. Am I the belief or the 
                        cliff?
           Carl leans in. Cracks her stony expression with his grin.

                                 CARL
                        Cancel dinner. I’ll take you out 
                        instead. We’ll celebrate, you and me.

                                 LINDA
                        We can’t. You committed to interview 
                        with Rolling Stone tonight.

                                 CARL
                        I’m trying to make it up to you.

           Linda smiles. Kisses her husband softly on the cheek.

                                 LINDA
                        I know. 

           She strolls off with Nick. Carl stares after them a long beat. 
           Then heads inside. As he disappears through a revolving door--

           ANN EXITS OUT THE OTHER SIDE 

           She stares up at the Random House sign. Then angrily tosses 
           her manuscript into the trash. And storms out of frame.

           A BEAT as a homeless guy rescues it and a half-eaten burrito 
           from the garbage; flips through her book while enjoying lunch. 
           Until Ann RUNS BACK out of breath. He takes one look at her...

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Just ‘cause someone tells you so, 
                        don’t mean it’s trash.

           ...and hands it over. To his surprise, Ann hugs him. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - MAGIC HOUR

           A setting sun glows gold over Manhattan as Ann and Tim stroll 
           arm-in-arm out of Central Park and into a fancy brownstone. 
           Tim swings a champagne bottle, cheery to Ann’s moody silence.

                        So what. Good writers borrow, great 
                        writers steal. Oscar Wilde said that.

           but his timing is, unfortunately, dreadful.  
                                 ANN
                        That’s great. Your first book.

           The elevator opens into a apartment. Tim steps out. Ann stays.

                                 TIM
                        Did I miss something?

                                 ANN
                        No, I’m thrilled for you. Really. 

                                 TIM
                        So why are you still in the elevator? 

                                 ANN
                        You go ahead. You’ve a big interview 
                        with Sagan. I don’t want to spoil it.

                                 TIM
                        I’m sorry if my good news ruined your 
                        bad. I thought it’d lift your spirit.

                                 ANN
                        For such a smart, charming man... 
                        sensitivity is not your strong suit.

                                 TIM
                        And for an empowered, talented woman, 
                        it’s cute how oversensitive you are. 

           Ann crosses her arms, he’s not exactly helping his cause here.

                                 ANN
                        It’s not just the book. What have I 
                        done with my life that matters? That 
                        makes a difference. That lasts.

                                 TIM
                        Annie, your expectations are too high 
                        for everyone... especially yourself. 

           He takes her hands, pulls her playfully out of the elevator. 

                                 TIM
                        Now c’mon, let me show you how boring 
                        “successful” writers really are.

           With that he drags a reluctant Ann into the apartment to find--

           INT. DINNER PARTY - CLOSE-ON

           Carl standing on top the dining table, waving a wine bottle 
           like a conductor’s baton. Happy-drunk and mid-joke.
                                 CARL
                        So then the reporter asks: “How often 
                        do you get high?” And I swear to god,
                        without cracking a smile, Buzz Aldrin 
                        replies: “Whenever NASA lets me!”

           The dinner guests burst into laughter: Linda, plus hosts NORA 
           EPHRON and CARL BERNSTEIN (young and still madly in love).

                                 TIM
                        And Carl wonders why the scientific 
                        community doesn’t take him seriously.

           Everyone at the party turns, then rises to greet Ann and Tim.

                                 CARL
                        Says the man who talked me into being 
                        profiled in a rock ‘n roll magazine. 

                                 TIM
                        You can still say no.

           Carl hops off the table. Clasps Tim’s arm affectionately.

                                 CARL
                        To the best science writer I know?

                                 TIM
                        Flattery won’t get you a fluff piece, 
                        even if it’s the biggest compliment 
                        I’ve ever had. Meet my fiancée Ann. 

                                 ANN
                        You’re all Tim’s been talking about.

                                 CARL
                        Then I already owe you an apology.

           The sparkle of his smile spreads to Ann. With his sleeves 
           rolled up, he’s more charming than she imagined, in spite of 
           his turtleneck. They hold on each other... a locked-in beat.

                                 BERNSTEIN
                        Careful Tim, Sagan looks like he's 
                        just discovered a new star.

           He cuts in, taking Ann’s hand and kissing it flirtatiously.

                                 BERNSTEIN
                        But even they don’t shine so bright.

                                 NORA
                        It’s you she should worry about. 
                        Every marriage needs at least one 
                        good secret. Clearly mine’s falling 
                        for shameless flirts. 
                                 LINDA
                        And mine’s marrying a man who’s idea 
                        of foreplay is probing the surface of 
                        Mars. Don’t mind our halfwit 
                        husbands. I’m Linda and this is--

                                 ANN
                        Nora Ephron, I know. I loved your 
                        Esquire exposé on small breasts. 

                                 NORA
                        I wish I had more to expose! My wit 
                        is unfortunately bigger than my tits.

                                 ANN
                        Well I envy both. It’s an honor.

                                 NORA
                        Honor is for saints and soldiers. 

           She links arms with Ann, sweeping her into this charmed world.

                                 NORA
                        Let’s not stand here like marble 
                        statues! This is a party after all.

                                 LINDA
                        Speaking of which...

           She grabs Tim’s wine bottle, pops off the cork with her teeth.

                                 LINDA
                        LET’S DRINK!
                                                       SMASH TO:

           INT. PARTY - LATER

           A stonehenge of empty bottles and plates litter the table -- 
           Ephron and Bernstein stacking them in a game of drunken jenga. 
           The rest of the party (the Sagans, Ann and Tim) have migrated 
           to the floor. A joint passes around as Tim interviews Carl.

                                 TIM
                        Say we do find life on Mars. So what? 

                                 CARL
                        It will be the greatest discovery--

                                 TIM
                        In the history of history. I know 
                        that’s what everyone says. But why?

                                 CARL
                        Because it’ll prove we’re not alone.
                                 TIM
                        It’ll prove life CAN exist elsewhere, 
                        but you can’t talk to a microbe.

                                 CARL
                        If basic life can survive Mars’ harsh 
                        environment, it’s a near mathematical 
                        certainty intelligent life has 
                        evolved somewhere in the universe.

                                 LINDA
                        I think the jury’s still out for 
                        intelligent life here on earth.

           She blows a perfect smoke ring as everyone laughs. 

           Carl takes the roach, inhales an expert hit, passes it to Ann. 
           Who stares at the most famous scientist in America, shocked. 

                                 TIM
                        Say we are alone, Carl. And there's 
                        nothing out there but dust and rock 
                        and endless cold.

                                 CARL
                        We keep looking.

                                 ANN
                        But at what cost?

           Everyone turns and stares at Ann who’s been quiet up till now.

                                 CARL
                        Any. Though our country pays peanuts. 
                        Less than 1% of our budget on science- 

                                 ANN
                        Which is still billions that could go 
                        to solving this world’s issues versus 
                        sending rockets to other ones.

           Her passion takes the room by surprise, especially Carl. He 
           smiles at her... but it’s a challenge. She struck a chord.

                                 CARL
                        This nation spends more every year on 
                        bubblegum than we do on outer space. 

                                 ANN
                        And both are a waste.

                                 CARL
                        Every major advance man’s made is the 
                        result of science. Our 1st ancestor 
                        picked up a stone and made a tool.

                                 CARL (CONT'D)
                        Innovation has been the key to our 
                        survival ever since.

                                 ANN
                        Or it’s how we’ll destroy ourselves. 
                        That 1st tool was a knife. Now it’s a 
                        bomb. We’ll never reach life on other 
                        worlds if we don’t preserve our own.

           Fire in her voice, her eyes burning hot. And Carl’s her moth.

                                 CARL
                        What ended the Cold War wasn’t a 
                        missile but a man on the moon. That’s 
                        the only thing that brings small 
                        creatures such as we together: a 
                        truth bigger than ourselves.

                                 ANN
                        And I think the only thing that makes 
                        the vastness bearable is love.

           On her feet now, surprising even herself. But she can’t stop--

                                 ANN
                        You want to find life? You’re looking 
                        too far. It’s here. It’s US. It’s 
                        now. Excuse me.

           She shakes off Tim’s calming hand and EXITS. Leaving a stunned 
           silence behind and Tim at a loss. Linda hands him the joint.

                                 LINDA
                        Surprise Tim, your lamb has fangs.

           Her wild laugh cuts the tension. As Tim slowly joins in... 
           Carl stares after Ann, lost in thought.

           EXT. PENTHOUSE BALCONY - NIGHT

           Laughter spills out of the party onto a rooftop balcony 
           overlooking Central Park and Manhattan beyond. Carl steps out 
           to find Ann, staring up at the faint few stars above. 

                                 CARL
                        It’s ironic isn’t it. The brighter 
                        our world gets, the harder it is to 
                        see the stars.

                                 ANN
                        Sorry I went after you in there. 

                                 CARL
                        Never apologize for being passionate. 
                        It’s a thing I find most people lack.
        Chicago Tribune, Nov 15, 1992 
                                 ANN
                        Funny, most people claim I have too 
                        much. Tim says I chase the impossible-

                                 CARL
                        My critics accuse me of the same.

                                 ANN
                        But that hasn’t stopped you?

                                 CARL 
                        It’s driven me to question more.

                                 ANN
                        And if you don’t find your answers?

           That sparkle reenters Carl’s smile as he leans into the night. 

                                 CARL 
                        When I was five my parents took me to 
                        the 1939 World’s Fair and it was like 
                        magic. Moving images in a box called 
                        TV. Future cities powered by cars and 
                        electricity. “The World of Tomorrow”.

           He points to the lights of the cityscape below.

                                 CARL
                        Science fiction then, reality today. 
                        I don’t believe in impossible -- 
                        History’s proven it false too often.

                                 ANN
                        Which is why you believe there are 
                        other worlds out there?

           They look up together at the stars twinkling dimly overhead.

                                 CARL
                        I believe somewhere, something 
                        incredible is waiting to be known.

                                 ANN
                        That sounds an awful lot like faith.

                                 CARL
                        The only difference between science 
                        and religion is one has proof and the 
                        other god.

                        What I know: that we exist. That life 
                        is sacred. That we should cherish 
                        what we have. Because as far as we 
                        know, we’re it.
                        (locking eyes with Carl)
                        And if we’re not... why wait, or pray 
                        for contact when we can make our own.

           On Carl truly disarmed. And as his smile now spreads to Ann--

                                 CARL (V.O.)
                        Man has always been drawn toward the 
                        beauty of the unknown...
                                                        CUT TO:

           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

           The Florida sun sparkles on a crowd gathered before a stage on 
           which Carl speaks; the metal towers of NASA’s famous launchpad 
           rising dramatically behind him. Beside him Bruce Murray hovers 
           on edge, as Carl addresses the press with electric intensity.

                                 CARL
                        5000 years ago, using only the stars 
                        as guides man’s 1st voyagers set sail 
                        across the vast ocean for worlds then 
                        unknown. This summer NASA will launch 
                        a new voyage inspired by that past. 

           He pulls a cloth, covering a model of the VOYAGER SPACESHIPS. 
           Cameras FLASH. Pens scribble. Bruce claims the mic from Carl.

                                 BRUCE 
                        In 2 months, Voyagers 1 & 2 will set 
                        sail to map Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus 
                        and Neptune. Worlds never explored.  

                                 CARL
                        And that’s just the start. From there 
                        they will journey on. To the edge of 
                        our solar system and by 2013...  
                        (quoting Tennyson)
                        “Beyond the sunset and the baths of 
                        all the western stars.” Man’s first 
                        explorer into the uncharted cosmos.

           A forest of hands go up. Bruce picks. A reporter aims at Carl.

                                 REPORTER
                        Dr. Sagan, why should the public care 
                        about unmanned missions? Especially 
                        now, after the spectacular failure of 
                        the Viking landers on Mars. 
           Carl leans into the mic to answer, but Bruce blocks him out.

                                 BRUCE
                        I wouldn't call sending two ships 50 
                        million miles to land on another 
                        planet a failure. The issue here is 
                        one of expectations. See popularizers 
                        like Sagan got everyone so excited 
                        about life out there, the public 
                        would’ve been disappointed with 
                        anything less than little green men.

                                 CARL
                        Who knows maybe you scared them away.

           He leans in as the press eat this up. Bruce is sweating. 

                                 CARL
                        Look, I know robots digging on Mars 
                        was as exciting as watching an art 
                        farm. Less cause we didn’t find ants--

           Chuckles from the journalists. Carl at home in the spotlight.

                                 CARL
                        But the only way to find life in the 
                        universe is to explore.

           Bruce cuts back in, a controlled boil, to reclaim Carl’s spin.

                                 BRUCE
                        Finding life is not Voyagers mission. 

                                 CARL
                        Discovering the New World wasn’t 
                        Columbus’s either. Just as 5000 years 
                        ago, those first voyagers sailed into 
                        the unknown of the Pacific in their 
                        ancient canoes with nothing but a 
                        yearning. And a hope.

           And now he turns to address Bruce directly. A challenge.

                                 CARL
                        The truth is we have no idea what’s 
                        out there. And that’s why the public 
                        should care. Because this mission is 
                        our best chance of finding out.

                                 BRUCE
                        Okay, that’s it for questions. NASA 
                        will be releasing a press kit soon.

           Bruce pulls Carl away from the mic, all smiles, shaking Carl’s 
           hand a bit too tight as the cameras FLASH and FLASH and...
          NY Times, Sept 17, 1977. Image of Bruce Murray, sitting before Voyager 1 
           EXT. COCOA BEACH - FLORIDA - DAY  

           FLASH! Linda lowers a polaroid as Carl poses with Nick and a 
           pack of wide-eyed 6 year olds in NASA tees. Bruce observes 
           while ‘mission directing’ a company BBQ up the beach.

                                 CARL
                        Ok, does everybody have a bottle?

           He hands out vintage glass coke bottles to each excited kid, 
           as Nick helps pass around paper and crayons.

                                 CARL
                        Now before we cast them out, I want 
                        you to each write a message.

                                 NICK
                        What should we say?

                                 CARL
                        Good question. What do you want 
                        whoever finds it to know about you?

           Nick thinks a long moment. Smiles, scribbles. One by one the 
           kids slide their crayon notes inside their bottles, and Carl 
           corks each one. Then in his best NASA mission control voice:

                                 CARL
                        Houston we are go-no-go for launch. 
                        In T-minus 3-2-1...

                                 ALL THE KIDS
                        BLASTOFF!

           They arc their bottles far out into the tide. Watch as they 
           drift out toward the horizon.

                                 NICK
                        Do you think anyone will find them?

                                 CARL
                        Well your bottle is pretty small and 
                        the ocean immensely big, so the odds 
                        are pretty slim...

           Nick’s face drops. Linda frowns at Carl, what are you doing?

                                 CARL
                        But let it drift long enough and it’s 
                        bound to wash up somewhere. It’s the 
                        same with the Voyager spaceships...

           He slips his own message into a bottle. Sets it out to sea.
                                 CARL
                        Imagine each of your bottles floating 
                        across the vast sea of interstellar 
                        space. Endlessly adrift. And then...

           He scoops up a handful of sand, holds it out.

                                 CARL
                        How many grains of sand do you think 
                        are in my hand. Hundreds?

                                 NICK
                        More like thousands.

                                 CARL
                        And how many grains on this beach?

                       TIMID BOY
                                              SMART-ALEC
               Millions?
                                      Billions!

                                 CARL
                        And what if I told you there’s more 
                        stars in the sky than all the sand on 
                        all the beaches of the world?

           A crazy fact, but true. We almost hear little minds exploding.

                                 NERDY GIRL
                        That’d be like a gazillion worlds! 

                                 CARL
                        Even more.

                                 NICK
                        So how can we possibly be alone?

           Carl smiles at his son, the same childlike wonder as the kids.

                                 CARL
                        That my little astronomer is what I’d 
                        like to know... more than anything.

           He lets the sand run through his fingers, where the sun makes 
           each grain sparkle as they fall.

                                 NICK
                        So what message are you putting on 
                        Voyager, Dad?

           Carl looks at his son, incredulous. The answer surprises him.

                                 CARL
                        We’re not.

                                 NICK
                        Why? 
           Such an innocent question -- a simple connection that until 
           now no one at NASA has made.

                                 CARL
                        That’s a good question...

           And just like that the seed of a BIG IDEA begins to take root.

                                 CARL
                        (echoing Ann)
                        Why wait for contact when we can make 
                        our own.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CAPE CANAVERAL - NIGHT 

           Linda carries Nick in astronaut pjs to bed, as Bobby Darin’s 
           “Beyond the Sea” wafts over a balcony overlooking the Indian 
           River and moonlit Atlantic Ocean beyond. Carl’s huddled over a 
           scrapbook, scribbling furiously. 

                                 LINDA
                        Come to bed now, Carl.

                                 CARL
                        I’m having an epiphany.

                                 LINDA
                        Save your epiphanies for Monday.

           But he can’t and she sees he’s a lost cause. She exits annoyed 
           as the record skips: Beyond the Sea, beyond the sea, beyond...

           Frustrated Carl crumples his sketches. Moves to the turntable, 
           lifts the needle off vinyl. Inspects the record for damage.

           Across the water, a FULL MOON breaches cloud. And the disk in 
           Carl’s hand suddenly lines up perfectly with the bright disk 
           in the sky. It hits Carl at once.

                                 CARL
                        That’s it!

           He drops the record, needle falling in groove, song crooning: 
           I know beyond a doubt / My heart will lead me there soon... as 
           Carl’s scrapbook fills with diagrams. 

                                 BRUCE (V.O.)
                        ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!

           EXT. COCOA BEACH - POOLSIDE TIKI BAR - NIGHT 

           Bruce sits at a kitschy bamboo bar, Carl’s proposal laid out 
           between tiki-mug maitais. His face a formidable shade of rage.
                                 BRUCE
                        A Golden Record?

                                 CARL
                        Listen we’ve sent messages to space 
                        before, but those were radio signals, 
                        shots fired in the dark. What if we 
                        sent something tangible, something we 
                        can attach to the Voyager satellites.

                                 BRUCE
                        Like a record made out of gold?

           His sarcasm is met and drowned by a tidal wave of sincerity.

                                 CARL
                        It’s the one thing that can endure 
                        the rigors of space travel. Think 
                        about it, paper will decompose. A 
                        tape would erase in Earth’s magnetic 
                        field. Any other transmitter will run 
                        out of power. But a record...

           He flips through his drawings: 2 parts brilliant 1 part manic. 

                                 CARL
                        Is light, durable and technologically 
                        simple enough that any advanced life 
                        who finds it should be able to play 
                        it. And think of the message we can 
                        encode! Sounds, images, music. Plus--

           Bruce downshifts from angry to annoyed. He signals his check. 

                                 CARL
                        Gold doesn’t oxidize so it’ll survive 
                        millions of years. If not forever. 

                                 BRUCE
                        And you want NASA to fund this?

                                 CARL
                        And put it on Voyagers 1 and 2.

                                 BRUCE
                        A GOLD Record.

                                 CARL
                        A time-capsule of life on Earth. That 
                        captures the spirit of all we are. 

           Bruce shakes his head, not buying it.

                                 BRUCE
                        It’s a publicity stunt, Sagan. Just 
                        like everything else you do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        Now if you’ll excuse me, I have 4000 
                        actual scientists working on a 
                        billion dollar mission that needs 
                        attention.

           He rises and heads for the door. Carl doesn’t quit so easily.

                                 CARL
                        And who funds that mission, Bruce? 
                        You heard the press back there, NASA 
                        is losing the support of the public. 

                                 BRUCE
                        And as the ‘face of space’, that’s 
                        your fault! You turned our Mars 
                        mission into a talk show punchline. 
                        Now you wanna send up some cosmic 
                        kumbaya?

                                 CARL
                        This is our chance to ignite peoples’ 
                        imagination. The record is a symbol--

                                 BRUCE
                        Of what! And for whom? I’d like to 
                        believe there’s someone else out 
                        there too, but if there is this won’t 
                        reach them. It’d be like...

                                 CARL
                        Casting a message in a bottle into 
                        the sea, hoping it washes ashore?

                                 BRUCE
                        Exactly! And even if it did, it would 
                        take tens of thousands of years to 
                        reach whatever life might be out 
                        there. And then, IF they understood 
                        it, 100,000 more to reply. If they 
                        even cared. If they even could.  

                                 CARL
                        And what if they do find it? You're 
                        already casting Voyager into space... 
                        why send an empty bottle?

           Bruce chews on this. A small opening that Carl dives through.

                                 CARL
                        A billion years from now when mankind 
                        has come and gone, this will live on. 

                                 BRUCE
                        So will the plastic umbrella in my 
                        piña colada.
           He bites off his pineapple chunk for emphasis and stands up.

                                 CARL
                        All I’m asking for is a small team. 
                        And I will claim full responsibility.

                                 BRUCE
                        You want to hang your career on this 
                        noose, go ahead. I’m not giving you 
                        any funding. Nor do you have official 
                        NASA support. All content you select 
                        is subject to my review and approval. 

                                 CARL
                        But you’ll put it on Voyager?

                                 BRUCE
                        I promise nothing. You got 6 weeks.  
                        It fails, you take the heat. It hits 
                        the press, I kill the whole thing.

           Carl shakes Bruce’s hand though it wasn’t offered. Heads out.

                                 BRUCE 
                        And Carl? One last thing...

           Carl turns back. Bruce tosses him a copy of Rolling Stone: the 
           April 7th, 1977 profile Tim wrote on Carl gracing its cover.

                                 BRUCE 
                        No rock and roll.

           We PUSH IN on the magazine’s title as it transforms now into--

           INT. ROLLING STONE HEADQUARTERS - NYC - DAY 

           The company marquee. Beneath which a cover shoot is underway. 
           Fleetwood Mac in their 1977 prime -- Mick, Stevie, Buckingham, 
           the McVies -- all cuddled together on a giant bed as a young 
           Annie Liebovitz snaps her infamous photos from atop a ladder. 

           The band’s hit You Make Loving Fun pumps over the scene as Tim 
           leads Carl past on a fastpaced walk-n-talk through the office.

                                 TIM
                        That’s great. That’s the cover!

                                 CARL
                        Who’s the band?

                                 TIM
                        You’ve never heard of Fleetwood Mac? 
                        Their album Rumours is #1.
        Rolling Stone, April 7th, 1977. Tim’s profile 
        of Carl is the second feature listed on cover. 
                                     Rolling Stone, March 24th, 1977.  

                                     Newsweek Cover, Aug 15, 1977 
                                 CARL
                        I see why. Sex sells but that bed is-- 

                                 TIM
                        A bit much? Not after you read 
                        Cameron Crowe’s exclusive. Apparently 
                        they’re all sleeping together. 

           He ducks through the writers bullpen into his editor’s office.

                                 TIM
                        So tell me about this record. A human 
                        mixtape? Sounds too hippie for NASA.

                                 CARL
                        It is. That’s why I’m unofficially 
                        asking for your help.

                                 TIM
                        I’d love to but I’ve got a publisher 
                        pouring kerosene down my throat, an 
                        editor lighting fire under my ass... 
                        plus a wedding to plan.  

                                 CARL
                        I’ll write the foreword to your book.

                                 TIM
                        If I ever get through my edit! I’m 
                        sorry, Carl. I can’t.  

                                 CARL
                        This is a chance, Tim, to create 
                        something that will last longer than 
                        anything anyone has ever made. Don’t 
                        you want to be a part of that?

                                 TIM
                        You’re preaching to the wrong choir. 
                        I’m a journalist. You need a dreamer, 
                        not a skeptic like me.

                                 CARL
                        I need both. 

                                 TIM
                        Who else have you asked?

                                 CARL
                        Only everyone I know.

                                 TIM
                        Well I know one person you forgot...
           INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - NYC - DAY

           Ann’s working her 2nd job, bored at a desk in museum uniform, 
           renting audio guides to tourists. Carl steps up, next in line.

                                 CARL
                        How much for a tour?

           Ann lights up surprised and happy to see him. She plays along.

                                 ANN
                        $3 sir, for the self-guided audio.

                                 CARL
                        I haven’t had much luck recently with 
                        unmanned missions. How much are you?

                                 ANN
                        More than this museum can afford.

                                 CARL
                        All I can offer you is a great story.

           Ann looks at him, a strange smile. Slowly rises from her desk.

                                 ANN 
                        (to a coworker)
                        Tell Martin I’m on my lunch break.

                                 COWORKER
                        But it’s 4 o’clock!

           Ignoring this Ann takes Carl’s arm; leads him into the museum--

                                 ANN (V.O.)
                        What makes anything a masterpiece?

           INT. PERMANENT COLLECTION - MOMA 

           Ann guides Carl through the masters’ wing of the gallery.

                                 ANN 
                        Is it the craft of the artist? The 
                        quality or fame of a work?

           She pauses before Picasso’s Three Musicians.

                                 ANN
                        For me it’s the way something moves 
                        me. Captures what words never can.

           Carl squints at the Cubist classic. Shakes his head.
                                 CARL
                        I have to confess I’m art illiterate. 
                        Linda paints, and I’ve been to the 
                        Louvre... but I just don’t get it.

                                 ANN
                        That’s because you think too much. 
                        Art is for the heart, not the mind. 

           She steers Carl over to the museum’s most famous painting.

                                 ANN
                        Here, take Van Gogh’s Starry Night. 
                        Intellectually we see his perspective 
                        is skewed: the stars are too big and 
                        close to earth. But emotionally it 
                        makes sense. They’re almost in reach.

           Carl studies the canvas as though seeing it for the 1st time.

                                 CARL
                        So this one image achieves what I’ve 
                        spent my career trying to express. 

                                 ANN
                        Which is exactly where science fails 
                        and art succeeds. Art tells us we’re 
                        special, sacred. Science reminds us 
                        we’re not. We’re just a lonely speck 
                        in a vacuum of darkness.

                                 CARL
                        But that is exactly what makes us 
                        special: that despite impossible odds 
                        life exists. Science proves we are 
                        the greatest miracle in the universe.

                                 ANN
                        I guess I never looked at it that way-

           Carl points at Starry Night.

                                 CARL
                        Because your perspective is skewed.
                        But I could use your point of view.

                                 ANN
                        On what?

                                 CARL
                        A real way to reach those stars...

           INT. MOMA - FRONT DESK - CONTINUOUS

           Carl returns Ann to work, the two locked in a lively exchange.
                                 ANN
                        So let me get this straight. You want 
                        to condense the entire human 
                        experience into an hour long record?

                        well go all the way. And to be clear 
                        you have no approval, no guarantee 
                        it’ll even launch...

                                 CARL
                        And no funding.

                                 ANN
                        I don’t see how that’s a problem.

           She heads out the door. Tim follows, arguing down the hall.

                                 TIM
                        You can't change the whole world, 
                        Annie. You have to pick and choose.

           They step into an elevator. At odds as the doors BING closed--

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL - SIMULTANEOUS

           BING! The elevator opens, only Linda and Carl step out. Locked 
           in a similar argument as they move through the hotel lobby.

                                 LINDA
                        This isn’t a discussion if you’ve 
                        already made up your mind.

                                 CARL 
                        I thought you’d be excited about--

                                 LINDA
                        A space record? It’s career suicide.

                                 CARL
                        You’re missing the bigger picture.
                                 LINDA
                        It only ever is the big picture with 
                        you, Carl. Forget the cosmos for a 
                        damn minute! I’m here on Earth. 

           She spins on him, the middle of the lobby. 

                                 LINDA
                        Your book’s done, Viking mission’s 
                        over... this is our time together.

                                 CARL
                        Which is why I want you on the team.

                                 LINDA
                        That’s the opposite of what I mean.

                                 CARL 
                        We have the opportunity to build 
                        something important here: a cultural 
                        Noah’s ark. Don’t you want to share 
                        that with me?

                                 LINDA 
                        I’d rather share a life with you. 

           She takes his hand, fire trying to melt ice.

                                 LINDA 
                        But you never stop. Even when you’re 
                        here, you’re still up here-- 
                        (she taps his head)
                        And when you work, nothing else does.

                                 CARL
                        That’s why we should do this 
                        together. I promise it’ll be better.

                                 LINDA
                        And if I won’t?

           Carl clenches his jaw, determination fused with defiance.

                                 CARL
                        Then I’ll do it without you.

           She pulls her hands away from his.

                                 LINDA
                        So I’m losing you either way.

           She pushes out a REVOLVING DOOR, Carl following as it SPINS--
           INT. RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 

           --a complete 360° CIRCLE: carrying us into the famous NY eatery 
           into which Ann and Tim now ENTER, still arguing.

                                 TIM
                        All I’m saying is your decisions 
                        affect me. From now on we should be 
                        making the major ones together.

                                 TIM
                        That wasn’t a choice. You know how 
                        much I have on my plate. And this 
                        will only delay everything further.

                                 ANN
                        Carl’s project is 5 weeks. You act as

                                 TIM
                        No, I fear it’s gonna consume yours.

           Their tension is cut by a cheerful hostess.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Good evening. Dinner for two? 

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        Actually it’s six.

           Ann and Tim turn as Carl and Linda ENTER the restaurant now. 
           Both couples greet each other warmly; smiles plastering over 
           their relationship issues still simmering below the surface.

                                 ANN 
                        Who are the other two?

           INT. RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amid a sea of high heels and fancy suits, ‘Astral Artist’ JON 
           LOMBERG sits in overalls and tie-dye shirt across from FRANK 
           DRAKE, Carl’s best friend and infamous SETI astronomer (Search 
           for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). On the table before them, 
           they’ve rearranged 12 wine glasses into a makeshift xylophone.

           As the others approach both men strike up Wagner’s Ride of the 
           Valkyries: fingers gliding circles around the wine rims, each 
           glass tuned a different note. It’s ludicrous and mesmerizing.
                            www.JohnLomberg.com 
                                 CARL
                        I’d apologize for keeping you, but it 
                        seems you made good use of your time.

                                 FRANK
                        Lomberg here showed me how to arrange 
                        the glasses into a harp.

                                 JON
                        And Drake figured out how to tune the 
                        pitch by adjusting the level of wine.

                                 LINDA
                        I bet it works in reverse too.

           Linda grabs a glass and drains it. 

                                 LINDA
                        Yup, I feel more harmonious already.

                                 FRANK
                        Try another, it’ll make you less 
                        shrill.

           He hands her another glass, clear animosity between these two. 
           This whole gathering’s a powder keg and everyone has a match.

                                 CARL
                        Ann, Tim may I introduce Jon Lomberg, 
                        my artistic collaborator. And my son 
                        Nick’s godfather: the honorable Dr...

                                 TIM
                        Frank Drake, the yeti of SETI. Never 
                        thought I’d see you in the wild.
                        (explaining to Ann)
                        The good doctor here believes aliens 
                        communicate with him via radio waves.

                                 FRANK
                        And you misquote me in every article.

                                 TIM
                        You’re welcome. I make you sound like 
                        an eccentric lunatic versus a raving 
                        one. 

           He offers Frank a hand. Frank grins. Pulls Tim into a hug. 

                                 CARL
                        Great we’re all friends. Let’s begin.

                                 JON
                        Shouldn’t we wait for the rest of the 
                        team?
                                 LINDA
                        There isn’t enough wine in here to 
                        keep either of us amused that long.

           Frank and Jon spin on Carl as the situation sinks in.

                                 JON
                        It’s just the six of us?

                                 TIM
                        5 Actually. Ann’s yet to convince me.

                                 LINDA
                        And Carl me.

           She shares a knowing look with Tim. Frank breaks into a grin.

                                 FRANK
                        Perfect! People, in my experience, 
                        only tend to complicate things.

           WHOOSH! Everyone jumps as a waiter ignites a flambé beside the 
           table, breaking the tension. Jon hands out wine to the team.

                                 JON
                        Plus nothing’s ever fun if it’s easy.

           He raises his glass in toast. As everyone joins with a CLINK.

           INT. DINNER BOOTH - MOVABLE FEAST

           The CAMERA CIRCLES with the waiters as they continuously bus 
           plates of food to and from the table where Frank, Jon, Carl, 
           Ann, and eventually Linda and Tim, engage in a lively debate.

                                 CARL
                        If you could send any message to an 
                        alien world, what would it be?

                                 JON
                        Not even a question. I’d send the 
                        great works of art: Monet, Da Vinci--

           Scientist Frank cuts artist Jon off, passions stirred quickly.

                                 FRANK
                        Please, if I’m an alien who’s never 
                        seen a human being, how would I even 
                        begin to process Water Lilies? We 
                        need to send more universal things. 

                                 ANN
                        Like music.
                                 FRANK
                        Or math, the universal language. And 
                        the only thing any advanced 
                        intelligence will understand easily.

                                 ANN
                        Then call me primitive cause I didn’t 
                        make it past geometry. I think we 
                        need to send things that move us 
                        deeply, make us unique. 

           The fire of conviction in her. It pulls Carl in like a magnet.

                                 CARL
                        I’m with Ann. This is our chance to 
                        capture the beauty of life on Earth. 
                        Who we are, what we believe.

           At this Linda jumps in, the opposite of Ann. Not buying in.

                                 LINDA
                        And who are we?

                                 TIM
                        (matter of fact)
                        An immature species struggling to 
                        survive on a peripheral planet, in 
                        some far-flung suburb of an immense 
                        cosmos, in which there are infinitely 
                        more stars than humans.

           He snaps the head off a baguette casually as Ann scowls at him-

                                 LINDA
                        I MEANT who are we to speak for 
                        humanity? No one here is an expert. 
                        Not in anthropology, art, religion, 
                        history. We’re at best a ragtag team.

                                 CARL
                        The “experts” thought this was crazy.

                                 LINDA
                        And doesn’t that tell you anything?

           Before Carl can reply, Ann does for him. Impassioned.

                                 ANN
                        Yeah, that we’re on to something.

           She shares a look with Carl, the only one that gets him.

                                 ANN  
                        Most people spend their lives chasing 
                        meaning, some purpose to the chaos.

                        This is our chance to shout into the

                        here. And this is our great story.

           And with that line Tim understands suddenly why she’s set her 
           mind so completely on this. But he’s still a skeptic.

                                 TIM 
                        And if no one takes you seriously?

                        We’ll prove why they should. Skeptics 
                        laughed at Galileo and Einstein too.

                                 TIM
                        They also laughed at Daffy Duck.  
                        Honestly Carl, you want to condense 
                        all human history into an hour long 
                        record... where do you even start?

                        That’s easy. With Beethoven. 

           A collective groan goes up. Tim can’t help but get roped in.

                        are the only species, we should also 
                        include sounds from all life on Earth-

                        to hear Earth but to truly comprehend 
                        the miracle of a sunset, the birth of

                        It seems we have our work cut out for 
                        us. With 20 people this project could 
                        take a year. We have 5 and a month.

           With a mischievous grin Ann pulls a “45” LP from her purse. 
           Slides it to the center of the table. CAMERA ZOOMING IN as 
           everything else drops away. The arm of a stylus ENTERS FRAME. 

           As the record spins: Johnny B. Goode (track 1) begins to play--

           INT. COLONY RECORDS - NYC

           Carl and Ann squish together in a listening booth at the back 
           of a record shop as “Johnny” spins between them. Ann’s loving 
           it, rocking out freely. Carl’s not feeling it. He hands her a 
           Beethoven LP. Ann holds up Bob Marley. Carl: Bach. Ann: Bowie. 

           EXT. COLONY RECORDS - DAY

           Ann and Carl exit the store, laughing as they struggle to haul 
           a crate overstuffed with LPs. Across the street, Jon and Frank 
           exit a bookstore -- Frank with a cart of National Geographics, 
           Jon a pile of art books. They load up the trunk of Carl’s car.

           EXT. SAGAN HOUSE - ITHACA, NY 

           Carl races up a wooded driveway in his orange convertible 
           porsche (with PHOBOS license plates) to a mansion overlooking 
           the dramatic gorges of Cornell. Nick Sagan runs out to help 
           carry a stack of books across the yard into the foyer where--

           INT. SAGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Jon and Frank stand amidst a sea of photos, arguing over the 
           merits of art vs photography. Jon pins Michelangelo’s Sistine 
           Chapel to a wall. Frank replaces it with a photo of human 
           anatomy. It’s clear from their “REJECT PILE”, Frank’s winning.

           INT. TIM’S APARTMENT - MATCH-CUT

           Speaking of rejection, Tim sweeps a publisher’s denial note 
           into a trash bin along with several wedding brochures. Pulling 
           back we see he’s preoccupied: typing and talking on the phone. 
           Annoyed, Ann recovers it. Cuts it into the letter ‘N’ as she 
           sorts through a tall stack of records. Tim shakes his head.

           INT. BRUCE MURRAY’S OFFICE - CROSS-CUT 

           To Bruce, shaking his head as he reads Carl’s book at his desk 
           overlooking Mission Control. Annoyed, he chucks it in the can.

           Ann sets Carl’s red-marked copy of her manuscript next to her 
           typewriter, and with renewed conviction, begins to write. Over 
           her desk she’s cut rejection slips into the word: MOTIVATION.

           INT. SAGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Linda comes in to find her wall now fully plastered in photos. 
           Frank, Jon and Nick all passed out before the collage, which 
           is arranged by theme: HUMAN - ANIMAL - NATURE - TECHNOLOGY. 
           She storms off in search of Carl, clearly not thrilled.

           INT. MILKY WAY FOYER - NIGHT 

           Carl now dances among the planets of a 3D model Solar System. 
           The record of “Johnny B. Goode” spinning in a turntable, the 
           needle running to the end of the groove as Carl sings along! 
           Rocking out freely just like Ann did. Linda stands in the door 
           arms-crossed, watching this new Carl. She doesn’t like it.

                                             END SONG AND MONTAGE.

           The fiery fingers of a setting sun streak the sky golden over 
           Carl’s wooded mansion overlooking Ithaca Lake. Ann pauses on 
           the porch to admire the view as Carl leads Tim into the foyer 
           for a tour of a lifesize 3D Solar System model that Jon built.
        Cover of the Cornell student newspaper (circa 1985) 
                                 TIM
                        So it is true, Carl... I always knew 
                        the world revolved around you.

           He spins a huge-plastic Earth on a circular track around Carl.

                        This took Jon 6 months to create. All 
                        built to scale. And the best part...

           He signals Nick, standing in the center of the model alongside 
           Jon and Frank. His son flips a switch and under blacklight the 
           stars begin to spin and glow. A homemade planetarium. Linda 
           rolls her eyes as she joins Ann outside with a bottle of wine.

                        such thing as a sure thing. 

           A deeper undercurrent here, though Linda doesn’t linger on it. 
           She links arms with Ann and as the sun fades, leads her in.

                        fools what they’re missing...

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAGAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The whole team lounges around a large table, doors open wide 
           to the warm summer night. A record player sits as centerpiece. 
           In front of each member is a stack of records. Carl toasts.

                                 CARL
                        They say music is the great unifier. 
                        If our message does nothing else it’s 
                        brought us misfits together. In the 
                        history of NASA, I’ve never seen a 
                        less qualified, harder working crew.

           All clink glasses. Linda slings her arm chummily around Ann.

                                 CARL
                        That said we’re now 3 weeks from 
                        Voyagers launch. Our deadline is fast 
                        approaching. Time to make decisions.

           He sets a record from his pile on the player. Beethoven’s 5th  
           (track 2) fills the room. Ann groans. Checks out Carl’s stack.

                        Yeah, it’s too perfect and humans are 
                        messy. The music we send should be 
                        emotional: Jazz, Folk, Rock n’ Roll.

           She pulls album covers from her pile: Elvis, Miles Davis, Bob 
           Dylan. Ann puts on Mr. Tamborine Man (track 3). Frank rebels.

                                 FRANK
                        No way! If I can't understand what

                        man's first music. Kinda gets in your 
                        bones, doesn’t it? 

           He dances erratically to the beat, like a man with epilepsy. 

                                 JON
                        Yeah, rattles them. Why send tin cans 
                        when we have melody, myth, Mozart--

           He puts on his pick: Mozart’s Magic Flute Aria 14 (track 5). 
           Piercing, operatic high notes fill the room. Frank winces.

                                 FRANK
                        I can hear alien ears shattering.

                                 TIM
                        Assuming aliens have ears. You all 
                        got it wrong. What they need is SOUL.

           As the opera crescendoes, he swaps in Blind Willie Johnson’s 
           Dark Was the Night (track 6). Hums along, low and guttural. 

                                 LINDA
                        This is lovely. It makes me want to 
                        draw a hot bath and slit my wrists.

           She switches on Louis Armstrong’s Melancholy Blues (track 7).

                                 LINDA
                        I’m with Ann. Let’s send Jazz. Or at 
                        least music that’s more uplifting.

                                 CARL
                        This is a democracy. How about every 
                        one names a pick, and we include it.
                                 LINDA
                        Louis Armstrong: “Melancholy Blues”.

                        If we’re vetoing Dylan then I guess 
                        Bach: “The Well Tempered Clavier”.

                                 CARL
                        Really?

           He cocks his head at Ann, who cracks a grin. Fucking with him.

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        I vote “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”.

           Everyone turns to find Nick, eavesdropping in astronaut pjs.

                                 CARL
                        You’re supposed to be in bed.

                                 NICK
                        Can I be part of the team?

           Ann takes his hand, with a warm smile.

                                 ANN
                        You can help me. I have to record the 
                        sounds of nature. You can be my ears.

           With Linda’s approval, she leads Nick into the yard outside.  

           EXT. FRONT YARD - SAGAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The silvery light of the moon shines over the Cornell gorges 
           as Ann teaches Nick how to record sound with a microphone.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t hear anything.

                                 ANN
                        Shhh. They’ll only play if we listen.

           Nick squirms but stays silent. Slowly that Universal Nightsong 
           (track 8) most of us ignore, swells to life like a symphony.

                                 NICK
                        The frogs?

                                 ANN
                        And the crickets.

           She catches one in the grass, shows Nick how it chirps.
                                 ANN
                        We aren’t the only life that sings. 
                        Before birds, or you and me, this was 
                        the first music on Earth.

           Impressed, Nick touches the cricket’s wing. It goes silent.

                                 NICK
                        Do you think they sing in outerspace?

                                 ANN
                        I hope so. Otherwise it’d be an 
                        awfully quiet place.

                                 NICK
                        Not if we send our own music.

                                 CARL 
                        You recruiting my son to the project?

           He joins them outside as fireflies twinkle to life like stars.

                                 ANN
                        Nick here just helped me record our 
                        first murmur of earth.

                                 CARL
                        What a lucky boy. Now your crickets 
                        will forever sing among the stars.

                                 NICK
                        Dad, do you really believe there’s 
                        other people like us out there?

                                 CARL
                        Belief is just a word for what we 
                        don’t know. People once believed the 
                        world was flat, the sun orbited the 
                        Earth, there was a man in the moon.

                                 NICK
                        A man! Who thought that was true?

                                 CARL
                        Everyone. Look you can see him still.

           He puts his arms around his son, uses Nick’s hands to point 
           out the face in the full moon’s craters. Nick’s not buying it.

                                 NICK
                        Those are just craters.

                                 CARL
                        But we had to go there to know that.
                        See everything changes... even truth.
                                 NICK
                        But your record won’t.

                                 CARL
                        No that, like my love for you, will 
                        live forever.

           Linda steps onto the porch behind them, calls loudly to Nick.

                                 LINDA
                        Alright Copernicus, time for bed!

           She heads back in where we see her laughing and drinking with 
           Tim. Nick rolls his eyes, slips his hand into Ann’s. Squeezes.

                                 NICK
                        Thanks for sharing your song.

           He beams at her, front teeth missing. Then skips to the house. 

                                 CARL
                        I think he’s in love.

                                 ANN
                        He’s so sweet. And smart. Must come 
                        from Linda.

           Carl pulls an imaginary dagger from his heart. Ann laughs. 

                                 ANN
                        Though clearly his flair for the 
                        dramatic comes from you.
                        (jokes aside now)
                        I’m concerned our record still isn’t 
                        diverse enough. It’s too Western. If 
                        our aim is to represent all humanity, 
                        we need to expand our chorus. 

                                 CARL
                        So what do you suggest?

                                 ANN
                        Include more voices, ethnic music. 
                        Though I honestly wouldn’t know the 
                        first place to start looking... 

           Carl squeezes her hand just like his son did.

                                 CARL
                        Good thing I know someone who will.

           They linger a moment together in the nightsong and moonlight, 
           as a Navajo Night Chant (track 9) begins--
           EXT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY - SCHOOL OF MUSIC - DAY  

           Summer light streams down on the bustling green quad fronting 
           Cornell’s Music School, where a WORLD FOLK FESTIVAL is under 
           way. Carl and Ann weave through a multicultural crowd to a 
           stage on which PROFESSOR ALAN LOMAX performs the Night Chant.

                                 ANN
                        Is that him?

           With his frumpy cardigan, owl eyebrows and untamed beard: the 
           famous ethnomusicologist looks entirely out of place among his 
           fellow dancers -- a circle of Native Americans in tribal garb. 
           Yet he sings and dances in perfect, passionate unison.

                                 CARL
                        What gave it away.

           Lomax finishes the dance in a sweaty flourish, takes the mic.

                                 LOMAX
                        Thank you! That was a Navajo Night 
                        Chant. Before that we had Melanesian 
                        pan pipes and a Javanese Gamelan. I’m 
                        Alan Lomax inviting all of you to 
                        support folk life, cultural equity, 
                        and the Global Jukebox. 

           He links hands with his fellow dancers and group-bows to wild 
           applause. Carl and Ann push forward as he steps off-stage. 

                                 CARL
                        Professor Lomax, got a minute?

           INT. LOMAX’S OFFICE - COLOMBIA UNIVERSITY 

           Lomax wipes sweat from his brow with a music sheet as he leads 
           Carl and Ann through a door labelled: “Dept of Cantometrics”. 
           Inside: a small office densely packed with exotic instruments, 
           recording gear, and a wall-sized, pinmarked MAP of the world.

                                 LOMAX
                        I can’t tell you how exciting this 
                        is: a record to represent humanity? I 
                        spent my life working on that dream. 

           He fumbles manically for a key, unlocks a hidden drawer. Pulls 
           out a carefully framed, triple laminated PLAYLIST.

                                 LOMAX 
                        Disclaimer: music is subjective. So 
                        no matter what you pick, some know-it-
                        all will disagree. That said, this is 
                        objectively and without question the 
                        greatest list of music ever compiled.
           He hands the list to Carl, letting go only reluctantly.

                                 CARL
                        It seems we share classical tastes.

                                 LOMAX
                        Well you can’t have a complete list 
                        without Beethoven and Bach.

           Carl shoots Ann a “I told you so” look. She rolls her eyes.

                                 LOMAX
                        But it’s the indigenous music that 
                        matters most. These songs transcend 
                        boundaries; they connect the dots of 
                        human culture, human spirit.

                                 ANN
                        We’d love to hear them.

                                 LOMAX
                        Ah, there’s the rub. I have some 
                        tracks, like the Georgian monks 
                        chanting “Tchakrulo”--

           He unlocks a hidden safe. Pulls out handmade tapes. Presses 
           play on Tchakrulo (track 10), sings along in lilting baritone.

                                 CARL
                        But the rest of it?

                                 LOMAX
                        Beyond rare. Near impossible to find. 

                                 ANN
                        So do you have a more practical list?

                                 LOMAX
                        Oh no, NO-NO. You don’t understand. 
                        These are perfect. Take track 11: the 
                        world’s most beautiful song, period. 
                        Unfortunately I was 23 when the Mbuti 
                        pygmies sang it to me in the forests 
                        of Zaire. I barely had money to eat 
                        back then let alone afford a recorder-

                                 CARL
                        What about Flowing Streams, track 13?

                                 LOMAX
                        Inarguably the single most important 
                        piece of music in 2500 years of 
                        Chinese history.
                                 ANN
                        Let me guess, you don’t have that 
                        either.

                                 LOMAX
                        I have the address of the 91 year old 
                        chin master who still plays it.

                                 CARL
                        Please tell me he’s in the Bronx.

                                 LOMAX
                        Yangshuo. And no substitute will do.

           Ann shakes her head as Carl matches Lomax’s song list to the 
           pins on the map of the world: Africa, India, China, Peru.

                                 CARL
                        We’d have to travel around the world 
                        to record half of these tracks.

           Lomax nods enthusiastically and unblinking.

                                 LOMAX
                        If you want a true blueprint of 
                        humanity all cultures should be given 
                        equal dignity on the playing field.

                                 CARL
                        We’ll start with the songs you have 
                        recorded. You mind if I borrow these?

                                 LOMAX
                        Of course.

           Carl reaches for the tapes; Lomax protectively yanks ‘em back.

                                 LOMAX
                        I meant of course I mind! 

                                 ANN
                        What if we just make copies?

           She soothes Lomax with a smile, gently takes back his playlist 
           and tapes as Cranes In Their Nest (track 11) begins to play--

           EXT. FALL CREEK GORGE - AFTERNOON

           Carl and Ann stroll together on Cornell’s scenic gorge trail, 
           the forest a riot of green. The waterfalls wild and swollen.

                                 CARL
                        Is it just me... or is Lomax one 
                        clock short of cuckoo?
                                 ANN
                        What’s crazy is I think he’s right.

                                 CARL
                        And that’s what concerns me, I agree! 
                        Though it goes against every 
                        scientific atom of my being.

                                 ANN
                        So we should book the plane tickets?

           They both laugh, not taking this truly seriously. Or are they?

                                 CARL
                        Honestly Ann, I’m not sure anymore 
                        what I’m doing.

           Not just the record he means. He’s questioning everything.

                                 ANN
                        You’re following your belief.

                                 CARL
                        Right off a cliff.

           They arrive at a gothic stone bridge overlooking Ithaca Falls. 
           Carl stares over the edge at the rocks far below. Conflicted.

                                 CARL
                        In the summer this is where lovers 
                        come to kiss. In the winter to jump. 

           He faces Ann, opening up, the most vulnerable we’ve seen.

                                 CARL
                        There’s a good chance I’m committing 
                        career suicide to pursue this. 

                                 ANN
                        And I quit my jobs. You know why? 
                        Precisely BECAUSE it’s so outrageous. 
                        And impossible. And romantic.

           She opens to him. The truth at the core of her being:

                                 ANN
                        If we don’t lose ourselves in 
                        something... we’re lost.

                                 CARL
                        But how do you know you’re not losing 
                        yourself in the wrong thing?

                                 ANN
                        You’re the scientist: you either 
                        examine the data, test every theory--
                                 CARL
                        Or?

                                 ANN
                        You follow the feeling.

           The sounds of the forest rush in: the roar of the falls, the 
           wind in the leaves. And they are alone, together in the mist. 

           As a haunting melody: Ugam (track 12) begins to play--

           INT. NASA - BRUCE MURRAY’S OFFICE - DAY      

           The music crescendoes as we PULL BACK on Bruce. A tape deck 
           blaring on his desk. Carl sits anxiously across from him.

                                 BRUCE
                        What the hell are we listening to?

                                 CARL
                        Azerbaijani bagpipes. Played by a 
                        Turkic shepherd to bring his flock 
                        together in the dark.

           Bruce closes his eyes. Listens. His brow furrowed.

                                 BRUCE
                        I like it.

                                 CARL
                        And that’s the problem. If we want  
                        great music like this, we have to pay 
                        for the rights, which is expensive 
                        and hard to track down. OR...

           Carl slides a proposal across the desk. Lomax’s list and map.

                                 CARL
                        We record it ourselves.

                                 BRUCE
                        I sincerely hope you aren’t asking me 
                        to pay for bagpipe lessons.

           He flips through Carl’s proposal. Eyes widening as he reads.

                                 BRUCE
                        China, India, Zaire, Peru... is this 
                        a joke or did you finally crack your 
                        head on the deep end?

                                 CARL
                        I have 12 days to finish my message. 
                        This is the only way to do it justice 
                        within the deadline you gave me.
                                 BRUCE
                        (shakes head in disbelief)
                        When you first brought this to me, I 
                        thought: Carl can’t be serious. Now I 
                        see you’re taking it too seriously. 

           He removes Ugam from a tapedeck. Slides back Carl’s proposal.  

                                 BRUCE
                        My advice as a friend: drop this now. 

                                 CARL
                        And if I don’t?

                                 BRUCE
                        Then as your boss I’m ordering you to 
                        quit. There is NO message, Carl. It’s 
                        over. Trust me, I’m saving your neck.

           With finality he shows Carl the door. Meeting and mission over-

           INT. FIRST TITLE BANK - LATER

           Carl is at a new desk now. A loan officer reviewing his Record 
           proposal. He hands it back to Carl. Hates giving out bad news.

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        I’m sorry, Dr. Sagan. I can’t approve 
                        a loan for something like this. 

                                 CARL
                        I understand. 

           The loan officer smiles, relieved. Only Carl isn’t finished.

                                 CARL
                        And I’d like to close my accounts.

           The loan officer’s smile drops. 

                                 LOAN OFFICER
                        You have several accounts here: joint 
                        savings, personal, and retirement. 
                        Which one would you like to cash out?

           Carl’s made up his mind now... and there’s no going back.

                                 CARL
                        (like a death sentence)
                        All of them.

           INT. SAGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 

           Frank and Jon both stand in front of their giant wall collage 
           of images. In each hand, they hold a final stack of photos.
                                 FRANK
                        We’ve narrowed it down to 200 images, 
                        but there’s only space on the record  
                        for 100. So we need you to decide. 

           REVERSE ON -- Nick, their impartial munchkin judge. 

                                 JON
                        You’re representing the entire human 
                        race. No pressure, go with your gut.

           On 3, they both lift their photos -- Jon’s: a glorious sunset  
           (#1) Frank’s: a man riding an elephant (#2). Nick picks Frank. 

                                 JON
                        Really? Mine has layers, clouds, 
                        color spectrum, birds in flight!

                                 NICK
                        (shrugs)
                        I like pachyderms.

                                 JON
                        Fine, lightning round.

           They lift two images of an island (#3). Nick picks Frank. Two 
           of a classroom (#4). Frank again. Two gymnasts (#5). Frank.

                                 JON
                        Ok Frank what did you bribe him with?

                                 NICK
                        A double brownie sundae.

                                 FRANK
                        I never said anything about brownies!

                                 JON
                        So much for an unbiased judge. 

           As Nick heads for the kitchen, Jon notices Carl tapping at the 
           window. He has to kick aside photobooks to pry open the door. 

                                 JON
                        How long you been standing there?

                                 CARL
                        Long enough to never again trust 
                        either of you with my son.

           He reaches in a closet, then tosses Frank an old camera.

                                 CARL
                        Here’s an idea: instead of fighting 
                        over the wrong images, you two should 
                        go take the right ones.
           A loud CRASH off-screen interrupts him followed by a scream:

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        OH MY GOD!

           All three men drop everything and race into the next room--

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Where they find Nick, casually eating a massive sundae as he 
           watches Linda and Tim, entangled on the floor. Hard to tell 
           for a beat if they’re hysterically laughing... or crying. 

                                 CARL
                        Is everyone alright? What happened?

                                 LINDA
                        Nothing. Except Tim’s a total genius.

                                 TIM
                        All I did was phone a few contacts. 
                        It was Linda’s brilliant idea.

           Ann bursts in from the other room.

                                 ANN
                        I heard a crash. Why are you guys on 
                        the floor?

                                 NICK
                        They were dancing.

           He gives Ann a chocolate sundae smile as if that explains it.

                                 LINDA
                        Celebrating. We figured out what the 
                        record’s missing... a Rosetta Stone! 

                                 TIM
                        See we were joking about what happens 
                        if aliens don’t speak English. How 
                        will they decode our message? 

                                 LINDA
                        So Tim called his contact at the UN--

                                 TIM
                        And the Secretary-General himself 
                        just signed on. With 30 ambassadors. 

           They talk so fast and giggle so much, it’s hard to keep up.

                                 CARL
                        What the hell are you talking about?
                                 LINDA
                        Hola. Buongiorno. Konnichiwa.

                                 TIM
                        That means hello in three languages.

                                 CARL
                        I know what it means.

           Again they burst into hysterics. Clearly stoned, or worse.

                                 LINDA
                        We’re gonna record greetings in every 
                        language. A kind of human dictionary.

                        Terrific! I still don't understand 
                        why you're entangled on the floor?

                                 LINDA
                        Because brilliant as he may be, your 
                        fiancé can’t dance to save his life.

           She springs to her feet. Twirls a victory dance around Carl. 
           Happier than we’ve seen. Something released inside her.

                                 CARL
                        Yet I leave you for two days and you 
                        turn into a ballerina. I thought you 
                        wanted nothing to do with the record?

                                 LINDA
                        I changed my mind. Why should you and 
                        Ann have all the fun? 

           A challenge here, invisible lines being drawn. 

                                 ANN
                        I thought you were too busy, Tim, to 
                        work on anything but your book?

                                 TIM
                        Linda needed my help so I decided to 
                        squeeze it in. Aren’t you the one who 
                        wanted me to get more involved?

                                 LINDA
                        I think we should all be dancing. Or 
                        did Bruce not grant your funding?

           All eyes on Carl. The whole team eager to know. Their mission 
           hinges on it. Carl locks eyes with Ann. Then lies to everyone.

                                 CARL
                        Actually, he did. Can I talk to you?
           He takes Linda’s hand, spins her to a stop.

           INT. MILKY WAY FOYER - TWILIGHT

           The painted stars of the model Milky Way glow neon around Carl 
           and Linda, who angrily reads Carl’s trip proposal. 

                                 LINDA
                        This is what you asked Bruce for?

                                 CARL
                        It’s just an idea.

                                 LINDA
                        I know you, Carl. Nothing’s ever JUST 
                        an idea with you. You’re committing.

                                 CARL
                        Not without you. Come with me.

                                 LINDA
                        To record pygmies?

                                 CARL
                        To preserve ancient cultures that are 
                        everyday vanishing. It’ll be the 
                        romantic getaway you’ve been wanting.

           This is a turning point for Carl. His grand romantic gesture.

                                 LINDA
                        8 days in 5 countries with monsoons 
                        and malaria doesn’t exactly sound 
                        like a romantic getaway to me. 

                                 CARL
                        I don’t understand. I thought you 
                        wanted to spend more time with me.

                                 LINDA
                        I wanted you to spend more time with 
                        your family. Not fly off to Timbuktu. 
                        And now with these UN greetings...

                                 CARL
                        Let Tim cover that.

                                 LINDA
                        Tim’s doing us enough favors as is. 
                        Plus this is the first thing I’ve 
                        done in years for me.

           She glances out the window where Tim sits writing alone, while 
           nearby Ann piggybacks Nick: recording a brewing thunderstorm.
                                 CARL
                        A month ago you wanted me to ditch 
                        the project, now suddenly you’re gung-
                        ho about the least important thing? 

                                 LINDA
                        Because only what you do has meaning? 

                                 CARL
                        Linda. Help me here cause I’m trying. 

                                 LINDA
                        And for once I’m finally achieving... 
                        something on my own. Be happy for me.

                                 CARL
                        I am. But I want you to come with me.

                                 LINDA
                        You don’t, trust me. Take Frank.

                                 CARL
                        You think he’s neurotic now? He’s 10 
                        times worse jet-lagged.

                                 LINDA
                        What about Jon?

                                 CARL
                        Just the word plane makes him panic. 

           Outside it starts to rain. Tim runs for cover but Ann doesn’t. 
           Instead she spins Nick, laughing. Linda follows Carl’s gaze.

                                 LINDA
                        It’s Ann you want to take.

                                 CARL
                        It’s you I’m asking.

                                 LINDA
                        Though we both know you’ll be happier 
                        without me--

           She hands back Carl’s proposal, decisive. A line in the sand.

                                 LINDA
                        You’ve made up your mind. So have I.

           She leaves Carl, alone amongst the stars. His eyes connect 
           with Ann, as the ROAR of thunder grows louder and LOUDER and--
           EXT. ITHACA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CLOSE ON:

           A 747 comes barreling STRAIGHT AT US down a runway! Engines 
           thundering as it lifts off, just clearing Frank! Who straddles 
           the top of the tarmac fence, snapping photos on Carl’s camera.

                                 FRANK
                        Jon, you have to come try this, it 
                        feels like you’re touching God!

           He SHOUTS with glee as Jon fidgets anxiously in an idling car.

                                 JON
                        That’s because you’re an inch away 
                        from shaking his hand in heaven. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’m an atheist. We don’t believe in 
                        heaven.

                                 JON
                        How about hell?

           He points at a convoy of security cars SCREAMING toward them. 
           Frank quick-scrambles off the fence; dives through the window.  

                                 JON
                        Tell me you got the shot.

                                 FRANK
                        I dunno. I hope so. Let’s roll!

           Only Jon doesn’t. He pins Frank with a glare.

                                 JON
                        You don’t know? If we’re going to 
                        prison, you better have got the shot.

                                 FRANK
                        Forget prison, if you don’t drive 
                        right now, we’re gonna get a whole 
                        different kind of shot.

           He jams Jon’s foot to the pedal and they PEEL OUT, airport 
           security fishtailing in their dust. Both men howling like 
           madmen as they now race past the-- 

           EXT. DEPARTURE TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

           Where Tim and Linda are just dropping off Carl and Ann.

                                 CARL
                        We’ll be back in a week. You sure you 
                        can handle the UN alone?
                                 LINDA
                        I’ve been married to you for 9 years; 
                        I think I can handle stubborn men.
                        (speaking of which)
                        It’s not too late to change your mind-

                                 CARL
                        It’s not too late to change yours.

           He leans in to kiss her, gets only a cold and cursory cheek.

                                 CARL
                        I’ll call you when we land in Peru.

                                 LINDA
                        Call Nick, he’ll be more excited to 
                        talk to you.

           Carl nods, stung. Ann and Tim share a more intimate parting.

                                 ANN
                        You really don’t mind me going?

                                 TIM
                        Of course not, I’m actually looking 
                        forward to the lack of distraction.

                                 ANN
                        I’ll give you a sec to rephrase that.

                                 TIM
                        You know what I mean. I can focus on 
                        finishing my book. By the time you’re 
                        back I should have my edits complete.
                        (takes her hands)
                        I know I haven’t been so available, 
                        but I promise we’ll plan the wedding 
                        when you return. That is, if you 
                        still wanna marry me.

           He leans in to kiss her playfully, but Ann stops his lips.

                                 TIM
                        Is that a no?

           She looks into his eyes, a long contemplative beat. 

                                 ANN
                        No to the “no”.

           She kisses him. Their routine. Only now, less passionately. 
           Carl cuts in with their bags, all heavy audio equipment.

                                 CARL
                        Don’t worry, Tim. I’ll keep her safe.
                                 ANN
                        Me safe? Worry about yourself.

           She hefts her AND Carl’s bag overshoulder and without waiting, 
           heads for the gate...as another jet ROARS OVERHEAD soaring us--

           EXT. MACHU PICCHU, PERU - DAY

           Into a cloudless blue sky. On the terraced slopes above the 
           ancient Incan city, Carl and Ann now record a group of Andean 
           llama herders playing the Panpipes and Drum Song (track 13).

           EXT. GATE OF THE SUN - MAGIC HOUR

           The sun sets as Carl and Ann stroll together on the Incan 
           Trail above the famous ruins, surrounded by snowcapped peaks.

                                 ANN
                        It’s incredible isn’t it, yesterday 
                        my world was the size of a shoebox 
                        apartment. And now--

           She takes in the peaks, the stone ruins, the misty valley.

                                 CARL
                        Nothing like travel to remind you how 
                        tiny and insignificant we really are.

                                 ANN
                        You make that sound like a good thing-

                                 CARL
                        You think it’s bad? 

                                 ANN 
                        These strangers just sang us a song 
                        passed down from generations of llama 
                        herders. All living and loving, 
                        suffering and dying. Then there’s me. 
                        In a world with so many people, what 
                        difference can I make? Can anybody?

                                 CARL
                        It’s not who we are that counts, it’s 
                        our legacy. Like that song or this 
                        city. Nobody knows why the Inca built 
                        it, what purpose it served or why 
                        they left it. But still, it’s here.

           Below them Machu Picchu is bathed in the sun’s last light.

                                 ANN
                        But is that it? The best we can hope 
                        is to leave a tiny mark on eternity? 
                        I mean what if no one finds Voyager.
                                 CARL
                        Even if we are the only two people to 
                        ever hear this record, it’s worth it. 
                        Because right now what we do makes a 
                        difference. To you and me.

           Maybe it’s the altitude, or the way the light touches off the 
           mountains and settles around their feet. But for this moment, 
           they may as well be the only two people in this world.

           Until they’re interrupted by one of the Andean musicians from 
           before, accompanied by his daughter: a pretty Incan girl.

                                 INCAN MUSICIAN
                        My daughter ask sing special wedding 
                        song for you. Old-time. Much beauty. 

           Carl and Ann both step apart, laughing awkwardly.

                         ANN
                                                CARL
                 Oh, that’s sweet...
                                      But we’re not--

           The girl exchanges words with her dad, who smiles slyly.

                                 INCAN MUSICIAN
                        She insists. For future blessings.

           Ann shares a bemused look with Carl who pulls out a recorder. 

                                 CARL
                        Who knows, it may end up being our 
                        favorite song on the whole thing.

           He holds out a mic, presses PLAY as the girl begins to sing 
           The Wedding Song (track 14)--

           EXT. MID-TOWN EAST - NEW YORK CITY - MORNING 

           The romantic acapella lullaby is CUT SHORT by the blare of NYC 
           traffic as Linda wild-drives Carl’s porsche toward the UN, 
           while Tim tunes the radio to Fleetwood Mac’s Go Your Own Way.

                                 TIM
                        Slow down, Nascar. You tempted the 
                        reaper enough on the turnpike. Let’s 
                        not greet him 3 blocks from the UN.

                                 LINDA
                        We’re meeting the head of the most 
                        important political organization in 
                        the world, I won’t be late.

                        Death is a pretty serious delay.

                        You know I appreciate you coming down 
                        with me but you really don’t have to--

                                 TIM
                        What, help you? Unfortunately I do. 
                        I’ve a weakness for pretty damsels in-

           Linda SLAMS on both her brakes and HORN as a bus cuts her off.

                        I’m NO damsel. And I’m certainly not--

                        time you painted something?

           This catches Linda offguard. She measures Tim as she drives.

                                 LINDA
                        How did you know that I...

                        There’s a room under the stairs in 
                        your house filled with art-school 
                        easels, cake-dried paints and dusty 
                        canvases. You wanted to be an artist 
                        once and you were good. 
                        (piercing her with this)
                        But one day you woke up and realized 
                        the picture you created was something 
                        else entirely. Beautiful yes, but not 
                        a painting. You wouldn’t trade it of 
                        course: you have Carl, you have Nick, 
                        you’re happy. But you can’t help 
                        wonder now and then when you smell 
                        linseed oil or wander alone through a 
                        museum what your life might have been-
                        (beat)
                        Recording these greetings is not the 
                        same as painting. But it’s a start. 
                        It’s yours. It’s something.

           Linda swerves the car to a stop outside the UNITED NATIONS, 
           where flags of every country in the world flap in the breeze. 
           She tries to hide it... but Tim’s stripped her to the bone.

                                 LINDA
                        You always snoop through peoples’ 
                        personal lives?
                                 TIM
                        I’m a journalist. I’m always looking 
                        for a good scoop.

           By that he means her. And she knows it. And it’s flattering. 

                                 LINDA 
                        Well you should choose more wisely. 
                        There are 4 billion people in this 
                        world, all more interesting than me. 

                                 TIM
                        Don’t sell yourself short so quickly.

                                 LINDA
                        And what about you? Why not write 
                        your story instead of other peoples’.

                                 TIM
                        Benjamin Franklin said either write 
                        something worth reading or do 
                        something worth writing. I’m still 
                        working on the second one.

                                 LINDA 
                        Well Tim, recording these greetings 
                        isn’t the same as writing, but it’s 
                        something... 

           She grabs a recorder and pulls Tim toward the iconic building.

                                 LINDA
                        And if I can start, then so can you.

           INT. UNITED NATIONS - CONTINUOUS

           The two push into the United Nations’ grand marble lobby where 
           they’re personally met by KURT WALDHEIM: the tall, sharp 
           featured, piercingly blue-eyed Austrian Secretary-General. 

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Mrs. Sagan, we’ve been expecting you. 
                        (checks his watch)
                        Here at the UN we consider tardiness 
                        to be the second greatest crime 
                        against humanity.

                                 LINDA
                        Our apologies, Mr. Secretary-General.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        And now you’ve committed the first. 
                        Never apologize for anything. 
           A joke clearly, though Waldheim doesn’t smile. Instead he 
           shakes their hands with a stiff, nazi-like vigor.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Follow me, we are very excited to 
                        help NASA record these greetings. 
                        Many ambassadors have been preparing 
                        their remarks all morning.

           He guides them around a bend to the UN sound studio, where a 
           line of ambassadors snakes down the hall. All very serious-- 

           At the front: France gargles salt water, Spain warms up with 
           tongue twisters, England practices what sounds like a Macbeth 
           monologue, and China sweats as he redmarks a 4 page speech. 

           Linda and Tim exchange a look.

                                 LINDA
                        Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General. You 
                        have made our job amazingly easy but--

                                 TIM
                        We were planning to record short 
                        greetings, not speeches. You know: 
                        hola, bonjour, live long and prosper.

           He flashes a Vulcan salute. Waldheim stares at him unblinking.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        As Secretary-General speaking for the 
                        entire assembly... you WILL permit me 
                        a slightly longer greeting. 

           Not a question. All diplomats watching. Tim and Linda fold.

                                 TIM/LINDA
                        Of course/Absolutely!

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Good then let’s get started shall we?

           INT. SOUND STUDIO - UNITED NATIONS - CONTINUOUS

           A recording light blinks on. An analog tape rolls static. A 
           microphone lowers from above. Waldheim clears his throat then-- 

                                 WALDHEIM
                        As Secretary General of the United 
                        Nations, I send greetings on behalf 
                        of the people of our planet...

           Our “Blue Marble” (photo #6) is tacked to the “winner wall”  
           now covered in images including Jon’s jet takeoff (photo #7). 
           Onto the Earth pic Jon DRAWS symbols of the essential elements 
           for life (water, oxygen, etc), as Frank delegates nearby.

                        ...we step out of our solar system 
                        into the universe seeking only peace 
                        and friendship...

           Frank leans in closer putting his arm around Jon’s shoulder. 
           As he fixes a mistake, Nick squeezes in between, on the phone. 
           He studies the Earth, then pins his finger onto Africa as we--

           EXT. CONGO - DAY 

           TELESCOPE DOWN from god’s view into the continent. Zeroing in 
           through cloud cover past Kinshasa to a forest village. 

           Where Carl cradles an old phone to ear, the only one in town, 
           as a tribe of Mbuti pygmy children surround him playfully.  

                                 WALDHEIM (V.O.)
                        ...to teach if we are called upon...

           Ann too is encircled by pygmy women who reach up to touch her 
           freckles, her hair. For them she plays her tape recorder: the 
           panpipes song she recorded in Peru. The tribeswomen jump back 
           in shock, then press forward to listen, eyes wide with wonder.

                                 WALDHEIM (V.O.)
                        ...to be taught if we are fortunate.

           One begins to sing. Voice blending in, then transcending as--

           EXT. ITURI FOREST - LATER

           The music now subtly shifts, taking on new voices as sunlight 
           filters through high rainforest canopy like strands of gold. 

           Ann and Carl join hands with a circle of pygmies who dance 
           together, arms and voices raised in polyphonic harmony: the 
           Pygmy Girls Initiation Song (track 15).

                                 WALDHEIM (V.O.)
                        We know full well that our planet and 
                        all its inhabitants are but a small 
                        part of the immense universe that 
                        surrounds us...
           Carl and Ann lock eyes on each other, no longer just recording 
           but joining as one in this joyous celebration of being alive.

                                                 AS WE RETURN TO:
           INT. SOUND STUDIO - UNITED NATIONS 

           Where the crowd of diplomats has fallen quiet as Waldheim 
           finishes his speech.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        ...and it is with humility and hope 
                        that we take this step.

           He takes one now, back from the mic. Silence of a pin-drop.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Was that short enough?

           This breaks the spell. Linda and Tim as one stop the taping. 

                          TIM
                                                LINDA
                     That was...
                                      Perfect. Inspiring. 

           She shakes hands with the Secretary-General enthusiastically.

                                 LINDA
                        More than we hoped for truly.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Because I can always add “May the 
                        force be with you” at the end.

           For the first time he cracks a smile. Just fucking with Tim. 

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know what that means.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        You’re sending a message to space and 
                        you haven’t seen Star Wars yet!

                                 TIM
                        That the movie that opened last week?

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Why do you think so many ambassadors 
                        signed on to record space greetings. 

                                 LINDA
                        Well we thank you Secretary-General 
                        for organizing it so quickly and 
                        cutting out the normal red tape.

                                 WALDHEIM
                        Politics don’t always have to be 
                        about one-upsmanship and rivalry.
           He shakes hands and exits. Leaving Linda alone with Tim.

                                 TIM
                        You know for the first time I feel 
                        good about this whole thing.

           They share an excited grin as the next delegate walks in. 

                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR
                        Bonjour. Monsieur Secretary-General 
                        gave a beautiful speech, non? I feel 
                        it only fair my country which birthed 
                        the Enlightenment and Belle Epoque 
                        gets equal time as one which led the 
                        greatest genocide in history.

           She pulls out a book of Baudelaire‘s poetry, pushes her way to 
           the mic and in dramatic fashion begins, in French, to read.

                                 TIM
                        Well, so much for diplomacy.

           SOUND now surges in. A barrage of Hindi catcalls surround Ann 
           and Carl as they wade through a crowd of rickshaw drivers 
           fighting for their fare on the oversaturated streets of India.

           The boldest driver half-coaxes, half-pulls them to his neon-
           painted bajaj. Their only choice is to surrender, then cling 
           for dear life as he careens into the frantic crush of traffic.

           EXT. AGRA SLUMS - CONTINUOUS

           Their moto-rickshaw rollercoasters down a narrow road in the 
           heart of a massive slum. All around scenes of extreme poverty 
           flash by at dizzying speed. The breadth of it is astounding. 

                                 ANN  
                        Whether we like it or not the reality 
                        of most human existence is suffering. 
           They pass a mother beating a snarling mongrel away from trash 
           scraps. Slumdog children playing cricket among the tin-can 
           homes. A legless beggar praying in the road.

                                 CARL
                        So what are you saying, we should 
                        show misery, pain, despair?

                                 ANN
                        They’re as much who we are as 
                        anything. Yet everything we’ve chosen 
                        for our record so far is positive.

                                 CARL
                        Isn’t that what you wanted: to make 
                        something that uplifts and inspires.

                                 ANN
                        Of course, but don’t we also have a 
                        responsibility to present the truth?

           Their driver swerves wildly to avoid a head-on collision with 
           a colorful overpacked bus, throwing Carl and Ann against each 
           other. They hold here a beat. Then Carl shouts to slow down. 

           Instead the driver spins around, head-wagging to placate Carl. 
           Ann shrieks as an emaciated cow wanders into the road ahead.

           Their rickshaw veers last minute... slicing down an alley onto 
           a wider road. Up ahead a mob buzzes around an ugly collision.

                                 CARL
                        Now he slows.

           A taxi has collided with a spice cart. Dried cumin spills out 
           in a river from which a hysterical man lifts a bleeding child. 
           A mob swarms like a cloud of angry hornets, shaking the taxi. 

                                 CARL
                        Is this really what you want an alien 
                        culture to see? Human brutality.

                                 ANN
                        You told me that if we succeed, our 
                        message may become the only surviving 
                        record of life on Earth. Aren’t we 
                        doing a disservice if we don’t show 
                        all sides: the dark and the light. 

           She stops their driver, leaps out to help. But the child is 
           already being carried off safely. And now the mob turns on the 
           reckless cabby. Carl pulls Ann back toward the rickshaw.

                        Every choice we make excludes 
                        another.

                                 CARL  (CONT'D)
                        To show EVERYTHING, Ann, is 
                        impossible. And crazy as it sounds, 
                        what if one day we give up violence, 
                        solve poverty, cure disease, end 
                        hunger, unite our common humanity 
                        toward the higher goal of peace. 

                                 ANN
                        You’re right, that is crazy.

           But she smiles, relieved as the cab driver emerges. Prostrates 
           himself in forgiveness, as Carl and Ann’s rickshaw pulls away.

                                 CARL
                        This message can either be a record 
                        of who we are now... or a symbol for 
                        what we’d like to be. 

                                 ANN
                        And what symbol is that?

           But the way he’s looking at her, she knows the answer already.

                                 CARL
                        The only one that makes the vastness 
                        bearable.

           Ahead the famed white domes of the Taj Mahal rise like a 
           vision beyond the slums: the ultimate symbol of love. As the 
           soaring Indian raga Jaat Kahan Ho (track 16) begins--

           EXT. TAJ MAHAL - DAY

           CLOSE ON: a sitar, henna-tattooed fingers plucking its many 
           chords; an upraised face: almond eyes, red painted dot of a 
           bindi, a mouth full and brimming with song.

           Mirrored in the water of the Taj’s reflecting pool, an orange-
           robed swami (holy person) intones a raw, almost mystical tune. 
           At her feet Carl and Ann listen in awe.  

           As the bars on Carl’s recorder rise and fall with the song, 
           something unspoken passes between them: silent and profound.

           INT. TAJ MAHAL - MAUSOLEUM

           The music carries us through the high-domed halls, the vaulted 
           arches etched in sensuous calligraphy. Ann and Carl propelled 
           by the swirling rhythm, the spellbound beauty at every corner.

           They drift across the great marble floors, a dance between 
           them: tango of the eyes. Drawn together. Somehow woven by the 
           music; the mystique of this moment. The push-pull of desire.  
           EXT. TAJ MAHAL - REFLECTING POOLS 

           Rain ripples across the water, shrouding the image of the Taj.

           EXT. TAJ MAHAL - GREAT GATE 

           A wave of visitors rush for shelter from the sudden downpour. 
           In the crush, Carl and Ann get pressed close together. That 
           electric proximity. Hum of lightening in the air. 

           The music swells, hastening it’s heartfelt final notes. Carl 
           looks at Ann, their faces too close. Then she takes his hand. 
           Where everyone pushes in, she pulls him out. Into the STORM. 

           EXT. TAJ MAHAL HOTEL - MONSOON

           Carl and Ann run hand-in-hand down the flooded streets of 
           Agra; monsoon rain now full-blown. The two of them as wild as 
           free as the storm. Happy, bone-soaked, they reach their hotel.

                                 ANN
                        This is crazy!

           It’s not the storm she means.

                                 CARL
                        You’re shivering.

           Not from the cold. Carl wraps her in his arms, rubs her warm--

           INT. SOUND STUDIO - UNITED NATIONS - SIMULTANEOUS

           Linda rubs Tim’s arm, jolting him awake at the mixing board, 
           where a stack of tapes are now piled high. He checks a clock.

                                 LINDA
                        Don’t bother, the sun set last week.

           On the mic, the Indian Ambassador reads from a 9 page speech. 

                                 TIM
                        I swear the amount of hot air we’ve 
                        collected could fuel NASA’s fleet.

                                 LINDA
                        Do you think we can cut him off?

                                 TIM
                        As long we do it tactfully.

           That’s all Linda needs. She rises, clapping her hands loudly.
                                 LINDA
                        Thank you, we just ran out of tape.

                                 INDIAN AMBASSADOR
                        But I didn’t finish...

                                 LINDA
                        It was great, we’ve got what we need.

           She quickly escorts the flustered ambassador out the door.

                                 INDIAN AMBASSADOR
                        This is an outrage. As ambassador to 
                        the world’s 2nd most populous country 
                        I should get the 2nd longest speech. 
                        Who is your supervisor at NASA? I’m 
                        filing a complaint immediately!

                                 LINDA 
                        Feel free. Just please keep your 
                        complaint shorter than your greeting.

           Like a mute button on a TV she shuts the soundproof door.

                                 TIM
                        If that was you being tactful, I’m 
                        eager to see you tactless.

                                 LINDA
                        Then you better buy me a drink.

           EXT. WORLD BAR - NIGHT

           An empty shot glass SLAMS DOWN onto a bar. 

                                 TIM
                        Two more please. And some martinis.

           He carries the drinks out to a rooftop balcony overlooking the 
           lit-up UN building below where Linda is taking a photo (#8).

                                 LINDA
                        Imagine if every light were a star, 
                        every skyscraper its own galaxy...

                                 TIM
                        It’d take a billion years just for 
                        our message to cross 34th street. 

           They clink glasses. 

                                 TIM
                        Tell me what’s it like being married?
                                 LINDA 
                        (ala Groucho Marx)
                        Oh it’s a wonderful institution, but 
                        who wants to live in an institution? 

                                 TIM
                        Only hopeless romantics and the 
                        criminally insane.

                                 LINDA
                        Aren’t those the same thing?

                                 TIM
                        And here I took you for Cinderella 
                        happily swept off her feet.

                                 LINDA
                        No, I was never a girl who grew up on 
                        fairytales. I read more philosophy, 
                        so my view of romance was shaped by 
                        Plato more than princes. You ever 
                        read his Symposium on Love?

                                 TIM
                        The one about prisoners in a cave?

                                 LINDA
                        No, this one’s a bit more uplifting.

           She downs her drink, leans in:

                                 LINDA
                        When the world was made, men and 
                        women were not separate but rather 
                        two beings joined by one soul. Only 
                        together we were too powerful, so the 
                        gods split us with lightning bolts. 
                        Leaving us to wander the earth alone, 
                        seeking, longing for our lost half. 
                        So that when we find each other, if 
                        we ever do, we once again become 
                        complete, inseparable, whole.

                                 TIM
                        I’m sorry but that sounds like the 
                        oldest fairytale of all.

                                 LINDA
                        You don’t believe in soulmates?

                                 TIM
                        I spent the past two years writing 
                        about what they call the Red Limit: 
                        the end of the universe. And you know 
                        what I discovered? It doesn’t exist.

                                 TIM (CONT'D)
                        It’s always expanding. And so are 
                        you, me, love, everything. 

                                 LINDA
                        What does that mean exactly.

                                 TIM
                        I don’t believe we were made to be 
                        bound to any one person absolutely. 
                        Nature doesn’t work that way. 

                                 LINDA
                        Then why marry Ann... or anybody? 

                                 TIM
                        Because things expand together as 
                        often as they grow apart.

           He’s talking about himself, but it resonates deeply with her. 

                                 LINDA
                        I think I need another drink.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - INDIA   

           Steaming chai pours into teacups as Ann enters the door

                        ever done. Because he knew we weren’t 
                        right. That’s what he told me...

           She leans close. Only inches separating them. And a thousand 
           doors they could open, a thousand doors they might close.

                        Have you?

           Ann stares deep into Carl’s eyes, a terrifically long pause.

                                 ANN
                        I’m not sure anymore.

           Silence overtakes them both. Outside the rain intensifies its 
           rhythmic pulse until it’s almost unbearable. Carl leans in.

                        I should call Tim.

           She pulls away. And like that, their second is gone. She exits 
           fast, a brief look back. As a RINGING PHONE carries us into--
           INT. TIM’S APARTMENT - WITCHING HOUR

           The door SLAMS OPEN as Tim and Linda stumble in drunk and half-
           asleep. They trip over the couch together, laughing. 

                                 TIM
                        Warning: objects are closer than they 
                        appear.

                                 LINDA
                        Now I understand why they call it 
                        crashing.

           She climbs onto the couch. Tim throws a blanket at her.

                                 LINDA
                        You know I was just as happy sleeping 
                        in that alley on the street.

                                 TIM
                        What’s a lumpy couch among friends.

           Through all this the phone RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.

                                 LINDA
                        Shouldn’t you get that?

                                 TIM
                        I’m in no condition to operate heavy 
                        machinery.

           He crawls to the phone, his MACHINE answers before he can:

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Tim, it’s Frank. What happened at the 
                        UN? Bruce Murray called me screaming. 
                        He’s threatening to ax our project! 
                        We gotta contact Carl immediately. 

           Linda and Tim share a guilty look--

                                 LINDA
                        Carl is gonna kill me.

           Then they burst out laughing. For some reason right now it’s 
           the funniest thing on earth. Then, a drunken moment of truth:

                                 TIM
                        You know I think your true half is 
                        still out there, looking for you.

           Linda stops laughing. Shares a heartfelt moment with Tim.

                                 LINDA
                        And I sincerely hope someday the 
                        universe will stop expanding for you.
           Tim smiles, tucks her in. Rises to leave. Linda stops him.

                                 LINDA
                        Tim, do you really like my paintings?

           He answers by kissing her forehead. Then flicks off the light.

           INT. AIRPORT BOARDING GATE - INDIA - THE NEXT DAY

           A line of travellers file past a HONG KONG departure sign onto 
           a plane as the PA announces final boarding. At the back of the 
           line, Ann checks her watch nervously. Then ditches her bags to 
           go on a frantic search for Carl.

           She finds him at a nearby payphone furiously scribbling notes.

                                 CARL
                        Contact.

           Ann steps into Carl. Kisses him slowly on his forehead. His 
           right eye. His left cheek. For a moment neither breathes. 
           Then, before he can speak, she turns and walks onto the plane.

           EXT. NASA JET PROPULSION LAB - THE NEXT DAY

           A towncar pulls up to meet a mob of press and protestors 
           camped outside the main entrance. Bruce steps out, alarmed.

           Half the people wave signs and banners: “NASA has doomed us 
           all" and "Guess who’s coming to dinner... Aliens!” The other 
           half throw vinyl, shout their picks for the Golden Record.

           Bruce pushes his way into the building like a thunderstorm.

           INT. JET PROPULSION LAB - ENGINEER BAY

           Sparks fly as NASA technicians torch, bolt and assemble the 
           Voyager spacecrafts. Carl’s waiting for Bruce as he enters.

                                 BRUCE
                        Just the man I want to see.

                                 BRUCE
                        Oh, but I can. In fact I was under 
                        the impression that I already did. 

           He juggernauts through the bustling dock, Carl at his heels.

                                 BRUCE 
                        And in case you didn’t notice, this 
                        is our mission. This is our focus.

           Bruce points at the impressive, expensive operation underway. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Everything you’ve done has been a 
                        distraction from that.

                                 CARL
                        Bruce, just listen--

                        I DID, CARL! You didn’t. Do you have 
                        any idea how many wild fires I had to 
                        put out today? Everyone from NASA’s 
                        top brass to the Secretary of State.

                        made NASA look like a pack of fools. 

           He pushes past, end of discussion. But Carl doesn’t back down.

                                 CARL
                        You and I may disagree on many 
                        things, but we both want proof of 
                        life. This record is our best shot.

                                 BRUCE
                        The record’s dead, Carl. Far as I’m 
                        concerned... so are you. 
                                 (MORE)

                        say, you’ll be off all future NASA 
                        missions too. 

           He storms away leaving Carl for the first time lost for words.

           INT. SAGAN HOUSE - NICK’S ROOM - MORNING

           Nick lies on his space-themed bed, planet pillows pressed to 
           his ears. Through his walls come the angry sounds of fighting--

           INT. SAGAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           It’s a war-zone, battle lines drawn by Linda’s suitcases and 
           clothing as she furiously packs. Carl’s at a loss. 

                                 CARL
                        I don’t know what you want me to say.

                                 LINDA
                        Try ANYTHING. Try “I’m sorry”. 

                                 CARL
                        I can fix this.

           Linda’s on fire and that’s kerosene. She EXPLODES.

                                 LINDA
                        How Carl? You lied to me. You spent 
                        our life savings on your obsession. 
                        And now it’s cost us EVERYTHING! 

                                 CARL
                        You’re right, I took a risk and I 
                        should’ve told you. But this record--

           Linda screams. 

                                 LINDA
                        WHO CARES ABOUT THE FUCKING RECORD!

           And now she’s fighting back tears with every fiber she’s got.

                                 LINDA
                        I don’t know how we got so far from 
                        where we started. But this isn’t who 
                        I am. And I can’t get back. If not to 
                        what we had... then at least to 
                        something recognizable.

           A confession, a crossroad, a cry in the dark.
                                 LINDA
                        You told me that of all the stars in 
                        the sky, even the brightest burn out. 

           She stuffs the last of her clothes in bags. Carl stops her.

                                 CARL
                        I don’t care about the stars anymore.

                                 LINDA
                        But you do. You always will. And I 
                        can’t keep holding onto the flicker 
                        of a light we long ago lost.

           Before Carl can say another word she grabs her bags and exits.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - SAGAN HOUSE - DAY

           Linda loads suitcases and painting supplies into a car. Nick’s 
           belted in the back seat, confused and upset. Carl races out.

                                 CARL
                        Linda please...

                                 LINDA
                        I’m making this easier for us both. I 
                        love you, Carl. But love isn’t 
                        supposed to make you feel lost.

           She gets in the car and drives off. Stronger than she thought. 
           Nick watches in the rear window as his father fades from view.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Carl reenters in a daze. His life’s come unraveled. From the 
           other room, a CRASH suddenly jolts him back. He moves to 
           investigate as the sound of heated whispers grows louder--

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Oh shit, I think he’s back.

                                 JON (O.S.)
                        Did he hear us?

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Carl opens the door to find Frank and Jon huddled under a red 
           lamp: dozens of wet photos drying on towel racks; the window 
           blacked out with aluminum. The tub a giant developing bath.  

                                 JON/FRANK
                        Hey Carl.
                                 CARL
                        What did you do to my bathroom!

                                 JON
                        We needed a photolab. 

                                 CARL
                        Have you been in here the whole time?

                                 FRANK
                        I told Jon not to listen...

                                 CARL
                        So what’s that microphone for?

           He points to the big boom mic Frank’s hiding behind his back. 

                                 FRANK
                        The important thing to remember is we 
                        hear your heart. And it’s beautiful.

           He presses the boom to the wrong side of Carl’s chest. Jon who 
           wears headphones, nods like he’s listening along; SHOUTS loud--

                                 JON
                        ALSO WE FINISHED ALL THE PHOTOS!

           He gives Carl an unwanted hug. Whispers in his ear, heartfelt:

                                 JON
                        Don’t worry, it’ll all work out.

                                 FRANK
                        (slightly crazed)
                        Will it, Jon? I mean do you know that 
                        for a fact. Do you possess magic?

                                 JON
                        I’m just trying to be nice.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s too bad, ‘cause for a second I 
                        thought you were actually psychic.

                                 CARL
                        Are you two stoned?

                                 FRANK
                        Absolutely not! We took mushrooms.

           He joins the huddle with Jon, all 3 faces a little too close.

                                 JON
                        What are you going to do now, Carl?

           And for perhaps the first time in his entire life--
                                 CARL
                        I have no idea.

           He lets this sink as Flowing Streams (track 17) begins to play-

           EXT. YULONG RIVER - CHINA - DAY

           Dawn mist drifts over emerald waters. A white crane glides 
           past an ancient bamboo raft drifting lazily down a wide, 
           tranquil riverscape. All around, tall green limestone peaks 
           rise majestically like the spines of sleeping dragons.

           Ann gazes out at this mystical land that has inspired painters 
           and poets for millennia. At the flowing stream lapping against 
           her raft: the same stream embodied in this 2500 year old song. 

           At the front of her raft a wizened 91 year old master MUSICIAN 
           plays a ch’in: an ancient 7-stringed zither; the oldest and 
           most revered instrument in China. 

           His music is incredibly simple. There are no words. Just a man 
           and the haunting vibrato of his strings. Lomax was right...

           It’s the most beautiful song Ann’s ever heard.

           EXT. YULONG RIVER - CHINA - NIGHT

           The song continues as Ann stands on the balcony of her hotel 
           room overlooking the moonlit river and majestic peaks beyond. 
           She cradles a phone to her ear. It rings and rings.

                                 ANN
                        Where are you? Pick up.

           But no one does. She waits one more ring then goes to hang up--

                        Can I call you back?

           Her smile drops. Not the loving response she was expecting.

                                 ANN
                        NO. I’m in China. And I’ve been 
                        trying to reach you since I left.

                        Annie. I’ll see you when I get back.

           He can’t get off fast enough. Ann fights to keep him on.

                                 ANN
                        I understand.

           A lie for him. A moment of truth for Ann.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I’ll see you in a few days. Bye.

                        Tim I--

           But he’s gone. Ann sets down the phone. Stares up at the full 
           moon, the stars. Then picks up the phone again and calls Carl.

           INT. MILKY WAY FOYER - SAGAN HOUSE - DUSK 

           The house is empty now, quiet. Carl wanders among his stars, 
           lost in thought. The phone rings, but he lets the machine pick 
           up. Its blinking red eye beckons like a beacon in the dark--

                                 ANN (V.O.)
                        I know it’s late but I had to call--
           EXT. YULONG RIVER - CHINA - DAWN

           On the balcony of Ann’s hotel, a sleepless night has given way 
           to the gold tinged half-light of dawn. Ann gazes at the stars.

           Into her phone she plays Flowing Streams (part 2, track 18).

                                 ANN 
                        To share with you this song. Because 
                        it’s what our whole message is about.

           EXT.  SAGAN HOUSE - PORCH - TWILIGHT

           The same gold tinged half-light fills the sky as Carl gazes at 
           the same faint stars above. The song connecting them together.

                                 ANN (V.O.)
                        I can’t explain it in words. Maybe 
                        that’s the point. We can never share 
                        ourselves entirely with someone else. 
                        Yet we try regardless. We cast 
                        ourselves into the darkness and we 
                        hope. And though everything in the 
                        universe seems stacked against us, 
                        sometimes... we find each other.

           Carl wrestles with his emotions. Lifts a phone. Slowly dials. 
           As it rings...the SCREEN SPLITS IN HALF. Ann answers, knowing:

                                 ANN
                        Carl.

                        I’ve been waiting my whole life for a 
                        message like yours.

           And now his truth:

                        I only wish you left it 10 years ago.

           Across the world Ann laughs... but her heart’s in her throat.

                                 ANN
                        Part of me hoped you wouldn’t call.

                        And the rest of you?

           Was up all night waiting. But she won’t say that.

                        If I’d gotten on that plane with you?

                        I don’t know.

           But he does. And now his moment’s slipping away from him like 
           so many grains of sand. So many stars. And then...

                                 CARL
                        I would have found you, wherever you 
                        are. On the banks of the widest 
                        river. And swam into your arms.

           Just like that the whole world stops.

           And there it is, no turning back. 

                                 CARL
                        If we do this it has to be for keeps.

                        NASA’s banned it from the launch.
           His confession. A moment of silence as Ann lets this sink in. 

                                 CARL
                        It’s my fault. I lied to the team, to 
                        you. I let everyone down.

           For a man who just lost everything, Ann gives Carl a way back.

           screen on their individual reactions: a stunned beat. Then... 
           ANN’s side blacks out. Hold on Carl. A smile blossoming as we--

           INT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY - LECTURE HALL 

           Carl animatedly teaches his popular Astronomy 101 class: a 
           standing room only of bright-eyed coeds. A slideshow of images 
           flash on a projector behind him, grounding his lecture.

                                 CARL 
                        Granted Shakespeare may not have been 
                        an astronomer, but he understood a 
                        fundamental truth of science: in 
                        order to understand the cosmos, we 
                        need to shrink them down.

           Images of space appear. Pulsars, dwarf stars, galaxies.

                                 CARL
                        The humbling reality is our sun is 
                        one of several billion stars in the 
                        Milky Way, which is just one of 
                        countless billions of galaxies that 
                        exist. When you look at the universe, 
                        it’s simply too huge to comprehend. 

           Apollo’s images of Earth appear -- a spinning blue marble.

                                 CARL
                        So let’s shrink it. To just our 
                        world. Let’s take the many millions 
                        of species alive on earth and shrink 
                        them down to just us. 
           Ann slips into the back of class, unnoticed by Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Now take the billions of human beings 
                        laughing, breathing and struggling...

           The class laughs as Carl playfully kicks a sleeping coed. 

                                 CARL
                        ...to stay awake in my ungodly early 
                        morning class. Then shrink that. All 
                        of us, down to one single person.

           And now he notices Ann in the back of the class. 

                                 CARL
                        You.

           The screen behind him fills with a National Geographic gallery 
           of life in full glory: Jon and Frank’s picks for the Record.

                                 CARL
                        We are each of us filled with a 
                        billion spinning thoughts, a billion 
                        bursting dreams. An entire universe 
                        condensed and contained within. 

           The images shrink in, to our anatomy, the core cells of life.

                                 CARL
                        We are not an island alone in the 
                        vast cosmic ocean. We are the ocean. 

           And now these images expand back out to the stars and galaxies-

                                 CARL
                        The truth is life is an anomaly. A 
                        random collision of circumstance and 
                        coincidence. We should not exist.

           He lets this sink in.

                                 CARL
                        And yet we do. Which means our lives 
                        are either insignificant or--

                                 ANN
                        We make every second count.

           The entire class turns to look at the person brave enough to 
           speak up to their god. Carl’s eyes meet Ann’s and never leave.

                                 CARL
                        That’s right. So what are you waiting 
                        for? Go. Live! Class dismissed.
           Like a flock of geese his students take flight, a mass exodus. 

           Leaving Carl and Ann alone: seconds TICKING into an unhinged 
           future. The Wedding Song (track 14) from earlier PLAYS now as--

           EXT. FALL CREEK GORGE - FAST-PACED 

           Fingers entwined Carl pulls Ann breathless down a forest path. 
           The light dances all around them as they emerge on the gothic 
           stone bridge spanning the dramatic sweep of Ithaca Falls. 

           The sun sparks rainbows off the water, sets Ann’s hair afire. 
           Carl pulls her close... a flash of fear in both their eyes.

           THEY KISS

           As colors intensify; the spin, the song, the ticking all stop. 

                                 ANN
                        I love you.

                                 CARL
                        I love you.

           The wind sighs through the trees. A moment frozen in time.

                                 CARL
                        No matter what.

           They draw into each other again, holding tight.

           Tim pounds away at a typewriter, pages piled high. He stops to

           EXT. 30 STREET RECORDING STUDIO - MANHATTAN - MORNING      

           A sunny summer day in the city. Carl and Ann stroll arm-in-arm 
           down a tree-lined street, unreasonably happy together. 
                                 CARL
                        About us?

                                 ANN
                        (no)
                        What this feeling is like. I wish 
                        there was a way to capture it, put it 
                        on our record. To share more than 
                        just images and songs. To actually 
                        express the feeling of being in love.

                                 CARL
                        If only humans were that emotionally 
                        and technologically evolved.

                                 ANN
                        But what if life out there is? What 
                        if we could send a piece of ourselves 
                        that perhaps we don’t yet know how to 
                        decode, but more advanced life could.

           Now the gears start turning. A lightbulb flash inside Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Like a brain scan?

                                 ANN
                        Or a heartbeat.

                                 CARL
                        Or both. A kind of human morse code.

                                 ANN
                        That a billion years from now, when 
                        the continents have shifted and our
                        sun has burnt out... will still echo.

                                 CARL
                        (a sad smile)
                        If only we’d a record and ship to put 
                        it on. But I failed. It’s impossible.

           Ann stops him now. In front of CBS Records. Takes his hands...

                                 ANN
                        When has impossible ever stopped you?

           A taxi pulls up to the curb. Bruce steps out looking unhappy.

                                 BRUCE
                        You better not have begun without me.

                                 CARL
                        Begun what? What are you doing here?
                                 BRUCE
                        (to Ann)
                        You didn’t tell him?

           He hands Carl an envelope marked CLASSIFIED. Carl breaks the 
           seal, lifts out a signed headshot of President Carter and his 
           written greeting for Voyager. Carl reads an excerpt outloud:

                                 CARL
                        “This is a present from a small 
                        distant world. We are attempting to 
                        survive our time so we may live into 
                        yours” --Jimmy Carter.

                                 BRUCE
                        Seems your little publicity stunt 
                        worked after all, Sagan. I got an 
                        angry call from the White House Press 
                        Secretary demanding to know why NASA 
                        asked the UN Secretary-General to 
                        record a greeting for Voyager and not 
                        the leader of the free world. He made 
                        it very clear to me that the 
                        President’s greeting will come first.

           Carl’s stupefied. He looks to Ann, who is grinning wide.

                                 CARL
                        You knew about this?

                                 ANN
                        Everyone on the team heard but you. 
                        We wanted to surprise you.

                                 CARL
                        Does this mean our record’s approved?

                                 BRUCE 
                        It means it’s above my paygrade now.
                        NASA’s brass have formed a review 
                        committee. We’re gonna take a vote.

                                 CARL
                        And you intend to sway them to “NO”.

                                 BRUCE
                        Unless you prove me wrong.

           He claps Carl’s shoulder, a challenge. Then marches inside.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           The E Street Band’s backing a young BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN in his 
           Darkness on the Edge of Town prime. A young JIMMY IOVINE, 
           future Interscope Records mogul, waves Carl into a sound booth-
                                 IOVINE
                        You the ones making the Space Record?

           Carl doesn’t quite know how to reply. Iovine eyes his sweater.

                                 IOVINE
                        Well you clearly ain’t here for rock 
                        ‘n roll. Come on in, I’m your sound 
                        engineer. Jimmy Iovine.

           He shakes hands avidly, then interrupts Springsteen mid-song.

                                 IOVINE
                        Sorry, Boss. Time’s up.

                                 SPRINGSTEEN
                        Don’t call me “boss”, you know I hate 
                        that. Alright E Street, pack it up.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Springsteen exits the studio as Jon and Frank arrive in Carl’s 
           car. Beyond them Tim emerges from a subway, gift in hand. 

                                 TIM
                        Thank god I’m not the last one. Ann 
                        would’ve killed me. Is Linda here?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t think Linda’s coming. She and 
                        Carl...

                                 TIM
                        I know, she told me. But she’s still 
                        part of this team. I convinced her to 
                        come. What’s that?

           Jon unbuckles a rare Honeywell photo-to-audio converter that’s 
           seatbelted in the front seat like a person. He gently lifts 
           the machine out as Frank hefts an overstuffed crate of albums.

                                 JON
                        This magic box is gonna convert our 
                        photos to sound waves for the record. 

                                 FRANK
                        We had to fly it in from Denver. One 
                        of only three in the world.

           As he says it, Jon trips and smashes it on the curb.

                                 JON
                        Don’t worry it’s just surface damage.

           He lifts it. A big chunk falls off. Frank looks ready to kill.
           INT. SOUND BOOTH - SIMULTANEOUS

           Lights come on. The mix board powers up. Carl squeezes Ann’s 
           hand excited as Tim enters. She quickly releases Carl’s hand.

                                 TIM
                        What did I miss?

           More than he knows. He woos Ann with the gift and a kiss.

                                 ANN
                        (deflecting both)
                        What’s this?

                                 TIM
                        My book. I finished it!

           Not one word about her trip or how’s she’s been? Ann unwraps 
           his present: The Red Limit. Turns it over, almost mournfully. 

                                 ANN
                        I’m happy for you. Your great story.

           She hands it back. Tim expected excitement. This is different. 
           A deeper shift in her that unglues him. Before he can respond--

                                 FRANK
                        Coming through!

           He stumbles by, straining under the Honeywell. Jon hauls the 
           crate full of all the pictures plus Carl and Ann’s recordings.

                                 IOVINE
                        Whoa, wait. We’re mixing all that? 

                                 JON
                        I hope this studio’s paying you well.

                                 IOVINE
                        (laughs, yeah right)
                        If I ever get through this, remind me 
                        to quit and start one of my own. 

           He loads the top album on a turntable -- as Linda slips last 
           minute into the studio with Nick, who dashes into Carl arms.

                                 NICK
                        Daddy! 

                                 CARL
                        Hey Copernicus, I missed you.

                                 NICK
                        Can I come home now?

           This breaks Carl’s heart.
                                 CARL
                        I don’t know.

           He looks to Linda, who blazes wordlessly past. Iovine starts 
           the first song to mix onto the record: El Cascabel (track 19), 
           a frantic mariachi number that now kicks off the--

           INT. SOUND BOOTH - CROSS-CUT

           Carl lowers the next LP in line to record onto the spinning 
           studio turntable. Over his shoulder, Bruce jots each song in 
           his clipboard, his foot tapping unconsciously to the rhythm. 

           Down at foot level, Frank’s FACE APPEARS. Sweating, he plugs a 
           cable into the mix board that winds back into the--

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATER

           Where Jon is just finishing duct-taping the Honeywell back 
           together. He powers it on. Feeds Carter’s message in like a 
           fax. Frank and Jon wait, literally holding their breath.

           For a second NOTHING. Then slowly the photo starts to convert. 
           They high-five in victory as the image becomes sound waves-- 

           INT. FACTORY - MATCH CUT

           The same red and green sound waves rise and fall on a computer 
           screen above a “groove machine”. Our copper “mother” record 
           spins as a diamond cutter etches the picture out in grooves.

           INT. STUDIO BATHROOM - CLOSE-ON:

           A real diamond, in a real ring, glittering in the hard light. 
           Tim stares at it, at himself in the bathroom mirror. Feigns a 
           smile of confidence...but his face is filled with uncertainty.  
           INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - REVERSE ON:

           Carl, the same worry etched on his face as he tries not to 
           watch Tim romantically pull Ann into the hall. His big moment. 
           Only Ann evades, shrugging Tim off. Heads back in... to Carl.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - SIMULTANEOUS

           Jon and Frank are down to the last 2 images for conversion. 
           Bruce rejects one: Frank’s anatomy photo of a naked man and 
           pregnant woman holding hands. He writes something on it in 
           red, then presses it to the sound booth glass for Carl: SMUT. 

           Meanwhile, Jon loads the final photo: The Blue Marble of earth 
           from space. It gets stuck halfway down. Frank laughs nervously 
           then kicks the machine. It finishes converting as--

           INT. FACTORY - MATCH CUT

           Back on the assembly line, the same image of Earth is now 
           pressed to the center of our copper record, becoming its 
           label. Onto which is stamped a title: The Sounds of Earth.

           INT. SOUND BOOTH - SIMULTANEOUS

           Nick sits with Bruce cutely sharing a headset as they listen 
           to the edited Sounds of Earth (track 20) audio journey Nick 
           helped Ann record. Something changes in Bruce’s face as Nick 
           shows him the crayon drawings he made to accompany each sound--

           Bruce smiles.

           EXT. STUDIO STEPS - DAY

           Linda sits smoking, watching a heavy rain fall. Tim joins her 
           and they sit quietly: alone together, lost in their thoughts. 
           Then Tim reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out...

           His BOOK. Gives it to Linda. As she opens it, Tim touches the 
           fresh yellow paint stains on her fingers. A knowing smile.

           INT. FACTORY - CLOSE UP:

           The completed Voyager Record spins center-frame. Shining, 
           beautiful, and missing one key detail. As it rotates before 
           our eyes: a fine metal mist turns it into pure, gleaming GOLD. 

           A hand lifts it, radiant in the light. Then with a hot pen 
           etches an inscription into the takeout grooves:
                 “TO THE MAKERS OF MUSIC - ALL WORLDS, ALL TIMES”

                                             END SONG AND MONTAGE.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Empty takeout boxes litter the mix board. Everyone’s exhausted 
           but amped: the last mile of a marathon recording session. Even 
           Bruce’s come around. He’s smiling now, jacket off, tie undone. 

                                 IOVINE 
                        Is that everything, are we wrapped? 

           Carl cross-checks a master track list tacked to the wall.

                                 CARL
                        We’re just missing one thing. On the 
                        sound essay. A kiss.

                                 IOVINE
                        Is that it? Easy...

           He sucks his arm. A loud SMACK.

                                 IOVINE
                        There, print it, done!

                                 ANN
                        No, this is meant to be that 
                        impossible thing: a kiss that will 
                        last forever. It has to be real.

           Her eyes find Carl’s. He shakes his head, subtly. Turns to--

                                 LINDA
                        Don’t even think about it.

           The tension in the room bubbles to boil. Tim grabs Ann.

                                 TIM
                        A kiss to represent all kisses. I 
                        think I can manage that.

           He sweeps her up, dips her. Leans playfully in. At the last 
           second, Ann turns away. SMACK! Lips connect with cheek.

                                 IOVINE
                        Perfect!

           But it’s not. Ann doesn’t have to say it. Tim follows her gaze 
           to Carl’s. And the truth hits like a 1000 volts. He knows. 

                                 ANN 
                        Tim...
        The Milwaukee Journal, Nov 27th, 1978. 
                                   Talks about the team, the contents, and the kiss. 
           He doesn’t stick around to celebrate. He’s out the door.

           EXT. RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           A street market has sprung up. Happy families, couples in love 
           out enjoying the day. Ann catches up to Tim in the crowd.

                                 ANN
                        Tim wait...

                                 TIM
                        Why, Ann? I’ve seen that look before. 

           It’s the same one he gives her now. Only broken.

                                 TIM
                        What happened while you were gone?

           She can’t answer him. Can barely meet his gaze.

                                 TIM
                        Just tell me, do you still love me?

           Ann looks up into his eyes now, a long contemplative beat.

                                 TIM
                        Is that a no?

                                 ANN
                        No.

                                 TIM
                        To the no or...

           She doesn’t have to say it. The truth breaks both their 
           hearts. Tim nods, no longer angry. He takes Ann’s hands. Even 
           now they’re expanding together as much as breaking apart.

                                 TIM
                        If you really love him, then promise 
                        me one thing--

           The hardest thing he’s ever said.

                                 TIM
                        This time make it great.

           Before either can pause for regret, he turns and walks away.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Ann returns, dismayed to find the whole team watching Linda 
           confront Carl on the other side of the soundproof glass. 
           Even ON MUTE their argument is clearly volcanic. And when THE 
           SLAP comes... it’s even more brutal for its silent ferocity. 

           Linda storms from the studio, stopping only to fling her ring 
           at Carl. A single word escaping as she slams open the door:

                                 LINDA
                        ...Divorce!

           This everyone hears. Jon and Frank scatter as she juggernauts 
           right up to Ann, looking like she might just hit her. 

                                 LINDA
                        There’s no such thing as a sure thing-

           Her punch. Both accusation and warning. Without a second look, 
           she lifts a shell-shocked Nick into her arms. And storms out. 
           Rocked by this sudden turn of events, Bruce confronts Carl. 

                                 BRUCE
                        I was wrong about the record, I admit 
                        it deserves to go up. But I can’t 
                        possibly take this to committee now.

                                 CARL
                        My personal life has nothing to do 
                        with this message, Bruce.

                                 BRUCE
                        It does when it turns into a scandal. 
                        For better or worse, you’re the 
                        public face of NASA. Our reputation 
                        is more important than this record. 

                                 CARL
                        The record’s bigger than any of us.

                                 BRUCE
                        And you sabotaged it. I’m sorry Carl. 

                                 CARL
                        Don’t be sorry, Bruce. Be a leader. 
                        Stand up for what you believe in. 

           Bruce shakes his head, turns to go. But Ann blocks him.

                                 ANN
                        I joined this mission to be part of 
                        something greater than myself. I 
                        can’t be the reason it falls apart.

           She takes Bruce’s hands. Pins him impassioned, doesn’t let go.

                                 ANN
                        There is no scandal. What happened 
                        between Carl and I... it’s over now.
           Carl knows she doesn’t mean this, still it breaks his heart.

                                 CARL
                        Don’t do this, Ann.

           But she has to.

                                 ANN
                        And no one has to know if I was never 
                        on the team at all. You understand?

           Bruce nods, floored. Ann releases his hands. Turns to Carl.

                                 CARL
                        I won’t let you go.

                                 ANN
                        The record is bigger than us, you 
                        said it yourself. 

           Eyes filling now, she bolts for the door. Only Carl stops her. 
           Steps in close. Kisses her slowly on her forehead. Her right 
           eye. Her left cheek. As much as it hurts her, Ann breaks away.

           It hurts Carl more to watch her go.

           EXT. NASA HEADQUARTERS - AUGUST 18, 1977

           A too-hot summer sun beats down on Frank and Jon, sweating 
           uncomfortably in suits as they awkwardly fix each other’s off 
           center ties. Together they stride through heavy doors into--

           INT. NASA APPROVAL COMMITTEE - DAY

           Where Carl is seated at cross-examination microphones before a 
           long table of straight-faced NASA brass. Bruce takes a seat 
           front and center as Jon and Frank join Sagan-- 3 chairs 
           conspicuously empty beside them. 

           A narrow whip of a man, the NASA CHAIRMAN, leans forward.

                                 CHAIRMAN 
                        No mission at NASA is undertaken 
                        lightly. We are tasked with a 
                        tremendous responsibility: to broaden 
                        human understanding, advance science 
                        and technology, and push the 
                        boundaries of what’s possible 
                        further. For the betterment of man. 

           He holds up the Golden Record like a false idol.
                                 CHAIRMAN
                        Before this committee makes our final 
                        decision we want to know how a “gold 
                        record” conforms to those demands.

           Jon and Frank rise to speak in defense but Carl takes the mic.

                                 CARL
                        It doesn’t. 

           Off the stir this causes through the committee and his team--

                                 CARL
                        If you’re looking for scientific 
                        justification, you’ll find none. We 
                        set out on an impossible task: to 
                        define what it means to be alive here 
                        and now. We used no set logic, no 
                        calculated plan. The only compass we 
                        followed was our hearts. 

           Snickers through the committee; Bruce conflicted among them. 
           But Carl doesn’t care. He looks to Ann’s empty chair.

                                 CARL
                        And maybe that was foolish. Maybe we 
                        failed. But if our responsibility is 
                        to better understand ourselves, I 
                        believe what is etched in the thin 
                        grooves of that record before you is 
                        something precious and profound: a 
                        representation of all we are.

           His conviction fills every corner of the room. Silences it. 

                                 CARL 
                        Even if it’s nothing more than a 
                        sliver, isn’t that worth it? To share 
                        a tiny piece of our soul.

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        Your passion is plain, Dr. Sagan. But 
                        what qualifies you to represent our 
                        “soul”?

           His words like shots. This isn’t a jury, it’s a firing squad. 
           And all guns aim at Carl.

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        You chose to capture an experience of 
                        life on earth; an experience that, in 
                        your words, is impossible to define. 
                        You assembled a team that is, to put 
                        it mildly, unorthodox. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
                        And all to reach out to an alien 
                        civilization who may not exist or may 
                        never receive your call.

           He shakes his head, the decision already made.

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        I’m sorry, but I don’t see the point 
                        in sending such a pointless message.

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Which is exactly why we send it--

           Everyone turns as Linda and Tim enter the hall together, Nick 
           in tow. The mission transcending any personal heartbreak.

                                 LINDA  
                        Because the act of sending, in spite 
                        of the odds, is the most revealing 
                        message of all. If nothing else, it’s 
                        a symbol for us more than THEM. And 
                        is it a perfect representation? No. 
                        But we are not a perfect species. We 
                        are messy and mean, full of 
                        contradictions and uncertainty and--
                        (aimed at Carl)
                        Unimaginable cruelty...

           There’s anger in her voice, and pain. And a newfound strength.

                                 LINDA
                        But also resilience and forgiveness.

                                 TIM
                        And hope.

           They take their seats, joining their team in solidarity. 

                                 TIM
                        And isn’t that, more than anything 
                        else, what it means to be human? That 
                        however small we are, however 
                        primitive we seem, something in us 
                        was large enough to reach out. To say 
                        we too once lived in this house of 
                        stars. And we thought of you.

           The temperature in the room shifts. Warming to them.

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        While that may be true, even if we 
                        wanted to, I’m afraid the record 
                        doesn’t meet approved regulations.
                                 FRANK
                        (jumping to his feet)
                        What are you talking about, we met 
                        every quality control specification!

           The Chairman clicks a projector and a magnified image of the 
           record’s takeout grooves appears: “To the makers of music...”

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        Size, weight and composition of your 
                        record passed, but this inscription 
                        was made without official clearance.

                                 JON
                        (up now too, outraged)
                        You’re rejecting on a technicality? 

           Carl stares at Bruce, the true architect of this decision and 
           the only one who can turn it around. Bruce avoids Carl’s eyes.

                                 CHAIRMAN
                        I believe we are ready to vote...

           Here it is. The end of the line; project dead. And then--

                                 BRUCE
                        I wrote it.

           To everyone’s surprise, Bruce rises. Takes the mic.

                                 BRUCE
                        The inscription. It’s our only 
                        example of human handwriting. Which I 
                        believe makes it immensely valuable. 

                                 CHAIRMAN 
                        You’re in favor of sending a record?

                                 BRUCE
                        It’s better to light a candle than 
                        curse the darkness. 

           He winks at Carl as the committee erupts.

                                 BRUCE
                        I’m in favor. Who supports my vote?

           One-by-one all committee members but the chairman raise a 
           forest of hands. Linda leans in as Bruce ratifies the vote.

                                 LINDA
                        I did this for Nick. Like Ann did for 
                        you. Don’t lose them to your stars.

           The camera becomes unhinged, SPINNING ROUND the room, 
           transforming as it circles a full 360 degrees around--
           INT. NASA AMPHITHEATER - PRESENT DAY 

           --Till we find ourselves back on that opening stage. Framed in 
           black. With the same older woman from page 1. Standing at a 
           podium bearing NASA’s iconic logo. And we know everything we 
           need to about her: she’s beautiful, impassioned, eloquent. 

                                 WOMAN
                        We can’t circle back but we remember:
                        everything we made everything we lost-

           She looks right at us, then beyond. And finally we see who 
           she’s been addressing all along: a room of young engineers; 
           the new generation of NASA. A banner reads: Voyager: 35 years!

                                 WOMAN
                        People think to be a scientist means 
                        to lose your joy of discovery, your 
                        passion, the great romance of life. 
                        Yet 35 years ago the Voyagers left 
                        the pale blue dot of our world. And 
                        on them still is our golden record. 
                        Which today leaves our solar system 
                        to join the cosmos beyond.

           She smiles into frame.

                                 WOMAN
                        And what could be more romantic than 
                        casting yourself into the unknown?

           Her wrinkles fade, her face turns young once more. And we 
           realize who she is now: The present day ANN DRUYAN (65). 

                                              AS WE MORPH BACK TO:

           Young Ann. Back in uniform, failing to explain to a Korean 
           family how to use the audio guide. Carl steps up behind.

                                 CARL 
                        Tell them forget the words. If it’s a 
                        masterpiece, it will move you in ways 
                        words never can.

                                 ANN
                        Carl, you know we can’t--

                                 CARL
                        They approved the record.

           A tornado of emotions tear through Ann. 
                                 CARL
                        But I told them we can’t send it 
                        without one missing piece.

           Before she can say anything more... HE KISSES HER. 

           The Korean family snap photos as Ann throws her arms around 
           Carl, kissing back. The haunting notes of Iziel je Delyo 
           Hagdutin (track 21) the record’s final song strike up--

           Ann stares into Carl’s eyes while EEG nodes are placed across 
           her scalp, their web of thin wires running to a tape recorder 
           that translates her thoughts into a fierce electric pulse.

           Inside the white cocoon of the MRI, the sound of Ann’s

           space around her, taking form; pulsing brighter and brighter--  
           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - LAUNCHPAD

           Boosters IGNITE in a cloud of fire, Ann’s heartbeat BLENDING 
           now with the steady countdown 4-3-2-1! As Voyager blazes 
           gloriously to life, breaking its mooring lines and launching--

           EXT. SATELLITE BEACH - 5 MILES OUT

           Into a cloudless blue sky. As it rises, our entire team, all 
           gathered on the shore opposite the launch-site, burst into 
           wild, emotional celebration. Carl raises Nick into the air.

                                 A VOICE (CARL’S)
                        Are we alone in the universe?

           INT. MRI - MINDSCAPE

           All around Ann now: her thoughts form into images. PROJECTED 
           on the MRI walls; flashing by in rhythm to her pulsing heart:

                        Hello from the children of planet 
                        earth.

           He throws them into the sky, where they become so many stars.
                                 THE VOICE
                        We are one world but we contain many. 

           EXT. SATELLITE BEACH - DAY

           Voyager’s glory trail rockets higher and higher to the cosmos 
           as Ann slips her hand into Carl’s. And squeezes. No words. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Outside the MRI, Carl takes Ann’s hand in his. Squeezes. As 
           the EEG of her thoughts register like an seismic earthquake, 
           the tape recorder emits a sound like a string of fireworks.

           INT. MRI - MINDSCAPE 

           Ann’s thoughts intensify as the grand sweep of Planet Earth 
           cycles before her eyes in a rotating triptych (photos #10-20):

           SCREEN 1--Nature’s Glory: mountains, deserts, oceans, forests. 

           SCREEN 2--Animal Kingdom: gorillas, dolphins, reptiles, birds. 

           SCREEN 3--Human History: from hunter-gatherers to astronauts.

                                 THE VOICE

           EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON THE VOYAGER ROCKET

           High above the blue skin of the earth, Voyager detaches from 
           its booster, our gold record gleaming in the rays of the sun.

           INT. MRI - MINDSCAPE

           Every emotion washes over Ann as one by one the images MERGE--

           UNTIL THERE IS ONLY CARL:

           --smiling under the stars on the balcony at Nora Ephron’s.

           --Carl squeezing her hand under the full moon in Ithaca.

           --Carl running with her through the rain outside Taj Mahal.

           --Carl kissing her on the stone bridge over Ithaca Falls.

           All the moments they’ve shared together in our story FLASH BY 
           up till NOW. And then something completely unexpected happens--
                                 THE VOICE
                        All that will be...

           Older Ann opens her eyes, full of tears in CLOSE-UP.

                        Time is not a wheel it’s a heartbeat. 
                        We can’t circle back. 15 times around 
                        the sun now we’ve gone without Carl-- 

           In the front row, flush with emotion, sit the present day 
           members of our team: Tim, Frank, Bruce, Jon. In between an 
           aged Linda and grown-up Nick is one empty seat. 

                                 ANN
                        But Voyager lives on. Carrying our 
                        song forever toward the heart of the 
                        universe. And with it, the memories 
                        of a young girl in love.

           And now Carl’s in that seat. Smiling at Ann. No one else in 
           the theater but him and her. And as she smiles back--

                                 THE VOICE

           OUR PALE BLUE DOT

           Glimmers like a precious jewel. 4 billion miles out it hangs 
           like a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. Our entire world 
           nothing more than a sapphire speck on the vast cosmic ocean.
