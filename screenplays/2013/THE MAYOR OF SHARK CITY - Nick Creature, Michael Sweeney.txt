                               screenplay by Nick Creature & Michael Sweeney

                                                                    Agency:

          "All the adversity I've had in my life, all my troubles and 
          obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it 
          happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the 
          world for you."

                                                       -- Walt Disney

          "Shooting Jaws was really a living nightmare.  I dreamt about it 
          at night.  I'd wake up with that sick feeling in the pit of my 
          gut.  I felt that I was the eye of the hurricane.  All this fell 
          on me.  It was the hardest production I've ever experienced... And 
          I still have nightmares about it to this day."

                                                       -- Steven Spielberg

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER -- DAY

           A MARQUEE advertises DeMille’s The Greatest Show on Earth.

           Below the sign, a line of people wait for tickets.  A grand 
           day out for post-war nuclear families.  A TITLE fades up:

                             PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

           Farther down the line, we find STEVEN (5), gangly and shy.   
           He tugs on the hand of a grown-up beside him.  ARNOLD (35), 
           his father, kneels down.  Kind eyes behind round glasses.

                                 STEVEN
                        Is it going to be scary?

                                 ARNOLD
                        You’re going to love it.  I promise.

           INT. THEATER LOBBY -- DAY

           Arnold, popcorn and soda in hand, leads Steven into a... 
           DARK CORRIDOR.  Swinging doors at the end.  Steven stops.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Go ahead, Steven.  Don’t be afraid.

           Steven’s hand pushes the door open.  LIGHT shines out, 
           turning him into a tiny SILHOUETTE.  A SHADOW in the doorway.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER -- THAT MOMENT

           Steven enters, overwhelmed by the cavernous art deco chamber.  
           A UNIFORMED USHER smiles as father and son take their seats.

           Moments later, Steven gasps as the curtain slides open... 
           THUNDEROUS MUSIC comes up as the huge Paramount logo appears.

           And we see something happen in Steven’s face.  Something 
           magical.  A wonder in his eyes that only belongs to a child.

           ON SCREEN: As the movie plays out, we see Jimmy Stewart as 
           Buttons the Clown... Death-defying acts... A majestic herd 
           of elephants... Two circus trains COLLIDE in a huge crash.  

           Finally, the picture ends.  Arnold gets up, but Steven stays.

                                 STEVEN
                        Again.  Please.

           Arnold can’t resist.  He sits down.  The curtain opens and 
           the movie begins again.  Steven giddy with delight.  Then...  
           CREAKING.  From the rafters.  A sound like TWISTING METAL.  
           Or an old ship at sea.  Then, a new sound... DRIP... DRIP...

           An AIR CONDITIONER leaks water.  Droplets fall from above.

           A CRACK OF THUNDER draws Steven back to the screen, where...  
           A VIOLENT STORM rages on a ROLLING SEA.  Confusion sets in.    

                                 STEVEN
                        What happened to the circus?

           BOOM!  Something POUNDS on the screen from the other side.

           The screen CRACKS as if made of glass, slowly from top to 
           bottom.  Leaking like a broken aquarium.  It holds for a 
           beat... Then SHATTERS as a TIDAL WAVE fills the theater.

           In seconds, it floods the room.  Seats RIPPED from the floor.  
           Steven clings to his floating chair.  Frantic.  Looking for...

           Arnold.  Floating in his seat.  Drifting to the far side of 
           the theater.  Eyes still on the screen.  Enjoying the show.

           Then... A BLACK SHAPE, thirty feet long, spills out from 
           behind the screen.  There’s something in the water with them.

           And it’s MOVING.  A slithering black SHADOW.  Steven cries.

                                 ARNOLD
                             (still smiling)
                        Don’t be afraid.

           Something BUMPS Arnold from beneath... Then pulls him under.  

                                 STEVEN
                        DADDY!  NO!

           A churning wake EXPLODES from below.  A flash of gaping JAWS.  
           Rusted BOLTS and GEARS.  Metal teeth CHOMPING down hard as...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. CABIN / BEDROOM -- DAWN

           Steven (27), grown up with full head of shaggy hair, jolts 
           awake from the nightmare.  Gasping for breath.  A beat.     
           He looks out the window toward a quiet HARBOR in the distance.

                                                             BLACK OUT.

           OVER BLACK, a TITLE:

                               BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS
           Then, still OVER BLACK...

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        No rest for the wicked.

                                 ALVES (V.O.)
                        Thirty six hours and counting.  
                        Figure I’ll sleep when I’m dead.

           INT. BOAT HOUSE -- DAY

           WORKER BEES loiter.  Guys in tool belts.  Days of stubble, 
           grungy T-shirts.  All GLARING at STEVEN as he confers with...

           JOE ALVES (38). Curly hair, beard.  Part artist, part carpenter, 
           all workhorse.  Came out of the womb with a pencil behind his ear. 

                                 STEVEN
                        How’s it coming?

                                 ALVES 
                        All the king’s horses, all the 
                        king’s men...

           He’s talking about the FISHING BOAT with a THREE FOOT HOLE 
           in her hull.  Alves and crew patching up the battle damage.

           A single word painted on her stern: “ORCA.”

           EXT. CABIN -- EARLIER THAT MORNING

           Cold.  Stark windblown morning.  Steven exits the house.  
           Walking toward the harbor in the distance.  All the while...

                                 ALVES (V.O.)
                        Talked to Z.  Studio’s ready to 
                        burn him at the stake for this one.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        And they actually like him.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- EARLIER THAT MORNING

           Steven still walking.  Passing sleepy store fronts.

                                 ALVES (V.O.)
                        We all got targets on our back now.  
                        Way this is going, I’m surprised 
                        they’re still talking to us at all. 

           Down the street, a gang of TEAMSTERS gathers at the bakery.  
           Breakfast on the go.  Steven tenses at the sight of them...

           Makes a hard turn on his route.  Best to avoid them right now.  
           EXT. OAK BLUFFS HARBOR -- EARLIER THAT MORNING

           Steven trudges past a hand-painted sign: SHARK CITY.  Hanging 
           above an encampment of shacks and work benches in the harbor.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        So how much longer ‘til we’re up 
                        and running?  Two days?  Three?

           A few more WORKER BEES gather.  Smoke break.  Chatting.  
           Staring hard at Steven... Who hangs his head as he passes by.

           No eye contact.  He just keeps walking...  
           To the BOAT HOUSE where Joe Alves has been working all night.

                                 ALVES (V.O.)
                        Steve... You don’t understand.

           INT. BOAT HOUSE -- NOW

           Back to Steven and Alves.  Steven chewing his nails.

                                 ALVES 
                        I think we're getting shut down.

           A heavy silence.  Finally...

                                 STEVEN 
                        Fuck.

                                 ALVES 
                        Everybody’s asking me when we’re 
                        going home, and I don’t know what 
                        to say... I don’t have an answer.

           There's only one answer...

                                 STEVEN 
                        We go home when we're finished.

           EXT. DOCKS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven heads back the way he came.  Feeling every 
           sideways stare.  Every pissed-off look.  A marked man.  

           And then he sees it... A custom DRY DOCK in the water.  
           Occupied by a SHAPE DRAPED IN CANVAS.  The shape of a certain 
           GREAT WHITE SHARK.  Drape partially pulled back to reveal... 

           SHARP TEETH.  Row upon row.  Like the ones in his nightmare.

           Steven brushes it off, heading back up the dock when...
           A PASSERBY SHOULDER-BUMPS him.  Whips him around to reveal...
           A HULKING FIGURE heading the other way.  Military jacket.  
           Fisherman's cap.  Tufts of mutton chops.  He whistles a tune 
           some may recognize about good-byes and fair ladies of Spain.  

           The figure TOSSES something in the water.  Never looks back.

           Shaken, Steven walks on, passing an AVIS DELIVERY VAN.  White 
           gaffer’s tape has been used to turn the word “AVIS” into...

                                     “JAWS”

           We CRANE UP to REVEAL, for the first time...

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD -- DAY

           A normally sleepy resort town, now mobbed with trucks, 
           trailers, crew, and the inherent chaos of film production.  

           Steven disappears into the crowd as a TITLE fades up:             

                                 MARTHA’S VINEYARD
                                SEPTEMBER 23, 1974

           A beat, then below that, another TITLE:

                               85 DAYS OVER SCHEDULE

           The CAMERA rises until all we can see is the ATLANTIC OCEAN.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS LOT -- DAY

           The calm waters of the Falls Lake tank on the Universal 
           backlot.  A STUDIO TRAM TOUR drives by with a clearly visible 
           Universal logo on the side.  As the tram passes, we REVEAL...

           STEVEN walking past the lake.  Crossing the lot.  Full of 
           energy, like a schoolboy who just got straight As.  TITLE:

                                 ONE YEAR EARLIER

           Steven ducks into a bungalow marked: ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY.

           INT. ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven hangs around the outer office as a cute young 
           SECRETARY makes copies of MANUSCRIPTS on a Xerox machine.

                                 SECRETARY
                        He shouldn’t be too much longer.  
                        Want a glass of water or something?
           He waves her off.  She goes about her work.
           As Steven peers around, a MANUSCRIPT catches his eye...  

                                    “JAWS”
                                  a novel by 
                                PETER BENCHLEY

           He pulls it from the pile.  Stumped by the title.

                                 STEVEN
                        Jaws?
                             (to the secretary)
                        What’s this?  A dentist story?

                                 SECRETARY
                        No, I think it’s about a fish.

           Steven flips to the first page of the manuscript.  As he 
           reads, his face changes.  Engrossed.  Maybe even a little 
           disturbed by what he’s discovered.  A few LINES jump out...

           “Jaws snapped shut... Crushing bones and flesh and organs 
           into a jelly... The boy’s legs were severed at the hips...”

                                 STEVEN
                        Definitely not a dentist.

           He flips pages, getting more and more into this, until...

                                 STEVEN
                        Hey, could you... Listen, do you 
                        think I could get a copy of this?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. Zanuck says it doesn’t leave 
                        the office.  He was clear on that.

                                 STEVEN
                        Crystal clear or kind of murky?

           She takes it back with a scolding grin.  Crystal.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ll just grab that glass of water.

           He ducks down the short hall, passing a half-closed DOOR...

           STEVEN’S POV -- JOE ALVES, a lifetime less haggard than the 
           previous scene, buzzes around a desk.  Showing off sketches.

                                 ALVES
                             (to someone off-screen)
                        These are just initial concepts... 
                        30 feet proportional, man to shark.
           BACK TO STEVEN -- Realizing something big is happening.
           He grabs water.  Heads to the OUTER OFFICE.  In his haste...

           He BUMPS the secretary.  Water and manuscripts go flying.

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, geez... Sorry.  I’m so sorry.

           As he helps her gather papers...

                                 STEVEN
                        Look, uh... Tell Mr. Zanuck I’ll 
                        catch up with him tomorrow, okay?

           And he’s out the door... Moments later, RICHARD D. ZANUCK 
           (38) enters from the back hall.  Motion picture royalty with 
           a maverick’s edge.  A synthesis of old and new Hollywood.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Marilyn, will you bring me the Jaws
                        proof?  I need to go over it before 
                        I call Mr. Brown.  And a cup of 
                        coffee, too, please.  Real coffee, 
                        not that instant shit that tastes 
                        like something I put in my engine.

           As she checks the pile, Zanuck looks around, confused...

                                 ZANUCK
                        Where’s Steven?  I just heard him.

                                 SECRETARY
                        It’s not here.
                             (off his look)
                        The Jaws manuscript.  It’s gone.

           PRE-LAP an intense PIANO RIFF.  “Sinnerman” by Nina Simone.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

           MUSIC continues as Steven moves across the backlot.  He pulls 
           the Jaws manuscript from under his shirt as we BEGIN MONTAGE.

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           Steven takes a seat in the sand.  In full view of the ocean.

           In a SERIES OF DISSOLVES, Steven devours the book.  DOUBLE 
           EXPOSURE SHOTS from his mind’s eye laid over turning pages.

           STEVEN’S IMAGINATION -- This is the Jaws movie that Steven 
           pictures in his head.  The version we never got to see...
           A YOUNG WOMAN swims in the ocean.  Behind her, a DORSAL FIN 
           cuts the water.  The SHARK dives beneath her, then ASCENDS...

           Recreating the iconic Jaws cover art in full LIVE ACTION.

           Only here, the behemoth EXPLODES from the water.  CRUSHES  
           the young woman in its massive JAWS.  This shark is a flesh-
           and-blood creature.  More terrifying than any movie monster.

           Steven continues flipping pages...
           A mock JAWS ONE-SHEET in the vein of Drew Struzan shows...

           GENE HACKMAN as POLICE CHIEF BRODY...
           JEFF BRIDGES as MATT HOOPER, the marine biologist... 
           LEE MARVIN as SAM QUINT, the shark hunter...

           A mini-trailer plays in Steven's head...

           Quint, Brody, and Hooper (played by the actors in the poster) 
           sail the high seas on Quint’s boat Orca to battle the shark. 
           The beast LEAPS onto the deck.  CHOMPING the boat to pieces.

           The shark hunters fight back with ropes and harpoons.  Quint 
           blasts away with a Tommy gun as the Orca sinks beneath him.

           BACK TO REAL LIFE -- Steven turns the last page. END MONTAGE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Steven pulls into his driveway in Laurel Canyon.  Still on   
           a creative high.  Until he sees SOMEONE on his front porch...

                                 ZANUCK
                        You must think you’re a pretty 
                        clever son of a bitch.

           Zanuck snatches the Jaws manuscript.  Calm but still pissed. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Dick, I have to direct this.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Look, you’re a good kid...

                                 STEVEN
                        You don’t understand.  This is the 
                        one.  The one that’s been living in 
                        my head since I was seven.  Pure 
                        adventure.  Still needs work, but --
                                 ZANUCK
                        Steven!
                             (off his look)
                        We’ve already got a director.

           A gut punch.  All Steven’s hopes crushed.   

                                 ZANUCK
                        IFA reps Benchley.  They wanted one 
                        of their guys.  We’re meeting him 
                        in New York.  It’s out of my hands.

           Steven paces.  Mind in overdrive.  Not ready to let go.

                                 STEVEN
                        Benchley’s gonna be there?
                             (off his nod)
                        So you can drop my name in his ear.

                                 ZANUCK
                        You telling me how to negotiate?

                                 STEVEN
                        Just keep me in the game.  Think of 
                        it like, I don’t know... insurance.

           Silence.  Zanuck doesn’t like being told his business.  But 
           there’s something about this kid... He can’t tell him “no.”

                                 STEVEN
                        You don’t see what I see here.  
                        I’ll do anything to make this 
                        movie, Dick.  It has to be me.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Good night, Steven.

           INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           VICKI (23), a pretty brunette, sits on the couch, paging 
           through a screenplay titled “Earthquake.”  Steven enters.

                                 VICKI
                        Who was that?

                                 STEVEN
                        Nobody.  A colleague.

           ELMER and ZALMAN, two Cocker Spaniels, greet him.  As he 
           passes Vicki, she takes his hand.  He barely seems to notice.

                                 VICKI
                        Wanna get something to eat?
                                 STEVEN
                        Maybe later.

           He grabs a notebook.  Starts scribbling.  Lost to his work.  
           The frown on Vicki’s face says this is a familiar scenario.

                                 VICKI
                        Yeah.  Maybe later.

           Her gaze drifts to a FRAMED PHOTO on the side table.  She and 
           Steven at the beach.  Arms around each other.  Happier times.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 21 CLUB RESTAURANT -- DAY

           A SCRIPT drops onto the table...

                                     “JAWS”
                                 a screenplay by 
                                 Peter Benchley

           PETER BENCHLEY (33) slides it across the table.  Strong, 
           confident, movie-star handsome.  Exeter and Harvard educated.

           Zanuck sits across the table with his producing partner, 
           DAVID BROWN (57), a savvy businessman and grandfather type.

                                 ZANUCK
                        We didn’t commission a draft yet.

                                 BROWN
                             (quick, diplomatic)
                        But we’re impressed with your 
                        enthusiasm for the project all the 
                        same.  We’ll get to it right away.

           Benchley checks his watch.  A glance at the door.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        He knows the meeting was at noon?

                                 ZANUCK
                        Hard to get a cab at this hour.

           Benchley grows more irritable.  Zanuck fills the dead air:

                                 ZANUCK
                        Like I was telling you earlier, we 
                        just finished shooting a picture 
                        down in Texas.  Sugarland Express.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        You making kids’ movies now?
                                 ZANUCK
                        Hardly.  It’s a Bonnie and Clyde 
                        thing.  Young couple on the lam.  
                        You wanna talk directors, this kid 
                        Steven is a crackerjack talent.  
                        Visual style like nobody I’ve seen.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Hold on... You’re auditioning a new 
                        director?  I thought we had a deal.

           Brown shoots Zanuck a look: what are you doing?  Then...

                                 BROWN
                        As producers, Mr. Benchley, it’s 
                        our job to find the right director.  
                        If it has to be someone from your 
                        agency, Dick Richards is our man. 

                                 BENCHLEY
                             (looking up)
                        We’ll find out soon enough.

           DICK RICHARDS (37) makes his entrance.  A straight shooter.  
           Nothing flamboyant about him, but nothing memorable either.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. 21 CLUB RESTAURANT -- LATER

           Empty plates in front of them.  Benchley downs the rest of 
           his third martini.  Sets the empty glass next to two others.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        ...no, my grandfather wasn’t just 
                        part of the Algonquin Round Table, 
                        he was a charter member.  You could 
                        find him holding court right over 
                        there with Dorothy Parker and 
                        George Kaufman, trading quips over 
                        whiskey sours and lamb medallions. 
                             (beat)
                        Well, I think I’ve bored us all 
                        long enough.  Shall we move ahead?

           His eyes now on Richards: impress me.   

                                 RICHARDS
                        First, let me say how excited I am 
                        about this, Mr. Benchley.  Ever 
                        since I saw Moby-Dick, I’ve wanted 
                        to make a picture about a whale.
           Benchley laughs, thinking Richards has made a joke.  
           Richards pauses.  Lights a smoke.  Makes his pitch...

                                 RICHARDS
                        We open on our tiny fishing  
                        village.  People going about their 
                        lives.  Then, out on the ocean, we 
                        reveal a titanic whale of a beast...

           Benchley frowns.  It’s not a joke.  Zanuck scrambles...

                                 ZANUCK
                        A shark, of course.  Not a whale.  

                                 RICHARDS
                        Of course, but whale-like 
                        proportions.  Makes the whale that 
                        swallowed Jonah look like a guppy.

           Benchley’s blood boils every time he hears the “w” word...

                                 RICHARDS
                        ...this magnificent creature is a 
                        living, breathing terror.  A whale 
                        that will give people nightmares...

                                 BENCHLEY
                        For the love of God, what’s wrong
                        with you?  You blundering ass, it’s 
                        not a whale, it’s a FUCKING SHARK!

           Benchley punctuates the outburst by SLAMMING a thunderous 
           fist on the table.  It’s like a bazooka blast in a library.  

           EXT. 21 CLUB RESTAURANT -- DAY

           Zanuck and Brown exit into the Manhattan sunshine.

                                 BROWN
                        I thought that went well.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Jesus ever-lovin’ Christ.  If they 
                        want somebody from IFA to direct 
                        this picture, Benchley’s agent 
                        better get his goddamn act 
                        together.  I can tell you this: I’m 
                        not going on the ocean with a guy 
                        doesn’t know a shark from a whale.

           Benchley follows.  Fuming.  A bit drunk.  A beat, then...

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Tell me about this Sugarland kid.
           INT. EDITING SUITE -- DAY

           A scene from The Sugarland Express plays out on a flatbed 
           MOVIOLA.  Ben Johnson shoots out the tires on a news van. 

           VERNA FIELDS (55) sits in front of the Moviola, the scene 
           reflected in her glasses.  Matronly but serious about her 
           work, she’s known affectionately as the “mother cutter.”  

                                 VERNA
                        Hand me that last shot, will you?
                             (silence, then...)
                        Steven, are you listening to me?

           She turns.  He’s across the room.  On the phone.

                                 STEVEN
                             (into phone)
                        Just tell him Steven called.  Again.

           He hangs up.  Trying not to show it, but he’s depressed.

                                 VERNA
                        Don’t act like you’re surprised.  
                        You think Zanuck’s got nothing 
                        better to do than sit around 
                        waiting for your call?  Right now, 
                        just be happy that you’re working.

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s the point, Verna... This one 
                        doesn’t feel like just another job.

           KNOCK-KNOCK.  RICK FIELDS (20s), Verna’s son, a shaggy-haired 
           SoCal kid, strolls in with a bag lunch.  Hands it to Verna.

                                 RICK
                        One tuna salad sandwich, ma.

           As Rick takes a seat, Steven paces.  Thinking.  Planning.

                                 STEVEN
                        I could go over his head.

                                 VERNA
                        Think about that.  Dick Zanuck 
                        doesn’t like being pushed around.  
                        God’s sake, the guy fired Kurosawa.

                                 STEVEN
                        Sid will take my call.  He’s the 
                        boss.  Zanuck has to listen to him.

           Out of nowhere, the phone RINGS.  Rick answers.

                        Sugarland slave labor department.

           He listens for a moment, then holds out the phone to Steven.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- DAY

           A gleaming onyx building.  The Black Tower.

           INT. SHEINBERG’S OFFICE -- DAY

           As Steven enters, we find... SID SHEINBERG (38), President 
           and COO, standing behind his desk.  Law degree from Columbia.  
           A born academic, but a man who knows how to work with people.

           He’s wrapping up a conversation with LEW WASSERMAN (60), 
           Chairman and CEO.  Gray hair, big black glasses.  Power, Inc.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Come in, Steven.  Mr. Wasserman 
                        and I were just finishing up here.  

           Wasserman drops a MANUSCRIPT on Sheinberg’s desk, then 
           silently exits... Casting a stern look at Steven as he goes.

                                 STEVEN
                        I hear he only shows up when 
                        there’s a green light.  Or when 
                        somebody’s getting shut down.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Seems like there’s a lot more red 
                        lights than green ones these days.

           Steven spies the manuscript... JAWS.  Shit.  
           It all clicks: Wasserman’s look, the “red light” comment...  

                                 SHEINBERG
                        So... Let’s talk. 

                                 STEVEN
                             (scared)
                        Listen, this was... I know what you 
                        think, but I didn’t steal it, I...  
                        Please don’t cancel my contract.

           A tense beat.  Sheinberg stares him down.  Finally smiles.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Steven.  If I fired you, I’d be a 
                        bigger fool than you take me for.
           A KNOCK at the door... Then Zanuck and Brown enter.  With a 
           crafty grin, Zanuck drops a SCREENPLAY into Steven’s lap...

           Peter Benchley’s screenplay for Jaws.

           Steven is speechless.  His dream project now in his hands.  
           His nervous gaze bounces around the room.  Is this for real?

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Mr. Zanuck’s vote of confidence  
                        says a lot.  But you’ve still got a 
                        long road ahead of you here, sir.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve made this movie before, Sid. 
                        Only this time, it’s a shark 
                        instead of a big rig truck, right?  

           He nods to an autographed poster of DUEL on Sheinberg’s wall. 
           A menacing big rig looms over a tiny car like a steel demon.

                                 STEVEN
                             (holds up the script)
                        But if this is anything like his 
                        book, it’s gonna need some work...

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Then don’t sit here talking to me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STEVEN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           A RED PEN slashes through DIALOGUE and STAGE DIRECTIONS.

           Steven makes notes on the Jaws script in RED INK.
           Vicki sleeps next to him on the WATERBED as he works.

           A LINE OF DESCRIPTION jumps out at Steven: “The shark 
           explodes from the water, seizing Alex and the raft in its 
           jaws... A foam of blood and water spews from its mouth...” 

           Steven seems shaken.  The moment clearly disturbing him.  
           He shifts in bed, making a small WAVE.  Looks over at...

           A MOVIE POSTER on the wall.  Gently BOUNCING up and down.    

           Steven LAYS DOWN.  And just as his head hits the pillow...  
           SPLASH!  He falls back, THROUGH the mattress of the waterbed.

           UNDERWATER -- Steven swims up.  Clawing for the surface...  
           But it’s BLOCKED by a thin, skin-like layer.  He can see 
           VICKI through the plastic... And HIMSELF.  Asleep beside her.
           Steven is trapped inside his waterbed.

           Fear and dread overwhelm him...  He’s losing control.  
           Then... A FLICKER OF LIGHT below.  Steven swims down as...

           A SUPER 8 CAMERA floats by.  

           Steven keeps swimming.  Follows the faint flicker until...  

           THUD!  He runs into a WALL.  Covered in moss, mud, and 
           barnacles.  The FLICKERING LIGHT shines through a pinhole. 

           Steven brushes the muck aside to widen the FLICKERING LIGHT.  
           Not a wall... A window.  He peers through the glass, into...

           AN OLD TIME MOVIE THEATER.  The same one from the opening.  

           STEVEN’S POV -- A LITTLE BOY and his FATHER sit watching the 
           show.  Staring right at Steven, but seemingly unaware of him. 

           The flickering light is from the PROJECTION BOOTH above them.

           Steven POUNDS on the glass to get their attention... CRACK! 
           The screen SPLINTERS from top to bottom, spider-webbing as...    

           A SHADOW looms behind Steven.  He whips around to see...   

           THE MECHANICAL HORROR.  Bolted steel beneath ripped flesh.  
           Razor sharp metal teeth.  Steven stares deep into its JAWS...

           INT. STEVEN’S BEDROOM -- THAT MOMENT

           Steven bolts up from the nightmare.  Sweating.  Gasping.

           He picks up the script from beside him.  Looks at the fresh 
           RED INK.  He swipes his hand across it.  Streaks like blood.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL / POLO LOUNGE -- DAY

           Steven and Benchley.  McCarthy salads in front of them.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        There’s got to be human drama on 
                        the island.  This can’t be three 
                        men out on a boat chasing a fish.

                                 STEVEN
                        But that’s the draw of it!  Hell, 
                        the shark is the best character.

           Benchley seethes just below the surface.  Watching as Steven 
           flips through the script.  Every page slashed with RED INK.
                                 STEVEN
                        Take Hooper, the marine biologist.  
                        The chief needs him to help kill 
                        the shark, but you’re more 
                        interested in him harpooning 
                        Brody’s wife.  And then you have 
                        him asking her if she fantasizes 
                        about being raped by black guys?!

           Benchley can’t tear his eyes away from those RED MARKS.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I didn’t set out to make him 
                        sympathetic.  I wanted a sense of 
                        suburban blight, middle class 
                        ennui.  People with real problems.

                                 STEVEN
                        Audiences want an escape from their 
                        problems.  A theme park ride.  
                        That screen’s not a mirror, it’s 
                        a window.  We’re here to entertain.

           Benchley says nothing.  Just slowly nods.

                                 STEVEN
                        Boil this thing down to its 
                        essence.  Three guys, one shark.  
                        High adventure.  That’s a movie.

           Benchley drains his martini.  Forces a “fuck you” smile.  
           PRE-LAP the CLICK-CLACK sounds of typewriter keys as...

           INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- DUSK TILL DAWN

           Steven pounds out new script pages.  Working fast.  He 
           doesn’t even notice Vicki watching him from the doorway.

           Pages pile up beside him in a TIME LAPSE as he diligently 
           works out his own set of revisions to Benchley’s screenplay.

           Vicki brings a plate of food... He still doesn’t notice.    

           TIME LAPSE as more pages pile up.  Vicki stands watching 
           again.  Staring at Steven... And the food he hasn’t touched.

           INT. ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY -- DAY

           Steven hands Zanuck and Brown a stack of pages.

                                 STEVEN
                        I worked up some new pages, got 
                        Benchley tackling another rewrite.  
                        But we need a fresh set of eyes... 
           EXT. GOTTLIEB’S HOUSE -- DAY

           CARL GOTTLIEB (36) signs for a package.  Affable guy, stout, 
           walrus mustache... And then there’s those RED NANTUCKET PANTS.  

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        There’s a friend of mine.  Actor, 
                        writer.  Works on The Odd Couple.  
                        He’s pretty deadly with a red pen.

           Gottlieb opens the package to find...
           Benchley’s script with a NOTE attached: EVISCERATE IT - S.

           INT. ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY -- DAY

           Back to the same meeting...

                                 ZANUCK
                        Maybe he’s got some casting ideas, 
                        too, since we’re shit out of luck.

           Zanuck rips down head shots from a CASTING BOARD as...

                                 ZANUCK
                        Hackman passed on the chief.  So 
                        did Duvall.  Bridges was interested 
                        in Hooper, but had a scheduling 
                        snafu.  Bottoms and Voight passed.  

                                 STEVEN
                        I talked to Lee Marvin’s agent.
                        He doesn’t want to play a shark 
                        hunter.  Rather go fishing for 
                        real... And Sterling Hayden’s got 
                        the IRS so far up his ass, he’ll 
                        never see a dime from this thing.

                                 ZANUCK
                        This is ri-goddamn-diculous.  I’m 
                        ready to pull some kid out of the 
                        community theater down the street...

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME -- NIGHT

           Steven sits alone on the patio.  Drinking a bottle of Coke 
           while guests mingle at the festive Christmas party inside.

                                 ZANUCK (V.O.)
                        Just find me one decent actor for 
                        this picture.  That’s all I want.

           STEVEN’S IMAGINATION -- As he stares into the pool, a SHARK 
           appears in the water.  A primal demon, twisting and stalking.
           BACK TO REAL LIFE -- An UNSEEN MAN approaches from behind.

                                 UNSEEN MAN
                        You okay, chief?

           Steven looks up at... ROY SCHEIDER (41), a worldly guy but 
           mellow as they come.  He grins at Steven.  A little drunk.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Didn’t you hear?  Pool’s closed.  
                        No swimming.  Order of the LAPD.

           INT. ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY -- DAY

           SCHEIDER’S PHOTO is tacked on the board under “CHIEF BRODY.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GOTTLIEB’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Gottlieb pages through the script.  Marking with a RED PEN.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        Plumbing the depths of character 
                        works fine for Melville, but this 
                        is mass entertainment.  We’ve only 
                        got two hours to tell our story.

                                 BENCHLEY (V.O.)
                        That doesn’t concern me as much as 
                        this new ending you talked about...

           Slashing dialogue.  Scribbling notes.  TRANSITION TO...

           EXT. BEL-AIR HOTEL -- DAY

           Steven pages through the marked-up script as he enters.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        Peter, we need a rousing ending.  
                        Something people will cheer for.

           INT. BEL-AIR HOTEL RESTAURANT -- DAY

           Benchley sits across from Steven.  Staring at the RED MARKS.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        A shark doesn’t just blow up like a 
                        refinery.  It simply can’t happen.
                             (frustrated)
                        I understand that it’s my book and 
                        your movie.  And I’m trying to stay 
                        objective.  But I feel that I’ve 
                        taken this as far as I can go.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BENCHLEY (CONT'D)
                        I have a new novel I’m trying to 
                        work on and... I’m just all written 
                        out.

                                 STEVEN
                        If that’s how you feel, I can ask 
                        the studio to pay out your contract.

           Benchley mulls it over.  Still not wanting to let go.

                                 STEVEN
                        The movie will still get made.  And 
                        you’ll get your production bonus.  
                        My lawyer can work out the details.

           Benchley nods.  Relieved.  Their handshake is cordial, but 
           still cold on both ends.  As Benchley exits the restaurant...

           He passes Zanuck and Brown on their way in.  Nods to them.  

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Best of luck, gentlemen.

           Off their confused looks...

                                 STEVEN
                        We’re gonna need a new writer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEL-AIR HOTEL RESTAURANT -- LATER

           Carl Gottlieb eats a massive breakfast of eggs, bacon, 
           sausage, pancakes, and hash browns as he gives his opinion.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Boys, every now and then, you gotta 
                        just buck the rules.  I’m telling 
                        ya, this is a two act movie.  Act 
                        one: we’re on dry land and shit 
                        goes bad.  Act two: let’s go catch 
                        us one big son-of-a-bitchin’ fish!
                             (takes another bite)
                        Least that’s the way I’d do it.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Let’s say you were doing it. 

           Gottlieb nearly chokes on a bite.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        You guys serious?
                                 ZANUCK
                        I don’t joke about motion pictures.  
                        Just know that we don’t have the 
                        budget for this kind of appetite.

           Steven puts an arm around his buddy.  In this together.

                                 STEVEN
                        Now all we need’s a place to shoot.

                                 ZANUCK
                        As you requested, Mr. Alves is 
                        freezing his ass off as we speak...

           EXT. FERRY -- DAY

           Joe Alves, bundled up against the New England cold, rides a 
           ferry across calm seas.  A flurry of snow whirls around him. 

                                 ZANUCK (V.O.)
                        Honestly, kid, I don’t see the 
                        point.  Studio feels shooting on 
                        the lot is the most sensible plan.

           The ferry docks beside a SIGN that reads: MARTHA’S VINEYARD.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        Come on, Dick.  When have you ever 
                        known me to do anything sensible?

           Old sea captain’s homes.  White picket fences.  A gorgeous 
           harbor.  Alves raises his CAMERA and takes some pictures.

           As he snaps pictures, the PHOTOS pop up ON SCREEN, one right 
           after another, until they’re all we can see.  MATCH CUT TO...

           INT. SHEINBERG’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Sheinberg stares at the same PHOTOS laid out on his desk.  
           Alves, Zanuck, and Brown hover.  Waiting for his response.

                                 STEVEN
                        Sid... This place is Amity.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        I’m not saying it’s not beautiful,  
                        sir.  I’m saying it’s not practical. 
                             (pushes the photos aside)
                        This is a shark picture.  We’ll save 
                        a lot of time and trouble, spend a 
                        few weeks in the tank...
           INT. STAGE 12 / UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- DAY

           The largest soundstage on the lot.  29,500 square feet.

                                 SHEINBERG (V.O.)
                        ...and build the rest on a stage.

           Steven walks with Sheinberg.  Alves, Zanuck, and Brown trail 
           behind them.  The men dwarfed by the humongous, empty stage.  

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Stage 12.  We can build the docks 
                        right here, all practical interiors.

           Steven paces, looking around.  Picturing in his mind’s eye...

           STEVEN’S IMAGINATION -- BEHIND STEVEN, we see a TIME LAPSE.  
           WORKERS building Amity Island on this gigantic stage.  Steven 
           walks and talks in real time as the IMAGINARY SET goes up.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Sure.  We control the weather.  The 
                        sunset.  The tides.  And it’ll be 
                        everything we want it to be.  But 
                        there’s still one little problem... 

           When the set’s done, they’re standing on the AMITY DOCKS at 
           sunset.  An incredible backdrop of stylized, man-made beauty.  

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Don’t say it.

                                 STEVEN
                        Sid, it just won’t look real.  

           He’s right.  It’s beautiful, but nothing close to reality.

                                 STEVEN
                        If people don’t buy into the world, 
                        then they won’t buy into the shark.

           His conviction is contagious.  His energy undeniable.  
           Sheinberg takes in the faux Amity, like he can almost see it.  
           Moments later, it FADES AWAY, bringing us back to REAL LIFE. 

                                 STEVEN
                        We need to shoot this on the ocean.
                             (off Sheinberg’s look)
                        You know it’s the right move, Sid.  
                        Trust me.  You won’t regret this.

           A tense beat.  Sheinberg weighing his decision.  Finally...

                                                                CUT TO:
           HEADLINE in DAILY VARIETY:

                     “JAWS” TO FILM THIS SUMMER IN MARTHA’S VINEYARD                   
                         NEW SCRIBE REPLACES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR

           INT. LAW OFFICE -- DAY

           Benchley sneers at the headline.  Tosses it aside as... 
           BRUCE RAMER (40s), smile as slick as his suit, slides a stack 
           of papers across his large oak desk for Benchley to sign.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I still don’t see why Steven needed 
                        to involve his own lawyer in this.

                                 BRUCE
                        My client just wants to be sure 
                        there’s no miscommunication here.  
                        You’re giving up creative control.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        At this point, that’s a blessing.  
                        Seems your client has very little 
                        understanding of the real world.

           Bruce stews at that.  Silent.  Hands Benchley his CHECK.

                                 BRUCE
                        I believe we’re all settled then.
                             (beat)
                        And by the way... My client thinks 
                        your book is a piece of shit.

           Benchley hides his disdain under a sardonic smirk. 

           INT. LOBBY -- DAY

           Benchley dials a pay phone.  Waits, scowling, as it rings.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        New York Times.

           INT. ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY -- DAY

           Steven slams the Times Arts section on a desk.  A headline 
           says: “JAWS” AUTHOR BITES BACK.  Steven yells into the phone.

                                 STEVEN
                        You told Benchley I hate his book?!  

           He drops the paper in the trash.  Listens for a beat.  Smiles.  
                                 STEVEN
                        You’re a real shark, Bruce, you 
                        know that?  I’m gonna ditch the 
                        fish and make this movie about you.

           Steven hangs up, heads into the outer office, where there’s a 
           buzz of excitement.  Zanuck greets him.  He’s followed by...

           BILL GILMORE (40s), a casual but serious studio executive. 
           Steven bear hugs him.  So tight, Gilmore wheezes.

                                 STEVEN
                        Bill Gilmore!  The Sugarland gang’s 
                        all here!  You cut the checks, 
                        I’ll put ‘em on screen.  Sounds 
                        like a good plan, don’t you think?

                                 GILMORE
                        Shooting on the lot sounds better.  
                        Studio’s got me watching your ass 
                        here, kid.  If you were wondering.

                                 STEVEN
                             (smiling)
                        I wasn’t... But thanks for asking.

           Steven pats him on the arm as he walks toward the CAMERA.  
           The CAMERA swings around him to REVEAL that he’s now in...

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE -- DAY

           The Jaws creature shop.  Without missing a step, Steven 
           greets Alves, observing as a work crew assembles three 
           different SHARKS, for now nothing but SKELETAL WOOD FRAMES.

           Alves gives a few instructions to one of his guys, a BURLY 
           CARPENTER with TATTOOS, while Steven inspects the sharks.

                                 STEVEN
                        You have everything you need?

                                 ALVES
                        To build ‘em all, sure.  To bring 
                        ‘em to life, we called the expert.

           Alves leads him to a work bench, where BOB MATTEY (62), the 
           most humble special F/X legend you’re ever likely to meet, 
           tinkers with a control board.  Mattey shakes Steven’s hand. 

                                 MATTEY
                        Bob Mattey.
                                 STEVEN
                        I know who you are, Mr. Mattey.  I 
                        saw 20,000 Leagues when I was 
                        eight.  That squid is still the 
                        most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.

           Mattey smiles modestly.  As Steven and Alves walk away...

                                 STEVEN
                        I thought he was retired.

                                 ALVES
                        I told him we were building the 
                        biggest shark ever put on film.  
                        Suddenly, he wasn’t retired anymore.

           Rick Fields, Verna’s son, meets Steven at the soundstage 
           door.  Hands him an ENVELOPE.  Inside: a ticket to BOSTON.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. STEVEN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           The ticket sits next to an open suitcase.  Steven packs.  
           He doesn’t notice Vicki watching from the doorway.  Until... 

                                 VICKI
                        Were you even gonna say good-bye?

                                 STEVEN
                        Of course.  I was hoping you’d come 
                        visit the set once we got up and...
                             (off her look)
                        You know I care about you, Vick.

           He reaches out to her.  She pulls away.

                                 VICKI
                        If you have to say it, then you 
                        don’t.  You’re obsessed, Steven. 
                        You’re in love with a bunch of 
                        imaginary people... And a shark.  
                        And the saddest part of it is, I 
                        really believe you wanted me once.

           She almost laughs at the absurdity of it...

                                 VICKI
                        Now you’re just too busy fucking your 
                        movie to bother with anyone else.

           She walks out.  Much as he wants to, he can’t tell her she’s 
           wrong.  So he sits there on the bed with the dogs.  Silent.
           EXT. LAX / INT. 747 -- DAY

           A TWA 747 lifts off into smoggy L.A. skies.

           PUSH IN through the window to find Steven and Gottlieb.  
           Steven’s nose in a book called “Sharks of the Pacific Ocean.”

           Thoughts gnaw at Gottlieb as Steven devours his book...

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Steve, you realize we’re less than 
                        a week from shooting and we’ve got 
                        no script, no cast... and no shark.

                                 STEVEN
                        No problem.

           PRE-LAP “The Real Me” by The Who as we BEGIN MONTAGE.  
           A kinetic sequence like a live-action SCRAPBOOK.  It should 
           resemble SUPER 8 FOOTAGE with film perforations on the sides.

           IN THE AIRPLANE -- Steven and Gottlieb work on the script.  
           Animated discussions.  RED NOTES all over the current draft.

           A TELEGRAM SLIDES across the whole screen.  Brownish-yellow 
           stock, from the days before email and cell phones.  It reads:  

                             Z, LAYOVER IN NEW YORK.
                          POTENTIAL HOOPER CASTING. - STEVE

           It WIPES off the screen to reveal... NEW YORK CITY.

           THE WARWICK HOTEL -- A hallmark of big city class and 
           sophistication.  Steven and Gottlieb knock on door #2074.

           RICHARD DREYFUSS (26) opens the door.  Grinning like a fool 
           with his shaggy beard, glasses... and long madras nightshirt?

           He leads them into his SUITE, where there are pillows on the 
           bare floor... Candles burning... Half-naked people snoozing.

           Steven pitches the movie to Dreyfuss.  Animated and excited... 
           But Dreyfuss is clearly not interested.  He shows them out. 

           Once they’re gone, he heads over to the window.  Stares 
           outside with a smile at the ZIEGFELD THEATER.  Marquee reads:

                                   OPENING FRIDAY
                        “THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ”
                            introducing RICHARD DREYFUSS  

           PUSH IN on a LIGHT BULB on the marquee.  The light FLARES... 
           Becoming a bright New England SUN that shines down on a SIGN:
           WELCOME TO MARTHA’S VINEYARD -- Steven tours the island in a 
           car like a kid in a candy store.  This place truly is AMITY.

           One by one, Joe Alves’s LOCATION PHOTOS become real as...  

           Steven visits downtown EDGARTOWN... 
           MENEMSHA HARBOR...
           CHAPPAQUIDDICK FERRY... 
           The Brody residence at EAST CHOP...

           ...finally arriving at a real life LOG CABIN.  His home for 
           the shoot.  He greets Rick Fields... And his beloved DOGS.

           NEW YORK PUBLISHING HOUSE -- Copies of Jaws slide off the 
           presses.  In DOUBLE EXPOSURE, it climbs the best seller list.

           AT THE 21 CLUB -- Benchley pops the cork on a bottle of 
           champagne.  Toasts his success with a crowd of literati. 

           AT THE CABIN -- Gottlieb types by the fire as Steven paces 
           atop the dining table, phone to his ear.  SPLIT SCREEN with...

           ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY --  Zanuck on the phone, Brown at the 
           casting board.  Brown shuffles HEAD SHOTS of new actors...

           LORRAINE GARY as “Ellen Brody”... 
           MURRAY HAMILTON as “Mayor Vaughn”... 
           Even CARL GOTTLIEB as “Meadows” is on the board.

           AT THE CABIN -- Steven hangs up.  Consults his own casting 
           board.  Two roles still remain blank: QUINT and HOOPER.

           NEW YORK CITY -- A line of people buy tickets for Duddy 
           Kravitz at the Ziegfeld... Richard Dreyfuss among them.

           IN THE THEATER -- ON SCREEN, Duddy Kravitz smiles like a 
           jackass as he acts like he’s jerking off with a pipe and rag.

           Nobody laughs.  Dreyfuss cringes in his seat.  Mortified.

           AT THE CABIN -- LIGHTS shine as a car pulls up...

           The front door opens... It’s DREYFUSS.  Seaman’s bag in hand.  
           With his knit hat, beard, and glasses, he is MATT HOOPER.

           ZANUCK/BROWN COMPANY -- His HEAD SHOT goes on the board.  
           Brown looks at the empty spot under Quint’s name.  Sighs.   

           He turns to say something to Zanuck, who’s got his eyes fixed 
           on... A framed one-sheet for THE STING hanging on the wall.

           AT THE CABIN -- Steven hangs up.  Pumps his fist in victory.  
           He tacks a new head shot up under “QUINT”... ROBERT SHAW.
           DAY-PLAYER AGREEMENTS -- Universal contracts SLIDE across 
           screen, DOUBLE EXPOSED with a casting call for TOWNSPEOPLE.

           ON THE UNIVERSAL LOT -- TIME LAPSE as the SHARKS are built.  
           THIRTY FOOT MONSTERS grow from SKELETONS to full LEVIATHANS.

           ON THE BACKLOT -- Sheinberg, Zanuck, and Brown watch a team 
           of F/X GUYS lower the FULL SHARK into the Falls Lake tank.

           Alves and Mattey work the controls as the SHARK explodes out 
           of the water, attached to a metal JIB ARM.  JAWS chomp down.

           A TELEGRAM SLIDES across the screen:

                      SHARK TANK TEST SUCCESSFUL.  SEE YOU MONDAY. -Z 

           It WIPES off as the SHARKS are CRATED and loaded onto FLATBED 
           BIG RIGS.  GATES open as THE SHARK FLEET rolls off the lot.

           U.S. INTERSTATE MAP -- A RED LINE traces the truck route to  
           the east.  DOUBLE EXPOSURE shots of big rigs on the road. 

           ON THE HIGHWAY -- A bored LITTLE GIRL stares out the window 
           of a station wagon as the trucks roll past.  She notices...

           SHARP TEETH and a BLACK LIFELESS EYE through the slats in one 
           of the truck crates.  Her eyes widen.  Chilled to the bone.

           EDGARTOWN -- Steven’s army has arrived.  Zanuck and Brown 
           accompany a massive FLEET of trucks, trailers, and equipment.

           Steven hands out custom-made JAWS T-SHIRTS to the crew. 

           PRODUCTION OFFICE -- TIME LAPSE as desks, Xerox machines, and 
           phones are set up in the PRODUCTION OFFICE.  Mission control.

           OAK BLUFFS HARBOR -- A mini-city of SHACKS and WORK BENCHES 
           goes up.  Big rigs with SHARK CRATES roll in beside a SIGN: 

                                      SHARK CITY

           IN THE BOAT HOUSE -- Alves supervises the BURLY CARPENTER  
           with TATTOOS as CREW MEMBERS make final touches to the sharks.

           Steven sets a hand-painted sign inside one shark’s mouth.  
           The menacing beasts have earned a single collective name... 

                                       “BRUCE”

           AROUND EDGARTOWN -- Various crew members set up generators, 
           run cable, and finish construction on mobile dressing rooms.

           A HIPPIE GRIP finishes changing a tire on the “JAWS” AVIS 
           TRUCK.  The DRIVER happily pays him with a SIX PACK OF BEER.
           Crew members haul gear into the historic KELLEY HOUSE hotel.

           THE KELLEY HOUSE -- Steven and Rick Fields help Verna turn 
           a pair of large adjoined rooms into a full EDITING SUITE.

           PRODUCTION OFFICE -- Steven, Zanuck, and Brown lay out the 
           PRODUCTION BOARD as the island shooting schedule is made.  

           The board notes 35 DAYS ON LAND, then 20 DAYS AT SEA.  

           CLOSE PAN across the board, made of moveable CARDBOARD SLATS.  
           Each slat contains written info for one full day of shooting.

           The info on each slat DISSOLVES into a LIVE-ACTION MOVIE that 
           shows Steven filming that particular scene.  A visual diary of 
           the shoot similar to moving CHAPTER SELECTIONS on a DVD menu.  

           ON THE DAY 1 SLAT -- Steven directs Scheider and a college 
           boy, JONATHAN FILLEY, discovering the first shark victim.

           PRODUCTION OFFICE -- Steven moves the DAY 1 SLAT (with the 
           tiny movie still playing) to a board marked “COMPLETED.”

           Steven moves DAY 2 and DAY 3 (both playing scenes with 
           Scheider and Dreyfuss in Amity) over to the “COMPLETED” side.

           He’s got it all under control... Like he was born to do this. 

           Before you know it, STEVEN has moved 27 DAYS of land shooting 
           to the COMPLETED BOARD without breaking a sweat.  END MONTAGE.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DAY

           Gottlieb walks the busy streets, going over the script.  
           MURRAY HAMILTON (51), mayor of Amity in Jaws, finds him.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Carl!  Look what I bought in town!  
                        I’ll wear it for the ferry scene!

           He holds up a SPORT COAT covered in tiny white ANCHORS.    
           The same one we see him wearing in the finished film.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        You run it by wardrobe, Murray?

                                 HAMILTON
                        Goddamn right I did!  If you think 
                        you’re gonna upstage me with those 
                        fucking red pants, forget about it. 
           As he storms off, we fly around town, amid cast and crew, to 
           find... Steven.  Talking to a REPORTER on a downtown street.

                                 REPORTER
                        You’ve been on the island nearly a 
                        month.  When do we see the shark?

                                 STEVEN
                        Soon.  Soon enough.  I promise.

                                 REPORTER
                        Has it been daunting for you 
                        adapting such a successful novel?

           Steven has a chance to snipe back at Benchley... Takes it.

                                 STEVEN
                        Mr. Benchley’s take on the story was 
                        different from ours.  His characters 
                        just weren’t appealing.  He had us 
                        rooting for the shark to eat everyone.

           INT. BENCHLEY’S STUDY -- DAY

           Benchley tosses the paper aside.  Goes back to pounding 
           typewriter keys.  After a beat, he stops.  Picks up the PHONE. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHARK CITY -- DAY

           Steven rips a canvas tarp off a shrouded MASSIVE SHAPE.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Ladies and gentlemen... meet Bruce.  

           It’s our first full look at the incredibly realistic GREAT 
           WHITE.  Held above water by a series of ropes and pulleys.

                                 ALVES
                        Oh yeah.  He’ll make a nice snack 
                        out of that Chrissie girl tomorrow.

                                 STEVEN
                        He better or we don’t have an 
                        opening.  Let’s give him a bath.

           GRIPS slowly lower the shark into the water...
           Floating there, just under the waves, it looks so real.  
           Then... An odd grey LIQUID seems to be pooling around Bruce.   

           Everyone seems curious... Puzzled... Except for...
           Bob Mattey, the F/X guru.  He knows this is not good.

                                 MATTEY
                        Pull it up!  Now!  

           As the shark comes up, the entire COAT OF PAINT comes off.  
           Running like mascara to reveal the yellow neoprene beneath. 

                                 ZANUCK
                        Looks like a great white turd.

                        Goddamn salt water just ate through 
                        him like battery acid.  We’ll have 
                        to recalibrate, repaint, reseal...

           Bill Gilmore, the studio production exec, spits out a breath.

                                 GILMORE
                        Great.  How much will that cost?

                                 ALVES
                        Couple days at least.  Maybe three, 
                        four.  If we can bump Chrissie --

                                 GILMORE
                        No.  We move her back, it pushes us 
                        into July and we’re over schedule. 
                        And once that summer crowd rolls 
                        in, we’re gonna be paying summer 
                        prices.  We can’t afford to stall.
                             (to Steven)
                        We can shoot her back on the lot.

           Steven does not want to hear that.  Brown pulls him aside.

                                 BROWN
                        This is your picture.  Your call.  
                        Dick and I stand by your decision.

           Steven paces.  Thinking hard.  Then, back to the others...

                                 STEVEN
                        We’re shooting her tomorrow.

                                 ALVES
                        Steve, I need a couple days --
                                 STEVEN
                        We’ll shoot her without the shark.

           He storms off.  Gilmore runs to catch him.  We’re now on...

           EXT. COW BAY BEACH -- DAWN

           Steven and Gilmore walk side by side along the shore as the 
           crew makes preparations to shoot the opening scene of Jaws.

                                 GILMORE
                        Think about what you’re doing.  
                        God’s sake, it’s a shark picture, 
                        and you wanna leave out the shark.  

                                 STEVEN
                        We’re implying it.  Playing up the 
                        tension.  It worked for Hitchcock.

                                 GILMORE
                        Jesus, Steve, you’re not Hitchcock!

           That was a huge ego blow.  Zanuck steps in...

                                 ZANUCK
                        Goddammit, Bill, that was out of 
                        line.

           Steven walks it off.  Finding his focus.  As he paces...

           DOWN THE BEACH -- SUSAN BACKLINIE (26), a gorgeous blonde 
           stuntwoman, stands in a bikini top and cutoff jeans.  She’s 
           playing the girl who’s eaten by Bruce in the opening scene.

           The CREW attaches METAL CLAMPS to her jeans, threading CABLES 
           through them.  Six Pack, the hippie grip, makes adjustments.

                                 SIX PACK
                        I built in a safety catch here.  
                        You get in trouble, just pull.

           IN THE WATER -- Steven wades in with BILL BUTLER (52), his no-
           nonsense director of photography.  Both men in wet suits.  
           Butler mans a watertight CAMERA BOX as Steven directs.

                                 STEVEN
                        Keep it close to the water line.  I 
                        want the audience swimming with her. 

                                 BUTLER
                        Shark’s POV.  Smart thinking, kid.

           The AD calls “picture’s up” and the usual litany of “roll 
           sound,” “roll camera,” begins.  The CLAPPER holds the slate.

                        Marker!

           The traditional clapsticks have been altered to resemble a 
           mouth full of SHARK TEETH.  The “jaws” SNAP SHUT as...

           We dive UNDERWATER to see the cables threaded through Susan’s 
           harness, wrapped around pylons, then stretching back to... 

           THE SHORE -- Two teams of FIVE MEN each, Six Pack included, 
           hold the ropes.  INTERCUT between land and sea as we hear...

                                 STEVEN
                        Action!

           The two teams start a tug of war with Susan in the middle.  
           She’s DRAGGED back and forth, SCREAMING bloody murder.  A 
           brutal assault on the senses.  The entire crew taken aback.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        She’s acting... right?

           But Steven lets it play out.  Then, to Bill Butler...

                                 STEVEN
                        I like it, but it’s still missing 
                        that final punch... Keep shooting.

           Steven dives into the water.  We FOLLOW...

           STEVEN’S UNDERWATER POV -- Like a shark.  Looking up at 
           Susan.  The shot from the film.  Swimming toward her as...

           ABOVE WATER -- Susan JERKS.  A look of horror, then... 
           Something violently PULLS HER UNDER.  A tense beat, then...

           Steven finally emerges with her.  Susan gasping for air.  

                                 SUSAN
                        Jesus, you scared the living shit 
                        out of me, Steven!  Don’t do that!

                                 STEVEN
                        If you’re not scared, the audience 
                        won’t be scared.  It needs to be 
                        real.  First positions, let’s go!   

           The SLATE comes back into frame.  As it SNAPS DOWN...

           EXT. OAK BLUFFS HARBOR -- DAY

           SLAP!  Roy Scheider takes a hand across the face from LEE 
           FIERRO (45), a local actress dressed in black mourning garb.
           They’re shooting the scene from the film where Scheider gets 
           slapped by a dead boy’s mother... But Lee breaks character. 

                                 LEE
                        Oh my God, Roy, I’m so sorry!

                                 STEVEN
                             (from behind the camera)
                        Don’t be sorry!  That was great!

           Scheider scowls at Steven’s cavalier attitude toward his 
           face.  Still, professional that he is, he reassures Lee...

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Don’t worry, Lee.  I was a boxer. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Yeah, he knows how to take a punch.  
                        Let him have it.  We’re going again!

           Scheider shoots him a glare just before we JUMP CUT TO:

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- As the SLAP repeats five or six 
           times.  Scheider takes it hard.  But Steven wants more...

                                 STEVEN
                        Harder!  Do it again!  Make it real!

           More JUMP CUTS, back in action.  Lee SLAPS Scheider again... 
           And this time, she knocks the glasses clean off his face.  

                                 STEVEN
                        One more!

           Furious, Scheider grits his teeth: is this kid for real?  

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- Lee puts on a grieving face again.

                                 LEE
                        Chief Brody?

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Yes?

           SLAP!  The hardest hit yet.  Everyone’s stunned.  Especially 
           Scheider.  But he does not break character.  Nor does Lee.

                                 LEE
                        My boy is dead.  I wanted you to 
                        know that.

           Hold on her a beat until...
                                 STEVEN
                        Cut!  Print!  That’s the one!

           The crew packs up.  Steven pats Scheider on the back,
           though he still seems more fixated on the shot than his actor.

                                 STEVEN
                        Nice work, Roy.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Hope that was real enough for you.

           Scheider storms away, rubbing his cheek.  Dreyfuss grins.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Want some ice?

           Scheider collapses into a chair.  Rubbing his sore face 
           with both hands.  As he moves his hands away, we’re now in...

           INT. BRODY HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Scheider sits at a kitchen table on the Brody house set.  He 
           and his character both tired and frustrated after a long day.

           With him sits JAY MELLO (5), a mop headed kid who plays his 
           son, Sean.  The boy also hides his face in his small hands.

           BEHIND THE CAMERA, Steven films the tender family moment.  

           As the camera rolls, Scheider’s movie son cleverly mimics his 
           every gesture in a playful manner.  Scheider leans toward him.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Give us a kiss.

                                 JAY
                        Why?

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Because I need it.

           Jay moves in to kiss his cheek, but hesitates...
           He just sits there.  Frowning with uncertainty. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Cut!  Everybody take five!

           Steven guides Jay to a quiet part of the set.  The two sit 
           next to each other on the floor like they’re best buddies.

                                 STEVEN
                        What’s wrong, Jay?
                                 JAY
                        My dad’s not supposed to be scared. 

           Scheider watches them closely.  Noticing how much better 
           Steven relates to this kid than to any adult he works with.

                                 STEVEN
                        Your dad’s seen some terrible 
                        things.  He’s worried about holding 
                        his family together.  He’s lost and 
                        alone, like a little boy wandering 
                        in the woods.  He needs you to help 
                        him find his way home.  That’s what 
                        that kiss means.  It means he knows 
                        you love him and he won’t ever be 
                        alone as long as he’s got you here.

           The whole crew is watching now.  A beat... then Jay nods.

           JUMP CUT -- Filming again.  Scheider leans in toward his son.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Give us a kiss.

                                 JAY
                        Why?

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Because I need it.

           Jay kisses his cheek.  Such a tender gesture, Scheider almost 
           breaks character.  Steven seems lost in the moment.  Then...

                                 STEVEN
                             (almost a whisper)
                        One more time.

           As the scene repeats, we hear the dialogue, but we’re only 
           watching Steven’s reaction.  He puts his eye to the CAMERA... 

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- And now it’s a different KITCHEN...

           INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Arnold (37) sits at the table with Young Steven (7), the 
           former tinkering with a CIRCUIT BOARD as he eats.  TITLE:

                                PHOENIX, ARIZONA

           Steven leans in for a closer look...

                                 YOUNG STEVEN
                        How does it work?
                                 ARNOLD
                        Starts with the transistor... Here. 
                        Current trickles to the node.  An 
                        offshoot of the bigger one.  Makes 
                        it so the chain can keep on going...
                             (smiles at him)
                        Just like you.

           Arnold rubs his head.  Steven smiles with pride.  But 
           Steven’s mother, LEAH (34), chortles from across the table.

                                 LEAH
                        He’s nothing like you.

           She grabs the dirty dishes.  Heads to the sink.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Don’t say that in front of him.

                                 LEAH
                        Then don’t work at the table!  
                        That’s all you do is work all day!

           Steven cringes.  Hating this.  But his look says this has 
           happened before.  Arnold squeezes his hand.  A sad smile.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Go to your room, Steven.

           He does as he’s told.  Once he’s gone... 

                                 ARNOLD
                        I’m sorry, Leah.
                             (no response)
                        I said I was sorry.

           SMASH!  Dishes SHATTER in the sink.

                                 LEAH
                        Well say it again, goddammit!
                             (throws the circuit away)
                        You can’t fix us with your tools!

           Arnold snaps back.  We pull away, into the LIVING ROOM, where 
           Steven’s sisters ANNE (5) and baby SUE watch Ozzie and 
           Harriet.  Crying softly, little Anne turns up the volume... 

           The argument intensifies as we move down the HALL, into...

           THE HEATING VENT -- In here, the NOISE from the fight is 
           amplified in echoes.  Almost unbearable.  We soar up into...

           STEVEN’S ROOM -- Steven at his desk.  Listening to the 
           argument coming through the vent.  He wipes away a tear.
           Trying to focus, he loads film into a SUPER 8 CAMERA.

           Sprawled on the desk, an elaborate layout of ARMY MEN.  
           Placed around the set-up are PAPER CUT-OUTS.  Each with 
           a letter on them:  A... B... C... CAMERA PLACEMENTS.   

           Steven lines up his Super 8 with the “A” placement.  The 
           argument still raging, he loses himself in his own reality.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STEVEN’S ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           All is dark.  A crooked tree casts an eerie shadow through 
           the window.  Young Steven sleeps, until he’s stirred by...

                                 ARNOLD
                        Steven... Wake up.

           Groggy, the boy opens his eyes.  Arnold turns on a 
           FLASHLIGHT.  Motions for Steven to get out of bed.

           INT. ARNOLD’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Arnold drives down a lonely highway, Steven beside him.

                                 YOUNG STEVEN
                        What time is it?

                                 ARNOLD
                             (with a smile)
                        Middle of the night.

           From outside, glaring LIGHTS wash over them as they crest 
           a small hill.  Sprawled before them, Steven can now see...

           EXT. FARM FIELD -- NIGHT

           Rows of cars sit parked with their headlights on.  A mass of 
           people gathered.  Sitting on blankets like a communal picnic.

           All of them watching the skies above... Waiting. 

           MOMENTS LATER -- Arnold and Steven wander through the crowd.  
           Mainly families.  Smiling and laughing.  Having lots of fun. 

           Most of the crowd has gathered around a young COLLEGE 
           PROFESSOR type dressed in a blazer and turtleneck.  Steven 
           tries to get a look, but the professor’s got his back to us.

                                 THE PROFESSOR 
                        Tonight, as ever, we look to the sky 
                        and ponder its mysteries.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE PROFESSOR
                                                  (CONT'D)
                        And for a fleeting moment, we see a 
                        glimpse of its power.  The power of 
                        the unknown.  An unyielding power 
                        that demands not just respect, but 
                        fear.  We may think we’re in 
                        control, but that’s merely an 
                        illusion we have created to free us 
                        from self-doubt.  We are not the 
                        masters of our fate, nor are we 
                        innocent observers.  Nature, my 
                        friends, is a mortal predator.  All 
                        of us are her prey...

           The professor turns... And we see his FACE.  

                                 PETER BENCHLEY
                        And once she’s got our scent, we 
                        have no hope of holding her back.

           The sky LIGHTS UP with the most SPECTACULAR METEOR SHOWER 
           ever seen.  COLORFUL ROCKETS race across the blackened sky. 

           Arnold takes Steven’s hand as they stare up in amazement.    
           A beautiful moment shared by father and son.  Until...

           CRASH!  Across the field, a meteor SLAMS into the earth.

           People OBLITERATED in a crater.  CRASH!  Another meteor falls.  
           Shock turns to panic.  Screaming.  Crying.  Running like hell.  

           Through the madness, Benchley smiles at Steven.  Demented.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Run, Steven!

           CRASH!  Meteors SLAM DOWN in a celestial barrage.  Steven and 
           Arnold sprinting.  Dodging debris.  Others alongside them...

           Gottlieb... Vicki... Alves... Fleeing for their lives.

           Arnold fires up the car.  Steven peers up... A huge METEOR 
           bears down on them.  They peel out just in time as... CRASH!

           But the meteorite BURROWS underground, chasing after them.

           The highway CRACKS.  Raining chunks of pavement as the 
           UNDERGROUND FORCE burrows after them with relentless fury.

           EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Arnold’s car SKIDS to a halt in front of the house.

           DOWN THE STREET -- The meteor BURROWS toward them.
           IN THE CAR -- Steven wraps his arms around Arnold.  Both 
           crying.  A tender moment, but still frantic and urgent.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Give us a kiss.

           Steven kisses his cheek.  Right where his tears fall.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Go!  Don’t look back!

           ON THE STREET -- Arnold ushers him out.  Steven trips, falls 
           down.  Jumping up as the CRUMBLING EARTH reaches the car.

                                 YOUNG STEVEN
                        DAD!

           A huge CRATER opens up beneath the car.  Steven can only 
           watch in horror as his dad’s car is SWALLOWED from below. 

           The crumbling earth BURROWS toward Steven.  He runs into...

           INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Steven bolts inside.  Past his mother.  The foundation 
           BUCKLES.  A HUGE CRACK spreading across the floor as...

           A SHARK FIN splits the hardwood.  SURFACING through the  
           floor.  Tearing up floor boards as it chases Steven into...

           THE BEDROOM -- Steven leaps onto the bed.  Safe for now. 

           CRUNCH!  CRUNCH!  Two more FINS crash up through the floor.

           The THREE FINS circle the bed.  Ripping through hardwood.  
           SAWING away the floor until... The bed DROPS through it. 

           BLACKNESS -- FALLING.  Like Alice down the rabbit hole... 

           INT. OLD MOVIE THEATER -- NIGHT

           SPLASH!  The mattress lands in the old theater.  Tossed about 
           on the waves that fill the room, just like the opening scene. 

           THE MECHANICAL HORROR explodes out of the water right beside 
           Steven.  And it’s here we get our first real look at it... 

           A grim nightmare.  Part GREAT WHITE SHARK, part steam-punk 
           Frankenstein.  Patches of skin have been ripped away to 
           reveal BOLTS and METAL underneath.  A living machine with...  

           METAL TEETH.  Rows and rows of metal teeth.  
           The horrific MECHANICAL JAWS open wide.  CHOMPING DOWN as...
           INT. CABIN -- DAY

           Steven (grown up) jolts awake.  Gasping.  Sweating.  

           INT. CABIN / LIVING ROOM -- DAY

           Gottlieb, Gilmore, and Rick Fields gather.  Morning coffee.

           All snap to attention as Steven enters.  Still recovering 
           from the nightmare, and now everybody’s just staring at him.

                                 STEVEN
                        What?

           From his desk, Gottlieb picks up a copy of the L.A. Times.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Ahem... “A finer hand than mine is 
                        at work on the film project,” says 
                        Benchley.  “Someone who is doing a 
                        dialogue polish or some such thing, 
                        which I imagine is like referring 
                        to gang rape as heavy necking.”
                             (smiles)
                        At least he mentioned me this time. 

                                 GILMORE
                        Gang rape.  He said gang rape.
                        When Wasserman sees this, he’s 
                        gonna shit a can of creamed corn!

                                 STEVEN
                        Fuck me.  Somebody needs to stuff 
                        this guy in a box and seal it shut...

           INT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

           Zanuck.  On the phone.  Ringing on the other end.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        ...or this is just gonna get worse.

           BENCHLEY answers.  SPLIT SCREEN.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Peter!  Dick Zanuck.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Dick.  Tell me something, Mr. 
                        Producer.  Just what in the fuck 
                        are you doing to my book out there?

           A PANEL slides up from below for a THREE-WAY SPLIT SCREEN. 
           AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- Spit-polished shoes march down a 
           hallway.  TRACK UP to a hand clutching the same L.A. Times.

                                 ZANUCK
                        I don’t know what you mean.

                                 BENCHLEY 
                        Don’t play dumb with me, Dick.  It 
                        doesn’t flatter either one of us.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Peter, I didn’t call to discuss the 
                        art of adaptation.  What I need... 
                        What I’d like is if you’d call off 
                        the editorial artillery.  What’s  
                        it gonna take to make that happen?

           AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- The newspaper gets SLAMMED down on 
           the desk of Sid Sheinberg by... WASSERMAN.  Not a happy man.  

           The third panel SLIDES off screen.  Now back to...

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I want to see a script.

                                 ZANUCK
                             (winces, then stalling...)
                        You know I can’t do that, Peter.  
                        I... I don’t even have a script.

           Yes, he does.  Right on the desk in front of him.  He drops 
           it in a drawer.  SLAMS it shut.  In case Benchley can see it.

                                 ZANUCK
                        That’s how Steven likes to work.  
                        Only the actors have a script...

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Then put me in the goddamn movie.  
                        Find me a part and get me a script!

           Benchley hangs up.  His image SLIDES off the screen.  Zanuck 
           left staring into space.  Brown watching him from the doorway.  

                                 ZANUCK
                        Like I don’t have enough shit, now 
                        this asshole thinks he’s Bob Redford.

           A beat later, the phone RINGS.  Before Zanuck can answer, an 
           ASSISTANT grabs it.  She covers the mouthpiece.  Calls out:

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Mr. Zanuck?  Mr. Sheinberg for you.
                                 BROWN
                        Better let me handle this one.

           As Brown takes the call, Zanuck wanders over to the 
           PRODUCTION BOARD.  Location for today: QUINT’S SHACK.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MENEMSHA HARBOR -- DAY

           Quint’s shack towers over the harbor like a witch’s lair. 

           INT. QUINT’S SHACK -- DAY

           Cramped and minimalist.  Maritime theme.  Shark jaws on 
           crossbeams.  Few more BOILING in a pot.  STEAM fills the air.

           Steven sits behind the camera while Scheider and Dreyfuss   
           go over their lines.  Dreyfuss paces.  Working himself up.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        “I’m not talking about hooking some 
                        poor dogfish or sand shark.  I’m 
                        talking about finding a great white.”

                                 STEVEN
                        Slow it down, Ricky.  Let’s keep it 
                        fresh for when Mr. Shaw gets here.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        If he ever gets here.

           Nobody responds... Until a disembodied VOICE sings:

                                 VOICE
                        What do you do with a drunken sailor/ 
                        What do you do with a drunken sailor/ 
                        Early in the morning...

           The haze over the boiling pot of jaws parts to reveal...

           ROBERT SHAW (46).  A shark of a man.  Gentleman and 
           scoundrel.  Churchill meets Hemingway meets Teddy Roosevelt, 
           shaken not stirred.  He sips from a FLASK.  Like he means it.

                                 SHAW
                        Chief... Mr. Hooper... Stevie.

           He steps toward Dreyfuss.  Guts him with a glare.

                                 SHAW
                        You got somethin‘ to say, Hooper, 
                        or you gonna stand there like 
                        someone just fucked your mother? 
           The room goes silent.  Dreyfuss on the spot.  Intimidated.  
           He sniffs the air.  Summons a dose of courage, whispering:

                                 DREYFUSS
                        I can smell a bottle of bourbon.

                                 SHAW
                        What do you want for that, Hooper?  
                        A Mother Teresa medal?  Name me  
                        one great actor who’s not a drunk.

           Dreyfuss stares at Steven, who shrugs: just go with it.

           MOMENTS LATER -- Cameras rolling.  IN THE VIEWFINDER, Shaw 
           stomps across the room toward Dreyfuss like a thunderstorm.

                                 SHAW
                        Give me your hands.

           CLOSE ON: DREYFUSS’S HANDS as Shaw grabs them.  In his 
           monster grip, they turn bone white.  Dreyfuss wincing.

                                 SHAW
                        Dogfish?  When you got a $5,000 
                        net, you got $2,000 worth of fish 
                        in it, along comes Mr. Whitey...

           As Shaw continues, Dreyfuss strains to keep his composure. 
           Trying to wrench free, but Shaw’s got him in a death lock.

                                 SHAW
                        You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.  
                        Been countin’ money all your life.

           Finally, he lets go.  Dreyfuss backs away.  Out of character.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Goddammit!  Jesus Christ, Bob, what 
                        the fuck are you doing to me?!  We 
                        gotta shoot this ten more times!

                                 STEVEN
                        All right, okay, let’s cut please!

           Steven pulls Shaw off to the side for a one-on-one talk.

           The others watch from behind the camera.  Gilmore seems a  
           bit shaken, but Zanuck loves this.  He gives Brown a nudge.

                                 ZANUCK
                        He’s still a mean son of a bitch.

           Dreyfuss watches Steven and Shaw from a distance.  Still 
           fuming.  Rubbing his hands.  Scheider can’t help but laugh.  
                                 SCHEIDER
                        Want some ice?

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  Just 
                        because he played Henry VIII 
                        doesn’t mean he is Henry VIII.

           In a series of JUMP CUTS, we watch THREE MORE TAKES.  The 
           SLATE CLAPS each time.  The last line repeats three times:

                                 SHAW
                        You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.  
                        Been countin’ money all your life.

           And each time Dreyfuss yanks his hands away from Shaw’s, it’s 
           even worse.  His hands go from WHITE... To RED... To PURPLE.

           EXT. MENEMSHA HARBOR -- DAY

           Dreyfuss drops down on a bench.  Bags of ice on his knuckles.

           A moment later, Shaw strolls past, whistling the “Drunken 
           Sailor” sea shanty.  As he passes Dreyfuss, without a look:

                                 SHAW
                        All hands on deck!

           From the other end of the dock, SHAW’S FAMILY comes running 
           to meet him.  He’s assaulted by a gaggle of SIX KIDS of all 
           ages.  The younger ones climb him like apes on a skyscraper.

           The kids are joined by Shaw’s wife, actress MARY URE (41), 
           and a pretty young NANNY.  Shaw kisses Mary on the cheek.

                                 MARY
                        Don’t get too attached.  We’re 
                        taking the ferry to McDonald’s.

           When Shaw speaks now, it’s with a British accent:

                                 SHAW
                        Well... There goes another $200.

           Mary gives him a light-hearted smack.  Shaw pulls the kids 
           down off his back.  Ushers them toward the waiting nanny.

                                 SHAW
                        Get down off of there, you.  I’ll 
                        see you for supper.  Go with nanny.  

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Gottlieb works at his typewriter, suddenly jolted by... 
           A HELLISH SCREAM from the next room.  He runs back to find...

           STEVEN.  Sitting up in bed.  Cold sweat.  Another nightmare.

                                 STEVEN
                        I need to get out of here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE BAR -- NIGHT

           Steven and Gottlieb enter to find more people who can’t sleep.

           MOVING THROUGH THE BAR -- Steven and Gottlieb notice... Shaw 
           sitting with some TEAMSTERS.  He points to a SCAR on his chin.

                                 SHAW
                        See that?  Sean Connery.  From 
                        Russia with Love.  Kick!  Ba-boom!

           AT A NEARBY TABLE -- Bob Mattey and Six Pack, the set grip, 
           nurse a couple of brews.  As Steven and Gottlieb pass them...

                                 SIX PACK
                        Jungle Cruise?  The one inside 
                        Disneyland?  You designed it?!

                                 MATTEY
                        Alice in Wonderland, Haunted 
                        Mansion, the Submarine Voyage...

                                 SIX PACK
                        The submarine?!  That’s my 
                        daughter’s favorite!  Right on!

           MOVING ON -- They find Dreyfuss alone at the end of the bar.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Ricky?  How’s the hands?

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Why don’t you ask the great 
                        storyteller himself down there?

           He nods to Shaw, who bids a theatrical “good night” to the 
           exiting Teamsters... Then retreats to a table with his drink.

                                 STEVEN
                        Come on, Ricky.  We’re all taking 
                        our lumps here.  Scheider got 
                        slapped seventeen times yesterday.
                                 DREYFUSS
                        That supposed to make it better?

           As he talks, Steven sees a couple PRETTY GIRLS at the 
           other end of the bar.  Making eyes at Dreyfuss.  Starstruck.   

                                 STEVEN
                        I didn’t want it to get out of 
                        hand.  I told him not to hurt you.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        You told him to come after me?!  
                        What’s wrong with you?!  I’m a 
                        professional.  I have a real career.  
                        I don’t need this shark bullshit.

           He motions for the PRETTY GIRLS to join him as he exits.

           The bar seems a lot more quiet now.  From nowhere, Murray 
           Hamilton wraps his arm around Steven.  Blind stinking drunk.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Christ in a canoe.  What the hell 
                        did you guys say to Little Ricky? 

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Go get some fresh air, Murray.

           Hamilton protests but Gottlieb ushers him out the door.  
           Alone now, Steven quietly makes his way over to Shaw’s table.

                                 SHAW
                        Stevie!  Let’s go talk to the 
                        manager.  See if he’ll give us a 
                        spare key to Dreyfuss’s room.  
                        We’ll scare the shit out of him!

           Hesitating, Steven takes a seat.  

                                 STEVEN
                        I think... You were hard enough on 
                        him today.  And I really don’t 
                        think that, uh... this is helping.

           He picks up Shaw’s drink.  Shaw snatches it back.

                                 SHAW
                        We all have our own ways of blowing 
                        off steam, lad.  Scheider suntans.  
                        Me, I drink.  And Dreyfuss... well, 
                        Dreyfuss talks.  He talks to you, 
                        so you talk to me, and we go round 
                        and round with it.  I didn’t come 
                        here to talk.  I came here to work.
                                 STEVEN
                        I need you to respect me on this.

           Shaw smiles.  Might be the drink.  Might not.

                                 SHAW
                        Tell me something, Stevie.  How 
                        many pictures have you directed? 

           Voice slowly CHANGING from Brit accent to Quint’s growl as...

                                 SHAW
                        I know you spent your time arsing
                        around in TV land, making your 
                        little Bonnie and Clyde shoot ‘em 
                        up, but out here in the real world, 
                        we take our work seriously.  That’s 
                        been my life since nineteen bloody 
                        fifty-two.  I don’t need some 
                        goddamn child all green in the 
                        pants telling me how to act in 
                        front of a camera or what’s good 
                        for my character.  And if I decide 
                        that involves a wee nip of the 
                        grape from time to time, then what 
                        will be, will be, as the lady says. 
                             (full Quint voice)
                        This may be your picture, young 
                        fella, but Quint... Quint is mine.

           Shaw’s wife Mary enters the bar.  None too happy.  Looking  
           for her drunken Englishman... And there.  She’s found him.

           Shaw meets her gaze.  Drains his drink.  Growls at Steven:

                                 SHAW
                        Don’t you tell me my business 
                        again.

           Shaw storms off.  Steven stares at the empty glass.  There 
           may be other people left in the bar, but he’s totally alone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Hamilton pisses into the bushes.  So drunk he can barely 
           stand.  He spots something in the shrubs... A TINY BLACK DOG.

                                 HAMILTON
                        Hey, pup.  What’cha doing, huh?
                             (reaching to pet it)
                        C’mere, you little bastard...
           We now see the WHITE STRIPE on the animal’s back.  Not a dog. 

           Before Hamilton realizes it’s a SKUNK, he gets SPRAYED.  A 
           beat, then he sniffs the air... His clothes... Wrinkles 
           his nose in disgust.  Then he pulls off his jacket as we... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON: STEVEN.  FULL FRAME as he whispers:

                                 STEVEN
                        Murray... C’mon, wake up, Murray.

           CLOSE ON: HAMILTON.  Blinks his eyes.  Slowly coming around.

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE / LOBBY -- DAY

           And now we REVEAL... Hamilton’s been sleeping on a couch in 
           the lobby.  His tacky anchor sport coat draped like a blanket.  

           He slowly sits up.  Wraps the sport coat around him.  
           Oblivious to the GASPS and MURMURS from off camera.

                                 STEVEN
                        Rough night?

                                 HAMILTON
                        My goddamn room smells like an 
                        outhouse full of dead cats and 
                        dirty diapers. 

           As Steven leads him away, we see Hamilton is BARE ASS NAKED
           from the waist down.  Wandering through the CROWDED LOBBY.

                                 HAMILTON
                        I’m fine from here, Steve. 

           He walks by some elderly guests having continental breakfast.  
           Steven motions for Rick Fields to handle him.  As they go...

           They pass a stunned Zanuck and Gilmore coming the other way.  

                                 GILMORE
                        Oh, sweet Mother of Jesus... 

                                 STEVEN
                        He’ll still make his call time.

                                 ZANUCK
                        We’ve got bigger problems than 
                        Murray’s winky.  Sheinberg’s been 
                        chewing my ear off about you and 
                        Benchley pissing all over each other 
                        in the press.  This stops now.
                                 STEVEN
                        Talk to Benchley about that.

                                 ZANUCK
                        I’m talking to you.

           A tense beat.  We’ve never seen him this serious.

                                 STEVEN
                        Fine.  How do we fix it?

                                 ZANUCK
                        Mr. Brown asked Benchley, as a 
                        favor, to come play a bit part.

           We can almost see the steam shooting out of Steven’s ears.  
           He pulls them into an alcove.  Trying to stay cool.  Failing.

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s your solution?  Bring him on 
                        set so he can beat me up in person 
                        instead of in print?  No offense, 
                        but your diplomacy skills need work.

                                 ZANUCK
                        I’m not running some fucking 
                        artists’ commune!  This is 
                        business.  I have people to answer 
                        to, kid, and guess what: so do you!

                                 GILMORE
                        You’re lucky they’re letting you 
                        get away with this... this circus!

           He motions down the hall as naked Murray Hamilton steps into 
           the elevator.  Casually smiling like just another tourist.

                                 GILMORE
                        Sid’s coming to visit in a few  
                        days.  We can’t have any of this 
                        shit going on or we’ll all be 
                        selling used cars by next week.
                             (not a request)
                        You will get this under control.

           He storms off.  Steven in panic mode.  His only solution...

                                 STEVEN
                        We just won’t give him a script.

                                 ZANUCK
                        He’s got a speaking part, Steven!
                                 STEVEN
                        I don’t care.  I’m not giving this 
                        guy any more rope to hang us with, 
                        so this is how it’s gonna be...

           EXT. FERRY LANDING -- DAY

           Rick Fields waits at the landing.  Watching as the ferry 
           sails toward the dock.  A piece of paper rolled in his hands.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        Benchley does not get a script.

           THE FERRY -- Docks at the landing.  Waiting at the bow is 
           PETER BENCHLEY.  As he steps off, he only has one question:

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Where’s the fucking script?

           Rick hands him the single piece of paper.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        What the hell is this?

                                 RICK
                        Your lines, sir.

           Benchley glares: one fucking page?! He storms off into town.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STATE BEACH -- DAY

           Cloudy skies.  Heavy winds.  Rows of cabanas.  EXTRAS line up 
           along the shore.  Cold and impatient.  Shivering in swimsuits. 

           Despite the chilly temperature, there’s one soul braving the 
           air.  Roy Scheider lays out in Speedos.  Soaking up the sun.

           LATER -- Extras run from the water.  Screaming as they 
           stampede.  A BOOMING VOICE bellows out from LOUDSPEAKERS:

                                 LOUDSPEAKERS
                        Shark in the water!  He’s killing 
                        people!  Legs are bitten off!  
                        There’s blood!  Run, run, run!

           Steven, in a wet suit, films from the edge of the shore.

                                 STEVEN
                        And... cut!  Let’s go again!

           Again?  Nobody wants to get back in that freezing water.  
                                 GILMORE
                        You’re turning this into a death 
                        march, Steve.  People are storming 
                        off after every take.  This isn’t 
                        Hamlet.  I think it’s good enough. 

           Behind him, Steven notices Zanuck and Brown heading to the 
           beach from atop a sandy bluff... And Benchley’s with them.

                                 STEVEN
                        I need more than “good enough.”

           Gilmore thumbs through his SCRIPT.  Steven pushes it down.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Put that away.  Now.

           LATER -- Steven checks the viewfinder for another shot.

                                 STEVEN
                        Action!

           Peter Benchley stands on the other side of the camera.  His 
           big acting debut, playing a REPORTER.  He holds up his mike.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        But in recent days, a cloud has 
                        appeared on the horizon of this 
                        beautiful resort community.  A cloud 
                        in the shape of a killer shark.

                                 STEVEN
                        Cut.  Print that.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I want to try that end again.

                                 STEVEN 
                        We don’t need another take.  It was 
                        perfect.  You’re a natural, Peter.

           The crew starts moving equipment for the next set up.  
           Benchley subtly nudges Steven aside for a private talk.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I know what you’re doing.  I’ve 
                        seen how you work, Mr. Director. 

           QUICK CUTS -- Benchley watching Steven shoot beach footage 
           over and over.  All day long.  Take after take.  OVER THIS:
                                 BENCHLEY (V.O.)
                        Ten takes of this, fourteen takes 
                        of that.  And now, all of a sudden, 
                        it’s perfect?  One take, that’s it?

           BACK TO -- Steven and Benchley on set.  Steven holds firm.  

                                 STEVEN
                        We have a lot of pages to shoot.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        You think David Brown asked me out 
                        here so I could get a SAG card and 
                        a free lunch?  I don’t give a shit 
                        about that, and neither does he.  
                        What he needs, what you need, is 
                        someone to inject a dose of 
                        credibility into this disaster.  
                        That’s why I’m here.  Your ship is 
                        sinking.  And it scares the shit 
                        out of you.  Because you know that 
                        you’ve got nothing.  Why else would 
                        you be hiding a script from me?

           Usurping Steven completely, he directly addresses the crew:

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Set that up, I’m doing it again.

           Butler, the DP, looks at Steven: is he serious? Steven wants 
           to say no.  But he feels helpless.  Defeated.  He simply nods. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE / VERNA’S SUITE -- DAY

           Benchley’s face is projected on the KEM EDITING MACHINE.  

                                 BENCHLEY
                        On Amity Island, I’m Al -- 
                        Cut that, I wanna go again...
                             (new take, cut to:)
                        Alan Craig here in Amity, where the 
                        public seems to making up its -- 
                        Fuck!  Let’s do that one more time.

           The KEM freezes on Benchley’s smug look.  Verna marks the 
           sync point.  Assembling a rough cut with Steven beside her.

                                 VERNA
                        He seems like a real peach.

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s not the word I would use.
           Verna digs into the trim bin.  Crammed with COILS OF FILM.  
           She sorts through fistfuls of twisted, tangled celluloid.

                                 VERNA
                        Studio politics.  Nothing you can 
                        do.  Don’t let him get to you, kid.

           He’s biting his nails.  Agitated.  Verna touches his cheek.   
           A calming gesture.  Motherly.  And a soft smile to go with it.  

                                 VERNA
                        Steven... I’m the one putting this 
                        thing together and I see all of it. 
                        Good takes, bad takes, everything.  
                        I don’t need to tell you this is 
                        good work.  You already know that.  
                        Now get out there and make a movie. 

           That brings him back to life.  He kisses her cheek.  Grateful.

                                 VERNA
                        And tell Scheider to stop tanning!  
                        That asshole’s a different shade of 
                        orange in every scene!

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DAY

           Steven exits the Kelley House.  On his walk to the production 
           office, he notices Benchley giving an INTERVIEW.  All smiles. 

                                 BENCHLEY
                        It’s really something to see it all 
                        coming to life...

           EXT. STATE BEACH -- DAY

           Fierce winds blow.  Steven sets up a shot with the crew.  
           Miserable EXTRAS on the beach all clad in big winter coats.   

                                 BENCHLEY (V.O.)
                        True, sometimes it feels like we 
                        spend a lot of time doing nothing.  
                        But it gives me a chance to relax.

           Benchley watches as extras shed their coats with reluctant 
           groans.  Swim trunks and bikinis.  Holy shit, it’s cold.

           Benchley pokes around the set.  Looking for a script.  He 
           grabs a pile of papers... But it’s a BUDGET SHEET.  No luck.

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE / BENCHLEY’S ROOM -- DAY

           Benchley pounds away at his typewriter.
                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        What’s your opinion of the script?

                                 BENCHLEY (V.O.)
                        I haven’t read the latest draft.  
                        Steven and I had different visions 
                        for the movie, so we parted ways.  
                        In any case, it’s out of my hands.

           He stops typing.  Distracted.  Digs into his briefcase. 
           Finds one of his old drafts marked up with Steven’s RED INK.

           And all it means now, all it’s ever meant to him, is pain.  
           Resentment.  Bad memories.  He hurls it across the room.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DAY

           Back to the LIVE INTERVIEW.  Benchley still smiling.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        And I’m completely fine with that.

           Benchley notices Steven watching from afar.  Nods to him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FERRY LANDING -- DAY

           Amid the buzz of tourists getting off the ferry, one man 
           stands out in his sharp suit... SID SHEINBERG has arrived.

           EXT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

           Steven greets Sheinberg with a handshake as they begin a 
           tour... From EDGARTOWN... To the STATE BEACH, where filming 
           wraps up... To SHARK CITY, where the boss man meets Bruce.

           Sheinberg seems impressed.  He pats Steven on the back.

           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Sheinberg, Steven, and Gilmore have dinner.  Verna serves up 
           fresh pasta.  Steven sips a Coke while the others drink wine.

                                 SHEINBERG 
                        The shark looks great, Steven.  
                        I can’t wait to see it in action.

           From his look, his tone of voice, he wants to know when.

                                 STEVEN
                        Neither can we.  We’re heading out 
                        on the ocean for a big test 
                        tomorrow.  You should come with us.
                                 SHEINBERG
                        If I didn’t have an early flight...
                             (looks at Gilmore)
                        I’m sure it will be spectacular.  
                        I’ll expect a full report as usual.

           Steven and Gilmore trade a look: let’s not fuck this up.

           Moments later, Gottlieb approaches Steven with script pages 
           in hand.  Whispers to him.  He nods.  Gets up from the table.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Duty calls.  Excuse me.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Last minute polish?

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        New scenes for tomorrow.

           Sheinberg doesn’t understand...

                                 SHEINBERG
                        What happened to the old scenes?

                                 STEVEN
                        Worked fine on paper, but not on 
                        set.  We just scribble out new 
                        scenes the night before and hash it 
                        out in front of the camera.  Let 
                        the actors improv it, you know...

           Sheinberg chokes down some Chianti.  Glares at Gilmore as...

           EXT. BACK PORCH -- NIGHT

           Two Alka Seltzer PLOP into a glass of water and FIZZ. 
           Sheinberg chugs it back.  Nobody but Gilmore with him now.  

                                 GILMORE
                        Casablanca worked the same way, you 
                        know.  That turned out pretty well.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        I don’t give a shit about Casablanca.  
                        I don’t even like Casablanca.  What I 
                        do like is when things go by the book.

           He’s flustered, caught off guard.  And afraid, too, because...

                                 SHEINBERG
                        If Wasserman finds out...

           The implication is clear: he’ll pull the plug.
           INT. KELLEY HOUSE BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Gilmore broods alone.  Smoking.  A little drunk.  
           Staring at the bane of his existence... The JAWS SCRIPT.

           He STUBS out his cigarette on the cover.  Storms away.

           Moments later... BENCHLEY emerges from an alcove.  Martini 
           in hand.  He’s been watching.  Not Gilmore... but the script.

           INT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

           Half-asleep, still sipping coffee, Zanuck is startled as 
           the JAWS SCRIPT is dropped on his desk by a fuming Benchley.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        You call this a movie, Dick?  
                        This... This is ritual slaughter.

                                 ZANUCK
                        You waived creative rights when we 
                        paid out your contract.  Handsomely. 

                                 BENCHLEY
                        That’s no excuse for this hatchet 
                        job!  You turned Hooper from a 
                        literate scientist into a pedantic 
                        schmuck, and that’s just the start 
                        of this litany of formulaic drivel!

                                 ZANUCK
                        Do you honestly think we’re setting 
                        out to make a shitty picture?!  
                        Steven knows what he’s doing here!

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I’ll believe that when I see it.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Then let’s go make you a believer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DAY

           A BARGE sits anchored a mile off shore.  Loaded with F/X gear, 
           work benches, and a big shed.  A sign dubs it: SS GARAGE SALE.

           While at the control bay with Alves and Mattey, Steven hears... 

                                 SIX PACK (O.S.)
                        Son of a bitch!  Goddammit!
           Six Pack hovers over the exposed engine of a motor boat 
           moored to the barge.  Steven shrugs at him: having problems? 

                                 SIX PACK
                        Loose spark plug shocked the hell 
                        out of me.  I got it handled, boss.
                             (twists a torque wrench)
                        Just like the motor pool in Da Nang.

           Vietnam?  This hippie?  Not what Steven expected.

                                 SIX PACK
                        What about you?  You in the shit?

                                 STEVEN
                        I had a number.  Didn’t get called.

                                 SIX PACK
                        Charmed life.  Me, I volunteered.  
                        Needed a good kick in the ass.

           A subtle nod from Steven.  A new sense of respect.  Moments 
           later, Zanuck’s VOICE comes booming over Steven’s RADIO... 

                                 ZANUCK (V.O.)
                        We still on schedule?

                                 STEVEN
                             (into radio)
                        Got a front row seat for you, Z.

           A new VOICE answers back:

                                 BENCHLEY (V.O.)
                        I’m glad to hear that, Steven.  
                        We’re all ready for the big show.

           Benchley.  The last thing Steven needs right now.

           Knowing this, David Brown jumps up from a chair on the 
           barge.  Speaking into his own radio as he’s on the move:

                                 BROWN
                        Peter, it’s David.  I’m on my way.
                             (off radio, to Steven)
                        I’ll keep him out on the water.  
                        Just stay focused on your shark.

           Steven walks him over to Six Pack at the motor boat.

                                 STEVEN
                        You mind flying Mr. Brown out to 
                        pick up Z and his special guest?
                                 SIX PACK
                        I’ll do it for a six pack.

                                 STEVEN
                        You deep six that asshole on the 
                        way back, I’ll buy you a brewery.

           Six Pack speeds away with Brown.  Steven confers with Mattey.

                                 STEVEN
                        Pump up the juice on this one.

                                 MATTEY
                        We need to make adjustments.  I got 
                        a shift in the Gulf Stream that’s --

                                 STEVEN
                        Just make it work.  I want to scare 
                        this guy so bad, he forgets his name.

           UNDERWATER -- We DIVE down to the sandy bottom to find... 
           BRUCE.  The big star of today’s action.  Menacing JAWS agape.

           The great shark is connected to a metal JIB ARM below its 
           belly.  A crane attaches the arm to a massive SEA SLED fixed 
           to a DOLLY TRACK.  DIVERS connect HOSES to the sea sled.

           ON THE F/X BARGE -- Steven watches as Six Pack picks up 
           Benchley and Zanuck from the dock.  The boat starts back.

                                 STEVEN
                        Wait until they’re right on top 
                        of Bruce, then bring him up. 

                                 MATTEY 
                             (uneasy)
                        Aye aye, Cap’n.

           Steven peers off the bow.  Sees the boat.  Closer now.  
           Benchley on board.  Steven waiting for the perfect moment.

                                 STEVEN
                        Here they come... Steady... Now!

           Mattey hits a BUTTON on the control bay.

           UNDERWATER -- A GREEN LIGHT on the sea sled sets the divers 
           in motion.  SLIDING the massive cradle along the dolly track.

           BRUCE glides along.  The sled TRIGGERS a checkpoint as...

           ON THE F/X BARGE -- A light BLINKS on the control bay.   
           Mattey SLOWLY DIALS the air pressure, easing a CONTROL LEVER.
           ON THE OCEAN -- A pool of WHITE WASH BUBBLES in the water.

           Six Pack brings the boat closer.  Everyone moves to the edge 
           for a better look... And even our Mr. Benchley seems curious.

           ON THE F/X BARGE -- Steven watches the bubbles.  Anxious now.

                                 STEVEN
                        Bring him up!

           Steven TWISTS the dial full tilt.  Pushes the lever forward. 

           ON THE OCEAN -- BOOM!  An EXPLOSION of white water BLASTS 
           everyone on the motor boat.  From out of the water emerges...

           A SHARK TAIL.  Bruce is surfacing backwards.

           ON THE F/X BARGE -- RED LIGHTS.  Pressure gauges SPIKE.

           ON THE OCEAN -- The soaked passengers watch the shark tail 
           submerge into the sea as... BOOM!  All of them soaked again.

           A beat, then... Bruce BURSTS through the surface once more... 

           Only now the shark is completely inverted.  Tail in the air.  
           He holds steady for a beat... Then sinks like a lead weight.

           UNDERWATER -- Divers swim clear as the sea sled TOPPLES OVER.  
           Bruce careens off the track.  CRASHES to the ocean floor.

           ON THE OCEAN -- Drenched, Benchley rips off his glasses.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Take me back to shore.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

           Steven, Alves, and Mattey stand in front of Gilmore’s desk 
           like a group of teenagers called into the principal’s office.

                                 GILMORE
                        Somebody make me understand exactly 
                        what the fuck happened out there!

           Steven knows he has to fess up.  But just as he’s about to... 

                                 MATTEY
                        Well, you see Bill, ocean currents 
                        being what they are... 
           EXT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven, Mattey, and Alves exit post-haste. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Thanks, Bob.

           EXT. SHARK CITY -- NIGHT TO DAWN 

           In a SERIES OF DISSOLVES, Alves and his F/X crew rebuild 
           Bruce.  Strip him down.  Gut him.  Patch him up.  Then 
           repaint him.  He hangs over a FIRE in a barrel, drying off.  

           The BURLY CARPENTER with the TATTOOS confers with Alves, all 
           while three suns RISE and FALL off the coast in TIME LAPSE.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DAWN

           Quint’s fishing boat ORCA, a salty looking vessel, heads to 
           sea with a fleet of smaller boats trailing.  A TITLE rises:                 

                                  1 DAY OVER SCHEDULE

           The boats reach the site of the anchored F/X BARGE.
           On board the Orca, Steven checks his watch.      

           CLOSE ON: THE WATCH FACE.  In DOUBLE EXPOSURE beneath it...

           TIME LAPSE as the crew anchors down all the boats.  Prepping 
           for the first shot.  We see 4 1/2 HOURS go by in 15 SECONDS.
           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- LATER

           Steven on the Orca’s deck.  BOBBING up and down.  Behind him, 
           the cast preps.  Dreyfuss looks as GREEN as Kermit the Frog.   

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Whose bright fucking idea was it to 
                        shoot on the ocean? 

                                 SHAW
                        Belay that whining, Mr. Hooper. 

           Shaw bounces with the boat, which makes Dreyfuss woozier. 

                                 SHAW
                        Here, let me help you out, lad.

           He hands a bucket to Dreyfuss... It’s full of bloody CHUM.  
           Dreyfuss PUKES into the bucket.  Shaw cackles.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- LATER

           The first day on the ocean plays out in a SERIES OF DISSOLVES 
           and JUMP CUTS.  One by one, the sea gets the better of them.

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- Rolling camera.  The whole frame 
           bouncing as Dreyfuss hefts a scuba tank toward Scheider.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Dammit, Martin!  This is compressed 
                        air!  Screw around with these and --

           Dreyfuss PUKES again.  And we roll into JUMP CUTS...

           JUMP CUT -- New take.  Same shot.  Bobbing as Dreyfuss 
           struggles.  Just off camera, Shaw puffs out his cheeks...  

           And Dreyfuss PUKES.  Again.

           JUMP CUT -- New take.  Dreyfuss nails it, but Scheider PUKES.

           JUMP CUT -- Orca BOUNCING.  Shaw struggles to hold a fishing 
           pole upright, reeling in the monster shark as...  

                                 SHAW
                        He’s gone under the boat.  Yeah, 
                        too easy.  He’s a smart big fish.

           Bill Butler, the DP, can’t take it anymore.  He PUKES.

           JUMP CUT -- New take.  Still BOUNCING.  Shaw still fishing. 
                                 SHAW
                        Hooper, you may be a big yahoo in 
                        the lab, but out here you’re just 
                        super cargo!  

           The BOOM OPERATOR pukes.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DUSK

           The Orca and the camera boats come back to shore.  Cast and 
           crew hanging over the sides.  Sick.  Asses kicked by the sea.

           Steven exits the head.  He’s 100% fresh.  Dreyfuss glares.

                                 STEVEN
                        I have a waterbed.  I’m used to it. 
                             (off his look)
                        What?  It’s only a few more weeks.

           Dreyfuss turns green again.  In the distance, the lights of 
           Martha’s Vineyard twinkle in the dark.  A safe harbor.  Home. 

                                 DREYFUSS
                             (smiles, singing)
                        Show me the way to go home...

                                 STEVEN
                             (singing along)
                        I’m tired and I wanna go to bed...

           The crew joins them as they head in.  SONG CARRIES OVER to...  

           EXT. SHAW’S COTTAGE -- NIGHT

           A quaint cottage high on a bluff.  We peer in THROUGH A 
           WINDOW as Mary and the nanny serve dinner to the kids.

           Moments later, Shaw enters through the back door.  The young 
           ones attack him once again.  He obliges with airplane rides.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Clips of PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON play on TV.

                                 REPORTER
                        President Nixon continues to be 
                        dogged by the Watergate scandal, 
                        with Congress now considering 
                        articles of impeachment.  And while 
                        American troops may be gone from 
                        Vietnam, the spectre of war still 
                        looms over his tarnished legacy...
           RETROSPECTIVE FOOTAGE of the Vietnam War on the tube now.    
           American troops under fire at Ia Drang Valley, Khe Sanh...

           Steven watches.  Caught up.  Gottlieb typing away behind 
           him.  The dogs lie on the floor.  Glum from lack of attention. 

                                 STEVEN
                        How’s that comparing scars scene?

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        It’s okay, but it’s still not...
                             (thinking, then...)
                        Quint.  Something about him... He’s 
                        gonna kill this shark no matter 
                        what.  But why?  What’s driving him?

           Steven gets sidetracked again by the TV.  Footage of 
           DESTROYERS in the Gulf of Tonkin.  Triggers a memory.

           He ducks into his room.  Back in a flash with the 
           “Sharks of the Pacific Ocean” book he read on the plane.

                                 STEVEN
                        Think about it... Quint, he’s Ahab.

           QUICK CUTS -- Shaw causing trouble... He shoulder bumps 
           Dreyfuss at lunch, spilling his food... Pounds back shots 
           at the bar... Karate chops a picket fence... OVER THIS...

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        He’s a tyrant.  A maniac.  
                        Obsessed.  Only he’s lost a hell  
                        of a lot more than just his leg...

           BACK TO -- Steven shows Gottlieb a photo from the book.

                                 STEVEN
                        USS Indianapolis.  Japanese 
                        submarine took her out.  Nine 
                        hundred men died from drowning, 
                        exposure... and shark attacks.

           An electric moment of discovery.  Steven full of new energy.

                                 STEVEN
                        This guy saw his best friends and 
                        shipmates eaten by these things!  
                        That gives him one sole purpose...

           QUICK CUT -- Shaw broods on set.  A fire behind his eyes.

                                 STEVEN (V.O.)
                        “From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.”
           BACK TO -- Gottlieb studying the Indianapolis.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Great idea.  But I don’t know 
                        enough about this kind of stuff.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EMPTY LOT -- NIGHT

           A MANNEQUIN wearing a VIET CONG OUTFIT stands in a dirt 
           covered empty lot... And gets BLASTED TO PIECES in seconds.

           JOHN MILIUS (30) stands across the lot.  Smoking 12-GAUGE on 
           his hip.  Cigar in his mouth.  Empty beer cans next to him.  
           A self-proclaimed Zen anarchist with an itchy trigger finger.

           INT. MILIUS’S HOUSE / STUDY -- NIGHT

           A phone RINGS as we slowly explore a wood-paneled study...

           MOVIE POSTERS on the wall: Magnum Force, Jeremiah Johnson.  
           A desk holds a dog-eared copy of Conrad’s Heart of Darkness.

           PAN DOWN a display case filled with WWII memorabilia to the 
           ringing phone.  Milius’s MEATY HAND picks up the receiver.

                                 MILIUS
                        Milius.

           SPLIT SCREEN.  Steven’s face slides into half the frame.

                                 STEVEN
                        Johnny!  It’s Steve.

                                 MILIUS
                        Stevie boy!  The young soldier gone 
                        off to war!  What’s the good word 
                        from the battlefield, General, sir?

                                 STEVEN
                        How’d you like to write a monologue 
                        about the USS Indianapolis?

           Milius grins like a five year old on Christmas morning.

                                 MILIUS
                        Does the Pope shit in the woods?  

           In a SERIES OF DISSOLVES, Steven and Milius talk through the 
           night.  Milius waves his hands, the grand storyteller.  
           Steven takes notes, passing them to Gottlieb, who types them.
           INT. KELLEY HOUSE / DREYFUSS’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           THUNDERSTORM rages as Dreyfuss sleeps, arm around a PRETTY 
           GIRL.  Then... POUNDING above.  Then... THWACK!... THWACK!

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE ROOF -- NIGHT

           Dreyfuss opens a door to the roof.  Aghast as he sees...

           SHAW.  Standing in the RAIN with a spilled bucket of GOLF 
           BALLS and a FIVE IRON.  He tees up another shot... THWACK!

           The ball sails... SMASHES through a downtown window.  
           With a devilish grin, Shaw takes a long pull from his flask.

           INT. DREYFUSS’S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dreyfuss grabs the phone.  Punches in a number.  A beat.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Put Steven on the goddamn phone.

           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Steven listens to the SCREAMING VOICE on the phone.  Hangs up.  

                                 RICK
                        Problems, boss?

                                 STEVEN
                        Shaw.

                                 GILMORE
                        That lug needs a kick in the ass.

                                 STEVEN
                        No.  What he needs is a babysitter.

           Steven’s eyes go right to Rick Fields.  The kid cringes as...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHILMARK TAVERN -- DAY

           Rick Fields joins Shaw at the bar.  Shaw smiles.  

                                 SHAW
                        Young Fields!  Have a drink!

                                 RICK
                        I really shouldn’t, Mr. Shaw...

           Shaw pours him a round from his flask.  Glasses clink.
           INT. CHILMARK TAVERN -- LATER

           Empty shot glasses.  Shaw’s drunk but in control.  Rick is 
           trashed.  Can’t sit up.  He stares at another shot.  Nauseous.

           EXT. CHILMARK TAVERN -- LATER

           Rick staggers out.  Almost falls.  Catches sight of Six Pack 
           walking by.  Rick grabs him.  SHOVES him toward the tavern. 

                                 RICK
                        Your turn.

           INT. CHILMARK TAVERN -- LATER

           Six Pack is full-tilt blotto.  Beer cans in both hands.  A 
           PROSTHETIC ARM, an obvious movie prop, extends from his fly.  
           Another beer clutched in its plastic hand.  Shaw cackles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DAY

           Sunrise over blue vista.  A windy day in paradise.

           UNDERWATER -- Divers pull BRUCE’S SEA SLED along its track.   
           CRUNCH!  GRINDS to a halt.  BARNACLES on the track.  TITLE: 

                              3 DAYS OVER SCHEDULE

           TOPSIDE -- The Orca floats alongside the SS Garage Sale.

           ON THE F/X BARGE -- Steven bobs with the boat.  Watching 
           the rolling rough sea.  Lost in deep thought, just staring.    

                                 ALVES
                        Weather’s kicking our ass today.

           Steven is silent.  Just bobbing up and down.  Then... 
           He pushes past, down deeper into the barge.  Moving into...

           THE HEAD -- The door closes.  We stay outside for a beat.

           Moments later, Steven emerges a new man.  Whatever was on 
           his mind now just a memory.  He’s refreshed.  Back on deck...

                                 STEVEN
                        Don’t worry about the weather, Joe.  
                        We’ll ride it out.  Let’s knock out 
                        some close ups while we wait on F/X.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TIME LAPSE as boats come in from sea.  The crew unpacks.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT

           Steven and Gottlieb stroll among downtown storefronts. 

                                 GOTTLIEB 
                        Dreyfuss only puked four times.  
                        And you knocked out a couple pages.

                                 STEVEN
                        A couple pages of no shark.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Pages are pages at this point.  Take 
                        what you get.  Anything else is gravy.

           Steven stops.  Notices something in the liquor store window.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE -- NIGHT

           Steven finds a pair of DARK SUNGLASSES.  His trademark metal 
           rims worn in all the real-life Jaws production stills.
           Tries them on.  Checks his look in the mirror.  Perfect.

           (NOTE: He will always be wearing these out on the ocean.)

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DAWN

           Buzz around town.  SIGNS flip.  PRICE BOARDS going higher.

           AT THE HARBOR -- TOURISTS spill out of the ferry like troops 
           at Omaha Beach.  Flooding the streets.  SUMMER has arrived.   

           AT A SMALL CAFE -- Gilmore runs numbers in a ledger.  
           The waitress brings his check.  And he knows it’s summer...

           IN HIS NOTEBOOK: “BREAKFAST” has always cost $3.75 
           ON HIS CHECK: The same meal now costs him... $8.00

           Gilmore does some quick math.  NUMBERS appear all around 
           his head, Beautiful Mind style, as he COMPARES daily costs... 

           YESTERDAY: $55,000.  TODAY: $73,000.  

           He orders a SCOTCH.  Holds out TWO BUCKS.  The waitress 
           shakes her head.  Holds up all FIVE fingers.  Gilmore sighs.
           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DAY

           The mini-fleet drops anchor for another long day.  TITLE: 

                                5 DAYS OVER SCHEDULE

           ON THE ORCA -- Scheider plays solitaire while Steven
           blocks out a scene with Dreyfuss, Shaw, and DP Bill Butler.  

                                 STEVEN
                        And you’re both watching, following 
                        Bruce around the boat...

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- We see the shot from the film as...

                                 DREYFUSS
                        You ever have one do this before?

           PAN over to Shaw, who shakes his head, grim.

                                 SHAW
                        No --

                                 BUTLER
                        Cut!  We need to cut!

           Far in the background, he points out a TINY SAILBOAT that has 
           entered frame right.  Already moving well inside their shot.

                                 STEVEN
                        Let’s swing the boat around the 
                        other way.  We’ll shoot around it.

                                 BUTLER
                        That means we have to re-anchor.

                                 STEVEN
                        You wanna wait for them to pass?  
                        What if they drop anchor?  Then what?  
                        We’re supposed to be hunting a shark 
                        out in the middle of nowhere, not 
                        part of the goddamn America’s Cup!
                             (to the crew)
                        We’re losing daylight!  Let’s move!

           A collective groan from the crew.  This is a pain in the ass.

           IN TIME LAPSE, all the boats lift anchor and reset positions. 
           Another FOUR HOURS grind away in TWENTY SECONDS screen time.  

           SLOW DISSOLVES of Steven and the actors sitting in chairs.    
           Waiting... And waiting... This is taking forever... Until...

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- The same shot is ready to go.
                                 DREYFUSS
                        You ever have one do this before?

           Shaw steps into frame, about to answer when... 
           TWO MORE SAILBOATS appear in frame, this time from the left.

                                 STEVEN
                        Son of a bitch!  Cut!  Reposition!

           The crew looks ready to mutiny, but they have no choice.  
           Steven drops into his chair.  Pissed.  Time crawls ahead...

           Another SERIES OF DISSOLVES... BOATS slowly raise anchor... 
           STEVEN broods behind his dark glasses... CLOUDS roll in...

           Steven starts to nod off.  Then something SNAPS him to life.    
           RAINDROPS.  On his hand.  Looks like that’s a wrap for today.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DUSK

           Rain falls as the boats head in.  Steven wanders back into 
           town.  Sullen.  Moping on Main Street.  Until he notices...

           EXT. ISLAND MOVIE THEATER -- DUSK

           Dr. Strangelove on the marquee.  Steven smiles.  But 
           something’s not right... As he greets the OLD CASHIER, he 
           sees that she’s crying.  And holding a NEWSPAPER.  HEADLINE:

                         U.S. HELICOPTER SHOT DOWN BY VIET CONG

           And now he recognizes her ashy, wrinkled face... LEE FIERRO.  
           She’s aged decades since we saw her slap Roy Scheider’s face.

                                 LEE
                        My boy is dead.  I wanted you to 
                        know that.

           She turns over the “CLOSED” sign.  SLAMS down the shade.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Steven!

           Behind him.  ARNOLD stands in the street.  Still in his 30s.

                                 STEVEN
                        Dad? 

           Arnold holds a crumpled LETTER.  Steven takes it.  Afraid 
           to open it.  The date at the top stuns him: MARCH 14, 1965. 
           A SELECTIVE SERVICE LETTER fills the frame.  A DEFENSE 
           DEPARTMENT SEAL stamps down with a GUNSHOT.  More STAMPS:   

           STAMP: REGISTERED 1-A 
           STAMP: ELIGIBLE FOR INDUCTION

           SIRENS.  MILITARY POLICE CARS skid to a stop at the curb.  
           MPs climb out.  Hands on sidearms.  VICKI is with them.

                                 VICKI
                        That’s him!  Stop him!

           Back to ARNOLD.  He shoves a GUITAR CASE into Steven’s hands.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Take this and go, Steven!  Run!

           Tears in his eyes, Steven RUNS as the MPs give chase...  
           Through the ALLEY and the STREETS leading out of Edgartown.

           EXT. MOTOR POOL -- NIGHT

           Town outskirts.  Steven arrives at a makeshift garage.  He 
           recognizes a familiar HIPPIE in a U.S. ARMY UNIFORM working 
           on a beat-up GREEN JEEP.  Rows of more JEEPS parked outside.

                                 STEVEN
                        Help me!  Please!

           Confused, SIX PACK peeks out from the engine as...

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  He’s cut to SHREDS by GUNFIRE from the 
           pursuing MPs.  Stunned in horror, Steven stares down at him.

           This would be gory, but instead of blood and guts, Six Pack’s 
           wounds have coiled celluloid FILM STRIPS spilling out of them. 

           FOOTSTEPS approach.  Steven bolts out the back door, into...

           EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT 

           Steven runs.  Still holding his guitar case.  MPs right 
           behind him.  Flashlights.  Barking dogs.  Closing in fast.

           As he runs, the woods CHANGE around him.  Growing thicker.  
           More lush.  Tropical.  Like the jungles of Southeast Asia.

           He TRIPS.  The case spills open.  A SUPER 8 CAMERA and REELS 
           OF FILM fall out, all of it wrapped up in a DIRTY BROWN SUIT.

           Steven gathers it all up.  MPs closing in.  And suddenly...

           He’s GRABBED from behind by ROY SCHEIDER.  Dressed like a 
           VIETNAM COMMANDO.  KNIFE at Steven’s throat.  Whispering:
                                 SCHEIDER
                        Don’t fucking move, cherry.  

           Scheider’s been hardened by war.  EYE PATCH under his 
           glasses.  In lieu of a unit insignia, his uniform bears his 
           “Amity Police” patch.  He drags Steven into the bush... 

           Just as a VIET CONG PATROL walks by.  FOUR GUERILLAS on the 
           hunt.  Faces obscured by rice hats.  Finally, they pass as...

           A HULKING SOLDIER jumps out from the bush.  Slashes two VC 
           throats at once.  The other two VC rush him.  AK-47s raised.

           Steven panics.  Scheider restrains him.  Cool as a cucumber.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        The Dentist has got this one.

           PFFT! PFFT!  The VC are DROPPED by two muffled shots to the 
           back of the head that blow their faces out the front side.

           The dead-eye marksman know as THE DENTIST emerges from the 
           brush about fifty yards away.  We know him by another name...  

           RICHARD DREYFUSS.  Not the wiry, nervous Dreyfuss we know.  
           He’s more stone cold killer than any Hollywood assassin.  

           He joins up with the hulking soldier, who we now see is 
           ROBERT SHAW.  Scheider shoves Steven in Shaw’s direction.

                                 SHAW
                        Package secure.

           Shaw kicks over the dead VC bodies.  Steven chokes back a gasp 
           as he sees their faces... All of them look like PETER BENCHLEY.

           Steven follows Shaw and company deeper into the jungle.  
           The sounds of civilization growing louder as they arrive at...

           EXT. ARMY BASE -- PRE-DAWN 

           Barracks.  Guard towers.  Palm trees... And huge SOUNDSTAGES.  
           Part Fort Bragg, part backlot.  A dead accurate war movie set.

           “Gimme Shelter” by the Rolling Stones rises as...

           Twin AH-1 COBRA GUNSHIPS buzz over.  Steven shields himself 
           from the prop wash as a SERGEANT grabs him... Sid Sheinberg. 

           He takes Steven’s guitar case.  Opens it.  FILM REELS inside.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        General’s been waiting for these.
           He hands the case to GENERAL LEW WASSERMAN, Universal CEO.  
           The General puffs on a cigar.  Glares at Steven.  Pure ice.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        This goddamn war’s swirling into the 
                        shitter, kid.  Time for you to strap 
                        on a saber and lead the charge.  You 
                        need to earn your own trophies, sir.

           He shoves Steven toward a line of troops at a MAKE UP TRAILER.

           INT. MAKE UP TRAILER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven drops into a barber’s chair.  Head BUZZED clean.  

           EXT. ARMY BASE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven stumbles out to join his PLATOON, which is made up of 
           grips, crew, and cast members from Jaws.  Shaw, Dreyfuss, and 
           Scheider fall in as PLATOON SERGEANT Joe Alves leads the way.

                                 ALVES
                        All right, ladies, let’s saddle up!

           The unit marches out.  Double-timing across the “lot” to... 

           STAGE 12.  The big stage at Universal.  Pitch black inside.  
           The platoon marches into the dark.  Steven following into...  

           EXT. JUNGLE -- THAT MOMENT

           Rain comes down in sheets.  The platoon slogs through the 
           weather.  Steven peers up through heavy rain to the “sky”...

           Dark rafters.  Lighting rigs.  Catwalks.  Barely visible 
           above the dense canopy.  A living, breathing indoor jungle.

           (NOTE: Through this sequence, we notice lights, dolly track 
           and other film equipment randomly laying around the “set.”)

           The platoon halts at the banks of a narrow, murky river.  
           Preparing to cross it.  Steven sees something in the water...

           A SHARK FIN breaks the surface.  Quickly drops below. 

                                 STEVEN
                        S-S-Shark!  Shark in the water!

           Every last grunt bursts out laughing.  Alves loudest of all.

                                 ALVES
                        Hear that, boys?  Ol’ Mackie’s back 
                        in town!  Do the honors for us, kid.
           Alves BUMPS Steven toward the water with his M-16.  
           Steven inches along.  Trembling.  Other soldiers following.

           EXTREME SLOW PUSH on Steven’s terrified face.  As we do...

           In the BACKGROUND, one by one, each platoon soldier is 
           suddenly and violently PULLED UNDER by SOMETHING UNSEEN. 

           Steven slowly turns back, catching sight of... 
           DREYFUSS.  He smiles wider than any human could, revealing... 

           A MOUTH FULL OF JAGGED SHARK TEETH.

                                 SCHEIDER
                             (laughing it off)
                        Definitely not a dentist.

           Then... Dreyfuss and Scheider are violently PULLED UNDER.  
           Only Steven remains.  He wades to the far bank.  Lost.  Alone.  

           Nothing but jungle ahead.  As Steven takes a step forward,  
           he almost falls over.  Noticing something beneath his feet... 

           A HOLE in the dirt.  Like a small cave.  Covered by a 
           makeshift lid of leaves and brush.  An enemy bunker?

           With nowhere else to go, Steven drops down into the hole...

           INT. TUNNEL -- THAT MOMENT

           Black as night.  Steven explores the tunnel with only a 
           flashlight and .45.  He pushes ahead.  Slogging along until...

           SPLASH!  A huge puddle.  He waves the light to find...  
           Another SOLDIER.  Steven knows him by his BRIGHT RED PANTS.

           GOTTLIEB.  Steven grabs his leg.  Pulls the body closer... 
           And Steven’s hand comes away SMEARED WITH RED.  Gottlieb’s 
           pants are only red now because they’re soaked with BLOOD.

           Gottlieb JERKS FORWARD.  Grabs Steven.  His FILM COIL “guts” 
           peek out from his waistband.  Inches from death.  Wheezing.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        ...show me the way to go home...

                                 STEVEN
                        Carl!  Where are you shot?!

           Steven searches for a wound.  Finds it.  Realizing that... 
           Carl hasn’t been shot.  He’s been BITTEN.  By something huge. 

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        ...it’s here, Steven...
           Steven slowly spins around with the flashlight as... 
           CHOMP!  The MECHANICAL JAWS rush toward him in the dark.  

           Terrified, Steven drops the light.  BLACKNESS. 
           Sounds of breathing.  Crawling.  The light CLICKS ON as...

           A WALL OF RUSHING WATER barrels right at him.  The wave 
           SLAMS him.  Carries him through the tunnel.  Spilling into...

           THE OLD MOVIE THEATER.

           A churning ocean fills the room.  Steven climbs onto the 
           MATTRESS from his last dream.  Clinging to it, he notices...

           THE BIG SCREEN -- Where the Orca slowly drifts along. 
           And Steven sits sound asleep in his director’s chair.    

           BACK IN THE THEATER -- Steven just watches himself.  Unaware 
           of the MECHANICAL SHARK.  Until it BURSTS up from below him.

                                 SCHEIDER (V.O.)
                        STEVEN!

                                                               SLAM TO:

           EXT. ORCA -- THAT MOMENT

           Scheider brings him back to reality.  Steven almost falls out 
           of his chair.  Shakes off the dream.  Staring up at Scheider.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        “Definitely not a dentist.”  
                        You were talking in your sleep.  

           Steven’s vision comes into focus.  The crew has re-anchored.  
           They’re ready to shoot but... More SAILBOATS on the horizon.

                                 STEVEN
                        Roll!  Roll the fucking camera!

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER -- A WHITE OUTLINE shows the actual 
           film frame as a smaller area than our full view.  The boats 
           are outside the “white zone”, quickly moving into the frame.

           The CAMERA sweeps across Dreyfuss as...

                                 DREYFUSS
                        You ever have one do this before?

           The boats keep coming.  Another second, they’ll be in frame.  
           Shot PANS over to Shaw, who shakes his head, grim.

                                 SHAW
                        ...no.
                                 STEVEN 
                        And cut!  Gotcha!

           The boats enter the frame.  Steven and his actors all 
           raise celebratory middle fingers toward their sails.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Steven tosses and turns.  Another nightmare.  He thrashes 
           under the covers.  Almost strangling himself in them.

           MEMORY FLASH -- Monstrous JAWS open wide.  MATCH CUT to...

           EXT. F/X BARGE -- DAY

           The menacing JAWS OF BRUCE stare us down.  The mechanical 
           shark floats beside the F/X barge out on the open ocean.

                                 STEVEN
                        Please tell me it’s gonna work.

                                 ALVES
                        We’re good to go.  Mamma ocean’s 
                        just a mean old bitch.  This salt 
                        water’d eat through a goddamn tank.

                                 STEVEN
                        No pressure, Joe.  If it doesn’t 
                        work, it’s only my whole career. 

           ON THE ORCA -- Supervised by Butler, Rick Fields loads a 
           fresh FILM MAGAZINE onto the camera.  Secures it in place.

                                 BUTLER
                        Now roll off a few feet to make 
                        sure it’s locked in the gate.

           Rick clicks off a few frames.  Butler laughs at him.  
           The DP holds down Rick’s finger, advancing the film faster. 

                                 BUTLER
                        That’s a 1,200 foot mag, kid.  
                        Twelve minutes.  We got plenty 
                        to spare.  Mark it and let’s go.

           Rick labels a piece of tape.  Slaps it on the magazine.  
           Date, production number, and TWO WORDS: “BRUCE FOOTAGE.”

                                 RICK
                        Ready to roll, Steve!
           BEGIN MONTAGE as the spotlight now turns to BRUCE.  For the 
           next four minutes, he will make their lives a living hell. 

           A new SONG rises: “25 or 6 to 4” by Chicago.  

           ON THE OCEAN -- A wooden barge tows Bruce out to sea. 
           Alongside him, a mini-fleet bounces through the chop.  TITLE:

           ON THE OCEAN -- Cameras rolling.  All eyes watch the water.

           UNDERWATER -- The sea sled slides.  The JIB ARM rises.

           ON THE OCEAN -- Bruce bursts through surface.  SMASHES nose-
           first into the side of the Orca.  Steven throws down his hat.  

           SHARK CITY -- Bruce’s nose has a huge DENT.  

           Alves and Mattey fix it as NUMBERS appear ON SCREEN.  Repair

           Alves and Mattey man the controls.  Summoning the beast.

           ON THE ORCA -- Steven, in director’s chair and dark glasses, 
           gives a quick press interview as the GUITAR SOLO kicks in.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Sea conditions have been so 
                        impossible that’s it’s really hurt 
                        our schedule and put a general 
                        somber note behind the scenes on the 
                        production, because we’ve been here 
                        a hundred and five shooting days 
                        when we only scheduled for something 
                        like sixty-five or seventy...

           More DOUBLE EXPOSURES behind Steven.  Longer days as sea.  
           The shark is still not working.  As the interview continues...  

                                 STEVEN
                        At times, especially when you’re by 
                        yourself at night, it weighs much 
                        more heavily than it does during 
                        the working day...

           SPLIT SCREEN.  Steven’s interview on one side.  On the other: 

           STEVEN’S BEDROOM -- JUMP CUTS.  Different nights.  Nightmares.  

                                 STEVEN
                        ...when your mind is on getting 
                        good film.  At night, you realize 
                        that it’s a great responsibility 
                        and that you’re juggling a lot of 
                        cash and, uh... it’s, um... 

           Steven springs up from his bed over and over again.  
           The INTERVIEW half of the screen takes over the frame.

                                 STEVEN
                        It’s sometimes very frightening.

           ON THE OCEAN -- BRUCE malfunctions over and over again as...    

           The screen splits into TWO.  Both screens show the shark not 
           working.  The screens divide again.  Two split into FOUR.  
           Four into EIGHT.  Eight into SIXTEEN.  And again until...

           The frame is composed of THIRTY TWO SQUARE PANELS:
           In each, a new shot of the SHARK seriously fucking up a take.  
           Slamming into the boat.  Belching steam.  Surfacing tail 
           first.  Jaws not opening.  A serious pain in the ass.     

           Every panel FLIPS over to reveal THIRTY TWO NEW PANELS:  
           In each one, a new shot of Steven in serious frustration.

           Swearing.  Throwing things.  Shouting.  Hands in the air.  

           Every panel FLIPS OVER once more.  Each now a tiny piece of 
           the whole.  A MOSAIC of the crew re-anchoring.  Again.  TITLE:

           ON THE ORCA -- The CAMERA SPINS 360 degrees around Steven.  
           New problems in the BACKGROUND with each revolution...

           PASS 1... Bruce’s skin BUBBLES up from his skeleton. 
           PASS 2... A seasick Scheider THROWS UP all over Bruce. 
           PASS 3... Bruce’s jaws HYPER-EXTEND.  Unhinged.
           PASS 4... Shaw grabs Dreyfuss in a headlock.  Laughing at him.
           PASS 5... Bruce vomits BLACK GREASE all over Scheider. 

           As it spirals out of control...
           CLOSE ON: STEVEN AND BRUCE.  Nose to nose in a stare down.  

           The CAMERA FOOTAGE COUNTER says they’ve only shot about 400 
           FEET worth of film on the same “BRUCE FOOTAGE” magazine.

           We dive UNDERWATER, passing Bruce’s sea sled and SURFACE on 
           the other side of the Orca as Steven directs, calling for... 

           BRUCE.  He explodes from below, higher than the boat.  Hovers 
           in the air, suspended by his jib arm.  The crew goes berserk.  

           Steven kicks over his chair.  TITLE:  

                               75 DAYS OVER SCHEDULE

           CLOSE ON: THE CALENDAR.  More days... 76, 77, 78, 79... 

           ON THE CAMERA BOAT -- As the song winds down, Steven checks 
           the camera viewfinder to see... A SAILBOAT on the horizon.

           Steven hangs his head in defeat.  END MONTAGE on final TITLE:

           EXT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Steven lumbers toward the cabin.  The door SLAMS OPEN as...  
           The tattooed BURLY CARPENTER who works with Alves storms out.  

                                 BURLY CARPENTER
                        Hope your movie’s a fucking hit. 
           He throws a T-SHIRT at Steven.  Storms off.  A beat, then... 
           Steven notices Gilmore standing in the doorway.

                                 GILMORE
                        Missed a custody hearing back in 
                        L.A.  He just lost his kids.

           Steven feels the guilt like a kick to the head.  He looks down 
           at the T-shirt.  One of the Jaws shirts he made for the crew.  

           The “J” is crossed out, crudely replaced with “FL” - FLAWS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE BAR -- DAY

           Shaw’s wife Mary ducks inside.  Stares around at the few 
           patrons.  Doesn’t see her husband.  Frustrated, she exits.

           INT. CHILMARK TAVERN -- DAY

           Mary pokes her head into the Chilmark... No Shaw.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DUSK

           Mary enters a TRAILER marked with Shaw’s name.  
           A beat, then... She comes running out in tears.

           A moment later, Shaw appears at the door.  Clumsily pulling 
           up his pants... And the half-dressed NANNY is beside him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KELLEY HOUSE / BACK YARD -- DUSK

           A BANNER strung over the yard reads: “NIXON RESIGNS!”

           Members of the cast and crew gather on the lawn for a BBQ.  
           Laughing and chatting it up.  A break from their stress.

           Televisions stacked in a pyramid on the lawn show RICHARD 
           NIXON giving his farewell speech to the White House staff.

                                 RICHARD NIXON
                        Greatness comes when you’re really 
                        tested.  When you take some knocks, 
                        some disappointments, when sadness 
                        comes.  Because only when you’ve 
                        been in the deepest valley can you 
                        ever know how magnificent it is to 
                        be on the highest mountain...  

           Steven sits on a lawn chair far across the party.  Not really 
           mingling with the group.  A HIPPIE GIRL sits down next to him. 
                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        Some party, huh?  Fuck Nixon.

                                 STEVEN
                        Yeah.  I guess so.  
                             (awkward beat, then...)
                        You local?

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        Nah, I’m visiting from Albany.  
                        Been hanging out with Ricky.

           She nods at Dreyfuss across the way with a smile full of sex.

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        What do you do?  Carpenter?  No, 
                        you look more like... Accounting.

                                 STEVEN
                        Something like that.

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        Don’t act so excited.  Jesus, you 
                        sound worse than he does.  He can
                        not wait to get off this set, man.

           Steven didn’t expect that.  Tries to play it cool.  

                                 STEVEN
                        That, uh... That what he said?

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        He got an earful from his agent.  
                        Dude said people are talking all 
                        over Hollywood.  Talking like this 
                        thing’s gonna end careers.  Like 
                        it’s all gone fucking radioactive.

           Steven sets down his burger.  Suddenly nauseous. 

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        Like it’s nothing but a bad joke.

           Steven looks around the party for a life preserver.  In a 
           surreal moment, all their heads turn toward him... Laughing. 

           Across the lawn, he sees BENCHLEY.  Laughing hardest of all.

           Steven grabs his head.  Hyperventilating.  He shakes off the 
           VISION.  Staggers to his feet.  Moving past the TVs, where... 

                                 RICHARD NIXON
                        Always give your best.  Never get 
                        discouraged.  Never be petty...
           INT. CABIN / STEVEN’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Steven bursts into his room.  Worse than before.  He grips 
           the edges of the night stand.  Is he having a heart attack?

                                 RICHARD NIXON (V.O.)
                        Always remember, others may hate 
                        you.  But those who hate you don’t 
                        win... Unless you hate them...

           Steven EXPLODES.  Destroying the room like Citizen Kane.  
           Hurling the end table.  Smashing lamps.  Punching the wall.

           Finally, he drops to the floor.  Out of breath.  Spent.  

                                 RICHARD NIXON (V.O.)
                        And then you destroy yourself.

           A moment later, he pulls the phone down to him.  Dials.  
           On the other end, it rings... And rings... And rings...

                                 STEVEN
                        Come on, Vicki... Pick up.

           The other end picks up... but it’s a MAN’S VOICE.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Hello?  Hello?  

           Steven freezes.  Dead silent.  Then, he hears her:

                                 VICKI’S VOICE
                        Hang up.  Come back to bed.

           Steven hangs up.  Holds the phone in his lap.  Devastated 
           beyond hope.  We PULL BACK, leaving him alone in the room.

           EXT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Outside, it’s a quiet night.  A stunning view of the moonlit 
           ocean.  CAMERA carries us over the cabin.  Flying toward...

           EDGARTOWN... To the KELLEY HOUSE... Slowly moving into...

           INT. DREYFUSS’S ROOM -- THAT MOMENT

           Dark.  Dreyfuss and the Hippie Girl asleep in bed.  Then... 
           Dreyfuss stirs.  Something’s not right.  He slowly sits up...

           And finds ROBERT SHAW sitting on the end of his bed.

           Drunk.  Bottle of whiskey clutched in his hand.  He speaks... 
           And he never once looks at Dreyfuss during the entire scene.
                                 SHAW
                        I didn’t want to make this picture.  
                        Thought the book was a piece of shit.  
                        I wrote better novels in my sleep.  
                        Mary convinced me to do it.  And here 
                        we are.  Bouncing ships and broken 
                        sharks.  Days like that can kill a 
                        man, Hooper.  Makes a bottle in your 
                        hand feel like a gift from the gods.

           He gulps from the bottle.  A beat, then...

                                 SHAW
                        Thing about a bottle, you see, is 
                        it’s got slippery insides.  Easy to 
                        get in.  Hard to get out.  Stare 
                        into it long enough, all you find 
                        is a memory of who you used to be.
                             (beat)
                        God help me, Ricky.  God help me.

           Shaw doesn’t even realize he’s finally called Dreyfuss by his 
           real name.  But it’s like a nuclear blast to the young actor.

                                 SHAW
                        My wife left me this morning.

           Dreyfuss almost says something until he sees Shaw is crying.

                                 SHAW
                        Would have happened sooner or 
                        later, I suppose, even if she 
                        hadn’t caught me with the nanny.  
                        She was tired of watching me lose 
                        control.  Goddamn joke of it was, 
                        she’s the one who kept me in
                        control.  She couldn’t take the 
                        bottle from me, but she kept the 
                        demons at bay.  Now she’s gone, I 
                        hear ‘em calling.  And I tell 
                        myself I’d give anything for one 
                        last hurrah to make time stand 
                        still.  Because that’s the only 
                        thing shows you for sure you still 
                        matter.  But that moment’s come and 
                        gone.  All’s left is a tired old 
                        drunk with one foot in a pine box.
                             (long beat)
                        Quint might make it through the 
                        rest of this picture... Don’t know 
                        if I can say the same about me.

           Without another word, he exits.  Dreyfuss stunned silent.
           EXT. EDGARTOWN DOCKS -- DAWN

           As Steven heads down the dock, he notices Six Pack anxiously 
           waiting for the ferry to land.  Tapping fingers on the rail.   

                                 STEVEN
                        What are you doing up so early?

                                 SIX PACK
                        Special delivery for me, boss.

           Moments later, an adorable SIX YEAR OLD GIRL sprints off the 
           ferry into Six Pack’s waiting arms.  Soon joined by his WIFE.

           A family reunited.  Steven watches them.  Hope in his smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Overcast.  Orca and company anchored on rough seas.  TITLE:

           ON THE ORCA -- Steven, wearing his DARK GLASSES, blocks out 
           a shot with toy boats as the vessel bobs around on the waves.

                                 STEVEN
                        Bruce tugs the line underwater, and 
                        the entire Orca whips around...
                             (grabs his radio)
                        Where’s my tow cables?  I got a six 
                        pack for you if you’re ready in ten.

           ON A NEARBY DINGHY -- Six Pack gets the call over his radio.  
           Bouncing around in rough water, he’s sick to his stomach.

                                 SIX PACK
                        Keep it.  This chop’s a nightmare.  
                        I don’t know how you hack it, boss.

           ON THE ORCA --

                                 STEVEN
                             (into radio)
                        I sleep on a waterbed.  I’m good.

           He stares out at the ocean from behind his glasses... And 
           suddenly grows distant.  Off balance.  Something’s wrong.

                                 MATTEY
                        Cable may show through all the chop.
                                 ALVES
                        Steve... How wide we going on this?

           Steven doesn’t answer.  A beat.  He pushes past, down into...    

           THE HEAD -- Where we FOLLOW him inside for the first time. 

           Steven rips off his jacket.  Deep breaths.  Tears off his 
           glasses.  Stares into the mirror.  Panting.  Fighting it.

           And we realize his eyes are completely bloodshot.  Watering.

                                 STEVEN
                        ...c’mon... c’mon...

           Covered in sweat.  Trying to pace his breaths.  Desperately 
           staving off SEA SICKNESS.  But it’s too much to hold back.

           He PUKES into the marine toilet like his guts are coming up.

           Steven runs the water.  Dousing his face.  Regaining 
           composure as he stares into his reflection.  Into his soul.

                                 STEVEN
                        ...the fuck is the matter with you? 
                        ...what the fuck are you doing?

           BELOW DECK -- Steven exits the head.  On the move.   
           Fully composed and professional.  And we now understand...

           He’s been seasick the entire time.  

           Hiding it behind dark glasses and a smile.  Knowing that in 
           front of his crew, he needs to look like he’s in control.

           EXT. ORCA -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven emerges.  Fresh.  Amped up.   

                                 STEVEN
                        Go wide, Joe!  Make it look good!

           UNDERWATER -- Divers rig cables from the Orca to a motor boat.

           ON THE ORCA -- Steven blocks as the motor boat arrives 
           with the cast.  Shaw makes a point of isolating himself. 

           Butler starts to break down the camera.  Motions for Rick. 

                                 BUTLER
                        Hey, kid.  Grab me the black bag, 
                        will ya?  I wanna get rid of this 
                        albatross and swap out the mags.
           He pats the attached mag, the one that says “BRUCE FOOTAGE.”

                                 STEVEN
                             (stepping in)
                        We still got plenty of roll left.  
                        Let’s keep it running while we can.

           Butler shrugs.  No sense in arguing.  As Steven greets 
           the actors, Dreyfuss pulls him aside.  Genuinely concerned.  

                                 DREYFUSS
                        We’ve got a problem with Shaw.

           Shaw watches them talk from across the deck.  Moments later, 
           Steven slowly heads toward him, but before he says anything...

                                 SHAW
                        Tell Hooper to mind his fucking 
                        mannerisms.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- LATER

           The cadre of boats float among the rough chop, ready to roll.

           MOTOR BOAT -- Six Pack mans the steering wheel for Alves and 
           Mattey.  Alves checks the cables.  Thumbs up.  All set here.

           CAMERA BOAT -- Steven has moved here with Rick and a second 
           CAMERA OPERATOR.  He raises his radio and hits the button. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Action!  Punch it!

           MOTOR BOAT -- Six Pack SLAMS the throttle forward.

           UNDERWATER -- The motor boat’s wake pulls away.  Tow cable 
           drawing taut until it stretches out all the way and we go...

           TOPSIDE -- A vertical SPLIT SCREEN.  Both shots from the 
           finished movie are put to film in a simulated attack as...

           The shark RAMS the Orca from below.  The boat spins around, 
           almost capsizing as the unseen shark violently tugs it along.  

           And that’s when it happens.

           THE MOTOR BOAT -- hits a choppy WAVE.  The boat catches air, 
           DROPPING four feet before SPLASHING back to the sea.

           UNDERWATER -- Tow cable PULLS super taut.  RIPPING its 
           EYEBOLT from the bottom.  TEARING OUT a plank of the HULL.

           ON THE ORCA -- Cast, crew, and equipment get tossed to one 
           side as the boat LURCHES.  She’s taking on water.  Fast. 
           CAMERA BOAT --

                                 RICK
                        Jesus, did you see that?

                                 STEVEN
                             (into radio)
                        Talk to me, boys!  What’s going on?!

           ON THE ORCA -- The boat settles briefly.  Bruises and cuts 
           all around.  Everyone scrambling to their feet.  Then...

           There’s A VIOLENT SHUDDERING throughout the boat...
           She’s listing... And she’s listing bad.  Jesus. 

           CAMERA BOAT -- Steven sees her mast at forty degrees. 

                                 BUTLER (V.O.)
                             (over radio)
                        We’re going down!  Holy Christ, the 
                        Orca is going down right now!

           CLOSE ON: STEVEN.  The world warps around him in a 
           DIZZYING VERTIGO SHOT: Oh, dear God, this is not happening.  

           MOTOR BOAT -- Steven hops aboard as Six Pack swings past him.

                                 STEVEN
                        Get the actors off the boat!  Now!
                             (turns to Alves)
                        What happened?!  

           Alves and Mattey show Steven the end of the tow cable... 
           And the broken chunk of the ORCA’S HULL attached to it.

                                 STEVEN
                        What the hell are you guys, the 
                        special defects department?!  

           ON THE ORCA -- CREW MEMBERS bail over the sides.

           Scheider is trapped in the pilot house.  Banging on the 
           glass.  Frantic.  Dreyfuss SMASHES a scuba tank through the 
           window.  He and Shaw helping Scheider out and overboard.

           CREAKING and GROANING above.  Shaw tackles Dreyfuss aside... 
           Just as a hunk of the flying bridge CRASHES onto the deck.

           IN THE OCEAN -- Dreyfuss surfaces.  In a panic among the 
           detritus.  Shaw grabs him.  Other arm clutching a life vest. 

                                 SHAW
                        I gotcha, Mr. Hooper.  I gotcha.
           MOTOR BOAT -- Six Pack swings in toward the Orca.  Steven 
           pulls Scheider aboard.  Alves hops onto the listing deck.

                                 ALVES
                        I’m gonna save her!

           Steven follows him aboard the sinking ship.

           ON THE ORCA -- Steven directs panicked crew members back 
           toward the motor boat.  Follows Alves up to the bridge.

           Alves shoves the throttle full force into overdrive.  

                                 ALVES
                        We gotta ground her before she sinks!

           Engines GRIND as the sinking ship heads toward shore.  
           Steven finds a bullhorn, trying to manage some of the chaos.

                                 STEVEN
                        GET THE ACTORS OUT OF THE WATER!

           A lone voice screams out from the bow:

                                 SOUND GUY
                        FUCK THE ACTORS!  SAVE THE SOUND!

           A grizzled SOUND GUY wades through rising water.  He holds a 
           NAGRA SOUND RECORDER high above his head like it’s his child.

           In that moment, Steven realizes something horrible... 
           And his entire face goes pale.  He slowly turns to Alves.

                                 STEVEN
                        Where the fuck is the camera?

           SUPER SLOW MOTION:

           Sounds like we’re inside a sea shell.  Alves slowly turns 
           back to Steven.  Their hearts sinking deeper than the Orca.

           WAVES crest over the side of the listing deck as...
           The Orca RUNS AGROUND on the sandy bottom, half-submerged.

                                                          FREEZE FRAME.

           A song rises: “When the Ship Comes In” by Bob Dylan.

           The bedlam of the sinking Orca now captured in surreal 
           stillness like a photograph.  The entire moment FROZEN.

           CLOSE ON: STEVEN’S FACE... As he turns his head.  
           He’s the only one NOT FROZEN.  Wandering along the deck like 
           it’s a model ship.  Touching the still wave cresting the bow.  
           Walking atop the calm water on deck...

           And finally, he finds it.  Below the surface of the water.  
           Sinking like a stone.  Sinking along with his very soul...

           THE CAMERA.  Mag still labeled: “BRUCE FOOTAGE.”

           Eighty days of work.  Submerged.  Along with the hopes of a 
           crew who just want to go home.  Along with Steven’s dreams. 

           All buried at the bottom of the ocean.

           And that’s when a NEW CREW walks out.  Oblivious to Steven, 
           they carry off pieces of the frozen set.  Breaking down the 
           real world around him like it’s a life size jigsaw puzzle.  

           One takes Joe Alves... Another takes Six Pack...  They break 
           down the Orca... Then the OCEAN, just chunks of wooden facade.

           Until only Steven is left, standing in...

           INT. STAGE 12 -- DAY

           The largest soundstage at Universal.  Now a 29,500 square 
           foot monument to Steven’s loneliness.  But he’s not alone...

           A DIRECTOR’S CHAIR sits in the balcony, near the rafters.

           YOUNG STEVEN sits in the chair.  Seven years old.  Calling 
           all the shots.  Motioning for the crew.  And they return...

           The crew builds a brand new set around Steven in TIME LAPSE.  
           Now he’s in the middle of another still shot...

           EXT. EDGARTOWN DOCKS -- DAY

           The aftermath of the Orca sinking.  Still-life crowd.   
           Ambulances.  A nightmare frozen in time.

           From the director’s perch, Young Steven motions Older Steven 
           to his mark.  Steven obeys without any question... ACTION.  

           SUPER SLOW MOTION RESUMES:

           Paramedics tend to the crew... Cuts being patched... 
           Blankets placed around those pulled from the ocean...  
           And in the middle, Steven.  Relegated to an audience member.

           UNDERWATER --

           DIVERS recover the sunken CAMERA.
           ON THE DOCK --

           Rick Fields fills a bucket from a “FRESH WATER” faucet.

           Butler wraps a BLACK BAG over the camera.  Removes the “BRUCE 
           FOOTAGE” magazine.  Gently eases it into the bucket of water.

           Rick rushes the bucket into a waiting taxi.
           Steven can only watch it drive away.  Behind him...

           Benchley.  Rage in his stare.  His worst fears realized.

           PUSH into Steven’s face.  In his DARK GLASSES, the reflection 
           of the taxi speeding off with his future.  PUSH IN closer...

           As a lone tear streaks down his face from under the glasses.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY

           Steven’s tear becomes a DROP OF WATER slowly running down the 
           side of the bucket.  Rick Fields holds the bucket on his lap.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY

           Rick springs out of a new taxi.  Rushing the bucket into a 
           building.  SIGN outside the entrance reads: PHOTO-KEM LABS.

           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           The song’s somber HARMONICA SOLO echoes.  Steven collapses 
           into his bed.  Alone.  Hiding from the whole world.  Until...  

           Someone shows up to tuck him in bed... ARNOLD.

           His father plants a kiss on his head.  Steven shuts his eyes.  
           As the solo continues, we revisit the OPENING DREAM SEQUENCE: 

           INT. OLD MOVIE THEATER -- DAY

           Young Steven enters the theater... The screen SHATTERS...  
           Rough seas fill the room... Young Steven adrift and alone. 

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD -- DAWN 

           Steven walks through town.  Avoiding glares from crew 
           members.  A marked man.  He continues toward the harbor to...

           EXT. SHARK CITY -- DAY

           And he’s back where we first met him, headed to the boat 
           house where Joe Alves has been working all night.  END SONG.
           EXT. OAK BLUFFS HARBOR -- DAY

           Boots THUMP onto the dock as Robert Shaw stomps along.  
           Sipping from his flask.  WHISTLING that same tune from the 
           opening.  A song about good-byes and fair ladies of Spain.

           STEVEN walks up the dock from the other direction... 
           The scene from the opening, now shown from SHAW’S POV.

           Shaw SHOULDER BUMPS Steven.  Keeps walking.  Still whistling.

           He tosses his FLASK in the water as he walks on.
           Lingering on the floating object, we note an INSCRIPTION:  

                            TO A GLORIOUSLY LOVING, COMBATIVE,

           The Black Tower looms over Lankershim Boulevard.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

           Sheinberg checks the WHITEBOARD; Universal’s upcoming slate:

           Dollar amounts.  Charts.  Graphs.  All in BLACK MARKER.  
           In other words, the balance sheets are in perfect order.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Things look good on this side.  
                        Wish I could say the same for...

           He moves over a few steps.  Jaws has its own whiteboard.  
           Delays.  Setbacks.  Cash problems.  All inked in RED MARKER.  

                                 SHEINBERG
                        We opened a femoral artery, and the 
                        son of a bitch is hemorrhaging 
                        money.  We patch it, it rips open 
                        again.  And we’re out of bandages.

           Lew Wasserman stares back at him.  Silently absorbing it all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DAY

           The Orca floats idle.  Anchored off shore.  Camera boats all 
           around.  A motor boat pulls up with a very drunk Robert Shaw. 
           He attempts to climb aboard the Orca, but it takes a few 
           grips to help.  And he’s still got a bottle in hand.  Shaw 
           spots Dreyfuss watching the scene.  Disgusted with him.

                                 SHAW
                        Hooper, help me out here.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Sure.  I’ll help you out...

           Dreyfuss takes the bottle from him.  Hurls it overboard.  
           Shaw LUNGES, grabbing at him, but the grips hold him back.

           INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE -- DAY

           The set is being dressed for Quint’s Indianapolis speech.  
           Crew black out the windows.  Shaw drops down at the table.

                                 SHAW
                        Ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille!

                                 STEVEN
                        Bob?  You want some coffee?

                                 SHAW
                        Already had a drink.  A drink gives 
                        poetry to life, young Stevie.  
                        Isn’t that what we’re doing here?

           Shaw’s ready, but Dreyfuss just shakes his head: no good.  
           Steven settles in behind the camera and we...

           JUMP CUT -- Dreyfuss feeds Shaw the intro to his big speech.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        You were on the Indianapolis?

                                 SHAW
                        Goddamn right I was...
                             (beat)
                        Slammed my torpedo up her ass!

           He cackles like a madman.  A very long day has just begun.   

                                 STEVEN
                        Heh... Good one, Bob.  Let’s try it 
                        again.  A little more serious.

           More JUMP CUTS as Shaw drunkenly MANGLES one of the most 
           famous monologues ever captured on film...

                                 SHAW
                        Didn’t see the first shark for 
                        about an hour.  Tiger... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHAW (CONT'D)
                        Awww, this don’t make no goddamn 
                        sense.  The hell’s a tiger doing in 
                        the ocean?!

           JUMP CUT -- Same scene.  Another part of the speech.  Shaw 
           stares into space.  Dead silent.  Has he forgotten his lines?  

                                 SHAW
                        We delivered the bomb.  The 
                        Hiroshima bomb.  Nagasaki bomb.  
                        Some goddamn Jap bomb.

           JUMP CUT -- Another part of the speech.  Shaw slurs:

                                 SHAW
                        ...Third day, bumped into a friend 
                        of mine.  Robbie Herbertson... 
                        Herbie Herbison... Jackie Robinson.

                                 DREYFUSS
                             (pissed)
                        Herbie.  Robinson.

                                 STEVEN
                        Just say, “Friend of mine.  Baseball 
                        player.  He’d been bitten in half.”

                                 SHAW
                        Baseball player.  Bosun’s mate.  
                        Bitten... Bit himself in half.

           Steven’s not watching Shaw anymore.  He’s watching the CREW. 

           Most glare back at him, as if to ask why he’s putting up 
           with this.  A tense beat.  Then Dreyfuss starts to SING softly:

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Show me the way to go home...

                                 SCHEIDER
                        I’m tired and I wanna go to bed...

           And they’re joined by...

                                 THE CREW
                        I had a little drink about an hour 
                        ago and it’s gone right to my head.

           Everyone is singing.  Except Steven.  Looking around the 
           room, he can see TEARS in the eyes of his crew members.

           Not because they’re happy... They all just want to go home.
           EXT. OAK BLUFFS HARBOR -- DUSK

           The Orca and camera boats are back on shore.  Crew members 
           off-load gear.  Steven holds court with Zanuck and Brown.

                                 STEVEN
                        We’re just gonna cut it and move on.

           The producers exchange a worried look.  Then...

                                 BROWN
                        You feel that’s the right play?

                                 STEVEN
                        Why not?  In fact, let’s cut the 
                        whole rest of the fucking movie.

           He storms off down the docks.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN -- DUSK INTO NIGHT

           Steven wanders the streets.  Avoiding everyone.  As the sun 
           sets, he’s alone with his thoughts.  Until he arrives at...

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE BAR -- NIGHT

           Steven enters.  Finds crew members drowning their sorrows.  
           All eyes on him.  Alves tries to usher Steven back outside. 

                                 ALVES
                        Come on, Steve.  This isn’t the 
                        best place for you to be right now.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        MR. DIRECTOR!

           Heads turn.  The crowd parts to reveal SOMEONE at the bar...

           Benchley.  Martini glass in hand.  Several empties around 
           him.  He’s been at this a while.  Alves pulls Steven aside. 

                                 ALVES
                        Go home.  I’ll handle him.

           Steven glances around the room.  The whole crew watching.

                                 STEVEN
                        No.  I’ll deal with this.

           With the room on pins and needles, Steven steps to him.
           Benchley smiles to himself.  A long lost memory forming...
                                 BENCHLEY
                        My father didn’t believe in love.  
                        Strange thing for a man who wrote 
                        children’s books.  You know, he 
                        sent a letter back to every child 
                        that wrote to him, but he never 
                        made me feel like anything but a 
                        burden.  When I finally got old 
                        enough to call him on it, he said 
                        he was teaching me self-reliance.  
                        Being a bull headed young man, I 
                        decided I’d help him prove his 
                        point.  I brought home a straight A 
                        report card from Exeter the next 
                        semester.  You know what he said?     

           Benchley’s face cracks.  Pain... Giving way to anger.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        He said I only accomplished it 
                        because of him.  From that point 
                        on, I decided to start living for 
                        me.  And it led me to better 
                        things... the Post, Newsweek, 
                        speech writing for the White House. 
                        Then there was Jaws.  At last, I 
                        had my first big success.  He 
                        couldn’t tear that away from me.  
                        But I suppose he didn’t have to...

           His eyes drill into Steven...  

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I had you for that.    

           He stands.  Facing off with the young director.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        You and your little “adventure 
                        story.”  The one that ends with you 
                        shoving a scuba tank in a shark’s 
                        mouth and blowing it to smithereens! 

           Steven tries to stand his ground... 

                                 STEVEN
                        The book’s ending was... weak.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        The book is weak?  You’re weak.  
                             (moving closer)
                        You were doomed to fail.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BENCHLEY (CONT'D)
                        And when I think of how I just 
                        handed it over to you, like some 
                        sacrificial lamb... God, I hate
                        myself for it. 
                             (rage building)
                        I’d sooner see the entire book 
                        burned from my memory than drawn 
                        and quartered into this farce with 
                        you holding the dripping blade!  
                        You... have destroyed... EVERYTHING!

           He clenches his fist so tight, the glass SHATTERS in his 
           hand.  He doesn’t notice the blood.  He just keeps going.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        For God’s sake, look what you’ve 
                        done to these people!  Look at
                        them!  They just want to go home, 
                        but you won’t rest until you 
                        destroy them.  And what have you 
                        got to show for all your ambition?  
                        A broken shark and a sinking ship.   
                             (beat)
                        From this day forward, when people 
                        think of Jaws, they won’t remember 
                        Peter Benchley.  All they’ll 
                        remember is a young director who 
                        grew too big for his own dreams.  

           Benchley points a bloody finger right at Steven.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        You’re no artist.  You’re no great 
                        storyteller.  You’re Icarus with a 
                        movie camera.  And you flew too 
                        close to the sun this time.

           Steven looks like a beaten dog.  All conviction shattered.

           Benchley snickers at the sight of him.  Without another word, 
           without a glance at anyone else, Benchley exits the bar.  

           Steven can feel everyone’s eyes on him.  But when he looks, 
           nobody will meet his gaze.  Not Scheider.  Not Gottlieb.  
           Even Alves has to look away.  Head down, he exits... Alone.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN HARBOR -- NIGHT INTO DAWN

           Steven watches the sunrise.  Millions of miles from 
           everywhere in his head.  A moment later, he arrives at...

           FERRY LANDING -- Six Pack bids a tearful farewell to his WIFE 
           and DAUGHTER.  He kneels in front of his bawling little girl.
                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why can’t you come home with us?

                                 SIX PACK
                        I’ll be home soon.  I promise.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        You said that a long time ago!

                                 SIX PACK
                        I mean it.  Won’t be much longer 
                        now.  And we can go to Disneyland 
                        every day when I get back, okay?

           She grabs him in a desperate hug.  Won’t let go.  Crying.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        I don’t care about Disneyland!  I 
                        just want you to come home, daddy!

           All of them are crying now.  He kisses her tenderly.  Has to 
           pry her away as they board.  His heart breaking into pieces. 

           Steven watches.  Devastated.  A beat, then there’s Gottlieb.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Steve!  Where have you been?!

                                 STEVEN
                        I need to talk to Zanuck.  We’re 
                        going home, Carl.  Every one of us.

           Steven storms off... As Gottlieb runs for a PAY PHONE.

           INT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

           Zanuck, phone held to his ear, stares out the window.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Calm down, Carl.  I’ll handle it.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, he sees Steven coming up the walkway.  
           FOLLOW Steven as he enters.  Moving through the bullpen to...

           ZANUCK’S OFFICE -- As Steven enters, Zanuck has his back to 
           us.  Button-down on the chair, he now wears a white T-shirt. 

                                 ZANUCK
                        I heard what happened in the bar.

           Zanuck turns to reveal he’s wearing a JAWS T-SHIRT.  The same 
           shirts Steven made for the crew.  The sight jars Steven a bit.
                                 STEVEN
                        I never should have taken this job. 

                                 ZANUCK
                        We all hit a rough patch, kid.  Me, 
                        I had a nice run at Twentieth.  
                        Sound of Music, Patton, French 
                        Connection.  Those are the ones 
                        everybody remembers.  They don’t 
                        talk about the failures.  The ones 
                        that bleed the studio dry.  My 
                        father had to fire me to keep the 
                        stockholders happy.  My own father.  
                        You don’t know humiliation, kid. 

           A quiet beat.  The memory still stings.  Then...

                                 ZANUCK
                        Few years later, Mr. Brown told me 
                        something I’d never forget.  He said 
                        success isn’t about hitting a home 
                        run or being better than the other 
                        guy.  Success is showing up.  Putting 
                        in the hours until the job’s done.  

           He points to his T-shirt.  The Jaws shark logo.

                                 ZANUCK
                        This right here?  You made it 
                        happen.  You wanted it bad enough 
                        because you knew you could do it.  
                        God’s sake, kid, don’t let that go.

                                 STEVEN
                        If I don’t go, I’m gonna be living 
                        this nightmare for the rest of my 
                        life.   I... I want it to be over.

           Zanuck offers nothing but a sad smile.  He nods.  It’s done.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN DOCKS -- DAY

           Suitcase in hand, Steven boards the ferry.  Alves, Gottlieb, 
           Six Pack and other crew stand by like mourners at a funeral.

           EXT. FERRY -- DAY

           Sailing.  Martha’s Vineyard fading.  Steven doesn’t look back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- DAY

           The Black Tower looms over the lot like the Bastille.
           INT. SHEINBERG’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Steven stands in front of Sheinberg.  Humbled and humiliated.

                                 STEVEN
                        I don’t know how to make this 
                        right.  All I know is I failed you.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Kid, how can you say you failed me 
                        when you’re not working for me yet?

           Steven seems confused, until he looks at the CALENDAR: 1969.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        But we’re about to change that...

           He drops Steven’s GUITAR CASE on the desk.  The one from 
           Vietnam.  Sid POPS it open to reveal Steven’s OLD FILM REELS.  

           INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Steven exits Sheinberg’s office.  Starts a long walk down the 
           hall.  Actors and crew members PASS him going the other way.

           We may recognize some famous faces... ROD SERLING from Night 
           Gallery... JOAN CRAWFORD as her Night Gallery character... 
           Robert Young as MARCUS WELBY, MD... DENNIS WEAVER from Duel... 

           And as Steven keeps walking... The hallway begins to change.  
           More confined.  Pipes line the ceiling.  Steel vault doors.

           More CREW MEMBERS pass, now wearing NAVAL UNIFORMS.  A FEMALE 
           OFFICER goes by.  Reading from her script.  And we know her... 

                                 VICKI
                        When I called you a son of a bitch, 
                        I didn’t mean it.

           She looks right at Steven as she passes...

                                 VICKI
                        No... I meant it... Every word.

           ALARMS sound.  KLAXONS blare.  RED LIGHTS flash.  SAILORS 
           scramble past.  A uniformed RICK FIELDS grabs hold of Steven.

                                 RICK
                        Battle stations, Captain!

           EXT. OCEAN -- DUSK

           Two SHARK FINS slice through the surface of the water.  
           But we soon realize they’re not sharks... They’re TORPEDOES.
           And now we can see their target... it’s the USS INDIANAPOLIS.

           INT. INDIANAPOLIS BRIDGE -- THAT MOMENT

           Rick ushers Steven in amid chaos.  The crew SALUTES him. 

                                 RICK
                        Torpedoes in the water!  Orders, sir!

           PING!  SWISH PAN to... DREYFUSS.  Manning the sonar.  Not 
           in a Navy uniform, but pin-striped old timey BASEBALL DUDS. 

                                 DREYFUSS
                        400 YARDS AND CLOSING!  

           SWISH TO... SHAW.  At the window looking out to sea.  The 
           only one not scared.  Smiling at Steven as he sings softly:

                                 SHAW
                        Farewell and adieu to you, fair 
                        Spanish ladies...

           PING!  SWISH back to...

                                 DREYFUSS
                        TORPEDOES AT 200 YARDS!

                                 SHAW
                             (singing)
                        Farewell and adieu, you ladies of 
                        Spain...

           SWISH BACK TO... Steven.  Wracked by fear and anguish as... 
           PING!  And we’re SWISHING rapidly between Shaw and Dreyfuss.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        100 YARDS, SIR!

                                 SHAW
                             (singing)
                        For we’ve received orders for to 
                        sail back to Boston...

                                 DREYFUSS
                        BRACE FOR IMPACT!

           SWISH TO... Steven.  KA-BOOM!  The bridge SHUDDERS as we...

                                                             BLACK OUT.

           Sounds of violence, panic, chaos.  RUSHING WATER drowns it 
           all into silence.  All but the sound of Shaw still singing:
                                 SHAW (V.O.)
                        And so nevermore will we see you...
                             (whispers)
                        ...again...

           INT. OLD MOVIE THEATER -- THAT MOMENT

           Same theater from before.  Young Steven pleads with Arnold.

                                 YOUNG STEVEN
                        Again.  Please.

           The curtain opens... And a massive TIDAL WAVE spills out.  
           Behind the curtain, an endless OCEAN lies before us where... 

           The wreck of the USS INDIANAPOLIS sinks beneath the waves.

           Young Steven is sucked underwater by the tidal wave... 
           Emerging moments later as ADULT STEVEN.  Gasping for air.

           SHIP’S CREW float on the water.  Burned, bleeding, drowning. 

           A YELLOW RAFT drifts by.  SCHEIDER rides on it.  Dressed like 
           an old MOVIE USHER.  CHUMMING the water from a popcorn bucket.

                                 SCHEIDER
                        Slow ahead... I can go slow ahead.

           SHARK FINS emerge.  A brutal FEEDING FRENZY begins.  The ocean 
           turns red.  Rick Fields is PULLED UNDER.  Then Dreyfuss, 
           but not before Steven sees the name on his jersey: ROBINSON. 

                                 STEVEN
                        “Herbie Robinson.  Baseball player.”

           35mm FILM “GUTS” float to the surface.  He’s been bitten in 
           half.  Nearby, another sailor clings to a life vest... SHAW.

                                 SHAW
                        Better if you don’t fight it.

                                 STEVEN
                        Help me, Bob.  You can save us.

                                 SHAW
                        Ain’t me you want.  Old Shaw’s 
                        nothing but shark bait.  You want 
                        the other fella.  Only he can help.
                             (smiles)
                        But he might take some convincing.

           A RESCUE CHOPPER flies in.  Lowers a WINCH.  Shaw hooks on.
                                 SHAW
                        Farewell and adieu.

           The winch hoists him up.  Steven madly signals the pilot.

           IN THE COCKPIT -- CLOSE ON: THE PILOT... Peter Benchley.    
           He casts a smug glance down at Steven.  Then flies away.

           ON THE OCEAN -- Sharks circle Steven’s raft.  BUMPING him.  
           Bolted metal under ripped flesh.  Steven takes a deep breath.

                                 STEVEN
                        Better if you don’t fight it...

           He shuts his eyes.  Lays back in calm surrender as...

           A massive GREAT WHITE surfaces.  Larger than the rest.  The 
           huge metal JAWS open wide.  Swallowing Steven and the raft.

                                                         SLAM TO BLACK.

           MUFFLED MUSIC.  Old-time radio plays the big band sound of 
           Kay Kyser.  A children’s song: “The Three Little Fishies.” 

           INT. AIRLOCK -- MOMENTS LATER

           LIGHTS kick on.  Steven floats inside a rusted PRESSURIZED 
           CHAMBER.  A beat, then water DRAINS.  Steven HITS the floor.  

           Music STOPS with a scratch.  Steel door RISES UP as... 
           Alves greets him, clad in a ‘60s seafaring sci-fi JUMPSUIT.

                                 ALVES
                        C’mon.  You’re holding up the show. 

           He tosses Steven a towel.  Motions for him to follow into...

           INT. SUBMARINE -- THAT MOMENT

           A SUBMARINE right out of Jules Verne.  Part steam-punk, part 
           art deco, with a dash of Tomorrowland.  Steven takes a seat.

           The rows are filled with other PASSENGERS.  Six Pack and 
           daughter... Brown and Zanuck... Arnold and Young Steven... 
           All of them staring outside through CRESCENT MOON portholes. 

                                 ALVES
                        All ahead full, Cap’n!     

           “Captain” Bob Mattey, also clad in sci-fi sailor garb, hits a 
           lever.  Gears GRIND and CHURN.  The sub slowly moves forward.

                                 STEVEN
                        Joe... Where are we going?
                                 ALVES
                        On the ride of your life.

           Alves sets a needle onto a record.  “The Three Little 
           Fishies” starts over as outside lights FLARE, illuminating...

           UNDERWATER -- THAT MOMENT

           And we can now see that Steven and his fellow passengers   
           are aboard a Disneyland-style Submarine Voyage ride where...

           All the submarines are huge MECHANICAL SHARKS like Bruce. 

           The sharks run along a track connected to their sea sleds. 
           Passengers stare at the water through GILL-SHAPED PORTHOLES.

           The sub passes over a model MOVIE STUDIO.  A mini backlot 
           like the Flight Over London from Disneyland’s Peter Pan ride.

           From here, the sub will pass through UNDERWATER STAGE SETS 
           depicting scenes from Steven’s life with ANIMATRONIC 
           CHARACTERS in the fashion of an amusement park dark ride.

           With each new set, Steven’s face reflects a new emotion: 
           wonder, fear, sadness, regret, etc.  The sub passes into...

           STAGE SET 1 -- YOUNG STEVEN and ARNOLD at the movies...  
           STAGE SET 2 -- ARNOLD and LEAH argue in front of STEVEN...
           STAGE SET 3 -- YOUNG STEVEN films Super 8 movies at home...
           STAGE SET 4 -- A VIETNAM firefight, METEOR SHOWER above...

           IN THE SUB -- SIMULATED LIGHTNING flashes across the windows.

                                 ALVES
                        Bridge, Radar One!  Looks like 
                        there’s a surface storm ahead!

           KA-BOOM!  BOMB BLASTS echo.  FLASHING STROBES.  
           The water turns BLOOD RED as the shark sub passes through...

           STAGE SET 5 -- The underwater wreck of the INDIANAPOLIS...

           Steven peers outside.  Startled as he sees an ANIMATRONIC 
           SHARK ripping sailors to pieces.  The sub continues on into...   

           STAGE SET 6 -- UNIVERSAL STUDIOS.  Pre-production dioramas...  
           STAGE SET 7 -- JAWS PRODUCTION on the open Atlantic Ocean...

           BRUCE.  CAMERA BOAT.  Tiny CREW MEMBERS at their stations.  
           ANIMATRONIC STEVEN presides above it all like a movie god.

           Bruce BREAKS.  Bouncing on a spring.  The moment plays on a 
           constant loop of failure, the Animatronic Steven repeating...
                                 ANIMATRONIC STEVEN 
                             (angry)
                        CUT!  RESET!  DO IT AGAIN!

           IN THE SUB -- Six Pack’s daughter frowns.   

                                 DAUGHTER
                        He’s a mean man, daddy.  

           STAGE SET 8 -- UNIVERSAL STUDIOS MAIN GATE...  

           ANIMATRONIC STEVEN slides off the lot.  Head hung in defeat.  
           A crowd of robotic ONLOOKERS laughing at his tragic failure. 

           IN THE SUB -- Steven SLAMS his hand against the window.

                                 STEVEN
                        This isn’t my life! 

           Steven rushes forward.  Takes the controls from Mattey as...

           UNDERWATER -- THAT MOMENT

           The sub BREAKS from its sea sled.  Zooming off the rails.

           INTERCUT with THE SUB as Steven drives the shark sub from 
           stage to stage.  CHOMPING sets to pieces with massive JAWS.  

           Steven is having the time of his life.  Finally in control.

           Then... The ANIMATRONIC SHARK from the Indianapolis attacks.  
           Steven fights back.  Sends it CRASHING through the set wall...

           ...where YELLOW BARRELS slide on pulleys, operating the ride.

           Steven slams the levers forward.  The shark sub CHOMPS 
           through the set.  Biting through ropes and chains until...

           The shark sub now tugs the yellow barrels along with it.

           IN THE SUB -- Mattey puts a calming hand on Steven’s shoulder.  

                                 MATTEY
                        Hell of a ride, son.

           The TOP HATCH POPS open with a hiss.  SUNLIGHT blinds us.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FERRY -- DAY

           Steven’s eyes gently open.  Not scared by the dream this 
           time.  He quickly sits up.  Trying to get his bearings.
           A HORN BLOWS as the ferry starts to pull away.  Uh-oh...

           Steven scrambles.  Throws his suitcase over the rail.  
           He jumps off the boat, leaping back onto the Edgartown docks.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OAK BLUFFS HARBOR -- NIGHT

           Shaw sits on the end of the pier.  Alone and contemplative.  
           For the first time, he doesn’t have a drink in his hand.  
           Steven approaches.  Sits down next to him.  Silence.  Then...

                                 STEVEN
                        Quiet night.  I can’t get used to 
                        it.  No car horns, no airplanes.  
                        Nothing to hear but your thoughts.

           Nothing from Shaw.  A beat, then...  

                                 STEVEN
                        Ricky told me about your wife.

                                 SHAW
                        What’s done is done.  Best to pick 
                        up the pieces and move on with it.

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s not the way I work.

                                 SHAW
                        I said to let it go, goddammit!
                        I had my chance and I shot it all 
                        to hell!  Go back to your shark!

                                 STEVEN
                        Without your scene, there’s no 
                        reason to have a shark!  You can 
                        bring this movie back to life!

                                 SHAW
                        But it won’t bring her back.

           The sadness in his eyes... Pure heartbreak.

                                 STEVEN
                        No, it won’t.  You’re right.  Only 
                        you can do that.  Get Shaw out of 
                        your head.  I need Quint.  But you 
                        need him more.  You need him to 
                        teach Shaw a thing or two about 
                        being a man.  About not giving up.  

           Shaw fights back tears...
                                 STEVEN
                        There’s still hope.

           Both men look up... And just like in Jaws, just like in 
           Steven’s dream, a SHOOTING STAR streaks across the sky.

                                 SHAW
                        You believe in signs, lad?

                                 STEVEN
                        Not until now.

           EXT. ORCA BRIDGE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Shaw sits up on the bridge.  Pad and pen in hand.  Script 
           pages beside him.  Working on the speech by lantern light.

           Beside him rests a FLASK.  The one with the inscription.  The 
           one from his wife.  Retrieved... No... Rescued from the sea.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE -- DAY

           As the crew readies the boat for the shoot, everyone glares 
           at Steven as he confers with Shaw.  Nobody wants to be here.

                                 STEVEN
                        You need a coffee?

           Shaw waves him off.  Don’t need it.  He sits at the table.  
           Dreyfuss and Scheider share an uncertain look.  Here we go.

           The slate CLAPS.  And we JUMP CUT into the scene...

                                 DREYFUSS
                        You were on the Indianapolis?

           Silence.  Shaw says nothing.  Like he’s forgotten his lines  
           again.  But now we can see something happening in his face...

           His features harden like concrete...  
           His casual gaze becomes a focused stare... 
           A transformation is coming about before our very eyes...  

           This isn’t Robert Shaw forgetting... 
           This is Sam Quint remembering.

                                 SHAW
                        Japanese submarine slammed two 
                        torpedoes into our side, Chief.  We 
                        was coming back from the island of 
                        Tinian to Leyte, just delivered the 
                        bomb.  The Hiroshima bomb...
           As he speaks, all SOUND DROWNS OUT.  Replaced by SOUNDS OF 
           ECHOED HORROR.  A torpedo blast.  Alarms.  Men screaming.

           And Steven is mesmerized.  We slowly PUSH IN on his face...  
           Eyes open in silent wonder.  The face of a child watching in 
           awe.  A face we’ll see in many of his films in years to come. 

           LIVE SOUND comes back up as the speech draws to an end.

                                 SHAW
                        So, eleven hundred men went in the 
                        water, three hundred sixteen men 
                        come out and the sharks took the 
                        rest, June the 29th, 1945... 
                        Anyway, we delivered the bomb.  

           Silence.  All eyes turn to Steven.  Waiting.  Until finally...

                                 STEVEN
                        Cut.

           The crew ERUPTS in applause.  Cheering.  Shaking hands.  
           Zanuck and Brown high five.  Six Pack gives a huge whoop.

           Back at the table, Dreyfuss grabs Shaw by the shoulder.  A 
           new respect on his face... And one hell of a delighted grin.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Smile, you son of a bitch.  I think 
                        you might have just saved our ass.

           As the crew celebrates, Steven grabs Six Pack.  Dead serious.

                                 STEVEN
                        Listen... I need you to get the 
                        crew together at Shark City.  Now. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JAWS PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY

           Zanuck and Brown head to the production office, on their 
           way back from the set.  As they arrive, they find... Oh shit.

           Sid Sheinberg waits on the steps.  Bill Gilmore beside him.  
           And a third party we didn’t expect to see... Peter Benchley. 

           But it gets worse.  BLACK DRESS SHOES exit the office as...

           LEW WASSERMAN joins the somber looking crew.  The boss man 
           may as well be wearing a black hood and carrying an ax. 

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Where’s the kid?
                                 ZANUCK
                        Shark City.  Talking to the crew.
                             (beat)
                        Sid.  We had a breakthrough.  
                        Robert Shaw just gave a speech...

                                 SHEINBERG
                        I don’t care if he gave the 
                        Gettysburg Address.  We’ve got a 
                        broken shark.  Wasted footage.  
                        Gentlemen, there’s nothing left.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, but the Mayor of Shark 
                        City’s not in charge here anymore.

           He nods for Zanuck to lead the way.  Sheinberg and Wasserman 
           right behind him.  Benchley starts to follow after them...

           But Brown stops him with a biting tone.  No more Mr. Nice Guy.

                                 BROWN
                        Where do you think you’re going? 

                                 BENCHLEY
                        David... I thought we were friends.

                                 BROWN
                        We stopped being friends the moment 
                        you raked my director across the 
                        coals just to satisfy your own 
                        bloated ego.  Now I don’t care who 
                        your father was or where you went 
                        to school.  You have a problem with 
                        my director, then you have a 
                        problem with me.  And I have no 
                        time for your petty insecurities.
                             (to someone off screen)
                        Mr. Benchley was just leaving...

           Brown trails after the others.  Benchley starts to follow, 
           protesting... As a crowd of hard-ass TEAMSTERS blocks him.

                                 TEAMSTER
                        We’ll call you a cab.

           INT. SHARK CITY BOAT HOUSE -- DAY

           The entire cast and crew have gathered among the hanging 
           model sharks.  Nobody knows what’s going on... Until Steven 
           joins them.  His eyes pass around the room to all of them. 

                                 STEVEN
                        This hasn’t been an easy road.  You 
                        can blame yourselves.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        You can blame the studio.  But the 
                        only person you should blame is 
                        sitting right in front of you.  I 
                        came here to make a movie.  I chose 
                        that above all else.  Friends, 
                        colleagues, myself... Everything.

           Nobody in the room expected this.  Everyone just stares.

                                 STEVEN
                        And for that, I am sorry.

           Sheinberg and Wasserman arrive, appearing in the doorway 
           behind him.  Steven’s got his back to the door.  Unaware.

           He’s getting choked up.  Fights it.  Pushing through it.

                                 STEVEN
                        I know you’re tired.  You miss your 
                        family, your friends, your old 
                        lives.  You want to hop the next 
                        plane out.  And if this was 
                        yesterday, I’d be strapping in 
                        right beside you.  But not today...

           A new tone in his voice.  No more feeling sorry for himself.

                                 STEVEN
                        What I saw on set this afternoon 
                        made me a believer.  There’s 
                        something here worth fighting for.  
                        You want to go home, I will never 
                        hold it against you.  But I came 
                        here to make a movie.  And what I’ve 
                        finally realized is that so did all 
                        of you.  Somewhere along the way, I 
                        forgot why I was doing this.  But 
                        now I know.  I know that sink or 
                        swim, this thing has got to be 
                        finished.  I owe that to all of you.

           Moving around the room, we see the same look on the faces of 
           the actors and crew that we saw on Steven during the 
           Indianapolis scene.  That same childlike sense of wonder.

           Sheinberg looks over at Wasserman, who is himself watching 
           all this with a very intense stare.  Not sure what it means.

                                 STEVEN
                        Right now, it looks like I may 
                        never get the chance to make 
                        another movie as long as I live.  
                        So I need to make goddamn sure I 
                        give them one they’ll never forget.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                        And I am begging you for your help.
                             (lowers his head, then...)
                        That’s all.

           He can’t watch, expecting a mass exodus.  But nobody moves.  
           So quiet, it’s disturbing.  Until someone starts SINGING...

                                 SHAW
                        Show me the way to go home... 
                        I’m tired and I wanna go to bed...

           Dreyfuss joins in... Then Scheider... Then everyone else...

                                 CAST & CREW
                        I had a little drink about an hour 
                        ago, and it’s gone right to my head.

           Steven joins in as the song rises in volume.  This isn’t the 
           mournful dirge we heard before.  This is a song of rebirth.

           And that’s when Steven turns around to see... Wasserman.

           Steven isn’t smiling anymore.  He stops singing.  A long, 
           tense beat hangs... Until Rick Fields sprints into the room.

                                 RICK
                        We just got the Bruce footage back!

           INT. KELLEY HOUSE / VERNA’S SUITE -- DAY

           Verna feeds footage into the KEM.  Steven and his usual gang 
           gather around.  Wasserman and Sheinberg hovering behind them.

           The first bit of FOOTAGE appears on screen...  
           Scheider at the stern of the Orca.  Chumming the water.

                                 SCHEIDER
                             (on screen)
                        Slow ahead.  I can go slow ahead.  
                        Come on down and chum some of this 
                        shit.

           BOOM!  BRUCE leaps from the water.  JAWS open wide.

           Everyone JUMPS BACK about two feet with a GASP.  Holy shit.  
           This thing looks more terrifying than anybody ever imagined.

           A long beat.  Finally broken by a stunned Bill Gilmore:

                                 GILMORE
                        We’re gonna need a bigger budget.

           Without a word, the boss man Wasserman silently exits.
           EXT. EDGARTOWN HARBOR -- DAY

           Wasserman heads back toward the ferry, Sheinberg following.

                                 SHEINBERG
                        Lew?

           Wasserman stops.  Looks Sheinberg dead in the eye.  For the 
           first time in our picture, Wasserman SPEAKS.  With authority.

                                 WASSERMAN
                        Do you know how to make this 
                        picture any better than they do?

           Sheinberg just shakes his head: no.

                                 WASSERMAN
                        Then we let them keep going.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INSIDE A 35MM CAMERA --

           CLOSE ON: THE FILM GATE as fingers thread film inside.

           PRODUCTION WRAP MONTAGE --

           The film runs at high speed, looking like it’s filtered 
           through a SUPER 8 lens with film perforations on the sides.

           Every so often, frames JUMP, slipping from the gate as... 

           ON THE ORCA -- Mattey and Alves motion to BRUCE in the water.  
           Steven shakes his head.  Off their looks, he reaches down...

           And pats the YELLOW BARREL that he’s been sitting on.

           ON THE OCEAN -- Steven directs and Butler films as YELLOW 
           BARRELS are TUGGED across the ocean by something below.     

           SUPER 8 EFFECT as the film SLIPS from the gate.  In between 
           the skipping frames, Steven changes before our very eyes into 
           YOUNG STEVEN, wearing the DARK GLASSES.  Directing his movie.  

           PRODUCTION OFFICE -- Young Steven moves another “living” 
           piece of the production board over to the “completed” side.

           ON THE OCEAN -- Calm and glassy beside the Orca as Young 
           Steven directs the SPECIAL F/X CREW.  He calls “action” as... 

           YELLOW BARRELS pop from below.  Young Steven gives thumbs up.

           SUPER 8 EFFECT.  The film slips again, catching a flicker of 
           FULL GROWN STEVEN, giving thumbs up in the skipping frames.
           PRODUCTION OFFICE -- Zanuck and Brown help Young Steven 
           move more “living” production slats to the “completed” side.

           ON THE OCEAN -- The unseen shark drags THREE YELLOW BARRELS.   
           Young Steven signals to Alves, who hits a few switches and...

           The barrels SLIDE under the Orca.  Tugged by the great white.

           Young Steven clenches a fist in victory as Dreyfuss, 
           Scheider, and Shaw high five with the crew.  Loving it. 

           JUMP CUT TO -- The JAWS SLATE SNAPS numerous times.  Young 
           Steven directing shot after shot as he brings it all home...

           SNAP!  Scheider clings to the mast as the Orca sinks.
           SNAP!  Shaw smokes as he kicks back in Bruce’s open jaws.
           SNAP!  Scheider and Dreyfuss swim to shore on the barrels.

           KELLEY HOUSE LOBBY -- A fantastic BUFFET spread laid out.

           Young Steven hands Scheider a big piece of CAKE.  Scheider 
           SHOVES it back in the boy’s face.  The young man returns fire.

           And the lobby quickly explodes into a full-bore FOOD FIGHT.

           OUTSIDE SHAW’S COTTAGE -- Shaw passes us, walking back 
           up the road toward his cottage.  Hat literally in his hand.

           We watch through the window as his CHILDREN light up as he 
           comes home.  Even Mary relents... After all, she loves him.

           PRODUCTION OFFICE --  Young Steven takes another piece off 
           the board.  Marks it complete.  ONE DAY of shooting left.

           SUPER 8 EFFECT.  The film jumps a few frames revealing... 
           FULL GROWN STEVEN staring at the last piece of the board. 

           Suddenly, the FILM BREAKS.  Warping our view.  
           The projector SLOW DOWNS as we END MONTAGE and...

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. CABIN -- NIGHT

           Steven latches up his packed suitcase.  Ready to go home. 

           Finished, he looks out the window, into the back yard...  
           Rick plays on the grass with the dogs.  Steven smiles at them.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN -- DAY

           Six Pack drives a POWER BOAT.  Beside him stands Steven, clad 
           in an ill-fitting BLUE SUEDE SUIT and WHITE CAPTAIN’S HAT.
                                 SIX PACK
                        Fancy digs or not, the crew’s still 
                        gonna dunk you in the drink today.

                                 STEVEN
                        Just have this boat standing by.

           ON THE LOCATION -- BRUCE sits atop a half-sunken Orca rig.  
           F/X CREW stuff him full of DYNAMITE and clumps of CALAMARI.

           CAMERA BOAT -- Steven checks the camera placement.  He spots 
           CREW MEMBERS whispering.  Nodding to him, then to the water. 

                                 ALVES
                        Waiting for your signal, boss.

           Steven nods.  Shakes hands with Alves.  There’s a look 
           between them that needs no words.  A couple of old soldiers.

                                 STEVEN
                        See you on the lot.

                                 ALVES
                        Not if I see you first.

           On Steven’s subtle signal, Six Pack pulls up.  Steven takes 
           one last look at the set... His crew... Then boards the boat.  
           He tosses his captain’s hat to Alves, who dons it with pride.

           A nod to Six Pack, then the boat speeds away.  As they go...

                                 STEVEN
                        I SHALL NOT RETURN!

           Steven waves to the crew as the boat speeds into the distance.

           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD AIRPORT -- DAY

           Steven meets Dreyfuss on the tarmac in front of a twin prop.

           INT. COMMUTER PLANE -- DAY

           Steven looks out the window as the plane takes off.  
           Dreyfuss, happy to be leaving, can’t help but shout:

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Motherfucker!  

           Steven notes his buddy’s choice of language drawing looks 
           from some the more dignified Martha’s Vineyard passengers.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        Say it with me!  It feels good! 
           EXT. SKIES OVER MARTHA’S VINEYARD -- DAY

           The plane swings over the Atlantic.  Heading up the coast.

                                 STEVEN & DREYFUSS (O.S.)
                        MO-THERRRRRR FUCK-ERRRRRRR!

           As the plane passes over, we TILT DOWN toward the ocean.  
           The tiny Orca crew still at sea.  Silence.  Then...

           BOOM!  A small RED EXPLOSION.  Bruce is no more.  TITLE:

                              100 DAYS OVER SCHEDULE

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Steven enters.  Kicks aside the mail.  Drops on the couch.  
           The house is silent.  No barking dogs.  No traffic outside... 

           And of course, Vicki is now long gone.

           A FRAMED PHOTO lies face down on a table.  Steven lifts it.  
           The photo of he and Vicki from before.  Glass now CRACKED. 

           The SILENCE overwhelms him.  He’s trembling.  A full-on PANIC 
           ATTACK hits.  He shakes so bad, the actual FRAME shudders.

           The film JUMPS.  Skipping frames.  The trembling intensifies, 
           like an earthquake.  Steven fighting for control.  Until... 

           The FILM MELTS.  The PROJECTOR LAMP blinds us as we...

                                                         MELT TO WHITE.

           EDITING BENCH -- A GUILLOTINE CHOPS off a few frames.

                                 VERNA (O.S.)
                        There.  Let’s get rid of that one.  
                        That doesn’t work for the ending.

           INT. POOL HOUSE -- THAT MOMENT

           A cluttered bungalow turned editing suite.  Verna Fields 
           makes the cut.  Young Steven (7) watching over her shoulder.

                                 VERNA 
                        Keep it flush, edge to edge... 

           The boy lines up the film.  Pulls tape across the strip.  

                                 VERNA
                        Great job.  Let’s see how it looks.
           She runs film through an old Moviola.  Turns the crank.

           ON THE MOVIOLA -- The film runs at high speed.  PERFORATIONS 
           border the frame.  Everything filtered through the SUPER 8.   

           POST PRODUCTION MONTAGE --

           IN THE POOL HOUSE -- Verna and ADULT STEVEN cut the picture.  
           Behind them, Rick teaches Elmer and Zalman a few new tricks.

           AT THE STUDIO -- Zanuck, Brown, and Steven stand in front of 
           an easel.  Zanuck proudly yanks the cover away to REVEAL... 

           The finished JAWS POSTER.  The same one we know so well.  

           OUTSIDE THE POOL HOUSE -- Night time.  Steven wades in the 
           pool with the camera box as Butler pours in gallons of milk.

           Moments later, Joe Alves arrives, carrying... A SEVERED HEAD.

           IN THE POOL HOUSE -- Verna and Steven watch the Moviola as  
           Ben Gardner’s severed head appears through a hole in a boat.  
           Both of them JUMP at the scare... Then share an ecstatic hug.

           Our background music comes to a jarring STOP, changing to...  
           A FAMILIAR TWO NOTE STACCATO... DUMMMM-DUM.

           ON A SCORING STAGE -- Composer JOHN WILLIAMS conducts the 
           ORCHESTRA playing the terrifying TWO-NOTE JAWS THEME as...

           THE SOUND BOOTH -- Young Steven, wearing dark glasses and 
           HUGE HEADPHONES, signals the composer with a thumbs up.

           SUPER 8 EFFECT to FULL GROWN STEVEN giving the thumbs up. 

           And as quickly as we heard the TWO NOTES of the Jaws score, 
           the music jumps back into our original score once again as...

           IN THE POOL HOUSE -- Verna and Steven hoist a couple SIX 
           THOUSAND FOOT reels of film as they ready a work print.

           AT THE PHOTO LAB -- Prints are struck.  Reels packed away.

           AT THE STUDIO -- Steven walks into the BLACK TOWER.  Two 
           LOCKED FILM CANNISTERS in each hand.  Marching them into...

           SHEINBERG’S OFFICE -- Sheinberg sits at his desk with 
           Gilmore.  Steven sets the cannisters down.  Labels read:

                                   UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

                                        “JAWS”
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD -- NIGHT

           Spotlights.  Red carpet.  Street abuzz as a line of cars 
           arrive at GRAUMAN’S CHINESE.  The marquee proclaims this:  

                                    “JAWS” PREMIERE

           INT. LIMOUSINE -- THAT MOMENT

           Steven sits alone in the back.  Stares out at the massive 
           CROWDS in front of the theater... But something’s wrong.  

           Every FACE turns toward him... All of them LAUGHING at him.

           Steven adjusts his collar.  Getting hotter in here.  
           He fumbles for the air conditioner switch.  Flips it...

           And WATER pours out.  A DELUGE that starts to fill the limo.

           The DRIVER turns, facing him through the open partition... 
           And it’s PETER BENCHLEY.  Smiling, he ROLLS UP the partition.

           Steven tries the doors.  Locked.  The limo now half full with 
           water.  Panic time.  He looks back at the LAUGHING REPORTERS.

           All of them are Peter Benchley. 

           Steven kicks the window.  SHATTERS it.  But to his horror... 
           WATER spills in from outside.  Steven gasping, overwhelmed...

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. STEVEN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Steven jolts awake.  Alone on his WATERBED.  Once he’s back 
           to reality, he gets up... And LIFTS the sloshing mattress.

           EXT. STEVEN’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Steven SLICES the mattress open with a knife.  WATER pours out 
           onto the lawn.  He leaves the draining mattress in the dirt.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER -- NIGHT

           A grand old movie palace.  Greek revival meets art deco. 
           People massed in blue seats.  This time, it’s all real.   

           We recognize faces in the crowd... Scheider... Dreyfuss... 
           Brown... Schmoozing in a decidedly about-town manner.  TITLE:

                               CAST & VIP PRESS SCREENING
                      RIVOLI THEATER - NEW YORK CITY - JUNE 17, 1975
           Steven watches from a closed balcony box.  Zanuck waiting in 
           the wings.  Watching with concern as Steven chews his nails.  

                                 ZANUCK
                        Relax.   

           But it only gets worse as Steven sees... Peter Benchley.  
           REPORTERS trail him as he escorts his wife WENDY inside.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Off the record, we didn’t make this 
                        for him.  Who cares what he thinks?

                                 STEVEN
                        I do.

           Steven looks down from the balcony.  HOLD on him as lights  
           go down.  He’s bathed in BLUE LIGHT by the UNIVERSAL LOGO.  

           The movie has begun... But Steven’s eyes are on Benchley.

           The movie continues to play out in a series of DISSOLVES as 
           we witness, along with the audience, key moments from Jaws...

           BIG SCREEN: Chrissie gets violently dragged underwater.

           Everyone in the crowd squirms.  Gasps.  Screams.  Benchley 
           remains stoic.  Steven’s eyes fixed on him from high above.

           BIG SCREEN: The shark attacks Alex Kintner.  Blood gushes.

           Another round of screams from the crowd... But not Benchley.  

           One MOVIEGOER jumps up from his seat.  Hand over his mouth.  
           He’s running up the aisle toward the back.  Uh-oh.  Not good.

           IN THE LOBBY -- Zanuck arrives just in time to see the guy 
           PUKE on the floor.  But then, something unusual happens...

           The sick moviegoer takes a deep breath.  Wipes his mouth... 
           Then heads BACK INTO THE THEATER to keep watching the movie.

           BACK IN THE BALCONY -- Zanuck returns to find Steven right 
           where he left him.  A statue.  Eyes still locked on Benchley.

                                 ZANUCK
                        I’m no expert, but when a guy pukes 
                        his guts up and still wants to 
                        watch your picture, I think you 
                        sure as hell did something right.

           In a final SERIES OF DISSOLVES, we see more key scenes...
           The shark attacks Hooper in the cage... Quint stabs the beast 
           as he’s eaten alive... Moments that elicit gasps of terror...

           Until finally, Scheider blasts the SCUBA TANK in the 
           creature’s mouth and blows the bastard to smithereens.

           The entire auditorium ERUPTS in applause... Save one man.

           INT. THEATER LOBBY -- LATER

           A madhouse as the crowd spills out.  Dreyfuss greets Zanuck.  
           Ecstatic.  Overwhelmed with joy for the movie he once hated.

                                 DREYFUSS
                        The son of a bitch did it!

                                 ZANUCK
                        The son of a bitch is still inside. 

           INT. THEATER -- THAT MOMENT

           The theater is empty but for two people... 
           One in the balcony, one below.  Author and director.  

           CLOSE ON: BENCHLEY.  Staring at the blank screen.  Silent as 
           the grave.  And a moment later, Steven sits down next to him.   

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Mr. Director.

                                 STEVEN
                        Before you say anything, I...
                             (beat)
                        I never wanted to admit I was in 
                        over my head.  Sometimes it’s 
                        easier to just pretend you know 
                        what you’re doing.  That’s been my 
                        failure as a filmmaker.  Fuck, as a 
                        human being.  This thing... just 
                        got caught in the hurricane.  If  
                        it didn’t survive, it’s because    
                        I dragged it down.  Not you, not 
                        anybody else.  If it’s a hit, well 
                        then... I guess we just got lucky. 

           A silent beat.  Then...

                                 BENCHLEY
                        I tried to tell myself that I 
                        wasn’t even going to show up.  That 
                        I didn’t care how this came out.  
                        My book still lives and breathes 
                        without it, so why would it matter?
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BENCHLEY (CONT'D)
                        But my innate curiosity got the 
                        better of me.  So I’m here.  And...

           He hesitates.  Steven waits for the hammer to drop.

                                 BENCHLEY
                        It’s good, Steven.  My God, it’s 
                        really good.  It’s not my book, but  
                        it was never going to be.  My 
                        mistake was not seeing that as a 
                        true benefit.  An imagination like 
                        yours is exactly what this needed.  
                        Luck... Luck is just a cheap 
                        substitute for talent.  You never 
                        needed it.  There was no divine 
                        intervention at work here.  You made 
                        this happen.  You stamped your  
                        blood and sweat onto every frame  
                        and willed it to life.  As long as 
                        you live, they can’t take that away.  

           Stunned by emotion, all Steven can do is nod. 

                                 BENCHLEY
                        My father would have said you never 
                        could have done this without me...
                             (beat)
                        I say... I’m sorry I ever doubted you.

           Benchley shakes Steven’s hand with a genuine smile.  

                                 BENCHLEY
                        Congratulations, my friend.

                                 STEVEN
                        Thank you, Peter.  Thank you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- DAY

           A beautiful summer morning in Southern California.  Steven 
           waves to a security guard as he drives onto the lot.  TITLE:

                                 JUNE 20, 1975
                                    OPENING DAY

           EXT. STUDIO COMMISSARY -- DAY

           Steven walks across the lot, passing by the commissary... 

           Slowing as he notices VICKI sitting outside.  Head buried in 
           a script.  She doesn’t notice him... But he sure notices her.
           He keeps his distance.  Thinking about what he wants to say 
           to her.  A beat... Then he starts walking in her direction.

           That’s when a HANDSOME MAN (30s) walks up from behind her. 
           Places his hands over her eyes.  Peek-a-boo.  She giggles 
           like a little girl.  Jumps up from her chair to embrace him.

           Still watching, Steven can’t help but smile as she walks away 
           with this guy.  Hand-in-hand.  Happy to be alive and in love.  

           No reconciliation for them, but he knows they’ll both be okay.

                                 ALVES (O.S.)
                        Steve!

           He looks up to see Alves, Gottlieb, and Rick Fields exiting 
           the commissary.  Gottlieb still eating.  Big grins all around.

                                 ALVES
                        We’re catching a one o’clock in 
                        North Hollywood.  You coming with?

                                 STEVEN
                        Nah, it’s okay.  You guys go ahead.

                                 GOTTLIEB
                        Don’t you wanna know if it’s a hit?

           Steven just smiles.  Hit or not, he’s happy with his life.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STEVEN’S CAR -- DAY

           Steven drives down Sunset Boulevard.  A perfect sunny day 
           until... TRAFFIC JAM.  He turns onto a side street.  Parks. 

           EXT. DRUG STORE -- DAY

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, we watch as Steven pays for a small pile 
           of groceries, then walks outside into the bright sunshine...

           And as he does, a couple of hyper 11-YEAR-OLDS come running 
           out of the store behind him.  Almost knocking him on his ass.

                                 KID #1 
                        Come on, shark’s gonna start again! 

           That grabs Steven’s attention.  He watches them run down the 
           block.  Following a LINE of people standing on the sidewalk.

           Confused, Steven marches along the line.  Takes a turn onto...
           EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- THAT MOMENT

           The grocery bag DROPS next to Steven’s feet as he sees...  

           THE LINE continues all the way down Sunset.  And it doesn’t 
           end until it hits the box office of the legendary PACIFIC 
           CINERAMA DOME.  A single red word dominating the marquee: 

                                       “JAWS”

           INT. THEATER LOBBY -- DAY

           Steven enters.  Overwhelmed by the massive crowds.  People 
           chatting excitedly as they move in and out of the theater.  

           Moments later, Steven picks a familiar face out of the mob... 
           ZANUCK.  Stunned by the turnout, Zanuck hands Steven a ticket.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Here, I bought one for every show.
                             (looking around)
                        You believe this shit?  Last 
                        screening, people were yelling at 
                        the goddamn picture.  Credits roll, 
                        every one of ‘em got back in line.

                                 STEVEN
                        I can’t even... How did we do this?

                                 ZANUCK
                        You did this.  You showed ‘em all 
                        just how big one guy can dream.  I 
                        don’t know, kid, but I think we may 
                        have just kicked open a new door.

           Tons of people flow around Steven, but it’s like he’s not 
           even there.  Still just an unknown face in the huge crowd.

                                 ZANUCK
                        One thing’s for sure, though...  
                        You’re never gonna be the same.

           Steven sees the huge Jaws poster hanging on the far wall.  

           He looks at his name inscribed at the bottom.  His entire
           name.  He’s not just “Steven” anymore.  He has now become...   

                                 STEVEN SPIELBERG
                        I don’t feel any different.

           Zanuck pats him on the shoulder: you’ll see, kid.

           Steven looks down at his movie ticket.  Heads toward 
           the theater.  And just before he walks inside, he hears...
                                 BOY (O.S.)
                        Is it going to be scary?

           Behind him, a frightened BOY (7) is debating whether to go  
           in and see the movie.  His FATHER kneels.  Comforting him.

                                 FATHER
                        You’re going to love it.  I promise. 

           Steven smiles to himself.  Cherishing an old memory.
           He walks toward the theater doors.  Pushes them open...

           LIGHT from inside shines out, turning him into a SILHOUETTE. 
           A SHADOW in the doorway.  Just like he was back in 
           Philadelphia in 1952.  Only now, he’s not a boy.  He’s a man.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           SUPER OVER BLACK:

           BY THE END OF SUMMER 1975, JAWS HAD BECOME THE FIRST MOTION 
           PICTURE TO MAKE MORE THAN $100 MILLION AT THE U.S. BOX OFFICE.

           TIDAL WAVES OF MOVIEGOERS FLOODED THEATERS AS JAWS SMASHED 
           EVERY BOX OFFICE RECORD IMAGINABLE, USHERING IN A NEW ERA OF 
           HOLLYWOOD BY CREATING THE VERY FIRST SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER.

           FOR ITS TIME, JAWS WAS TRULY THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.
