           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

           A long, empty, hospital corridor lined with abandoned 
           gurneys.  

                                 WILLIS (O.S.)
                        So my wife and I separated. She 
                        says she’s not seeing anyone, but 
                        I’m not so sure about that. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - SUNBEAM WARD - DAY

           A faded sign - painted by children long ago - welcomes 
           visitors to SUNBEAM WARD 

                                 WILLIS (O.S.)
                        And my kids hate me. You’re going 
                        to tell me to be kinder to myself.  
                        That they don’t hate me, not 
                        really, not deep down. But they do. 
                        And if it comes down to it, 
                        sometimes I don’t like them so much 
                        either.  

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - PLAYROOM - DAY

           A decapitated teddy bear in an empty playroom.

           A flickering television connected to a broken games console. 

                                 WILLIS (O.S.) 
                        My work no longer fulfills me. I 
                        can hardly even remember a time 
                        when it did. And if any of that 
                        stuff we tell people about 
                        recommended daily amounts is even 
                        slightly true, then I drink way too 
                        much caffeine. And also alcohol. 
                        And I haven’t exercised since 
                        Christmas. Christmas 2008. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A waiting room full of extremely bored looking PARENTS and 
           CHILDREN.  

                                 WILLIS (O.S.)
                        But Clive - look, you call me Jeff, 
                        okay? Do you want to know what the 
                        real problem is, Clive?
           INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY

           Close on DR JEFF WILLIS, sitting in a chair in a consulting 
           room.  

           He is in his late forties or early fifties.

           His tie - emblazoned with images of the cartoon character 
           Goofy - is loosened. He looks tired and a little dishevelled.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        I just don’t enjoy anything any 
                        more. I mean, I get up in the 
                        morning and I work, and I go home 
                        in the evening and it is just all 
                        the same. Every single day. Nothing 
                        ever changes, and nothing I do 
                        makes a difference. I’m in a rut. 
                        Stuck in a rut. It’s like I’m the 
                        traffic on the Fremont bridge, you 
                        know? I just go back and forth, 
                        back and forth every day. And all 
                        that is going to happen is that I’m 
                        going to keep on going endlessly 
                        back and forth until one day far in 
                        the future the bridge collapses and 
                        we all plunge into that great 
                        terrible dark and bottomless abyss 
                        of death. 
                            (Beat.)
                        Why are you looking at me like 
                        that?  

           We now pull back and see who is sitting across the table from 
           Willis: a puzzled eight year old boy, CLIVE. 

                                 CLIVE 
                        I think I’m here about my asthma.

                                 WILLIS
                        See, this is another problem I 
                        have, Clive. I try to find a little 
                        empathy - not even sympathy, just 
                        empathy - and everybody that comes 
                        in here only ever wants to talk to 
                        me about their own problems. It’s 
                        like I’m just not supposed to have 
                        any feelings at all. Which is 
                        ironic because, as I’ve been 
                        telling you, part of the problem is 
                        that I no longer actually have 
                        feelings. 

           Clive looks blank.
                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s like I’m just supposed to be 
                        the guy who prescribes inhalers for 
                        everyone else. But nobody ever 
                        thinks about me. Nobody ever says, 
                        Doctor Jeff, do you sometimes feel 
                        like you might need an inhaler 
                        yourself?    

                                 CLIVE
                        You can borrow mine if you want.  

                                 WILLIS
                        I don’t need an actual inhaler, 
                        Clive. It’s a metaphor. I need a 
                        metaphorical inhaler.

                                 CLIVE
                        What’s a metamorphical inhaler? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Metaphorical. I don’t know. It’s 
                        being in love with a beautiful 
                        woman and knowing that she loves 
                        you back. Or driving out to Cannon 
                        Beach on a sunny day when I was 
                        seventeen. Or a piece of music that 
                        makes you want to smash shit up. Or 
                        even just being so sad that you 
                        can’t stop crying. It’s just 
                        feeling something. Do you know what 
                        it is to feel something, Clive? To 
                        really and truly feel something?  

                                 CLIVE
                        One time I broke my arm. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, this is going nowhere. Take 
                        two puffs of this twice a day, and 
                        come back and see me in a month. 
                        Next time, try and bring some 
                        empathy with you, okay? 

                                 CLIVE
                        What is empathy? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Exactly. That is exactly what I am 
                        talking about.  

           TITLES - ‘FRISCO’

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           A garage in near darkness. 
           In the background are bicycles, a kayak, a freezer, the usual 
           detritus of family life.   

           In the foreground, Willis snores on a camp bed. 

           A clock turns to 07:30 and an ALARM starts beeping. 

           Willis’ hand emerges from beneath the covers and knocks the 
           clock to the ground.  

           The alarm continues to sound. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY

           A sunny day in a pleasant suburb. It is Portland, Oregon, but 
           it could be anywhere.  

           A garage door opens and a bleary-eyed Willis emerges. 

           He is dressed in striped pyjamas.

           Two cars are parked in Willis’ driveway: a shiny new Lexus 
           and a beaten-up ancient Volare.  

           Beside the Lexus, two girls, ALEXIS (15) and BLAKE (16), 
           dressed in private school uniforms, are waiting.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Good morning, daughters.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Jesus Christ, dad. Put some clothes 
                        on.

                                 BLAKE
                        You look like a goddamn hobo.  

           SUSIE (late 40s), wearing a smart suit but late already, 
           bustles out of the house towards the Lexus.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Good morning, wife. 

                                 SUSIE 
                        We’re separated, Jeff.  

                                 WILLIS
                        But not divorced. Hence, wife. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I need to talk to you today.

                                 WILLIS
                        If you’d care to step into my 
                        office? 

           Willis motions to the garage. 
                                 SUSIE
                        I’ll see you at work. 

           Susie and the girls get in the car and drive off.  Willis 
           waves at them.

                                 WILLIS
                        Not if I see you first.  

           Across the street, BILL DRAKE - a man about the same age as 
           Willis, dressed in Operating Room scrubs - and his SONS are 
           getting into their car, a polished Jeep Cherokee. 

                                 BILL DRAKE
                        Good morning, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Good morning, Bill.  

           INT. WILLIS’ CAR - FREMONT BRIDGE - DAY

           Willis sits in his beaten-up Volare in heavy traffic on the 
           Fremont bridge. He is dressed for work in his Goofy tie.  

           He looks across at a billboard.

           It displays a large advert for ‘PORTLAND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL: 
           WHERE FAMILY COMES FIRST’.

           These words are accompanied by a PICTURE of a perfect family, 
           a husband and wife and their two daughters. 

           We recognise the female models as Susie, Alexis and Blake, 
           but the man where Willis should be - slim, tanned, smiling, 
           perfect teeth - is obviously an ACTOR.

           Willis takes a sip from a metallic insulated coffee mug. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - CANTEEN - DAY

           Willis refills his insulated coffee mug from a dispenser.   

           He is still sleepy and it overflows. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY

           Willis conducts his ward round. He is accompanied by a 
           resident, LUCIA CHEN. 

           Chen, wheeling a trolley of case notes, is bright-eyed and 
           keen. Willis is still half-asleep, bleary eyed and sipping 
           from his insulated coffee mug. 

           They approach the bed of a nine year old black kid, CHARLIE.
           Charlie is hooked up to an IV.  

                                 CHEN
                        Charles presented last night. 
                        Temperature 103.2, CBC showed a 
                        polymorphic leucocytosis, 
                        haematocrit-

                                 WILLIS
                        Just give me the Cliff Notes, would 
                        you? It’s too early in the morning 
                        for science.  

                                 CHEN
                        He was having a crisis. 

                                 WILLIS
                        A crisis? What’s the big idea, 
                        Charlie? You got fired? You crashed 
                        the car? Your wife left you? How 
                        are you even old enough to know 
                        what a crisis is?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s my sickle cell. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh, that kind of crisis. I thought 
                        Dr Chen meant, you know, the other 
                        kind. 

           Willis points at the IV. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Is this working out for you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, don’t let anyone steal it. 
                        And next time I don’t want to hear 
                        any more bleeding heart stories 
                        about the bank foreclosing on you 
                        or your dog getting run over, okay? 

           Charlie smiles, gets that this is a joke though Chen does 
           not. 

           As they move on to the next patient, they become aware of 
           SHOUTING coming from a side room. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Who is that? 

                                 CHEN 
                        Amy Morrison. Fifteen year old with 
                        an astroglioma. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHEN  (CONT'D)
                        She just transferred back from 
                        regional oncology. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Did they cure her? 

                                 CHEN
                        No.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Why didn’t she go to the Hospice? 

                                 CHEN
                        They had issues with her there 
                        previously. 

                                 WILLIS
                        So why can’t she go home?

           The door to the side room is flung open. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        I hate you! You’re an asinine bitch 
                        and I wish that you were dead! 

           A well-dressed woman - ANNE MORRISON (late 40s) - emerges in 
           tears and hurries down the ward. 

                                 CHEN
                        Yeah. There were issues there too.  

           Several PATIENTS and PARENTS are now staring expectantly at 
           Willis.  

           He sighs. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Wait here. 

           INT. AMY’S ROOM - CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY

           Willis enters the hospital room of AMY MORRISON, 15. 

           The door to the ensuite bathroom is open. Amy is vomiting 
           into the toilet. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Is this a bad time?

           Amy flushes the toilet, wipes the vomit from her mouth. We 
           see now that she has dyed black hair and copious mascara.   

                                 AMY
                        Who are you?  
                                 WILLIS
                        I’m Doctor Jeff. One of the 
                        doctors.                                                                                                          

                                 AMY
                        I’ve never seen you before. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I fly under the radar. Kind of like 
                        a superhero in that regard. 

                                 AMY
                        Or a pedophile. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You have to admit being a 
                        children’s doctor would be a pretty 
                        good cover. 

                                 AMY
                        What do you want, Jeff?

                                 WILLIS
                        I heard the yelling. 

                                 AMY
                        And?

                                 WILLIS
                        People were looking at me. I felt 
                        obliged to come in here and, you 
                        know, pretend to do something. 

           Amy visibly softens at this: at least Willis is honest.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Also your mom seemed upset. 

                                 AMY
                        My mom’s dead.

                                 WILLIS
                        So who was that woman?  

                                 AMY
                        That would be Anne.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Anne Frank? Anne of Cleves? Anne of 
                        Greengables?

                                 AMY
                        She used to be my stepmother, but 
                        my dad’s dead too now. So she’s 
                        really just the woman that is going 
                        to inherit my trust fund. 
                                 WILLIS
                        You have a lot of death in your 
                        family. 

                                 AMY
                        Tell me about. I’m dying too.

                                 WILLIS
                        We’re all dying, Amy. Some of us 
                        are just doing it a little faster 
                        than others.   

           Willis notices a book on the bedside table and picks it up. 
           It is a battered paperback copy of ‘On the Road’

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        You like Kerouac?

                                 AMY
                        Have you heard of him?

                                 WILLIS
                        When I read this book I made a vow 
                        I was going to drive across 
                        America. Just get in the car and 
                        go. See what happened along the 
                        way. Find the pearl.   

                                 AMY
                        And did you?

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, no.

                                 AMY
                        Why not? 

                                 WILLIS 
                        I went to college. I was pre-med. I 
                        had to earn money. I got married. I 
                        had kids. Life got in the way.

                                 AMY
                        How depressingly square. Could you 
                        leave now, Jeff?

           INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY

           Willis rejoins Chen with the notes trolley.  

           Before they even get to the next patient, a NURSE approaches 
           them. 

                                 NURSE
                        Margaret Brown is on the phone for 
                        you.
                                 WILLIS
                        Tell her I’m doing rounds. 

           The nurse goes back to the desk where the phone is. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        These administrators. They get an 
                        MBA and then they think they can 
                        just interrupt rounds. Rounds are 
                        sacred, they are holy, they are our 
                        communion. They are-

           The nurse returns.

                                 NURSE
                        She wants you to go to her office.

                                 WILLIS 
                        Did you tell her I’m doing rounds?

                                 NURSE
                        She said to tell you to come now. 

           Willis sighs and wearily trudges off.

           INT. HOSPITAL - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Willis sits across from a Hospital Manager, MARGARET BROWN.   

           Willis takes a sip from his insulated coffee mug.  

                                 MARGARET 
                        You are the best pediatrician we 
                        have on staff, Jeff. If your 
                        colleagues can’t diagnose a case, 
                        they ask you.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        If anybody ever tells them about a 
                        little thing I call ‘Google’ I’m 
                        screwed.  

                                 MARGARET
                        Was that a joke?  

                                 WILLIS
                        If you found it funny it was. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I didn’t. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Then it wasn’t a joke. 
                                 MARGARET
                        What I’m saying, Jeff, is the 
                        problem is not with your 
                        colleagues. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Then there is no problem. My 
                        patients love me.  

                                 MARGARET
                        Their parents don’t. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Who cares what their parents think? 

                                 MARGARET
                        I care, because they complain. In 
                        the last six months we have had 
                        more complaints about you than the 
                        rest of the pediatric department 
                        put together. 

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s a statistical anomaly. I’m 
                        sure it’ll average out.   

           Margaret motions at a LARGE PILE OF CASE NOTES beside her.    

                                 MARGARET
                        This is from the last fortnight 
                        alone.  

                                 WILLIS
                        What’s on the top there? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Claudia Jackson. Eight. You called 
                        her mother a moron. 

                                 WILLIS
                        The girl had a peanut allergy and 
                        they gave her peanut butter. It’s 
                        pretty moronic. In more advanced 
                        cultures it’s probably attempted 
                        murder.    

                                 MARGARET
                        You still can’t call the woman a 
                        moron. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What would you like me to call her?

                                 MARGARET
                        ‘Congresswoman’ would have been 
                        fine. 

           Willis winces. Forgot about that. 
                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Leonard Moss. Seven. Fractured his 
                        skull falling from a tree.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        I used a metaphor. It’s no big 
                        deal. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Which metaphor?

                                 WILLIS
                        Something about an omelette. I 
                        forget exactly.  

                                 MARGARET
                        ‘If you’re going to make an 
                        omelette you’re going to have to 
                        break a few eggs’? 

                                 WILLIS
                        That might have been it, yeah.  

                                 MARGARET
                        Jeff, this is a children’s 
                        hospital.  

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re kidding me. I thought I was 
                        the world’s greatest gerontologist.  

                                 MARGARET
                        We’re considering reconfiguring the 
                        service. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 MARGARET
                        The board think that if we combine 
                        allergy with general pediatrics-

                                 WILLIS
                        Come on, Margaret. I do too much 
                        general pediatrics as it is. It’s 
                        all runny noses and diarrhoea and- 

                                 MARGARET
                        You’re not hearing me Jeff. If we 
                        combined allergy with general then 
                        your job- 

                                 WILLIS
                        ‘Lead Pediatric Allergist with an 
                        interest in General Pediatrics.’ 
                                 MARGARET
                        Right. Your job wouldn’t exist 
                        anymore. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? Who would do Allergy? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Your colleagues. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Margaret, you might not have heard, 
                        but in three days I’m presenting a 
                        paper in San Francisco at the 
                        United States Congress of 
                        Allergists. 

           Willis pauses to see what effect this has. None.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        My work on the hazelnut is - look, 
                        I don’t want to boast here, but as 
                        far as the hazelnut goes, I’m one 
                        of this country’s leading 
                        authorities. 

           Margaret looks unimpressed.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Top five, definitely. 

                                 MARGARET
                        This isn’t about hazelnuts, Jeff.  
                        It’s about complaints, and the fact 
                        that you are having way too many.

                                 WILLIS
                        What are you saying?

                                 MARGARET
                        I’m saying if we have any more 
                        complaints between now and the end 
                        of the month, Portland Children’s 
                        will not be renewing your contract. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Did Susie put you up to this?

                                 MARGARET
                        Susie is the only reason we’ve let 
                        you go on for so long. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Do me a favour, would you? Don’t 
                        tell her that.  
           INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN - DAY

           A busy hospital canteen at lunchtime. 

           Willis sits eating his packed lunch alone.  

           Everybody else seems to have friends to eat with. 

           Willis is gazing at them when he sees Susie scanning the 
           crowd.

           Willis ducks his head and hides behind his hands so that she 
           does not see him. 

           Susie leaves the canteen. 

           Wilis stands up and follows her.  

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           Willis sees Susie disappear around a corner. 

           He hurries after her.

           INT. HOSPITAL - VARIOUS CORRIDORS - DAY

           Willis follows Susie through several different hospital 
           corridors. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           Wilis peers around the corner. 

           In the distance he sees Susie talking to a MALE COLLEAGUE.  

           Susie glances back down the corridor.  

           Willis ducks back behind the corner. 

           He peers around again and sees Susie walking back towards 
           him.   

           Willis looks around him and sees a cupboard. 

           He hides in the cupboard. 

           Susie comes around the corner. She glances around, surmises 
           what has happened, and tries to open the cupboard door. 

           It opens a tiny bit, but is then pulled shut from the inside. 

                                 SUSIE 
                        Jeff.

           No response. 
                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re in there, Jeff. 

           Still nothing. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Why were you following me, Jeff?

                                 WILLIS (O.C.)
                        I wasn’t. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Then why are you hiding in a 
                        cupboard on the surgery floor?

                                 WILLIS (O.C.)
                        What? I’m not hiding. 

                                 SUSIE
                        So what are you doing in there?

                                 WILLIS (O.C.)
                        I’m looking for a place for my new 
                        office. 

                                 SUSIE
                        We need to talk, Jeff. We can 
                        either do it with me out here in 
                        the corridor and you in the 
                        cupboard or we can go and get a 
                        coffee.   

           Willis emerges from the cupboard. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        I’d be glad to have coffee with 
                        you, Susie.

                                 SUSIE
                        It’s not like that. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Like what? 

                                 SUSIE
                        You make it sound like it’s a date.

                                 WILLIS
                        A man can’t go on a date with his 
                        wife now?

                                 SUSIE
                        Not when they’re separated, Jeff.  
           INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN - DAY 

           The canteen is now emptier as Willis and Susie sit drinking 
           coffee. Willis is drinking his from his insulated cup. 

                                 WILLIS
                        So is it Dalton from radiology? 

                                 SUSIE
                        What? 

                                 WILLIS
                        McQueen from Haematology. 

                                 SUSIE
                        How many times, Jeff? I’m not 
                        seeing anyone.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Tell me that it isn’t Jones from 
                        Orthopaedics. He’s an ape. They are 
                        all apes in orthopaedics. It’s like 
                        an apiary up there. 

                                 SUSIE
                        An apiary is where bees are kept. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, that’s ridiculous. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Jeff. You need to find somewhere 
                        else to live.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? I’m working on it. 

                                 SUSIE
                        You’ve been saying that for months.

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s a busy time. I have this 
                        conference coming up and-

                                 SUSIE
                        Can you tell me what exactly you 
                        have done to find somewhere else to 
                        live? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yes. I’ve looked. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Where? 

                                 WILLIS
                        On the internet. 
                                 SUSIE
                        Really? Which site?

                                 WILLIS
                        Let’s see. Mainly it was 
                        www.Iamnottheonehavinganaffair.com. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Jesus fucking Christ, Jeff! Enough! 
                        I am not having an affair! 

           They vehemence of Susie’s reply makes things a little 
           awkward.

                                 WILLIS
                        I’d better be getting back.

                                 SUSIE
                        I want a divorce. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? Why? Why would you say a 
                        thing like that?   

                                 SUSIE
                        Because I’m not in love with you 
                        and our marriage is over. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Is it Patel? It’s Patel from 
                        anesthesiology, isn’t it? 

           Susie starts to bang her head on the table. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY 

           Willis is stood disinterestedly signing some prescription 
           charts at the nurses’ station.  

           He does not even bother reading them, just scribbles his 
           signature on them as a NURSE places them in front of him.

           DR TURNER - prim, formal, fifties - emerges from Amy’s room 
           and approaches Willis. 

                                 DR TURNER 
                        Can I borrow you for a moment, 
                        Jeff? 

                                 WILLIS
                        For the price of a one-way ticket 
                        to Acapulco, you could have me. 

           INT. AMY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Willis follows Dr Turner into Amy’s room. 
           Amy rolls her eyes when she sees Willis enter. 

                                 AMY
                        Great. Because that’s definitely 
                        going to help.

                                 DR TURNER 
                        Dr Willis. Can you please explain 
                        to Amy why it is important she 
                        takes her Zinteca? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Look, Amy it’s-
                            (Shrugs.)
                        Why don’t you want to take it? 

                                 AMY 
                        Because it tastes like vomit and 
                        I’m going to die anyway. 

                                 DR TURNER 
                        Zinteca has been shown to improve 
                        survival in clinical trials. 

                                 WILLIS
                        By how long? 

                                 DR TURNER
                        The median is fourteen days, but-

                                 WILLIS 
                        Two weeks?

           Dr Turner nods. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Well, there it is. You might get an 
                        extra fortnight if you take it. But 
                        if it tastes like vomit you might 
                        not enjoy that time anyway. So I 
                        guess it’s up to you. 

           Dr Turner is staring at Willis with disbelief. 

                                 AMY 
                        Thank you.

           Willis nods at Dr Turner and leaves. 

           INT. MORTUARY - DAY

           Willis enters the mortuary. An industrial fridge takes up one 
           wall.   

           His colleague MELCHER is fixing some slides at a table.
           Overweight and in his fifties, Melcher is a cheerful but 
           owlish man. 

           Willis pulls opens a drawer of the fridge.

           It contains the CORPSE OF AN OLD WOMAN.   

           Willis frowns and closes the drawer.  

           He opens the next one. It contains a SIX PACK OF BEER.

           Willis opens two bottles and passes one to Melcher. 

           They drink them in silence for a few moments. We understand 
           that this is a regular ritual.  

                                 MELCHER
                        Oh hey, I’ve got those Make-A-Wish 
                        people coming this week. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Again? My wish is that they would 
                        stop coming.

                                 MELCHER
                        Me too. But if they don’t go for 
                        that could we take them round? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. 

           They sit in silence a bit longer.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        So Susie wants a divorce. 

                                 MELCHER
                        That’s tough. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah.

                                 MELCHER
                        Moving on is going to be so hard.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? No. I’m not going to move on, 
                        Ron. I’m going to win her back. 

                                 MELCHER
                        Oh. I just thought, because it has 
                        been a little while now and-

                                 WILLIS
                        She’s having an affair, Ron, that’s 
                        all. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIS (CONT'D)
                        I just need to find out who it is 
                        and, you know, kill him and then 
                        she’ll realize what a perfect thing 
                        we’ve always had together.  

                                 MELCHER
                        Jeff, it’s none of my business. But 
                        did you ever hear the phrase ‘If 
                        you love something, set it free’?

                                 WILLIS
                        I guess so, Ron. But you know a 
                        phrase I never heard?

                                 MELCHER
                        What’s that? 

                                 WILLIS
                        ‘If you love something, get 
                        divorced from it’.  

           Willis holds up his bottle and Melcher clinks his against it.  

           INT. WILLIS’ CAR ON FREMONT BRIDGE - DAY

           Willis in his car driving home over the bridge in slow moving 
           traffic.

           Just one of dozens more going back and forth all the time.  

           He stares at the poster for Portland Children’s, focusing 
           particularly on the face of the handsome actor pictured with 
           his family.    

           INT. WILLIS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Willis creeps into his kitchen through the back door.

           He makes a sandwich, taking great care to do everything 
           silently.  

           When he closes the fridge door, it reveals Alexis standing 
           behind it. 

           She is wearing a cheerleader uniform and has some kind of a 
           face pack on. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Aaarghh! 
                            (Realizes.)
                        Oh, it’s you.  

                                 ALEXIS
                        What are you doing, Dad? 
                                 WILLIS
                        I’m making a sandwich. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        You’re not supposed to come in here 
                        after nine. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I know that. But I’m hungry and 
                        your mother is out and I thought 
                        you and your sister wouldn’t mind-

           Blake enters, holding a phone as if about to dial. 

                                 BLAKE 
                        I’m calling Mom.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Okay. Okay, I’m going. 

           Willis starts heading out the door, taking his sandwich with 
           him. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        Put down the sandwich, Dad. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Alexis, I-

                                 BLAKE
                        It’s ringing.  

           Willis puts down the sandwich. When he does so, Blake hangs 
           up the phone. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I want you to know that I forgive 
                        you both. You’re my daughters and I 
                        will always love you, even if right 
                        now you’re going through a kind of 
                        unpleasant phase.     

           Blake lifts up her phone again. Willis reluctantly goes.

           INT. WILLIS HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

           Willis is woken by his phone ringing.

           He fumbles around for it, knocking several things over. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 
                            (Listens.)
                        This is Dr Willis. 
                            (Listens.)
                        I only do one call a month. It’s 
                        really very unlikely to be me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIS (CONT'D)
                        You should try someone else. Have 
                        you tried Nancy? Nancy does a lot 
                        of calls. 

           Willis puts the phone down and goes back to sleep. 

           After a few moments the phone starts to ring again. 

           INT. WILLIS CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Willis driving in his car. He is wearing his pyjamas and a 
           dressing gown over them. 

           He is sipping from his insulated mug of coffee and talking 
           into his phone clamped between his ear and his shoulder. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Set the pressure to twenty-five. A 
                        size five tube. Size seven gloves.

           Willis finishes the last of his coffee.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        And I’m going to need some really 
                        strong filter. Ethiopian if they 
                        have it. 

           Willis turns off the phone and tosses it on the passenger 
           seat.  

           INT. DELIVERY ROOM - NIGHT

           Willis, now wearing surgical scrubs - beneath which his 
           pyjamas are still visible - and a theatre cap and latex 
           gloves waits beside a resuscitaire.  

           In the background a WOMAN is giving birth. She is attended by 
           an OBSTETRICIAN and SEVERAL MIDWIVES.  The FATHER loiters 
           nervously nearby.  

           There is an abrupt flurry of activity around the woman. 

           Willis takes a swig of his insulated coffee mug.  

           A MIDWIFE places a NEWBORN BABY on the resuscitaire in front 
           of Willis. 

           The baby, covered in blood and meconium, is blue and is not 
           moving or breathing. 

           Willis rubs the baby with a towel in an entirely business-
           like manner. 

           When nothing happens he takes the oxygen mask and holds it 
           firmly over the baby’s face. 
           He uses his thumb to give a few firm inflation breaths.  

           We see the baby’s chest wall rise.  

           A few seconds later the baby starts screaming and quickly 
           turns pink. 

           Willis wraps the baby in a towel and passes it to the FATHER.  

           He takes off his gloves and drops them in the bin, then 
           leaves the room. 

           Even the miracle of the birth of human life no longer has any 
           impact whatsoever on Dr Jeff Willis.  

           INT. WILLIS’ OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Still wearing his theatre scrubs - with his pyjamas visible 
           underneath - Willis sits in his chair in his office and puts 
           his feet up on the desk, intending to sleep.

           Out of his window, he sees the red ember tip of a cigarette  
           end on a nearby balcony.  

           Willis closes his eyes. 

           After a moment he opens them again. 

           The red ember is still there, brightening each time the 
           unseen smoker inhales. 

           Willis sighs wearily and stands up.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL BALCONY - NIGHT 

           Willis opens the door onto the balcony. 

                                 WILLIS
                        We don’t let parents smoke out 
                        here. It kind of sets a-

           Willis stops when he sees who is smoking: Amy. 

           She blows smoke in his face.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        You know, we’re starting to 
                        discover that those things might be 
                        bad for you.  

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, well, an astroglioma is 
                        worse.

           Amy holds the pack out to Willis. 
                                 WILLIS
                        No, thank you.

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. I used to be scared of shit 
                        too, before I went terminal.   

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not scared. 

                                 AMY
                        Just square.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Give me one of those.  

           Willis takes the cigarette and lights it up from Amy’s.   

           He takes a long deep drag. And then coughs and splutters. Amy 
           smirks. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Did you finish the Kerouac?

                                 AMY
                        I’ve read it before. I’ve read all 
                        of them. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh. Yeah. Me too.  

                                 AMY
                        So what do you think of ‘Visions of 
                        Cody’?

                                 WILLIS
                        Maybe I missed that one. But I 
                        always liked his poems.

                                 AMY
                        Really? 

                                 WILLIS
                        ‘I saw the best minds of my 
                        generation destroyed by madness’ 

                                 AMY
                        That’s Ginsberg. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        That’s ‘Howl’ by Allen Ginsberg.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Are you sure? 
                                 AMY
                        Pretty sure, yeah. 

           They hear a noise behind them. 

           They look inside and see a NURSE approaching.  

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! 

           They quickly extinguish their cigarettes and flatten 
           themselves against the wall so that the nurse cannot see 
           them.   

           The nurse peers out from the glass but cannot see anything 
           and leaves.

           Willis waits until he is sure the nurse is out of earshot 
           before speaking.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Thanks for the cigarette. Please 
                        don’t tell anyone about it.  

                                 AMY
                        Who would I even tell?

                                 WILLIS
                        Seriously, if I get another 
                        complaint I get fired.

                                 AMY
                        Jesus, Jeff. I said I’m not going 
                        to tell anyone. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CLINIC ROOM - DAY

           Willis sits in a consulting room with a pair of parents, MR 
           and MRS LAKOVIC and their TODDLER. They look mildly 
           alternative, a hemp yoga mat strapped to the buggy etc. 

           It is now the middle of the day, but Willis is still wearing 
           his theatre scrubs with his pyjamas visible beneath them. 

           His insulated cup of coffee is on the table in front of him. 

           The parents are talking but Willis’ eyes are closed.  

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        We just don’t believe in 
                        vaccination.  

                                 MR LAKOVIC
                        Our friend Jenna recommended herbal 
                        vaccination. We printed some 
                        information from the internet. 
           They try to pass some sheets of paper to Willis. 

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        Doctor, are you asleep? 

           Willis shakes himself awake. 

                                 WILLIS
                        No. 

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        So what did I just say? 

                                 WILLIS
                        You were saying you don’t believe 
                        in vaccination and you want a 
                        herbal version.   

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        Yes. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Can I ask what you do for a living?

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        I’m a chef and he’s a mechanic but 
                        I don’t see how- 

                                 WILLIS
                        So imagine I came to your place of 
                        work and I told you that I didn’t 
                        believe in broiling.

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        What? That wouldn’t, I mean, that’s 
                        not the same thing. 

                                 WILLIS
                        And then I brought my car to your 
                        garage and told you I didn’t want 
                        you to put any gas in and instead I 
                        wanted you to use milk, because 
                        somebody I knew had once read in a 
                        magazine that gas was bad for it 
                        and milk worked jut as well.

           Mr and Mrs Lakovic look baffled.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        That would be insane, wouldn’t it? 
                        And yet that is pretty much exactly 
                        what is happening here. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CANTEEN - DAY

           Willis fills his insulated coffee mug.  
           Margaret Brown approaches him. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It’s not a good start, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Wow. That was quick. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What? What was quick?

                                 WILLIS
                        Nothing. What are you talking 
                        about? 

                                 MARGARET
                        One of the pediatric patients has 
                        gone on hunger strike until you 
                        agree to become her doctor.  

           INT. AMY’S ROOM - CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY 

           Willis enters Amy’s room.  

           They look at one another. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s not a real hunger strike. I 
                        stole chocolate from the little 
                        kids. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Do you have any left? 

           Amy takes some chocolate out from under her bed and gives 
           Willis a piece. He eats it and nods appreciatively.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ, who is wasting this 
                        stuff on little kids?

           Amy hands Willis another piece. 

                                 AMY
                        So are you going to be my doctor? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Let’s see: are you in hospital 
                        because of an allergy, preferably a 
                        hazelnut allergy? 

                                 AMY
                        No. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Then, no, I’m not going to be your 
                        doctor. Why would you even want me 
                        to be your doctor, anyway?

                                 AMY
                        Because you’re as messed-up as I 
                        am. And also I hate Dr Turner.

                                 WILLIS
                        Dr Turner is a very good physician. 
                        She is a Stanford graduate and-

                                 AMY
                        She’s a mewling quim. 

           Willis chokes on his chocolate.  

                                 WILLIS
                        She takes a little bit of getting 
                        used to, that is all. 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, I don’t really have so much 
                        time for getting used to things. 
                        What with imminently dying of a 
                        brain tumour and all.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Look. I can’t be your doctor. I’m 
                        going to San Francisco the day 
                        after tomorrow- 

                                 AMY
                        I’ll wait. I mean, so long as I 
                        don’t die.

                                 WILLIS
                        I have way too many patients 
                        already.

                                 AMY
                        It’s okay. I understand.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Good.

                                 AMY
                        But I think Anne might complain.  

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. She saw us smoking together. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Did she? 
                                 AMY
                        No. But if I tell her to say she 
                        did then she will. 

           Willis is about to say something but realizes he is trapped. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Case conference tomorrow at three, 
                        Jeff. Don’t be late. 

           INT. WILLIS’ CAR - DRIVING ON FREMONT BRIDGE - DAY

           Willis stuck in traffic as he drives home from work over the 
           bridge. 

           INT. WILLIS CAR’ - DRIVING ON FREMONT BRIDGE - DAY 

           Willis stuck in traffic as he drives to work over the bridge.  

           The HANDSOME MAN in the photograph in the billboard seems to 
           be laughing at him. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY

           Willis, Melcher and Chen walk down the ward with two women, 
           JULIE and JANE. 

           Julie and Jane are wearing bright T-shirts announcing they 
           are from the ‘Moonbeams-Make-A-Wish Foundation’.   

                                 JANE
                        It must just be such a privilege to 
                        work with these children. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Some of them are actually kind of 
                        annoying.  

           Willis points to a CUTE TODDLER in a cot. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        That guy, he does this thing where 
                        he clicks his teeth. It drives you 
                        nuts.  

                                 JULIE
                        Children are our future, aren’t 
                        they? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Generally, yes. Just, not so much 
                        these specific ones. 

           Julie studies a piece of paper in her hand.  
                                 JULIE
                        We’ve got one more name on our 
                        list. Amy Morrison?

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah, this isn’t really her kind of 
                        thing.  

                                 JANE
                        Is she terminally ill?

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, yes, but-

                                 JULIE
                        Then she should get to make a wish.  

           Willis reluctantly leads them over to Amy's bedroom.

           INT. AMY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Willis, Julie, Jane, Chen and Melcher enter Amy's bedroom. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Amy. You already know Dr Melcher 
                        and Lucia. This is Jane- 

                                 JULIE 
                        It’s Julie. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Then the other one is Jane. They 
                        come from, uh-

                                 JANE
                        Moonbeams-Make-A-Wish! 

                                 JULIE
                        Hi there, Amy! 

                                 JANE
                        We’re so very sorry to hear you’ve 
                        been poorly!

                                 AMY
                        That’s okay. I think I’m just about 
                        through the worst of it now. 

           Jane and Julie gasp and look with horror at Willis. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Come on, she’s kidding. She’s toast 
                        and she knows it.

                                 JULIE 
                        Do you know what we do at Moonbeams-
                        Make-A-Wish, Amy? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JULIE  (CONT'D)
                        We help terminally ill children 
                        realize their dreams. 

                                 JANE
                        Earlier this year we arranged for a 
                        little girl without a functioning 
                        immune system to swim with 
                        dolphins. 

                                 WILLIS
                        That doesn’t sound very safe. 

                                 JULIE
                        She passed away two days later. We 
                        were all so thrilled that we got to 
                        make her wish come true. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Do you think her wish was to die of 
                        dolphin flu?

           Willis has tried to whisper this to Melcher, but it comes out 
           too loud and the others have heard. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. 

                                 JANE
                        The point is, is there anything you 
                        would like to do before, well, 
                        before you can’t do it anymore?   

                                 AMY
                        There is. But I don’t think you can 
                        help.  

                                 JULIE
                        You’d be surprised. 

                                 AMY
                        Okay. I really want to have sex 
                        with a boy. Preferably a handsome 
                        boy who looks like Jack Kerouac. 
                        But time is short so I’d probably 
                        settle.  

           Jane and Julie look horrified. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Amy is on medication. It makes her 
                        loopy. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m only on Tylenol. It doesn’t 
                        make me loopy. 
           INT. WILLIS’ OFFICE - DAY 

           In his cramped little office, Willis sits at his computer 
           working on a POWERPOINT PRESENTATION. 

           Chen knocks on the door. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Dr Chen. I need your advice on 
                        something. 

                                 CHEN 
                        Of course. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You see this slide?

           Willis pulls up an incredibly complicated diagram of a 
           protein.   

                                 CHEN
                        The molecular structure of 
                        interleukin 5.

                                 WILLIS
                        Right, right. Does it look better 
                        in blue or green? 

           Wills flicks a button to toggle between blue and green. 

                                 CHEN
                        They are both fine.  

                                 WILLIS
                        But if you had to pick one? 

                                 CHEN
                        Green. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re not colorblind are you?

                                 CHEN
                        No.

                                 WILLIS
                        Okay. Listen, Nancy will be 
                        covering whilst I’m gone. If you 
                        have any problems with the 
                        patients, just call her. 

                                 LUCIA
                        I understand. 
                                 WILLIS
                        I mean, sometimes some parent will 
                        have some really specific question 
                        that it seems like only I could 
                        answer. What would you do then? 

                                 LUCIA
                        Call you?

                                 WILLIS
                        Jesus, no. Call Nancy! Don’t call 
                        me. I’m on vacation in California! 
                        Why would you call me? 

                                 LUCIA
                        I thought it was a conference.

                                 WILLIS
                        It is, but, you know, conference, 
                        vacation - there is kind of a gray 
                        area there. 

           INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CASE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Willis sits outside a room, drinking coffee from his 
           insulated cup. 

           Susie comes down the corridor. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I can’t talk to you now, Jeff. I 
                        have a case conference and-  

                                 WILLIS
                        I have the same one.

                                 SUSIE
                        Amy is Dr Turner’s patient.  

                                 WILLIS
                        She asked me to be her doctor. 
                        Actually, she didn’t just ask. She 
                        went on hunger strike.

           Susie stares at Willis. This is the last thing she needed 
           today.    

           INT. CASE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 

           Willis, Susie, Amy, Anne all sat around a table. 

                                 ANNE
                        Amy, why don’t you just come home?

                                 AMY
                        Because I don’t have a home.  
                                 ANNE
                        Do you have any idea how hurtful 
                        that is? 

                                 AMY
                        I’m a hobo, Anne. We don’t choose 
                        the road. The road chooses us. 

                                 ANNE
                        You’re a fifteen year old girl 
                        dying of a brain tumour. Where can 
                        you possibly go? 

                                 AMY
                        Maybe I’ll just hop a freight down 
                        to San Luis Obispo and ride the 
                        boxcars for a while.   

                                 SUSIE
                        Amy, at the Department of Family 
                        Services we feel that the best 
                        thing for you would be- 

                                 AMY
                        Does nobody care what I think? 
                        Where I want to live? Is that not 
                        at all important to people? 

                                 SUSIE
                        Of course that’s important. Where 
                        do you want to live?

                                 AMY
                        I don’t know. But not with Anne. No 
                        offence.    

                                 SUSIE
                        Look, Amy. Nobody wants to live at 
                        home when they are fifteen, but we 
                        can’t all just do what we want all 
                        the time.

                                 WILLIS
                        Why not?

                                 SUSIE
                        Jeff-

                                 WILLIS
                        Why can’t we all just do what we 
                        want all the time?

                                 SUSIE
                        Because we’re adults. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy’s not an adult. She’s fifteen. 
                                 SUSIE
                        Some of us are adults. Or at least 
                        we’re supposed to be.  

           Amy catches the tension between the two of them.  

           Susie’s pager goes. She looks at it, sighs and stands up.   

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        She stays here for now. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I went to med school with a guy 
                        lives down in San Luis Obispo. I 
                        could make a couple of calls? 

           Susie glares at Willis. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Just a suggestion. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           Willis walks down the corridor. 

           Amy catches up with him.  

                                 AMY 
                        What was that all about?  

                                 WILLIS
                        We were trying to find you 
                        somewhere to live. We were 
                        unsuccessful.  

                                 AMY
                        I meant with you and the child-
                        catcher. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Don’t call her that.  

                                 AMY
                        What? Why not? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Because I’m married to her.  

           They come to the end of the corridor. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back in a few days. Don’t 
                        die whilst I’m out of state. 

                                 AMY
                        Because you’ll miss me?
                                 WILLIS
                        It creates a lot of paperwork.  

           Willis turns and walks down the corridor.

                                 AMY
                        I hope your plane doesn’t crash, 
                        Jeff. 

           Willis replies without turning around. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m taking the train. 

           EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Willis exits the garage and rings the doorbell of his house. 

           Blake answers it. She does not open the door very far. 

                                 BLAKE 
                        What? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, I wondered if you and your 
                        sister wanted me to bring you 
                        anything from San Francisco? 

                                 BLAKE
                        Just the cash will be fine.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? No, I mean - the idea is that 
                        I bring you a souvenir. 

                                 BLAKE
                        We’d prefer the cash. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, maybe your sister would like 
                        a souvenir? Perhaps if I could just 
                        come in and ask her-

                                 BLAKE
                            (Shouts upstairs.)
                        Alexis? What do you want Dad to 
                        bring you from his trip? 

                                 ALEXIS (O.C.)
                            (Shouted from upstairs.)
                        Just the cash.  

                                 BLAKE
                        You can pay us later, Dad.  

           Blake closes the door. 
           INT. SUSIE’S CAR - PULLING INTO AMTRAK LOT - DAY 

           Susie and Willis pull into the parking lot at the Amtrak 
           station in downtown Portland. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        You know, this reminds me of that 
                        time, right after we first got 
                        married, when we drove down to 
                        Crater Lake and-

                                 SUSIE
                        I’m giving you a lift to the 
                        station, Jeff. That is all that’s 
                        happening here. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Right, I just meant- 

                                 SUSIE
                        And when you come back I want you 
                        to give me a divorce. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Right. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I still don’t know why you couldn’t 
                        have just flown down like any 
                        normal human being.

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m a romantic. I like the romance 
                        of the railroad. It’s, you know, 
                        romantic. 

           Willis goes to kiss Susie. But she pulls back from him. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Knock them dead with the peanuts. 

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s hazelnuts. I do hazelnuts.

                                 SUSIE
                        Really? I always thought it was 
                        peanuts. 

           EXT. AMTRAK STATION - PLATFORM - DAY

           Willis stands on the platform waiting for the train. 

           He has a weekender bag with him, and he is drinking his 
           insulated cup of coffee.  
           INT. QUIET CARRIAGE - AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY 

           Willis sits down on the train in an empty four-seater.  

           He puts his insulated cup on the table in front of him and 
           looks out the window at the countryside.  

           He closes his eyes and lets the motion of the train rock him. 

           It feels good to be getting away from everything.  

           After a few moments Willis opens his eyes. 

           Amy is sitting directly opposite him. 

                                 WILLIS  
                        Jesus!  

                                 AMY
                        Shhh, Jeff. This is the quiet 
                        carriage. You’ll disturb the other 
                        passengers. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Why are you on this train?

                                 AMY
                        Because I’m going to Frisco to get 
                        some kicks. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re going where?

                                 AMY
                        Duh. San Francisco. Everybody calls 
                        it Frisco.

                                 WILLIS
                        Nobody calls it Frisco.

                                 AMY
                        Jack Kerouac did. Neal Cassady did. 
                        You probably even called it that 
                        yourself back in the Summer of 
                        Love.   

                                 WILLIS
                        I wasn’t there in the Summer of 
                        Love. Where’s your stepmother? 

                                 AMY
                        Anne? How would I know where she 
                        is? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Isn’t she travelling with you? 
                                 AMY
                        Of course not. Anne’s not in to 
                        kicks. 

                                 WILLIS
                        So who are you going to San 
                        Francisco with?

                                 AMY 
                        That’s funny, Jeff.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Why is that funny?

                                 AMY
                        Because I’m going with you. 

           Willis stares at her in horror. 

           A CONDUCTOR is passing through the carriage.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Excuse me, Sir? We have a major 
                        problem here.  

                                 CONDUCTOR 
                        What’s the problem? 

                                 WILLIS
                        This girl. She’s a stowaway.

                                 AMY 
                        Daddy! Don’t kid on! 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not her dad and I’m not 
                        kidding. She’s a stowaway. She 
                        doesn’t even have a ticket.

           Amy takes a TICKET out of her pocket and shows it to the 
           Conductor.  

           The Conductor nods, give Willis a look, then continues on. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        How did you pay for that? 

                                 AMY
                        With Anne’s credit card.  

                                 WILLIS
                        You stole you stepmother’s credit 
                        card? 

                                 AMY
                        I borrowed it without her 
                        permission. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Which is stealing. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m not long for this world, Jeff. 
                        She’s going to get paid back in 
                        spades soon enough anyway.  

           Willis takes out his mobile phone and starts to dial.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Quiet carriage, Jeff.

           Willis gets up and walks towards the end of the carriage.   

           INT. VESTIBULE BETWEEN COACHES - AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY 

           The noisy vestibule between coaches. 

           Willis is yelling into his mobile phone, but between the poor 
           signal and the noise of the train it is a losing battle.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Hello? It’s Jeff. Hello? Hello?

           The door from the toilet unlocks, and Amy comes out. 

           She looks pale and her hair is a mess.

           It is obvious she has been puking again.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Hello? I can’t hear-

           Jeff looks at his phone, sighs and gives up.  

           INT. DINING CAR - AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT

           It is now dark outside.

           They sit in the dining car of the train as it travels on into 
           the night. 

           Amy is reading her book, ‘Visions of Cody’ by Jack Kerouac.  

           Willis is staring at her, fuming.  

                                 AMY
                        I have a Burroughs in my bag if 
                        you’d like.

                                 WILLIS
                        No, thank you. 

                                 AMY
                        Are you mad with me? 
                                 WILLIS
                        Yes. I’m extremely mad with you.

                                 AMY
                        Why? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Because you’re a stowaway. 

                                 AMY
                        I bought a ticket. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, you weren’t invited.   

                                 AMY
                        You don’t own the train, Jeff. I 
                        bought a ticket. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I bought my ticket first! 

                                 AMY
                        That’s mature.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        I said that’s mature. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Were you being sarcastic? 

                                 AMY
                        I don’t know, Jeff. What do you 
                        think?

                                 WILLIS
                        See, the funny thing about sarcasm 
                        is that it is actually a sign of 
                        immaturity. You know who the only 
                        people who think sarcasm is mature 
                        are? Teenagers. 

                                 AMY
                        And when you say ‘teenagers’, you 
                        mean me?

                                 WILLIS
                        No, I don’t mean you, Amy. Why on 
                        earth would you think I meant you?

           Amy smiles. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        What?
                                 AMY
                        Pretty sure that was some sarcasm 
                        right there, Jeff.  

           Willis curses for getting himself caught up in a knot.  

           EXT. PLATFORM - KLAMATH FALLS - NIGHT  

           A desolate-looking platform in the middle of the night.  

           A sign on the platform announces this place is ‘KLAMATH 
           FALLS’.

           Willis is on the payphone at the end of the platform.  

           Amy stood beside him looking bored and cold. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Yes, I know she is missing. She is 
                        here with me. 
                            (Beat.)
                        Of course I didn’t invite her! She 
                        stowed away! 
                            (Beat.)
                        Well, unless you know anybody else 
                        wants to drive down to Klamath 
                        falls?
                            (Beat.)
                        What? No, I have a very important 
                        paper about hazelnuts to deliver.

           Willis hangs up the phone and then holds the receiver out to 
           Amy.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Call your stepmother. 

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 WILLIS
                        Call your stepmother and get her to 
                        come and pick you up. 

           Amy sighs and dials the number.

                                 AMY 
                        Hi, it’s me. 
                            (Beat.)
                        Klamath Falls. 
                            (Beat.)
                        No, I understand. Goodbye. 

           Willis grabs the receiver from Amy. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Mrs Morrison? Don’t hang up. It’s 
                        Dr Jeff from Portland Children’s. 
                        I’m on way to San Francisco and 
                        Amy, well, maybe she didn’t exactly 
                        stowaway but-
                            (Listens.)
                        Oh. Oh, well I’m sorry that you 
                        feel that way. Mrs Morrison? Mrs 
                        Morrison?

           Willis hangs the phone up. 

           INT. DINING CAR - AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT

           The train is back on the move. 

           The dining car is emptier now. It is getting later. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Why doesn’t your stepmother want to 
                        collect you?

                                 AMY
                        Please don’t use the word ‘mother’ 
                        in conjunction with that woman.

                                 WILLIS
                        Seriously, why doesn’t she want to 
                        come? At the hospital it seemed 
                        like-

                                 AMY
                        Because she cares enough to drive 
                        five miles but not a hundred, okay?

           Amy turns and stares out the window. 

           She is trying not to cry. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What kind of berth do you have?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. They were all sold out. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy.

                                 AMY
                        Well, maybe if somebody had given 
                        me more notice-

                                 WILLIS
                        You weren’t invited! How could I 
                        have given you more notice?  
                                 AMY
                        It’s no big deal, Jeff. I’ll just 
                        jungle down here. Maybe if I slip 
                        him a couple of greenbacks the 
                        brakeman will Jones me a blanket.  

           Willis sighs and slides a key across the table.

                                 WILLIS
                        Take my berth.

                                 AMY
                        How many beds are there? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Two. 

                                 AMY
                        Then we can share. 

                                 WILLIS
                        We can’t share.

                                 AMY
                        Why? What do you think is going to 
                        happen?

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, for one thing you might get 
                        your stepmother to complain. If I 
                        get another complaint-

                                 AMY
                            (Interrupts.)
                        Maybe I’ll get her to complain if 
                        you don’t share. 

           Willis is still looking hesitant. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I absolutely promise you it is not 
                        going to be awkward. I’ll go in 
                        first and go on the top bunk, you 
                        come in after ten minutes and go on 
                        the bottom one. I swear I won’t 
                        peek. We don’t even have to talk to 
                        one another.  

           INT. BERTH - AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT

           Willis lies in the bottom bunk, Amy in the top. 

           The lights are off and Willis is contentedly drifting off to 
           sleep. 
                                 AMY
                        Hey Jeff, do you want to hear a 
                        funny joke? 

           Willis opens his eyes.  

                                 WILLLS
                        You’re fifteen. You don’t know any 
                        funny jokes.  

                                 AMY
                        So this guy gets home from work and 
                        his girlfriend tells him she is 
                        leaving him. 

                                 WILLIS
                        That’s not funny, that’s tragic.  

                                 AMY
                        It’s not finished yet. The guy asks 
                        her why she is leaving him and she 
                        says, I am leaving you because you 
                        are a pedophile. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy-

                                 AMY
                        He says, what?  And she says, you 
                        heard me: I’m leaving you because 
                        you are a pedophile. And so this 
                        guy says, well, that is a very big 
                        word for a thirteen year old.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Go to sleep, Amy. 

           INT. BERTH - AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY

           Willis wakes up and gets up quietly. 

           He tentatively glances up into the top bunk.

           He is surprised to find that Amy is not there. 

           INT. VIEWING LOUNGE - TRAIN - DAY

           Willis finds Amy alone in the deserted viewing lounge. 

           She is swaddled in blankets, watching the Californian desert 
           scenery go by in the dawn.  

                                 AMY
                        Do you think this is what dying is 
                        like?
                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        Like just watching something 
                        beautiful slip past you. And it is 
                        a little sad but it is okay because 
                        you realize that you could never 
                        really have properly known it 
                        anyway.

                                 WILLIS
                        Can you smell coffee? I think they 
                        are making coffee somewhere.

                                 AMY
                        Jeff.

                                 WILLIS
                        I don’t. I mean. Look, the thing 
                        is. You do my job for long enough 
                        and you hear a lot of otherwise 
                        very smart and very scientific-
                        minded people talk about better 
                        places and bright lights and 
                        sometimes even aliens. But, well, I 
                        think - and bear in mind this is 
                        just my personal opinion - it is 
                        really a whole lot of horseshit. I 
                        think that when you are dead you 
                        are dead. Sorry.   

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. That’s what I think too. I 
                        was just trying to be poetic. But 
                        it is a pretty view.  

           They watch it for a while longer. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been puking more. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I know. 

                                 AMY
                        It means I’m getting worse, doesn’t 
                        it?  

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah.  

                                 AMY
                        But you can’t say how long I have?

                                 WILLIS
                        Even if I could tell you, would you 
                        actually want to know?
                                 AMY
                        No, I guess not. 

           They watch some more of the scenery go by. 

           INT. OAKLAND AMTRAK STATION - DAY

           Willis and Amy get off the train. 

           Willis stops an OLDER COUPLE who are heading for the train 
           with their suitcases. Amy walks on ahead a little bit.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        Excuse me. Are you travelling to 
                        Portland?

                                 MAN
                        Seattle.

                                 WILLIS
                        Great. See, the thing is, I’m a 
                        pediatric doctor, and this young 
                        lady needs to get back to Portland 
                        Children’s. I was hoping you could 
                        escort her on the train.   

                                 MAN
                        Shouldn’t you be escorting her?  

                                 WILLIS
                        I would, but I have to deliver this 
                        paper about hazelnuts. It’s kind of 
                        a big deal.   

                                 MAN
                        Well, so long as we don’t have to 
                        do anything medical, I think we 
                        could help.

           Amy has come back to see what the hold up is. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy, these people are going to be 
                        your companions on the trip back. 

                                 MAN
                        You just stick with us, young lady. 
                        We’ll get you to the hospital.  

                                 AMY 
                        What? What hospital? 

                                 MAN
                        Your doctor has told us all about 
                        it. 
                                 AMY 
                        My doctor? Oh honey, why are you so 
                        funny? Our love is nothing to be 
                        ashamed about.

           The old couple look horrified, turn and hurry away.  

           EXT. OAKLAND AMTRAK STATION - DAY

           Willis and Amy emerge from the station and head towards the 
           single waiting taxi.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Jesus Christ! You could have had me 
                        arrested! 

                                 AMY 
                        Try to send me back again and I 
                        will. 

           A woman, VALERIE, approaches them. Valerie is in her early-
           thirties, probably pretty behind her large glasses, and 
           struggling with a ridiculous amount of luggage that seems to 
           include various poster tubes and display stands.   

                                 VALERIE
                        Excuse me? I couldn’t help but 
                        overhearing-

                                 WILLIS
                        Perfect. Take her. I don’t even 
                        want any money for her. 

                                 VALERIE
                        What? 

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re about to offer to buy her. I 
                        can feel it. 

                                 VALERIE 
                        I overheard you say you were going 
                        to the conference. I thought maybe 
                        I could share your cab. I mean, if 
                        your daughter doesn’t mind. 

                                 WILLIS
                        She’s not my daughter and she 
                        doesn’t get a vote. We’d be glad to 
                        have you along.  

                                 VALERIE
                        Great.

           Valerie struggles to get her copious luggage into the trunk. 
           Willis tries to help, but Valerie is so physically awkward it 
           only makes things harder. 

           INT. TAXI CAB - DAY 

           Willis, Valerie and Amy in the cab, driving from the Oakland 
           Station to San Francisco. 

                                 VALERIE 
                        So what sessions are you looking 
                        forward to hearing?

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m actually delivering the main 
                        lecture on hazelnuts.  

                                 VALERIE
                        Wow.

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. It’s a big honour but, you 
                        know, I’m just taking it in my 
                        stride.    

                                 AMY
                        What kind of doctor are you?

                                 VALERIE 
                        Oh, I’m not a doctor. I’m a rep. A 
                        rep is somebody who-

                                 AMY
                            (Interrupts.)
                        You try and persuade doctors to 
                        prescribe drugs that don’t work. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Who told you our secret?

                                 AMY
                        I have an astroglioma. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Oh. Sorry.  

                                 AMY
                        Sorry I have a brain tumour or 
                        sorry for trying to poison me?

           INT. TAXI OUTSIDE HILTON UNION SQUARE - DAY

           The taxi pulls up outside the Hilton Union Square. 

           Willis takes his billfold out of his wallet.  
                                 VALERIE
                        Let me, Jeff. I can bill this back. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I won’t say no to a free ride, 
                        Valerie. 

                                 AMY 
                        It’s not free. It just ultimately 
                        makes the drugs more expensive. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        It is paid for by the families of 
                        sick and dying children. Lots of 
                        them don’t even have insurance. 
                        This particular cab ride was 
                        probably paid for by a foundry 
                        worker pulling double shifts to buy 
                        a medicine that he thinks is making 
                        his kid better but is actually just 
                        making his kid’s hair fall out.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy, are you feeling okay?  

                                 AMY
                        Actually, I’m a little nauseous 
                        right now. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, that’s funny, because I have 
                        a severe pain in the neck.  

           INT. RECEPTION - HILTON UNION SQUARE - DAY

           Willis and Amy stand at the reception desk being attended by 
           a UNIFORMED RECEPTIONIST.  

           Valerie is visible checking in a little further down the 
           counter. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Dr Willis, I’m here for the 
                        conference. 

           The receptionist starts typing. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m presenting the keynote paper on 
                        hazelnuts.  

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Then you’ll be booked into one of 
                        our penthouses.
                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not, I mean, formally a keynote 
                        - I’m kind of the keynote speaker 
                        within the hazelnut subsection. So 
                        I have a single room at the 
                        conference rate. They said it was 
                        eighty two dollars. With tax. And 
                        I’m also going to need another 
                        single room for my daughter.   

                                 RECEPTIONIST 
                        I’m sorry. The hotel is completely 
                        booked for the conference.  

                                 WILLIS
                        My daughter needs her own room. 
                        She’s not actually very well, and- 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m afraid that is not going to be 
                        possible. Unless-

           The receptionist types something in. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you’re in luck. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Great. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        We have an Imperial Suite with two 
                        bedrooms available. 

                                 WILLIS
                        An Imperial Suite? How much is 
                        that?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        It is nine hundred and twelve 
                        dollars a night. Before tax.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah, the thing is. I mean, it’s 
                        not the price, it’s just-

                                 AMY
                        We’ll take it. 

           Amy holds out her stepmother’s credit card.

           Willis pushes it away and tries to give the receptionist his 
           own card instead. 

           Amy forcefully gives the receptionist her card.
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Live a little, Jeff. Anne doesn’t 
                        even read the bills. 

           The receptionist looks at her with concern. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Private joke between me and my dad. 
                        Anne’s my mom. His wife. She’s just 
                        a crazy shopaholic, hey Dad?    

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A BELLBOY shows Willis and Amy in to the suite and then 
           departs. 

           There are large windows with extensive views of the city 
           beneath.

                                 AMY
                        Which bedroom do you want? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Nine hundred dollars a night. I 
                        think they are both going to be 
                        okay. 

                                 AMY
                        Lighten up, Jeff! Nine hundred 
                        dollars is a small price to pay for 
                        a view like this.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Eighty two dollars with tax would 
                        be a small price to pay. Nine 
                        hundred and twelve dollars before 
                        tax is a large price to pay. 

                                 AMY
                        But look at this view. It’s  
                        Frisco! It’s the city lights, like 
                        Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s bookstore!

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, I guess you’ll be spending a 
                        lot of time in here so- 

                                 AMY
                        What? What do you mean? 

                                 WILLIS
                        See, I have a lot of sessions to go 
                        to and-
                                 AMY
                        Jeff, do you really think I rode 
                        the rails all the way down to 
                        Frisco just to sit around in some 
                        crappy hotel room?

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s San Francisco and it’s not a 
                        crappy hotel room, it’s a nine 
                        hundred and twelve dollars before 
                        tax hotel room. And yes. I do think 
                        you came all the way here to sit in 
                        a hotel room. 

                                 AMY
                        Well, I didn’t! I’m going out to 
                        explore. I’m going to go to the 
                        Mission, I’m going to ride a street 
                        car to the Castro, I’m going to 
                        walk up the steep hills and cross 
                        the Golden Gate Bridge and then I’m 
                        going to go down and look at the 
                        goddamn sea lions!   

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy, this isn’t Portland. There are 
                        all kinds of dangers lurking out 
                        there. 

                                 AMY 
                        Like what? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, for one thing they never 
                        caught the Zodiac killer.  

                                 AMY
                        Great. And what terrible thing 
                        could he do? Kill me? 

           Willis sighs.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Keep twenty dollars in your sock 
                        and get back here before dark.   

                                 AMY
                        Even ignoring the whole sock thing, 
                        that’s ridiculous. Why do I have to 
                        be back before dark?

                                 WILLIS
                        So that we can go for dinner. 

                                 AMY
                        Oh. Well, give me the twenty bucks 
                        and you have a deal.
           Willis takes out a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL and gives it to her. 

           Amy goes in to her bedroom and closes the door behind her.  

           INT. CONFERENCE HALL - HOTEL - DAY

           Willis wanders through the conference hall. 

           DELEGATES are milling around the posters on display.

           Several people dressed as GIANT PEANUTS are being chased 
           around by another dressed as a GIANT EPIPEN.  

           Around the edge of the room are various drug company 
           promotional stands. 

           They are all emblazoned with expensive and eye-catching 
           materials, each promoting a blockbuster drug.

           The stands are all staffed by IMMACULATE WOMEN, and many of 
           the stalls are giving away expensive free gifts: BOTTLES OF 
           SCOTCH, BRANDED MP3 PLAYERS, GOLF CLUBS etc

           Willis walks past them all and makes for the auditorium.  

           INT. AUDITORIUM - HOTEL - DAY

           Willis enters the packed auditorium.  

           Up on stage, a PROFESSOR is talking through fancy-looking 
           graphs that are projected on a powerpoint display. 

           The last graph is titled ‘Incidence of Peanut Allergy’ and it 
           shows a red line spiralling upwards exponentially.   

                                 PROFESSOR
                        In conclusion, the peanut remains 
                        our most important and most deadly 
                        foe. We’d be nuts not to redouble 
                        our efforts against it.

           The auditorium laughs and then erupts into applause and, a 
           moment later, a standing ovation. 

           INT. HOTEL RECEPTION ROOM - EVENING 

           A welcome reception, a banner saying:

           ‘UNITED STATES 38th ANNUAL CONGRESS OF ALLERGISTS’ 

           Delegates stand chatting in small groups. 

           Willis takes a drink from a table. 

           A nearby delegate engages him in conversation. 
                                 DOCTOR
                        Great session today, huh? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Which one? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        The peanut keynote. Fascinating.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, if you liked that, I’m giving 
                        a session tomorrow on the hazelnut.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Does anybody still eat hazelnuts? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Does anybody still eat hazelnuts?  
                        Are you kidding? It’s one of the 
                        big three. And when you factor in 
                        Nutella - let me put it this way: 
                        what other nut can say it is the 
                        major ingredient in one of the 
                        nation’s top-selling spreads? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        The peanut. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 DOCTOR
                        I think peanut butter sells pretty 
                        steadily. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Look, obviously peanuts are number 
                        one. That’s a given. But you know 
                        what you can’t make into a spread? 
                        Walnuts. Brazil nuts. And don’t 
                        even get me started on pecans. I 
                        mean, sure, you can make a 
                        reasonable pie with a pecan, but 
                        that’s about as far as that goes 
                        and-

           Willis notices Valerie at a promotional stand in the 
           distance.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Would you excuse me?

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - VENTRAN STAND - DAY

           Smaller and much more chaotic than the others, Valerie’s 
           stand carries the logo of a drug called ‘Ventran’.  
           Valerie is using a plastic model of the human respiratory 
           system to demonstrate something to a group of delegates. 

           Most of the model is made of plastic, but two balloons act as 
           inflatable lungs.  

           Valerie sprays an inhaler into the plastic model’s mouth. 

                                 VALERIE 
                        And so what Ventran does is to 
                        really open up the airways. All 
                        this old stale air that was trapped 
                        in here-

           The balloons were supposed to deflate but have remained the 
           same size.  

                                 VALERIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, one moment.

           Valerie sprays the inhaler again. 

           The two balloons loudly burst. The noise makes Valerie 
           scream.  

                                 VALERIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Sorry, well, look, I’m sure you 
                        all get the idea. I have some 
                        branded laser pens if anyone-

           The delegates are already walking away.

           Valerie sighs and starts packing up her broken model.

           Willis approaches. Valerie does not initially look up.   

                                 VALERIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m actually finished 
                        for the day-
                            (Sees it is Willis.)
                        Oh. Hi.

                                 WILLIS
                        I’ve been wanting to apologize on 
                        behalf of Amy.

                                 VALERIE
                        I liked it. She has character. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yes, she does. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Anyway, she is right. This drug I’m 
                        here to sell, Ventran?
                                 WILLIS
                        I read about this. It’s that new 
                        inhaler that dilates your airways-

                                 VALERIE
                        The new inhaler that we say dilates 
                        your airways. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh. 

                                 VALERIE
                        It’s no better than placebo.

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re not doing a very good job of 
                        selling it. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Between you and me I think I might 
                        not actually be cut out for being a 
                        rep. 

                                 WILLIS
                        How long have you been a rep?

                                 VALERIE
                        Six and a half years.

                                 WILLIS
                        So why don’t you change jobs?

                                 VALERIE
                        Stuck in a rut, I guess.

                                 WILLIS
                        I could drink to that.    

                                 VALERIE
                        Then maybe I could buy you a drink?

                                 WILLIS
                        I told Amy we’d have dinner. Sorry. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Oh. Okay. Have fun. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. You too. 

           Valerie appears a little disappointed, but Willis does not 
           seem to pick up on this. 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Willis enters the suite.
                                 WILLIS
                        Amy? 

           He glances into both the rooms.  

           Amy is not there. 

           Willis goes and looks out the window at the view of the 
           lights of San Francisco.  

           He looks around and sees Amy’s copy of ‘Visions of Cody’ on a 
           table.  

           Willis leaves the room. 

           EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

           A cab pulls up outside the City Lights bookstore.  

           Willis gets out and hurries inside. 

           INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 

           Willis comes downstairs to where a reading is taking place in 
           a packed basement. 

           Up on stage, a BEATNIK POET is reading from a chap-book. 

                                 POET 
                        I want to sing in the railroad 
                        night,
                        I want to feel the desert sun burn 
                        my bones,
                        I want to board my slow boat to 
                        China,

           Willis looks around and glimpses Amy.

           He is about to make his way over to her when he sees how 
           enraptured she is by the whole thing. 

           Willis turns to watch the poet too. 

                                 POET (CONT’D)
                        I want to sail lonesome as the wind 
                        in Frisco harbour,
                        I want to sit at the feet of the 
                        Buddha,
                        I want to touch heaven here on 
                        earth,
                        And know that I was alive in each 
                        and every moment as I did so.

           The poet closes his book and the crowd applauds.  
           Willis is surprised to find himself moved and joining in with 
           the applause.  

           EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

           The crowd filtering out to the exits. 

           Willis has to push his way through to catch up with Amy. She 
           is carrying a chapbook of poetry she has bought. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy? 

                                 AMY
                        Jeff! What are you doing here? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh, you know, I just wanted to pick 
                        up a little Ferlinghetti.  

                                 AMY
                        Really? You like Ferlinghetti? 

                                 WILLIS
                        No! You were supposed to be back at 
                        the hotel before dark!

                                 AMY
                        You’re not my dad. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m in loco parentis.

                                 AMY
                        I take Spanish, Jeff. What you just 
                        said is ridiculous. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?   

                                 AMY
                        You said that you are a crazy 
                        parent. 

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s not Spanish, it’s Latin. It 
                        means that for the purposes of this 
                        trip I am your parent. It might be 
                        Greek.   

                                 AMY
                        No offence, but if you were my 
                        parent I’d run away from home. 
                                 WILLIS
                        You have run away from home. And no 
                        offence, but if you were my 
                        daughter I’d probably -

                                 AMY
                        You’d what, Jeff? What would you 
                        do? 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’d probably let you walk all over 
                        me like my actual daughters do.  

           INT. CAB - NIGHT 

           Amy and Willis get into a cab. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Union Hotel please.  

                                 AMY
                        What? I thought we were going for 
                        dinner. 

                                 WILLIS
                        We’ll eat at the hotel.

                                 AMY
                        Very adventurous, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I have a big day tomorrow. 

                                 AMY
                        What about me?

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re fifteen. There is no what 
                        about you.

                                 AMY
                        I’m dying of cancer, Jeff.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, you should have thought about 
                        that before you broke curfew.  

                                 AMY
                        Harsh, Jeff. Very harsh.  

           Amy slumps back in the seat of the taxi.

           INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Amy and Willis dine in the hotel restaurant, a beer in front 
           of him, a coke in front of her.  
           It is staid as any expense-account hotel restaurant anywhere.

           A corny ‘jazz’ quartet plays in one corner of the room.  

                                 WILLIS
                        This isn’t so bad, is it? 

                                 AMY 
                        It’s terrible. But I have a 
                        question? 

                                 WILLIS
                        You can’t have a beer. You’re not 
                        old enough. 

           Willis takes a long and satisfying pull of his own beer, 
           proving a point.  

                                 AMY
                        That wasn’t my question.

                                 WILLIS
                        So what was it? 

                                 AMY
                        My question is this, Jeff: what’s 
                        wrong with you? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Nothing is wrong with me. What’s 
                        wrong with you?

                                 AMY
                        I have an astroglioma. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh.

                                 AMY
                        Seriously, Jeff. When did you last 
                        have fun? 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        When did you last have fun?

                                 WILLIS
                        Honestly? 

                                 AMY
                        Yes, Jeff. Honestly. 

           Willis thinks about this for a long time. 

                                 WILLIS
                                 AMY
                        What happened in 1998? 

                                 WILLIS
                        I went camping with some buddies. 
                        Two of them were buddies. The third 
                        guy, he was kind of a friend of a 
                        friend.  

                                 AMY
                        And you’ve not been camping since? 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’ve been busy. 

                                 AMY
                        With what? 

                                 WILLIS
                        One thing and another.  

                                 AMY
                        You’ve been too busy to have fun 
                        since nineteen ninety-eight?  

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah.  

                                 AMY
                        It’s as if you’ve given up, Jeff.  

                                 WILLIS
                        I have given up. 

                                 AMY
                        Then it’s no wonder your wife wants 
                        a divorce.  

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        Why would she want to stay married 
                        to somebody who had given up on 
                        everything?

                                 WILLIS
                        I’d kind of hoped we could give up 
                        together. 

                                 AMY
                        That’s ridiculous.

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re too young to understand 
                        this, but when you get a bit older 
                        life has this way of knocking the 
                        stuffing out of you and-
           Amy has started to stare straight ahead at Willis.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Amy does not reply. 

           Willis now notices that one of Amy’s fingers is twitching.  

           The twitch spreads to Amy’s hand, and then her arm.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Right.

           Willis lays Amy out on the floor, places a cushion under her 
           head. 

           Amy starts having a tonic-clonic seizure, her arms and legs 
           jerking rhythmically.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Can somebody call an ambulance, 
                        please? 

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Amy lies on a trolley in a busy emergency room.   

           Willis is sitting beside her reading the chapbook of poetry 
           she bought.  

           Amy drowsily stirs and sees Willis. 

                                 AMY
                        Jesus, Jeff. What are you doing 
                        here? Don’t tell me you died too. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You didn’t die. You had a seizure.

                                 AMY
                        Did they scan me? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. 

                                 AMY
                        Has the astroglioma all gone away 
                        and we can live happily ever after? 

           Willis shakes his head.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        So what happens now? 
                                 WILLIS
                        They’ve given you medicine to 
                        reduce the risk of more seizures. 
                        It doesn’t affect, I mean, overall 
                        the-

                                 AMY
                        I know. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Do you want to go back to Portland?

                                 AMY
                        No. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Do you want to go back to our nine 
                        hundred dollar hotel suite?

                                 AMY
                        Nine hundred and twelve. Before 
                        tax. Yes.  

           Amy closes her eyes and drifts off back to sleep.  

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Willis carries a slumbering Amy in to the hotel suite. 

           INT. BEDROOM - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 

           Willis lays Amy on the bed and tucks the covers over her.

                                 AMY
                            (Sleep-talking.)
                        I want there to be sea lions in the 
                        morning, Jeff.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. 

           Willis goes to leave the room. 

                                 AMY
                        And I don’t want a crappy funeral. 

           Amy still has her eyes closed and is talking in a murmur.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 
                                 AMY
                        I don’t want a whole lot of people 
                        who barely even know me talking 
                        bullshit and listening to 
                        sentimental music that doesn’t even 
                        mean anything to anyone there. 
                            (Beat.)
                        And I really want to see sea lions 
                        tomorrow.

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. Goodnight Amy. 

                                 AMY
                        Goodnight Jeff. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Willis enters the hotel bar, sits down and signals the 
           BARTENDER over.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Scotch, please. A big one.  

           Willis sips his drink. A moment of quiet and peace.  

           Then, a little way down the bar, he spots a familiar face: 
           the HANDSOME MAN from the Portland Children’s billboard. 

           The man is even more perfect-looking in the flesh. He is 
           saying goodnight to TWO WOMEN who look like they are also 
           models.   

           Willis laughs ruefully into his drink. Of all the bars in all 
           the world.  

           After the women depart, Willis glances across at the guy 
           again. He finds he cannot resist.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Hey. How’s it going? 

                                 HANDSOME MAN 
                        Good, thank you. 

           The Handsome Man turns his attention back to his drink. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Don’t I know you from somewhere? 

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        I don’t think so. 

           Willis points at the guy, pretending he has just remembered. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Portland Children’s. 
                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re on the billboard for 
                        Portland Children’s Hospital. 
                        You’re on it with my wife and 
                        daughters, actually. 

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Oh, Okay. Sounds about right. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. I wasn’t considered - you 
                        know - photogenic or happy enough. 
                        So, to you. 
                            (Raises drink.)
                        Mr Happy Handsome Guy. Happy Happy 
                        Handsome Guy. Happy Handsome Guy, 
                        right up there on the billboard 
                        with my family, where I have to 
                        pass it every day. 

           Willis downs his drink. 

                                 HANDSOME MAN 
                        I’m not happy. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        People see my smiling on all those 
                        posters and they assume I must be 
                        happy. 

           Willis looks intrigued; this is indeed exactly what he has 
           always assumed. 

                                 HANDSOME MAN (CONT’D)
                        You know all I’ve ever wanted to 
                        be? A proper actor. 

           Willis is surprised by this. 

                                 HANDSOME MAN (CONT’D)
                        Off-Broadway theatre, that’s all I 
                        wanted to do. One play and I’d be 
                        content. Just one. And every time 
                        the phone rings it’s another 
                        fucking catalogue or campaign. Come 
                        to San Francisco and sell cheese. 
                        Come to St Louis and sell cars. 
                        Come to Denver and sell orphans.  

           Willis is staring at the guy in disbelief. 
                                 HANDSOME MAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m empty inside. Completely and 
                        utterly empty. Between you and me, 
                        most days I don’t even want to get 
                        up anymore. 

           The Handsome Man necks his shot.   

           Willis stares at him in disbelief, astonished that this 
           seemingly perfect man is as unhappy as him. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Can I buy you another drink there? 

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Sure. 

           INT. HOTEL - BREAKFAST ROOM  - DAY

           Willis and Amy sit eating breakfast in the hotel.  

           Willis glances around to make sure nobody is watching then 
           fills his own insulated cup from the pot on the table.

                                 WILLIS
                        How are you feeling today?

                                 AMY
                        Fine.

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m going to be at the conference 
                        all day.  I’ve got my talk at three 
                        so- 

                                 AMY
                        I want to come. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        I want to come to your talk. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re not a delegate. You don’t 
                        have a pass.

                                 AMY
                        You can put me on the guest list.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        Like it was a band. 
                                 WILLIS
                        It’s not a band. There isn’t a 
                        guest list. 

                                 AMY
                        So then you could smuggle me in.

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s an important session. It’s 
                        probably going to be full. 

                                 AMY
                        I’d really like to see it, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Why? 

                                 AMY
                        Because I’m proud of you.

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        You’re about to talk at the United 
                        States Congress of Allergists. 
                        That’s something, isn’t it?  

           This has an impact on Willis that he was not anticipating. 

                                 WILLIS
                        If you meet me in the lobby at two 
                        thirty, we can try and get you in. 

                                 AMY
                        Great. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What are you going to do until 
                        then?

                                 AMY
                        I’m going to explore Frisco. 

           Willis looks at Amy and from the defiant look on her face 
           sees that it is not worth arguing with her on this point.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Okay. But call me if you start to 
                        feel funny. And don’t talk to any 
                        men, alright? This isn’t Portland. 
                        Any one of these guys could be the 
                        Zodiac killer.   

                                 AMY
                        He’d be like a hundred years old by 
                        now. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Well, then they could be his son. 
                        Sometimes these things run in 
                        families.  

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           Willis stands practicing his lines in front of the mirror in 
           the suite.

                                 WILLIS
                        And in conclusion, we must never be 
                        vague about hazelnut allergy.

           Willis frowns. It is not as punchy as the other guy’s finale.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        And in conclusion, we must never be 
                        hazy about hazelnut allergy. 

           Willis smiles at the mirror. He has got it. 

           And then he winks at his reflection. And then frowns.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s the Congress of Allergists. 
                        Not ‘Jeopardy’.  
                            (Beat.)
                        And in conclusion, we must never be 
                        hazy about hazelnut allergy. 

           Willis gives the mirror his ‘serious’ look.     

           INT. HOTEL SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Willis goes to the empty hotel swimming pool. 

           He stands on the side, draws his hands up above him as if 
           about to make a graceful dive. 

           And then bellyflops in.  

           He swims a length underwater.  

           He comes up, gasping for air and rubbing his eyes. 

           At the far end of the pool, he sees Valerie exit the steam 
           room and walk along the poolside to the changing room.  

           Willis does not say anything, just watches her. 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           Willis getting dressed for his big moment. 
           He irons his shirt, puts on his best cuff-links and adjusts 
           his tie. 

           He then picks up his phone and dials a number. 

           His face falls as the call goes through to answerphone.

                                 WILLIS
                        Hi Susie. It’s Jeff. I just - I’m 
                        doing my talk today and I kind of - 
                        well, I was just calling so you 
                        could wish me luck. I am sure 
                        you’re thinking of me and you are 
                        probably just busy with something. 
                        I’ll see you soon. 
                            (Beat.)
                        Hey, maybe you’re actually on your 
                        way down here and you’re just going 
                        to surprise me? That’d be nice. 
                        But, I mean, I understand if you’re 
                        not. I just- 
                            (Beat.)
                        I don’t know if I already said so, 
                        but this was Jeff, by the way.  

           Willis hangs up the phone.

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

           Willis, dressed in his best suit, hurries in to the lobby. 

           It is bustling with delegates.  

           Amy is there, holding hands with a boy, DANNY. 

           DANNY is about sixteen. He is covered in tattoos and 
           piercings and he has a goatee beard. He is carrying a 
           longboard.

                                 WILLIS
                        Who is this?  

                                 AMY
                        Danny. He wants to come to the talk 
                        too. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve heard a lot about you, Jeff. 
                        The whole cashew nut thing sounds - 
                        well, I’m psyched.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Can I talk to you?
                                 AMY
                        Yes.

                                 WILLIS
                        Over there. 

                                 AMY
                        Excuse us a minute, Danny. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Who is that kid with the 
                        skateboard?

                                 AMY
                        It’s not a skateboard, it’s a 
                        longboard. And I told you already, 
                        that’s Danny. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yes, but who is Danny? 

                                 AMY
                        Just a boy I met.

                                 WILLIS
                        Where did you meet him? 

                                 AMY
                        On the street. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What do you mean you met him on the 
                        street? 

                                 AMY
                        We just kind of got talking.

                                 WILLIS
                        Why isn’t he in school? He should 
                        be in school. 

                                 AMY
                        He doesn’t go to school here. He 
                        goes to school in Des Moines.  

                                 WILLIS
                        So what is he doing here?

                                 AMY
                        Same thing we’re all doing in 
                        Frisco, Jeff. Looking for the 
                        pearl. 

           A bell is rung, signifying that the session is about to 
           start.  
           INT. AUDITORIUM - HOTEL - DAY

           The same auditorium as yesterday, tight on the stage.  

           The screen says: 

           THE HAZELNUT - A CINDERELLA STORY

           DR JEFF WILLIS, LEAD PEDIATRIC ALLERGIST, PORTLAND CHILDREN’S 
           HOSPITAL

           Willis approaches the lectern and starts to speak. 

                                 WILLIS
                        When people think of allergy-

           As Willis speaks he begins to look around the auditorium. 

           As he does so, something seems to catch in his throat. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        When people think of allergy- 

           We now see that - including Amy and Danny - there are only 
           about SEVEN PEOPLE in the entire auditorium. 

           One of them - an OLD MAN in the front row who appears to have 
           drifted in off the street - is already asleep.   

           Amy gives Willis an encouraging thumbs-up sign.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        When people think of allergy, they 
                        first of all think of the peanut. 
                        Very few people stop to consider 
                        the humble hazelnut, and yet- 

           A door noisily opens at the back of the room. 

           Willis looks up, hopefully, expectantly.  

           Valerie slips in and takes a seat. 

           INT. AUDITORIUM - HOTEL - DAY

           Willis is coming to the end of his talk. 

           He has his jacket off now, and the slide we saw him test on 
           Chen is displayed behind him.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        ...And in conclusion, we must never 
                        be hazy about hazelnut allergy. 

           Willis gives the auditorium his serious look, but it quickly 
           fades to an expression of disappointment.   
           There is a pause. 

           Amy starts eagerly clapping. 

           A few others join in.   

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Are there any questions?

           The few delegates present look impassive and disinterested.  

           Willis’ gloom visibly deepens.  

           Seeing this, Amy puts her hand up. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        The young lady in the middle there? 

                                 AMY
                        It’s not a question so much as a 
                        comment. I just wanted to say I 
                        thought this was really an 
                        excellent talk. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Thank you. 

           Willis smiles and nods and turns and walks off stage. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY

           Willis sits with Amy and Danny. 

           He has a large drink in front of him and he is staring 
           straight into the distance.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Do you know how long I spent 
                        preparing for that moment? Dreaming 
                        about it, planning it all out?

                                 DANNY 
                        A couple of hours? 

                                 WILLIS
                        A couple of hours? That’s what you 
                        think? That’s how long you think 
                        that took me?

                                 DANNY
                        A week?

                                 WILLIS
                        Ten years. Danny. A decade. What a 
                        goddamn waste. 
                                 AMY
                        It wasn’t a waste, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. It was. 

                                 AMY
                        Jeff, she came. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? Susie was here? Are you sure? 
                        I didn’t see-

                                 AMY
                        No. The child catcher wasn’t here. 
                        Valerie came. She likes you. 

                                 WILLIS
                        How would you even know that?

                                 AMY
                        Because I’m a woman.  

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re a girl. And I am married.   

                                 AMY
                        You’re separated. Your wife has 
                        asked you for a divorce. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? Who told you that?

                                 AMY
                        It’s a hospital. Kids talk. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Look, Susie and I might be 
                        separated. But we are still joined 
                        by a very special bond. If anything 
                        important happened, she would be 
                        there for me.  

                                 AMY
                        So where was she today? Or wasn’t 
                        this an important day for you? 

           On Willis, Amy’s words visibly having an impact on him. 

           Amy spots Valerie passing through the bar. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Valerie! Hi!

           Amy gets up and hugs Valerie. 
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry if I was weird yesterday. 
                        I’m on Tylenol. It makes me go 
                        completely loopy. This is my 
                        boyfriend, Danny. 

                                 WILLIS
                        He’s not her boyfriend. She met him 
                        on the street today. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s called spontaneity, Jeff. You 
                        haven’t heard of it, but some 
                        people find it helps them to stay 
                        alive.  

                                 WILLIS
                        My middle name is spontaneity.   

                                 AMY
                        So take us all to dinner in 
                        Chinatown to celebrate the occasion 
                        of you talking at the Congress of 
                        Allergists.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? Now? No. I can’t. We don’t 
                        have a reservation and-

           Amy is looking at Willis with her eyebrows raised. 

           She draws the sign for ‘square’ with her fingers.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Fine, fine. Somebody just call us a 
                        cab.

           INT. CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A cheap and cheerful restaurant in Chinatown.  

           Willis, Amy, Valerie and Danny all sit around a table at the 
           end of a meal. 

           Everybody is cracking up with laughter.  

                                 WILLIS
                        And then this girl at the desk 
                        says, you are in luck, it is nine 
                        hundred dollars! Before tax!

                                 VALERIE
                        It doesn’t sound so lucky, Jeff! 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, I sleep in the garage at 
                        home, so this is definitely better! 
           Everyone stops laughing at this.  

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh, since my wife and I separated, 
                        I sleep out in our garage. It’s 
                        fine. 

           The others look at him. Really?

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        I mean, it’d be better if I could 
                        go in the house after nine o’clock. 
                        But, you can’t have everything, 
                        right? Besides, modern camp beds 
                        are actually surprisingly 
                        comfortable.    

                                 VALERIE
                        I bet your nine hundred dollar bed 
                        is even more comfortable, Jeff.  

           Valerie fixes Willis with a sultry gaze as she reaches for 
           her wine glass. 

           And knocks it all over the table.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Here. Let me- 

           Willis dabs at her with a napkin. 

                                 VALERIE
                        I need to go the ladies room. 

           Valerie gets up and hurries away. 

                                 AMY
                        You should totally bone her 
                        tonight. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        Tell him, Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve been observing Valerie’s body 
                        language carefully. She wants to 
                        bone you.

                                 AMY
                        Danny is an expert in body 
                        language.   
                                 WILLIS
                        Well, I’m married. I made a vow. 
                        That doesn’t mean much at your age, 
                        but when you have spent as long 
                        being faithful as my wife and I 
                        have-   

                                 AMY
                        She makes you sleep in the garage!

                                 WILLIS
                        Our love is more complicated than 
                        you could ever understand. 

                                 AMY
                        Danny, could you excuse us for a 
                        minute? 

                                 DANNY 
                        Yeah, I knew you were going to say 
                        that. From your body language. 

           Danny gets up and heads to the restroom too.  

                                 WILLIS
                        What is this?

                                 AMY
                        Look, the thing is Jeff, there is 
                        no easy way to say this. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy, if this is the part where you 
                        tell me you are secretly in love 
                        with me, trust me, today has been 
                        more than bad enough already. Why 
                        don’t you just write a poem about 
                        me. And then, you know, burn it?  

                                 AMY
                        You know that guy at the hospital, 
                        Dr Melcher? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Of course I do. He’s my friend.  

                                 AMY
                        Oh. Is he a good friend? 

                                 WILLIS
                        He’s my only friend. 

                                 AMY
                        Right. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? What about him? 
                                 AMY
                        He’s kind of sleeping with your 
                        wife, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. I saw them going at it in the 
                        pathology lab. Sorry.

                                 WILLIS
                        What? How?

                                 AMY
                        Well, first of all they were kind 
                        of standing up, which was weird, 
                        but then he sort of-

                                 WILLIS
                        I meant how did you see them?

                                 AMY
                        Oh. I had to go there to get some 
                        blood drawn. 

           Willis stares into the distance.

                                 WILLIS
                        Melcher. I never thought of 
                        Melcher. Dalton, McQueen, Patel - I 
                        thought of all the others. One time 
                        I even asked her if it was Margaret 
                        Brown. 

           Willis looks at Amy, suddenly suspicious.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Why are you telling me this now? 

                                 AMY
                        Because you are wasting the best 
                        moments of your life, Jeff.  

                                 WILLIS
                        No I’m not. I wasted the best 
                        moments of my life long ago. 

                                 AMY
                        You didn’t. Do you know how I know 
                        that? 

                                 WILLIS
                        How do you know that?
                                 AMY
                        Because the past is the past and in 
                        the future we’ll all be dead, so 
                        all anybody has is the right now.   

                                 WILLIS
                        You’re not reading that from a 
                        fortune cookie, are you?

           Valerie returns from the bathroom and sits down.  

                                 VALERIE 
                        What did I miss?

           Amy and Willis both fall silent and stare at each other.  

           EXT. CHINATOWN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Willis talking on his phone outside the restaurant.

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not surprised you are not 
                        picking up, Ron. If I were you, I 
                        would not be picking up either. But 
                        I’m not angry. I’m just sad. All 
                        those times I came to you and told 
                        you about the problems Susie and I 
                        were having. And you listened and 
                        pretended you were concerned. And 
                        you were concerned, weren’t you? 
                        Because you’re such a good friend, 
                        Ron! Because you always had my 
                        back! I mean, you always had my 
                        back so you could stick your knife 
                        in! You are dead to me, Ron! 
                        Absolutely dead! And I swear to god 
                        when I see you I’m going to-  

           Willis turns and sees Valerie, Danny and Amy all staring at 
           him. 

           He presses the button to hang up the phone.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You guys ready to go home? 

                                 AMY
                        No. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 VALERIE
                        The night is still pretty young, 
                        Jeff. 
                                 WILLIS
                        It’s after eleven. The night is 
                        elderly. If it’s not elderly then 
                        it’s certainly middle aged.   

                                 AMY
                        Jeff, we are leaving tomorrow. Have 
                        you even seen any of the sights of 
                        Frisco?

                                 WILLIS
                        I’ve been to Chinatown. So yeah, I 
                        think I’ve done pretty well with 
                        the sights.

                                 AMY
                        What about the Golden Gate Bridge? 
                        What about the steep hills? What 
                        about the sea lions? Those are the 
                        things Frisco is famous for, and 
                        you’ve not seen any of them! 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’ll see them next time I’m here. 
                        It’s too late now.  

                                 VALERIE 
                        It’s not really too late, is it? 

                                 AMY
                        Live a little, Jeff! We’ll all be 
                        dead soon enough. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Alright, alright, fine. Let’s see 
                        the Bridge. Find us a taxi.  

           Amy whistles for a taxi.  

           INT. TAXI DRIVING OVER GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Willis sits in the front, Amy, Danny and Valerie squeezed in 
           the back.  

           They are driving over the golden gate bridge. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Isn’t it beautiful?

                                 WILLIS
                        You know, we have bridges in 
                        Portland that are nice too. 

                                 AMY
                        We don’t have bridges like this, 
                        Jeff. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah, maybe not. This one is pretty 
                        special.

           They gaze out the windows, everyone enjoying the beauty of 
           the structure, the lights, the water.   

           Willis turns to the driver. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Are we going to have drive all the 
                        way back over this thing, or is 
                        there another way around?

           Amy hits Willis from the back seat.

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        What? I just thought, you know, 
                        maybe there was a tunnel or 
                        something.  

           INT. TAXI - STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

           The taxi driving through streets of San Francisco.   

                                 DANNY
                        So what now? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Now we go back to the hotel. It’s 
                        late. 

           Willis smiles at Valerie and rolls his eyes: kids these days. 

                                 AMY
                        Hey! Stop the car! Stop the car!

           The taxi driver pulls over to the side of the road. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?  

                                 AMY
                        That place there! That’s the Sixth 
                        Gallery!  

           Willis looks sceptically at the place, an entrance to a 
           grungy-looking basement with a faded canopy that does indeed 
           say ‘Sixth Gallery’.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        It’s where Allen Ginsberg first 
                        performed ‘Howl’! Kerouac was too 
                        shy to read that night, so he just 
                        shouted out encouragement. Neal 
                        Cassady passed around the hat so 
                        they could buy more whiskey sours. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Great. And now we’ve seen it we can 
                        go home. 

                                 AMY
                        No! We have to go in there!

           Willis sighs and turns to Valerie.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Can you explain this to her, place? 

                                 VALERIE
                        Amy, this is where those writers 
                        you love used to hand out, right? 

                                 AMY
                        It’s where it all began! It’s where 
                        the Beat Generation was born!  

                                 VALERIE
                        Then what are waiting for?  

           Valerie gets out of the car. 

           Amy follows her. 

           Danny shrugs apologetically at Willis and gets out. 

           Willis turns to the DRIVER and counts out the far. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You shouldn’t have stopped. Next 
                        time, listen to the guy who is 
                        paying the fare, okay? I’m sure 
                        there is some kind of regulation 
                        about that.   

           INT. SIXTH GALLERY - NIGHT

           Inside, the Sixth Gallery is a dark and busy basement jazz 
           club. 

           The band on stage are a HIPSTER JAZZ GROUP. They are playing 
           loud, free-form jazz. The band - and indeed the place - are 
           the polar opposite of the hotel restaurant from the previous 
           night. 

           Amy, Danny, Valerie are taking in the scene as Willis 
           descends the stairs and joins them.  

                                 AMY
                        This is awesome.

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s very loud. 
                                 DANNY
                        Don’t you like it?

                                 AMY
                        Jeff was a flower child. He likes 
                        songs about unicorns sung by men 
                        who sound like women. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        What? No, I wasn’t. And no, I 
                        don’t.
                            (Sighs.)
                        What do you all want to drink? 

                                 AMY
                        What do you think we want? Whiskey 
                        sours.

                                 WILLIS
                        Okay. What do you want that doesn’t 
                        have any alcohol in it? 

                                 AMY
                        Really, Jeff? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Really, Amy.  

           Amy sighs. 

                                 AMY
                        Fine. Just get us jaegerbombs then.  

                                 WILLIS
                        What’s a jaegerbomb?

                                 AMY
                        Root beer and coke. You know, what 
                        little kids drink? 

           Willis turns to Valerie. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Whiskey sour? 

                                 VALERIE
                        Sounds great. 

           INT. SIXTH GALLERY - A LITTLE LATER - NIGHT

           The four of them sit at a table, watching the band who are 
           really rocking out.  

           Eight empty glasses on the table show that they have been 
           here a little while and have had a couple of rounds. 

           A WAITRESS is passing nearby. 
                                 AMY
                        Can we have one more round? 

           Willis looks at Valerie. She shrugs at him: why the hell not?  

                                 WILLIS
                        Miss! Two jaegerbombs and two 
                        whiskey sours please. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Coming up.

           Valerie now stands up and pulls Willis towards the dance 
           floor. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh no. That’s not. I mean. I don’t 
                        really. I have a ligament thing and-

           Valerie puts a finger to her lips and leads Willis to the 
           area in front of the stage where a few people are dancing. 

           Valerie starts to dance. Her style is highly idiosyncratic, 
           but she is so completely unselfconscious that it looks good.    

           Willis himself now starts to move. He begins very stiff but, 
           inspired by Valerie’s example, starts to loosen up.  

           Now the TENOR SAX PLAYER takes a solo and Valerie closes her 
           eyes and starts to really go for it. 

           She is so lost in the music, so at one with the moment, that 
           Willis stops dancing and simply stares at her.  

           He takes a step backwards to give her more space, and finds 
           himself backing into the BOUNCER. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        You folks have to leave now. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? We just got here. Look how 
                        much she’s enjoying herself. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        You’ve been giving alcohol to 
                        minors.  

                                 WILLIS
                        They’ve only been drinking 
                        jaegerbombs. They’re just root beer 
                        and coke. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        They’re jaegermeister and red bull. 

           On Willis as he realizes.
           Willis looks across to where Amy and Danny are standing - 
           with their coats already on and looking a little sheepish - 
           at the edge of the dancefloor.  

           Willis looks sternly at Amy. She looks solemnly back at him.

           Amy goes first, breaking into a smile.  

           Willis starts to smile too but quickly looks away in an 
           attempt to prevent Amy seeing this. 

           EXT. NOB HILL - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

           Nob Hill. Amy and Danny lead the way, then Valerie, then 
           Willis straggling behind. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You know, this can’t actually be 
                        the right way to our hotel. You do 
                        all realize that?

                                 AMY
                        What makes you say that, Jeff? 

                                 WILLIS
                        What makes me say that is our hotel 
                        isn’t up a huge hill. That’s kind 
                        of the clue.  

           Amy and Danny have reached the top of the hill. 

           They turn back and stare at the view behind them. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Valerie. You seem like someone who 
                        would understand basic geography- 

           Valerie has now reached the top and has also turned back to 
           look at the view.  

                                 VALERIE 
                        Uh, Jeff-

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Shhhhh.  

           Willis who has now joined them at the top, turns back and 
           looks down the hill too, so the four of them are now stood in 
           a line. 

           Spread out beneath them are the night-time lights of the 
           city, and beyond those the bay and then the sea. It is 
           breathtakingly beautiful. 
           They stare at it in wonder for a some moments. 

                                 AMY
                        You know what you should do? You 
                        guys should have a shot on Danny’s 
                        longboard. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? No. You should. You’re 
                        younger and-

                                 AMY
                        I already did. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? When? 

                                 AMY
                        We came up here this morning.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Look how steep it is, Amy! You 
                        could have been killed! 

                                 AMY
                        That’s pretty much the fun of it. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, did you even have a helmet?

                                 AMY
                        Uh, let me see. No. 

                                 WILLIS
                        You went all the way down there 
                        without a helmet? 

                                 VALERIE 
                        I’m game if you are, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Go down there on a skateboard? At 
                        my age? Are you insane?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s a longboard, Jeff. If you sit 
                        down it is actually technically 
                        impossible to hurt yourself. Even 
                        for a guy in his sixties.  

                                 WILLIS
                        What? I’m not in my sixties! Is 
                        that what you think?   

                                 DANNY
                        Well, most people that were at the 
                        Summer of Love-
                                 WILLIS
                        Look, I was not at the Summer of 
                        Love! I was three years old in 
                        1967!  

           Valerie takes the longboard from Danny and sits down on the 
           back of it.  

                                 VALERIE
                        We’re only here tonight, Jeff. 
                        It’ll be fun.  

           Willis shakes his head and grudgingly sits down at the front 
           of the longboard.

                                 WILLIS
                        Why do I have to go at the front? 

                                 VALERIE
                        In case we crash into anything.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Okay, look, if we just don’t go too 
                        fast, then-

           Valerie uses her legs to push them off very firmly. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        What did you do that for? 

                                 VALERIE 
                        I was getting us going!

           They start picking up speed and both start to scream, Valerie 
           with joy, Willis with something a little closer to terror.  

                        VALERIE 
                                                       WILLIS
           Yeaahhhhhh!
                                            Aaarrgghhh!

           They hurtle down the pavements, people jumping out of the 
           way. 

           The wind is in their hair as they go, faster all the time.    

           Amy and Danny are behind them. 

                                 VALERIE (CONT’D)
                        Go left!

                                 WILLIS
                        I can’t! There’s no steering wheel!

                                 VALERIE
                        Lean then! 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m already leaning! You lean! 
           They crash into a lamppost. It looks bad. 

           Valerie gets up, a little dazed.  

           Willis remains lying on his back. 

                                 AMY
                        Jeff!

           Willis has not moved since the crash. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Jeff? Oh my god, Jeff? Are you 
                        okay? 

           As Amy arrives she finds Willis still lying on his back but 
           laughing and staring up at the stars.   

                                 WILLIS
                        I want another shot.  

                                 AMY
                        I don’t think Danny will let you.

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, how much do those things 
                        cost? 

                                 AMY
                        A hundred bucks. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’ll take two. 

           Willis stands up, still laughing. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        That was great. That was really 
                        something.  

           Amy stares at Willis. 

                                 AMY 
                        Did you just have fun, Jeff?

                                 WILLIS
                        What? No. No. No, that wasn’t fun. 
                        I mean- 

                                 AMY
                        You had fun, admit it! 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not admitting anything. Find us 
                        a taxi, would you? 

           Amy looks at Willis with disappointment.  
                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been in Frisco two whole days 
                        and I’ve not seen a single goddamn 
                        sea lion yet.   

           Amy looks delighted.  

           EXT. ENTRANCE TO PIER 39 - NIGHT

           A taxi pulls away leaving Willis, Valerie, Amy and Danny at 
           the locked entrance to Pier 39.  

                                 WILIS
                        Well, that’s too bad. 

                                 DANNY
                        Wait here.

           Danny scales a nearby fence with a speed that suggests he has 
           done this on more than one occasion before.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        What’s he doing? 

                                 AMY
                        Relax. Danny knows what he is 
                        doing. 

                                 WILLIS
                        That is kind of what is concerning 
                        me.

           A moment later the gate is opened from the inside. 

                                 DANNY
                        What are you guys waiting out here 
                        for?

           EXT. PIER 39 - NIGHT

           Willis, Valerie, Danny and Amy sit on the boardwalk near the 
           SEA LIONS.

           They stare at the sea lions. Up this close they are amazing 
           creatures: filthy and belching and yet somehow grotesquely 
           beautiful.  

                                 WILLIS
                        You know, despite the name, sea 
                        lions are actually closer to the 
                        seal family than the lion family. 
                        It’s kind of a secret we scientists 
                        keep to ourselves.  

                                 VALERIE 
                        Why? 
                                 WILLIS
                        Mainly for these guys. 

                                 VALERIE
                        What?

                                 WILLIS
                        Think about it, Valerie. If this 
                        was just a bunch of seals out here 
                        lazing around all day and stinking 
                        the place out and getting in the 
                        way of shipping then, well, people 
                        wouldn’t be nearly so tolerant of 
                        them. Throw in the lion part, 
                        though, you can do what you like. 
                        We actually run a similar programme 
                        with the mountain lion.

           Valerie pushes Jeff affectionately. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Did anybody ever tell you how 
                        ridiculous you are?  

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, yeah, quite a lot. But I 
                        think I prefer the way you say it.   

           They are interrupted by a flashlight shining in their faces 
           and the crackle of a bullhorn. 

                                 COP 
                        SFPD! Keep your hands where we can 
                        see them!

           INT. POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT

           A police precinct busy with WEARY COPS and LATE NIGHT 
           MISCREANTS. 

           Inisde an office, a UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER is interviewing 
           Willis And Valerie. A window gives on to corridor, where Amy 
           and Danny are sitting. 

                                 OFFICER 
                        Okay. So we’ve got breaking and 
                        entering and misdemeanor possession 
                        of marijuana.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Marijuana? What? Who had marijuana? 

                                 OFFICER
                        The boy with the skateboard. 

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s a longboard. 
           The Officer looks at Willis. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        We’re not with that kid. He’s from 
                        Iowa.

                                 OFFICER
                        You’re not in loco parentis?  

                                 WILLIS
                        Of that guy? No. We’ve never seen 
                        him before in our lives.

                                 OFFICER
                        That’s a pity. See, I could have 
                        let him off with a warning, but if 
                        he’s an unaccompanied minor-

                                 VALERIE 
                        He’s my nephew. 

           Through the window, Willis sees that Amy and Danny have 
           started kissing. He starts banging on the window. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Hey! 

                                 OFFICER 
                        Sir? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Could you get them to knock that 
                        off please? You can Taser them if 
                        you like. 

                                 OFFICER
                        What relation is the girl to you, 
                        Sir? 

                                 WILLIS
                        She’s my patient. 

                                 OFFICER
                        What? 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m a children’s doctor. Amy is my 
                        patient.

                                 OFFICER
                        And, uh, what’s wrong with her?

                                 WILLIS
                        She’s dying of brain cancer. 

                                 OFFICER
                        I’m sorry, you broke into the pier 
                        with a kid with cancer?  
                                 WILLIS
                        She wanted to see the sea lions.

           Willis sees this is not cutting any ice. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        We’re working on behalf of a 
                        charity called Moonbeams-Make-A-
                        Wish to make the dreams of 
                        terminally ill children come true.  

           Out in the corridor, Amy and Danny are all over each other. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Knock it off, would you! 

                                 OFFICER
                        A registered charity was involved 
                        with this?

                                 WILLIS
                        Officer. I’m a children’s doctor. 
                        Do you really think I’m the kind of 
                        man that would break into a pier 
                        with a girl dying of brain cancer 
                        and a long-boarding pothead from 
                        Iowa just for kicks?  

           The Officer sighs and wearily commences to write up his 
           notes.

           EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

           Willis, Danny, Amy and Valerie get out of a cab outside the 
           hotel.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Are you going to be okay to get 
                        home? 

                                 DANNY
                        What? I’m coming up, amn’t I?   

                                 WILLIS
                        No. 

                                 DANNY
                        So it goes. I’m pretty much a hobo 
                        anyway. It’s all good.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Where are you actually going to 
                        sleep, though?

                                 DANNY
                        My cousin has a condo in Russian 
                        Hill. Goodnight.   
           Danny and Amy kiss.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Come on, come on, please don’t do 
                        that.

           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Willis, Amy and Valerie ascending in the lift.  

           Awkward silence. 

           The lift pings as it reaches a floor. 

                                 WILLIS
                        So I guess this is your-

                                 VALERIE
                            (Interrupts.)
                        Room 422. 
                            (Beat.)
                        Oh. Yeah. This is my floor. 
                        Goodnight. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Goodnight. 

           Valerie gets out of the lift, somehow managing to stumble as 
           she does so.  

           Other GUESTS get in and the lift continues to ascend.  

           Amy elbows Willis in the ribs. 

           Willis elbows Amy in the ribs.  

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - WILLIS’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Willis lies awake in his room. 

           He looks at the clock. 

           When it changes from 0329 to 0330 he throws back the covers 
           and gets up. 

           We see he still has all his clothes on. 

           Willis tiptoes out of the room. 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Willis tiptoes out of the suite, gently closing the door 
           behind him.    
           INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROOM 422 - NIGHT

           Willis knocks on the door of Room 422. 

           Valerie, now wearing a hotel robe and no longer wearing her 
           glasses, opens the door. 

           Willis stares at her. 

           She stares back. 

           We think they are locked in a passionate gaze.

                                 VALERIE 
                        Who’s there, please? I don’t have 
                        my glasses. 

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s Doctor Jeff. Doctor Willis. 
                        Jeff Willis. Jeff. It’s Jeff.  

           Valerie leaps forward and starts furiously kissing Willis.

           After a few moments of this she drags him into the room and 
           closes the door behind them. 

           INT. VALERIE’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           A single, cramped hotel room of the eighty-two dollar 
           variety.

           Daylight streaming in from the windows. 

           Valerie is sleeping on the bed.

           Willis is creeping around the room, picking his clothes up 
           and quietly putting them back on.  

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

           Willis, still carrying his shoes, creeps back into his suite. 

           He closes the door quietly and then tiptoes across the room. 

                                 AMY (O.C.)
                        Busted, Jeff. Totally busted. 

           Willis spins around to see Amy sat on the couch.

                                 WILLIS
                        Morning. I popped down to the gym. 
                        Did a few circuits. 

                                 AMY
                        In the clothes you had on last 
                        night.
           Willis stops, seems to hear something. 

           Danny appears in the doorway of one of the bedrooms, a towel 
           wrapped around his waits.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Danny? Why are you here? 

                                 AMY
                        It’s nine hundred and twelve 
                        dollars a night, Jeff. If you’re 
                        not going to sleep here, we have to 
                        get Anne her money’s worth somehow. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Wait. Did you two-

                                 AMY
                        Every terminally ill child deserves 
                        to have a wish come true, Jeff.  

           Willis puts up his hand and shakes his head. He does not want 
           to hear any more, does not want to think about it. 

           INT. HOTEL BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY

           Willis, Amy and Danny all sit at a table in the hotel dining 
           room having breakfast.  

           Danny notices that Amy is not eating. 

                                 DANNY
                        Why aren’t you eating anything?

                                 WILLIS
                        She’d only puke it up later. 

           A moment of silence. 

           Willis glances at Amy. Doesn’t Danny know? 

                                 AMY 
                        Yeah. I didn’t tell you this yet, 
                        but I have cancer.

                                 DANNY
                        I just thought you were bulimic. 
                        Can they treat it? 

                                 AMY
                        No. 

                                 DANNY
                        Bummer.  

                                 AMY
                        Yeah.
           EXT. UNION HOTEL - DAY

           Willis packs the bags into the boot of a taxi. 

           He looks back at the hotel and sees Amy smooching with Danny. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Amy. Come on, Amy. We’re going to 
                        be late. 

           Amy does not stop kissing Danny but detaches a hand from his 
           embrace just long enough to give Willis the finger.   

           Valerie emerges from the hotel with all her copious luggage. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Hi.

           Willis is visibly uncomfortable.

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m sorry for I didn’t wake you 
                        this morning, I-

                                 VALERIE
                        It’s okay, Jeff. I wasn’t actually 
                        planning on marrying you.  

                                 WILLIS
                        No, I didn’t, I mean-

                                 VALERIE
                        You can put yourself down as a 
                        vacation romance.

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh.

                                 VALERIE
                        Also I’m pretty sure you’re married 
                        already. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, there is that.

                                 VALERIE
                        But it was nice to meet you, Jeff.

                                 WILLIS
                        It was nice to meet you too.

           Valerie kisses Willis on the cheek then walks away. 

           Willis watches her go, struggling with her luggage, and 
           imagines how another life could be.  

           In the background, Amy is still vigorously kissing Danny. 
                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Amy! You’ll catch Mono. Or Herpes. 
                        Possibly CMV. Maybe even Hepatitis 
                        C.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           The flight from SFO to PDX is quiet. 

           Willis and Amy sit near the back. His trusty insulated cup of 
           coffee is sitting on the tray in front of him.  

           They are both wearing AIRLINE EYE MASKS and Willis is using 
           an inflatable travel pillow. 

                                 WILLIS 
                        Have you thought about where you’re 
                        going to live when we go back? 

                                 AMY
                        I was hoping I could come and live 
                        with you.  

                                 WILLIS
                        I live in the garage, Amy. And I 
                        have these daughters. They’re kind 
                        of mean and-

                                 AMY
                        I’m kidding. I’ll go back to the 
                        hospital. And then if I’m still 
                        alive in a fortnight me and Danny 
                        are going to elope to Alaska. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Why Alaska?

                                 AMY
                        Because why not Alaska?

                                 WILLIS
                        He’s a nice kid, Danny. From Iowa, 
                        but, you know, otherwise okay.    

                                 AMY
                        Do you know who else was nice? 
                        Valerie. 

                                 WILLIS
                        That situation wasn’t what you 
                        thought it was. 

                                 AMY
                        A random hook-up? 
                                 WILLIS
                        Yes. No. It wasn’t a random hook-
                        up. We’d known each other for a 
                        while and-

                                 AMY
                        You met her at the cabstand two 
                        days ago.  

                                 WILLIS
                        People experience time as a 
                        percentage. It goes faster when you 
                        are older. But that’s not what is 
                        important. 

                                 AMY
                        What is important? 

                                 WILLIS
                        It was just. I had to get it out of 
                        my system. What you told me about 
                        Susie and Melcher. I think I just 
                        needed to, I don’t know, even up 
                        the scores. And now I did that, 
                        well, Susie and I can have a real 
                        go at sorting things out. Of 
                        course, I’ll still need to kill my 
                        so-called friend Melcher, but that 
                        is a small price to pay.  

           Amy does not say anything for a moment. 

                                 AMY
                        Um, Jeff, about that stuff?  

                                 WILLIS
                        About what? 

                                 AMY
                        That stuff. It kind of wasn’t 
                        really true. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. I kind of made it up. Sorry. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        I didn’t see them doing anything.

           Willis takes his eye mask off. 
                                 WILLIS
                        What? Wait, my wife wasn’t sleeping 
                        with Melcher?

           Amy - still wearing her eye mask - shakes her head. 

           Willis is completely horrified as he thinks through the 
           implications: Susie, the phone call he made to Melcher.   

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        But why, why would you make 
                        something like that up?

                                 AMY
                        Because you needed to live a 
                        little, Jeff. 

           Willis takes Amy’s eye mask off. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        You needed to get laid. I did it 
                        for you. I wanted to set you free. 
                        I wanted to help you feel something 
                        again. 

                                 WILLIS
                        It didn’t work. 

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 WILLIS
                        I didn’t feel anything. 

                                 AMY
                        Yes, you did. 

                                 WILLIS
                        No, I didn’t. And why did you have 
                        to pick my only friend? 

                                 AMY
                        That was an unfortunate 
                        coincidence. He was just the most 
                        ridiculous person I could think of. 
                        I didn’t know he was your only 
                        friend. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Just don’t talk to me. Don’t say 
                        anything else ever again. 

           Willis pulls his eye mask down. 

           Amy sighs and then pulls her eye mask down too.  
           EXT. TAXI DRIVING THROUGH PORTLAND STREETS - NIGHT

           Willis and Amy in the back of a taxi driving through 
           Portland. 

           Amy glances across at Willis. 

                                 AMY
                        Jeff? Are you more or less mad with 
                        me than you were on the train?

                                 WILLIS
                        More. Way more. A vast amount more. 

                                 AMY
                        Right. I mean, it’s just good to 
                        know. To have some sort of scale.   

                                 WILLIS
                        It’s not even on the same scale. 
                        It’s exponentially different. 

                                 AMY
                        I don’t know what exponentially 
                        means.

                                 WILLIS
                        It means a massive amount. A 
                        goddamn massive amount, Amy.    

           Amy is visibly upset by this. When she next speaks, we 
           understand she is fighting back tears. 

                                 AMY
                        I was doing it for you, Jeff. I 
                        thought you’d be grateful. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Okay, next time, do me a favour? 
                        Don’t do anything for me!

                                 AMY
                        Oh, I won’t. You don’t have to 
                        worry about that. 

           EXT. GARAGE - WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Willis pays the taxi off in front of his house. 

           He opens the garage door. 

           The garage looks miserable, Willis’ pathetic camp-bed crammed 
           in front of the freezer, the fishing rods etc.    

           Willis sighs and puts his overnight bag down. 
           EXT. BACK DOOR - WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Willis knocks on the back door. 

           Susie opens it.  

                                 SUSIE 
                        It’s after nine, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I just got back from San Francisco.

                                 SUSIE
                        Welcome back. It’s still after 
                        nine.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Can I come in? I need to talk to 
                        you.  

                                 SUSIE
                        You’ll have to be quiet. The girls 
                        will go nuts if they catch you in 
                        here.

           INT. KITCHEN - WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Willis and Susie sit across the table from each other.   

                                 SUSIE
                        What can I do for you, Jeff?

                                 WILLIS
                        I have a confession to make. It’s 
                        something very serious.  

                                 SUSIE
                        You haven’t killed anybody, have 
                        you?

                                 WILLIS
                        No. It’s worse than that.

                                 SUSIE
                        Jesus Christ, Jeff. What did you 
                        do?   

                                 WILLIS
                        When I was in San Francisco I slept 
                        with someone. It was an accident. I 
                        mean, it wasn’t strictly speaking 
                        an accident but-

                                 SUSIE
                        Who was this person?
                                 WILLIS
                        Her name was Valerie. It didn’t 
                        mean anything. It was fun, but it 
                        didn’t mean anything. I didn’t 
                        actually even feel- 

           Susie sits back, shrugs and smiles at Willis. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Good for you, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What?

                                 SUSIE
                        I said ‘good for you’.

                                 WILLIS
                        Aren’t you angry?

                                 SUSIE
                        No.

                                 WILLIS
                        Jealous?

                                 SUSIE
                        No.

                                 WILLIS
                        Upset?

                                 SUSIE
                        No. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Even a little bit any of the above?

                                 SUSIE
                        I’m pleased, Jeff. You did 
                        something. You got out there and 
                        did something. I’ve been telling 
                        you for months that our marriage is 
                        over. Now, if you could just please 
                        run away with someone, that would 
                        be even better.  

                                 WILLIS
                        That’s really how you feel? 

                                 SUSIE
                        That’s really how I feel. 

           Willis digests this. It hurts, but is somehow liberating too.  
                                 WILLIS
                            (Hopefully.)
                        You’re not by any chance sleeping 
                        with Melcher, are you?

                                 SUSIE
                        I’m not sleeping with Melcher, 
                        Jeff. You’d better get back to the 
                        garage now.

           Willis is heading out the door. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Jeff?

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah?

                                 SUSIE
                        You can take the girls to the game 
                        this week. I think it’d do you all 
                        good to spend some time with each 
                        other. They miss you.   

                                 WILLIS
                        They get mad when I come in the 
                        house. If they miss me, they could 
                        just let me come in and-

                                 SUSIE
                        They miss the old you. We all do.  

           INT. CHILDREN’S WARD - DAY

           Willis and Chen stand at the end of the bed of a SEVEN YEAR 
           OLD GIRL.   

           Willis is wearing his Goofy tie and drinking coffee from his 
           insulated cup. 

           Willis’ gaze is wandering off to the door to Amy’s room.  

                                 CHEN
                        Melissa presented with 
                        gastroenteritis. She has had forty-
                        eight hours of diarrhoea and-

                                 WILLIS
                            (Interrupts.)
                        Why didn’t we see Amy Morrison this 
                        morning? 

                                 CHEN
                        She requested Dr Turner take over 
                        her care again.
                                 WILLIS
                        Oh. How is she? 

                                 CHEN
                        She had another seizure last night.

                                 WILLIS
                        Maybe we should pop in and say 
                        hello. 

                                 CHEN
                        Amy and her stepmother have said 
                        they’ll put in a complaint if you 
                        approach her. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Right. 

                                 CHEN
                        Anyway, this girl with 
                        gastroenteritis-

           Willis stares at the door to Amy’s room.  

           INT. MARGARET BROWN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Willis sits in Margaret Brown’s office. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Do you know why I have asked you 
                        down here, Jeff?

                                 WILLIS
                        Am I being presented with an award 
                        of some kind?  

                                 MARGARET
                        We have an issue, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What is that? 

                                 MARGARET
                        We have some parents who are on the 
                        verge of making a formal complaint 
                        against you.

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, that’s obviously a case of 
                        mistaken identity. I’ve not even 
                        been here. I’ve been in San 
                        Francisco. 

                                 MARGARET
                        It dates from before your trip. 
                                 WILLIS
                        Oh. Who is it? 

                                 MARGARET
                        Mr and Mrs Lakovic. They brought 
                        their child to be vaccinated by you 
                        last week.

                                 WILLIS
                        And did I vaccinate it?

                                 MARGARET
                        Her. Yes. 

                                 WILLIS
                        So what are they complaining about?  

                                 MARGARET
                        Your interaction with them and your 
                        general attitude. But I’ve managed 
                        to square it with them that if you 
                        apologize to them then they won’t 
                        proceed to a formal complaint.

                                 WILLIS
                        Is that everything?

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes. 

           INT. MORTUARY - DAY

           Willis enters the mortuary.  

                                 WILLIS
                        Hey, Ron. 

           Melcher gets up and hurries around the other side of the 
           dissection table in order to put some distance between him 
           and Willis.  

                                 MELCHER
                        I didn’t do it, Jeff. I don’t know 
                        what you think I did or why, but I 
                        didn’t do it. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I know, Ron. 

                                 MELCHER
                        You’re not just pretending so that 
                        I’ll come over there and then you 
                        can attack me?
                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not just pretending so that 
                        you’ll come over here and then I 
                        can attack you. Can we drink a 
                        beer? 

           Melcher eyes Willis suspiciously and then nods to the 
           mortuary drawer.  

           Willis opens it, takes out two beers and passes one to 
           Melcher. 

           INT. WILLIS CAR - DRIVING ON FREMONT BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Willis driving his car, stuck in traffic on the Fremont 
           bridge.  

           Alexis and Blake are both sitting in the back, wearing their 
           cheerleader uniforms.  

                                 BLAKE 
                        Why is your car so gross?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Yeah. And Mom says you’re having an 
                        affair. 

                                 WILLIS
                        What? That’s not true. You two know 
                        you and your mother are the only 
                        women in my life. 

                                 BLAKE
                        Eugh. 

                                 ALEXIS 
                        Douchebag. 

                                 BLAKE
                        You know who Mom should start 
                        seeing? Bill Drake.  

                                 ALEXIS
                        Totally. His car is awesome.

                                 BLAKE
                        Yeah. Why don’t you have a car like 
                        Bill Drake’s?

                                 WILLIS 
                        I’m a paediatrician. Bill Drake is 
                        an eye surgeon. Our jobs reward us 
                        in different ways. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        Yeah. Bill Drake’s job rewards him 
                        with actual money. 
           Willis looks out the window towards where the Portland 
           Children’s advertisement was.  

           He does a double take when he sees it has been replaced with 
           a POSTER that says ‘VISIT SAN FRANCISCO!’.

           The photographs on it include NOB HILL, the GOLDEN GATE 
           BRIDGE and the PIER 39 SEA LIONS.  

                                 BLAKE
                        Hey Dad, You never brought us back 
                        our money from San Francisco.  

                                 ALEXIS
                        Yeah. You should probably give us 
                        extra. For interest. 

                                 BLAKE
                        And a surcharge for having an 
                        affair. 

           Willis pulls the car over to the side of the road. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        What are you doing, Dad? 

                                 WILLIS 
                        You guys are getting out. 

                                 BLAKE
                        What? What are you talking about?

                                 WILLIS
                        There is an emergency at the 
                        hospital. I have to go there now.  

                                 ALEXIS
                        Really?  

                                 WILLIS
                        Really. 

                                 ALEXIS
                        It just seems a little odd that 
                        nobody called you or paged you. 

                                 WILLIS
                        They called earlier. I just forgot 
                        until now.  

                                 BLAKE
                        Mom is going to freak.

                                 WILLIS
                        You both have phones and I know 
                        that because I pay the bills. You 
                        can call a cab. 
           The girls get out and Willis drives off.  

           INT. CHILDREN’S WARD  - NIGHT

           Willis enters the ward. 

           As he approaches Amy’s room, Chen emerges from it. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Lucia? What’s going on? 

                                 CHEN
                        Amy has been having more seizures.  

                                 WILLIS 
                        How many?

                                 CHEN
                        Five or six. I was just going to 
                        call Dr Turner.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Don’t call her. 

                                 CHEN
                        But I-

                                 WILLIS
                        What do you think she is going to 
                        be able to do?  

                                 CHEN
                        I thought she might want me to run 
                        some tests. 

           Willis shakes his head and enters the room. 

           INT. AMY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 

           Willis enters Amy’s room.

           She is in bed, looks pale, sweaty and drowsy.  

                                 AMY 
                        Am I dying, Jeff? 

           Willis studies her chart.

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah.  

                                 AMY
                        Well, that really sucks.

                                 WILLIS
                        Do you want me to call Anne?
           Amy shakes her head. 

                                 AMY
                        Why are you even here, anyway? I’m 
                        pretty sure I fired you. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I actually came by to say thank 
                        you.

                                 AMY
                        For what?

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, you know, paying for the 
                        hotel suite. Some other stuff too.

                                 AMY
                        Are you thanking me for telling you 
                        your wife was sleeping with 
                        Melcher?

                                 WILLIS
                        Mainly for paying for the hotel 
                        suite. But the other thing too. A 
                        little bit. 

                                 AMY
                        We’ll always have Frisco, Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Is there anything I can do? Are you 
                        sure you don’t need me to call 
                        anyone? Do you maybe need some 
                        water or your feet massaged or- 

                                 AMY
                        You could read to me, Jeff.  

           Willis looks puzzled, but then sees the paperback copy of ‘On 
           the Road’ on the bedside table and understands. 

           He picks it up and begins to read.

                                 WILLIS 
                            (Reads.)
                        I first met Dean Moriarty not long 
                        after my wife and I split up. I had 
                        just gotten over a serious illness 
                        that I won’t bother to talk about, 
                        except that it had something to do 
                        with the miserably weary split-up 
                        and my feeling that everything was 
                        dead. With the coming of Dean 
                        Moriarty began the part of my life 
                        you could call my life on the 
                        road...
           Amy has closed her eyes and rested back on the pillow.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAWN

           Willis emerges from Amy’s hospital room and closes the door 
           behind him. 

           Something about the weary way he moves tells us Amy has 
           passed away. 

           It is morning now, CHARLIE wheeling his IV stand to the 
           bathrooms, the DAY STAFF arriving in, the first CLEANERS 
           getting to work.  

           INT. WILLIS CAR - DRIVING ON FREMONT BRIDGE - DAY

           Willis drives home across the Fremont Bridge. 

           Going this way there is no traffic.  

           EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - DAY 

           Willis gets out of the car. 

           He walks up the stairs to his front door. 

           INT. WILLIS HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 

           Willis enters the hallway. 

           As soon as he closes the door Susie, Blake and Alexis 
           converge on him from various rooms.

           Alexis, just of the shower, has a towel wrapped around her 
           head. Blake is cleaning her teeth with an electric 
           toothbrush. Susie has her skirt and blouse on, but they are 
           not yet fully buttoned up.  

                                 SUSIE
                        Jesus Christ, Jeff. The girls are 
                        saying you left them on the freeway 
                        last night? 

                                 BLAKE 
                        It’s before eight-fifteen, Dad!

                                 ALEXIS
                        You shouldn’t be in here before 
                        eight-fifteen!

           Willis walks straight past them all, through to the kitchen. 

           Willis takes a BEER out of the fridge opens it and pours it 
           into a glass.   
           He then does the same with ANOTHER BEER and walks upstairs 
           holding his two full glasses of beer.  

           His family have followed him, though they have now fallen 
           silent.  

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Willis walks into the guest room carrying his two beers. 

           He closes the door behind him, shutting the door on his wife 
           and children.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A small church, a WHITE COFFIN at the front overlaid with a 
           simple wreath and a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO OF AMY.

           The photograph is a recent one, but Amy looks surprisingly 
           young; in life the force of her personality made her seem 
           older than she really was.  

           A MINISTER stands at a lectern, addressing a SMALL 
           CONGREGATION: Willis, Susie, Anne, Melcher, a couple of 
           Nurses, a few others.  

                                 MINISTER 
                        Our music today was all selected by 
                        Amy herself. I’m not sure it is 
                        what any of us would have chosen, 
                        but it is what Amy wanted and that 
                        is what is important. This first 
                        song is at least a short one. 

           A moment later, the music starts.  

           It is some kind of awful THRASH METAL DIRGE. 

           The congregation are mostly bemused. 

           Anne is horrified and seems about to cry.   

           Willis is smiling. He gets that Amy was just trying to piss 
           people off.  

           The music finishes.

                                 MINISTER (CONT’D)
                        Normally I would say a few words of 
                        eulogy at this point, but when I 
                        visited her in hospital Amy said 
                        that organized religion was all a 
                        lot of, well, the only person she 
                        wanted to speak today was her 
                        pediatrician, Doctor Jeff Willis. 
                        Dr Willis? 
           This is clearly news to Willis, who glances behind him then 
           taps his chest in a ‘Who, me?’ kind of gesture.  

           The minister nods. 

           Willis reluctantly comes up to the lectern.

                                 WILLIS
                        Well, this is, unexpected. I mean, 
                        really unexpected. A eulogy. Jesus. 
                        I don’t actually know what to say. 
                        Amy and I only knew each other 
                        towards the end of her life so the 
                        first fifteen years of it - well, 
                        who knows what happened there? 
                        Obviously at some point her Mom 
                        died, and then her Dad married Anne 
                        and then he died, but Amy didn’t 
                        get along with Anne so- 

           Willis sees Anne looking at him.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Maybe she wanted me to talk 
                        medically? Well, this tumour Amy 
                        had, it was really an aggressive 
                        one. There was not much you could 
                        do about it. I mean, a few years 
                        ago there was some experimental 
                        work from France on a mouse model 
                        that looked quite promising, but 
                        since then-  

           Willis looks out at the blank faces of the crowd.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        What am I doing? Amy didn’t want me 
                        to talk medically. She wanted me to 
                        talk about who she was.

           Willis takes a deep breath and looks out at the congregation. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        Well, Amy Morrison was fifteen 
                        years old. She liked Jack Kerouac 
                        and she took absolutely no shit 
                        from anybody. She would have made 
                        more of even one more week of life 
                        than any of us in this room have 
                        done in years and even though I 
                        only knew her for a short time she 
                        was my friend and I am going to 
                        miss the absolute hell out of her.  

           Willis nods at the Minister then gets down from the lectern. 

           Willis takes his place back in the pew. He has not cried. 
                                 MINISTER 
                        Amy had requested that we play one 
                        more song.   

           The music comes on. 

           Gently strummed melodic chords. They sound vaguely familiar, 
           but initially nobody can quite place the song.  

           On Willis as the words start. 

           The song is ‘San Francisco’ by Scott McKenzie. 

                                 SCOTT MCKENZIE (LYRICS)
                        If you’re going to San Francisco
                        Be sure to wear some flowers in 
                        your hair, 
                        If you’re going to San Francisco
                        You’re going to meet some gentle 
                        people there.

           On Willis.

           He does not want to. 

           He looks around. 

           He is going to make sure that he does not.  

           But then he starts to tear up. 

                                 SCOTT MCKENZIE (LYRICS) (CONT’D)
                        For those who come to San Francisco
                        Summertime will be a love-in there
                        In the streets of San Francisco
                        Gentle people with flowers in their 
                        hair.

           And then Willis is openly weeping, the first time in years. 

           Willis is crying so hard that several other members of the 
           congregation turn to look at him.  

           INT. WILLIS’ CAR ON FREMONT BRIDGE - DAY

           Willis - dressed for work in his Goofy tie - drives over the 
           Fremont Bridge in busy traffic.  

           Workmen are changing the ‘VISIT SAN FRANCISCO’ poster to one 
           for ‘VENTRAN’. 

           It depicts a cute child taking an inhaler. 

           The caption says ‘HELP THEM BREATH MORE EASILY’.

           Willis is sipping from his insulated cup.
           It seems like it is just another day. 

           INT. MARGARET BROWN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Willis sits opposite MR and MRS LAKOVIC whilst Margaret Brown 
           looks on. 

                                 MARGARET 
                        Firstly, thank you for coming in 
                        today. 

                                 WILLIS
                        That’s okay. I was here anyway. 

                                 MARGARET
                        I meant Mr and Mrs Lakovic.

                                 WILLIS
                        Oh. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Now, Dr Willis has something he’d 
                        like to say to you about your 
                        recent interaction. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m-
                            (Beat.)
                        I mean-
                            (Beat.)
                        I-

           Willis tries but cannot physically say the words.  

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        She wants me to say I’m sorry. But 
                        I can’t. That’s because I’m not 
                        sorry. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Jeff. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m not. I don’t do this job 
                        because it’s fun or because I like 
                        getting up in the middle of the 
                        night or because I like driving a 
                        car that cost a tenth of what Bill 
                        Drake’s did. I do it because I want 
                        to look after your kids and because 
                        I’m good at looking after your 
                        kids. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIS (CONT'D)
                        And if you think your friend Jenna 
                        who once read something in a 
                        magazine knows as much about this 
                        as me who has only spent my whole 
                        life doing this, well, that’s fine, 
                        but don’t ask for my opinion then, 
                        and don’t be upset when it’s not 
                        the same as Jenna’s. 

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        You said a doctor not believing in 
                        vaccination was like a chef not 
                        believing in broiling. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m going to use that one again. 

                                 MRS LAKOVIC
                        Mrs Brown, you said that if we came 
                        here he was going to apologize. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Jeff, if these people complain 
                        there won’t be anything I can do 
                        about your position. 

                                 WILLIS
                        I know. 

                                 MARGARET
                        But if we fire you what will you 
                        do? We’re the only children’s 
                        hospital in the city and- 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’ve been thinking I might drive 
                        across the United States. 

                                 MARGARET
                        What? Why? 

                                 WILLIS
                        I’m going to look for the pearl.  

                                 MARGARET
                        But who will cover allergy?

                                 WILLIS
                        Maybe Jenna can. 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           A clock ticking in an empty waiting room. 
                                 WILLIS (O.C.)
                        You want to know something funny? 
                        We tell kids that adults know 
                        everything. We tell them ‘Wait till 
                        you are older’ and ‘You’re too 
                        young to understand this’ and ‘You 
                        can’t ride the rollercoaster until 
                        you are four feet eight’ and ‘Just 
                        wait until your taste buds mature 
                        and then you’ll realize just how 
                        much you’ve been missing out on by 
                        refusing to eat mushrooms all this 
                        time’. 

           INT. PLASTER ROOM - DAY  

           A row of CHILDREN sit with various arms and legs in plaster 
           casts. 

                                 WILLIS (O.C.)
                        But, you know, when you think about 
                        that, it’s crazy. Our taste buds 
                        don’t mature. They just wither. All 
                        five year old girls think they are 
                        going to grow up to be princesses 
                        and all five year old boys think 
                        they are going to grow up to be 
                        astronauts. Even most teenagers 
                        still all think they are going to 
                        be popstars or models or at least 
                        dentists and football players.  

           INT. NEONATAL NURSERY - DAY

           Mobiles dangle above rows of cribs of PERFECT NEWBORN BABIES.  

                                 WILLIS (O.C.)
                        But ask an average adult what the 
                        future holds, and they will say, 
                        well, if they work hard and don’t 
                        piss anyone off and don’t get laid 
                        off and their ulcer doesn’t make 
                        them need to take any more sick 
                        days, well, they might possibly be 
                        able to see about asking for a 
                        raise the year after next if the 
                        economy doesn’t tank any further. 

           INT. PEDIATRIC CLINIC ROOM - DAY

           Willis sits in his chair in the clinic room. 

           He has his insulated coffee cup in front of him and he is 
           wearing his Goofy tie. 
                                 WILLIS
                        So what I am saying to you is this. 
                        Right now, you have a twinkle in 
                        your eye. You don’t know it is 
                        there, because to you it is just 
                        your eye, and it’s there every time 
                        you look in the mirror. And 
                        besides, all your friends have the 
                        same twinkle too. But, Clive, when 
                        I see you in this clinic in a 
                        year’s time, I want it to still be 
                        there. 

           Pull back to see that Willis is addressing a bemused-looking 
           Clive, the asthmatic kid from the start. 

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D)
                        And even better, when I bring my 
                        grandchildren in to see you in 
                        thirty years time, I want it to 
                        still be there. That is when I 
                        really want it to still be there. 
                        Of course, knowing my luck I’ll 
                        probably be dead by then, but I’ll 
                        still be watching you, okay?

                                 CLIVE 
                        Why won’t I see you for a year? 

                                 WILLIS
                        Because I’m going away. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Where? 

                                 WILLIS
                        I don’t know, Clive. That’s kind of 
                        the fun of it. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Oh, well. Don’t forgot to have a 
                        good time.

           Willis is taken aback by this. Out of the mouths of babes. 

                                 WILLIS
                        Yeah, I won’t. You don’t forgot to 
                        have a good time either.

                                 CLIVE
                        I won’t.  

           EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - DAY

           Willis comes out of his front door carrying his insulated 
           coffee cup.
           He makes for the garage door and opens it. 

           We start to think maybe nothing has changed after all.  

           But the garage is different inside, for it now contains an 
           RV.

           Willis gets in and starts the engine. 

           As he pulls out, Susie and his daughters come to the door and 
           wave him off.  

           They are not coming with him on his trip, but being on such 
           waving terms is at least a start. 

           INT. WILLIS’ RV ON BRIDGE - DAY

           Willis in his RV on the Fremont bridge. 

           WORKMEN are changing the Ventran advert for one that features 
           a picture of a PEARL. 

           We cannot yet see what the product is, just that the 
           advertisement involves a gleaming pearl.  

           Willis pulls into the lane for the interstate, puts his foot 
           to the floor, and drives off into the distance.  

                                                             FADE OUT

                                                              THE END
