                                                             FADE IN:

           INT. COACH - JET (FLYING), 1991 - DAY

           An overhead announcement PLAYS: final approach to JFK. 
           Stewardesses walk TRASH BAGS up and down the aisles -- 

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Trash? Trash? Thank you. Trash?

           STEWARDESS comes upon...

           BILL WATTERSON (30s), face framed by big glasses, a buzz 
           cut, and a thick brown mustache.

           He is DRAWING on his UNFOLDED NAPKIN with a pen. 

                                 STEWARDESS    
                        Sir? Can I take your trash?

           Bill looks up, taken aback -- but she's only reaching for 
           his CUP. Bill lets her take it. The MAN IN THE MIDDLE SEAT 
           leans over, tosses his trash, and the stewardess moves on.

                                 STEWARDESS (O.S.)
                        Trash? Thank you. Trash? ...

           We see Bill's drawing now:

           It's a one-panel CALVIN & HOBBES COMIC STRIP. The boy Calvin 
           and his stuffed tiger Hobbes are on a flight with Calvin's 
           parents. Calvin gives orders to a stewardess with a cart...  

           The following is the dialogue written on the napkin --

                                 CALVIN (ON THE PAGE)
                        A tuna sandwich for my friend, and 
                        a dry martini for myself.

                                 CALVIN'S MOM (ON THE PAGE)
                        He'll have a soda.

           Bill scrunches his face. Not that good.

                                 MIDDLE SEAT MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey. Calvin & Hobbes.

           Bill looks over at his seat-mate, who CHUCKLES --

                                 MIDDLE SEAT MAN
                        That's pretty good.

           Bill sighs, shakes his head -- 
                                 BILL
                        No. It's not...

           -- SCRATCHES OUT HIS DRAWING...

                                 BILL    
                        It's garbage. 

           EXT. STREETS - NEW YORK CITY (NYC) - DAY

           Bill frowns as he squeezes and BUMPS through CROWDS. We get 
           a better look at him --

           SUPER: NEW YORK CITY, 1991 

           Bill Watterson is a thin oddball. He wears Reeboks and a 
           rainbow Swatch, which clash eccentrically with his sweater 
           and slacks. In fact, Bill is a man of many paradoxes...

           He is, all at once, an old man and a boy. A grouch, with a 
           heart of gold. Prone to silence, but also lengthy rants. A 
           shut-in who loves the outdoors.

           A paradox. He's a very odd, brilliant, befuddling paradox.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL PRESS SYNDICATE - NYC - DAY

           Bill enters a gray building.

           INT. LOBBY - UNIVERSAL PRESS SYNDICATE - DAY

           Waits on a sofa. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                             (hushed, on the phone)
                        Mr. Salem? Mr. Watterson is here...

           Bill grins politely at the sweet-looking RECEPTIONIST (20s), 
           a SIGN for UNIVERSAL PRESS SYNDICATE behind her. 

           Then, Bill's eyes wander to the --

           Various FRAMED POSTERS hung on the walls. All classic comic 
           strips: BALDO, CATHY, ZIGGY, THE FAR SIDE, DOONESBURY...

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Mr. Watterson?

           Bill looks back.
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I--I'd just like to say...I am a 
                        huge fan of your work.

                                 BILL
                        Thank you.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Could I--um...could I have your 
                        autograph?

                                 BILL
                        Uhhh...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I know you don't normally do them, 
                        but I won't sell it or anything. It 
                        would just be for my daughter. No, 
                        I don't have a daughter, it would 
                        just be for me. I'm sorry I lied.

           The DOOR behind her OPENS, and Bill is saved from his 
           discomfort as --

           LEE SALEM (40s), the syndicate's charming editor and vice 
           president, steps in. His arms wide open, a winning smile. 

                                 LEE
                        Bill.

           Bill gets up...and leaves the expectant young woman behind.

           BACK OFFICES

           Bill follows Lee through an open working area.

                                 LEE
                        How was your flight?

                                 BILL
                        Fine.

                                 LEE
                        Don't know how you do it out there. 
                        Too hot. Nothing but desert. Can't 
                        be worth it, man.

                                 BILL
                        It's worth it.

           LEE'S OFFICE
           The door opens, Lee lets Bill enter. FOUR MEN wait inside: 

           -- JOHN MCMEEL (60s), the syndicate's stoic president,

           -- FRANK THORNTON (40s), Bill's portly book publisher, and

           -- Two new slick suits, KEVIN and MIKE (30s).

                                 LEE
                        Bill, this is Kevin Darling and 
                        Mike Russo. Gentlemen, this is Bill 
                        Watterson. Our esteemed client, and 
                        the genius behind Calvin & Hobbes.

                                 MIKE
                        Mr. Watterson.

                                 KEVIN
                        It's an honor to meet you, sir. 

           Bill shakes their hands warily.

                                 LEE
                        Please, have a seat.

           Bill sits. Lee settles in at his desk, gets out a BOX --

                                 LEE    
                        Now, I know some of us are strapped 
                        for time, so I'll start with the 
                        main dish. These little buggers...

           Lee digs out five or so T-SHIRTS, lays them on the desk...

                                 LEE    
                        Are numero un on the agenda.

           Look closer, and they are cheap, fake-looking CALVIN & 
           HOBBES T-SHIRTS.

                                 LEE    
                        These five bootleg shirts are just 
                        a small sample of the kinds of  
                        contraband going on across the 
                        country. There are others, like the 
                        bumper stickers, but the shirts are 
                        the biggest problem. Now, this kind 
                        of stuff isn't all that surprising, 
                        given the high demand for Calvin, 
                        but, nonetheless: forgeries...are 
                        unacceptable. It's stealing money  
                        which belongs to Bill, to Universal 
                        Press, and that has to be stopped. 
                        These shirts need to disappear. I 
                        think we can all agree on that. 

           Lee pauses, looks at Bill.

                                 LEE    
                        Believe it or not...there is a 
                        solution. And it's quite simple. If 
                        we want to see these t-shirts go 
                        away...all we have to do is make--

                                 MIKE
                        We have to make our own shirts. 

           Bill turns, squints at Mike: what?

                                 LEE
                        Bill, Kevin and Mike are reps from 
                        a t-shirt company out in Delaware. 
                        Their idea is that if we hire them 
                        to make official Calvin & Hobbes 
                        clothing, their company will then 
                        have a vested interest in cracking 
                        down on the imitators.

                                 MIKE
                        Exactly right. Mr. Watterson-- 
                        unfortunately, neither you nor your 
                        syndicate has the means or the 
                        know-how to conduct an inquiry, to 
                        work side by side with police in 
                        finding and stopping these perps. 
                        But as a licensed clothing company, 
                        we deal with this sort of thing all 
                        the time. We would do the fighting 
                        for you. Because, as your business 
                        partners--it would affect us just 
                        as much as it would affect you. And 
                        make no mistake--we would very much 
                        like to be your business partners.

           It feels sleazy.

                                 BILL
                        You want to make Calvin shirts.

                                 LEE
                        They want to make real shirts, and: 
                        get rid of all these phonies.

           Kevin chimes in --

                                 KEVIN
                        Not just that, Mr. Watterson, but 
                        if you sign with Milford Clothes, 
                        we will donate a portion of the 
                        profits to an international group 
                        that helps save tigers worldwide.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes. That could be great for P.R.

                                 LEE
                        Bill? What do you think?

           Mike and Kevin flash their smiles. Lee and the others wait 
           uncomfortably. Then --

           Bill stands, heads out. John and Frank sigh in their seats. 
           Like they knew it was coming. Mike and Kevin look confused.

                                 LEE
                        Bill.

           BACK OFFICES

           Bill marches back down the hallway, Lee behind him.

                                 LEE
                        Bill, hang on a sec.

           EMPTY OFFICE

           Lee finds Bill pacing in a vacant room. He enters, closes 
           the door.

                                 BILL
                        I thought we were discussing the 
                        new book.

                                 LEE
                        We are.

                                 BILL
                        Did you fly me here just for that?

                                 LEE
                        No. No. We figured, as long as 
                        you're here--why not discuss this 
                        thing? We could put an end to the 
                        bootlegging, Bill, this could solve 
                        a big problem for us--

                                 BILL
                        This is not solving a problem, this 
                        is creating a new one.

                                 LEE
                        Creating a new one, what are you 
                        talking abou--

                                 BILL
                        You're making more shirts!

                                 LEE
                        Okay, easy. Official shirts. Ones 
                        we can make money off of--

                                 BILL
                        I don't want shirts. Official or 
                        unofficial. I don't want stickers. 
                        I don't want dolls, I don't want 
                        greeting cards, I don't want 
                        Saturday morning cartoons. We have 
                        been through this again and again, 
                        I don't know why you continue to--

                                 LEE
                        You're gonna lose your job, Bill.

           Bill stops.

                                 BILL
                        Excuse me?

                                 LEE
                        You're gonna lose your job.
                             (beat)
                        The syndicate has reached a 
                        decision. We're tired of this. 
                        We're tired of begging. I'd keep 
                        your wishes til the cows came home, 
                        but--at the end of the day, you 
                        know I gotta look out for number 
                        one. We are still a business.

                                 BILL
                        You're firing me?

                                 LEE
                        You get a week. If you haven't 
                        changed your mind on the shirts, 
                        we're gonna hire a ghost to come in 
                        and take over Calvin. Then, we'll 
                        start licensing without your--

                                 BILL
                        You can't do that--

                                 LEE
                        We'll start licensing without your 
                        consent. And we won't hold back. We 
                        have five years of lost revenue to 
                        catch up on.

           Bill is speechless. Lee touches his shoulder.

                                 LEE
                        Please...do the right thing here. 
                        For your fans, for your wife...for 
                        your career. Are you willing to 
                        walk away from everything you've 
                        built...just on principle?

           Lee grins weakly, trudges to the door --

                                 LEE
                        I'll see you in Ohio.

           He steps out, shuts the door.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - DAY

           A plain ranch house sits among a row of homes in a desert 
           neighborhood. Bill pulls into his drive in his '88 VOLVO 
           SEDAN, gets out, wheels a small suitcase to the porch...

           SUPER: ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO

           INT. FOYER - BILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bill enters -- and a GRAY CAT leaps, hangs onto his shirt. 

                                 BILL
                        Hey, Sprite.

           Bill pets SPRITE as she dangles there, then the cat drops, 
           runs off. Bill wheels through...

                                 BILL
                        Melissa?

           MELISSA'S STUDIO

           He arrives and stands in the doorway to a room turned art 
           studio. A window reveals the DESERT outside. In the center 
           of the room,

           MELISSA WATTERSON (30s) is painting a landscape. She's a 
           small, warm brunette. To look at her is to feel at home.

           Bill gazes at his wife as she strokes her brush: a pretty 
           small Midwestern town is FORMING, a blue and red building  
           called the POPCORN SHOP the main attraction.
           More PAINTINGS rest against the wall.

           Melissa stops, examines her work -- and not too fondly.

           Bill approaches Melissa. She turns and smiles.

                                 BILL
                        Looks nice. 

                                 MELISSA
                        How was your trip?

                                 BILL
                        Fine.

           Bill pecks her, heads back out.

                                 MELISSA
                        Talk about the new book?

                                 BILL
                        Yep.

           Bill disappears into the HALLWAY --

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill, don't put away your suitcase. 
                        We'll have to pack again tomorrow.

           INTERCUT WITH HALLWAY

           as Bill wheels his luggage away -- 

           -- and SPRITE dashes past Bill's MOVING FEET --

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Is your speech finished?

           -- and an orange cat JUNIPER BOOTS follows after --

                                 BILL
                        No. I'm going to try and work for a 
                        bit, Melissa. I'll be in my studio.

           -- and brown PUMPERNICKEL crosses from one room to 
           another... Three cats. One house.

                                 MELISSA
                        Okay-- 

           Melissa pauses, something's not right -- but, she gives up, 
           returns to her painting.

           BILL'S STUDIO - LATER
           Bill enters, sits at a DRAFTING TABLE against the wall. He's 
           made himself comfortable by undoing one button on his shirt. 

           The room is small with one window. Bare, apart from a stack 
           of CALVIN & HOBBES STRIPS on the floor and a PEANUTS POSTER 
           above the table. A bin of FAN MAIL resting near Bill's feet.

           Bill goes through his PRE-DRAWING ROUTINE: he CRACKS his 
           knuckles, he shakes his wrists. He GRINDS pencils with a 
           sharpener. He gets out a Bristol board, lays it before him.

           He sighs heavy and stares at the BLANK WHITE PAGE...

           Brushes his mustache with his fingers.

           LATER

           Bill paces to and fro about the room, brainstorming, 
           creating worlds and conversations in his head. He MUMBLES to 
           himself, he curiously shapes the air with his hands.

           He sketches briefly at his desk, then gets up again.

           LATER

           Bill stares out the window, a blank expression on his face. 

           Behind him, SPRITE tiptoes across the table, hops off.

           LATER

           Bill TAPS his pencil, stumped, then he tosses the pencil 
           down, leans forward, smushing his face -- and we see his 
           latest work...

           ...a single, solitary SKETCH OF CALVIN AND HOBBES in the 
           center of the page. The two characters stare dumbly right 
           back at Bill, but there's something unique, organic about 
           this particular drawing. The lines seem to be pulsating, 
           vibrating with life...as if Calvin and Hobbes were alive. 

                                 BILL
                             (to the drawing)
                        Do something. 
                             (beat)
                        Do something.

           Another beat. Then --

           Calvin and Hobbes look at each other, and back at Bill.

           They are alive.
                                 BILL
                        Stop standing there, and do 
                        something. 

           Calvin shrugs, looks up at Hobbes -- who scratches his furry 
           head.

           Bill fumes, then he snatches the board and FRISBEES it 
           across the room, and it skids into the wall. Bill sags in 
           despair -- and then, he finds himself looking up at...

           ...CHARLIE BROWN, looming above his desk in poster form...

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - GROCERY STORE, 1985 - DAY

           ...and a SMALLER PEANUTS POSTER replaces it. Taped on the 
           brick wall of a cramped, windowless basement over a desk.

           BILL WATTERSON, early 20s and fresh out of college, is 
           hunched over the desk, DESIGNING GROCERY STORE ADS. Dull, 
           mindless work -- which barely pays the bills as it is.

           SUPER: CHAGRIN FALLS, OHIO - 1985

           Bill stops, brushes his mustache. Looks back, scans the 
           empty basement. The only sign of life from inside his 
           MANAGER'S OFFICE, where a country song PLAYS loudly. 

           Bill carefully slides out a SKETCH from under his work, 
           DRAWS on it. Whatever it is, it's quite amusing to Bill --

           The office door YANKS OPEN behind him. Bill hides his 
           drawing --

                                 HANKS (O.S.)
                        Watterson.

           HANKS (50s), Bill's tie-choked, red-faced manager, has poked 
           his head out his office.

                                 HANKS    
                        Where's that ad?

                                 BILL
                        Almost finished. 

                                 HANKS
                        Hurry up. Printing company needs it 
                        by five. And none of that weird, 
                        creative stuff you like to do. 
                        Prices and products. That's it.
                                 BILL
                        Yes sir.

           Hanks loosens his tie, marches up the stairs.

                                 HANKS
                        This is real life, Watterson. Get 
                        your head out of the clouds.

           Bill turns back to his desk, unearths his DRAWING again -- 
           it's a sketch of HANKS, raging and spitting like an ape.

           Bill sighs, DRAWS...

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Bill marches across the parking lot, away from his prison 
           (or the FOOD 'N' SAVE as it's called). He carries a brown 
           leather satchel with his drawing things in it.

           He finds his '78 CHEVY IMPALA, hops in, fires it up --

           EEE EEE EEE EEE -- and his car won't start.

           EEE EEE EEE EEE. EEE EEE EEE EEE.

           A beat.

           Bill gets out, SLAMS his door, starts to walk.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CHAGRIN FALLS, OHIO - DAY

           Bill moseys through a quaint, quiet, idyllic small-town. He 
           passes rows of charming storefronts, polite passers-by, old 
           lampposts...this is CHAGRIN FALLS: straight from the mind of 
           Norman Rockwell.

           EXT. BACK ROAD - DUSK

           Bill trudges down a road, just between the center of town 
           and the neighborhoods enclosing it. 

           An ORANGE VW BEETLE pulls up alongside him...

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Bill.

           Bill peeks inside --

           MELISSA RICHMOND, Bill's future wife, gawks as she drives 
           alongside him. Melissa is as upbeat about life as Bill is 
           cynical -- and that's why he's secretly in love with her.

                                 MELISSA
                        What are you doing?

                                 BILL
                        Hello, Melissa.

                                 MELISSA
                        Do you need a ride?

                                 BILL
                        Um...yes. Thank you.

           Melissa pulls over, opens the passenger door.

           INT. BEETLE (MOVING) - LATER

           Melissa can't stop glancing, smiling at Bill as she drives. 
           She wears a uniform, maybe for a coffee shop or something.

                                 MELISSA
                        Can't believe you're walking home. 
                        Why didn't you call your folks?
                             (beat)
                        You should really just get a new 
                        car.

           Bill is glaring at the GARFIELD ORNAMENT hung from Melissa's 
           mirror.

                                 MELISSA    
                        What? You don't like Garfield?

                                 BILL
                        Garfield...is everything that's 
                        wrong with comic strips today. It's 
                        predictable, it's repetitive, it's 
                        juvenile. And the artwork...is 
                        almost as uninspired as the jokes.

                                 MELISSA
                        So, you don't like it.

                                 BILL
                        No.

           Melissa smiles as she hits her blinker, makes a turn.

                                 MELISSA
                        Such a snob.
           INT. FOYER - WATTERSON HOUSE - EVENING

           Bill UNLOCKS, enters his PARENT'S HOME. Melissa behind him. 

                                 BILL
                        Mom? I'm home.

                                 KATHRYN (O.S.)
                             (from the kitchen)
                        What?

                                 BILL
                        Melissa's here, we'll be 
                        downstairs.

                                 KATHRYN (O.S.)
                        Are you guys hungry?

           Bill and Melissa are already STOMPING into the BASEMENT.

                                 KATHRYN (O.S.)
                        Wait, Bill--where have you been??

           BILL'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON: Bill's OLD CARTOON STRIPS AND SKETCHES, as Melissa 
           FLIPS through them...

           -- A GROUNDHOG and a FROG hang out in the woods, a la POGO.

           -- A midget SPACEMAN SPIFF smokes a stogie on a far planet. 

           -- A YOUNG NEWS REPORTER is harassed by his CRAZY EDITOR.

           -- Ant-like married bugs (CRITTERS) have a domestic dispute.

           Melissa beams, she's loving them all...

                                 MELISSA
                        God, Bill. These are so great.

           Bill is rummaging through his closet. On the floor are more 
           drawings and notebooks, plus a HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK -- with 
           a TIGER as a mascot.

           Bill finds the FOLDER he was looking for, sits on the bed 
           beside Melissa, hands it over.

                                 MELISSA
                        This is your new one?

                                 BILL
                        I sent most of the originals in. 
                        Saved these.
           Melissa opens the folder -- a handful of NEWER STRIPS. This 
           batch is even slicker and more professional than the others.

                                 MELISSA
                             (reading title)
                        In the Dog House.

           It's a strip about the goofy shenanigans of young adult 
           friends, particularly straight-laced SAM and his slacker 
           buddy FESTER. Melissa FLIPS through them, all giggles --

                                 MELISSA
                        Who's this?

           A small, loud-mouthed BOY is showing up every few pages -- 
           sometimes dragging a STUFFED TIGER DOLL along with him. 

                                 BILL
                        That's Marvin. He's Sam's little 
                        brother. 

           Marvin looks eerily similar to Calvin, except he has bangs 
           over his eyes instead of that trademark spiky blonde hair.

                                 MELISSA
                        He's a trip. I like his tiger. 
                             (more flipping)
                        Oh, you should do more with him, 
                        Bill, he's funny. 
                             (more flipping)
                        Except maybe the hair? Can't see 
                        his eyes.

           She stops on a DRAWING of Sam and Fester hanging out by a 
           CAMPUS FOUNTAIN during summer. Little Marvin approaches the 
           fountain in goggles and swim trunks, carrying a towel...

                                 FESTER (ON THE PAGE)
                        You know you can't swim in there, 
                        right, Marvin?

                                 MARVIN (ON THE PAGE)
                        Beat it, ugly. I'm hot.

           Melissa lingers on Marvin, grinning...

                                 MELISSA
                        I'd give anything to be half as 
                        good as you. You're going to be 
                        famous, Bill. 

           A beat.
                                 BILL
                        No. I'm not.

           Melissa looks up.

                                 BILL    
                        I'm not going to be anything. 

                                 MELISSA
                        What are you talking about?

           A beat.

                                 BILL
                        I design pennysaver ads for a 
                        grocery store, Melissa. I live with 
                        my parents. I can barely afford 
                        pencils and pads, let alone a car. 
                        No one wants my strips, not that I 
                        blame them. They're mediocre at 
                        best--no, not even that...I am just 
                        as talentless as Jim Davis. The 
                        only difference is I know it.
                             (beat)
                        I'm a failure. That's all I'll ever 
                        be.

           Melissa frowns. Places her hand on Bill's.

                                 MELISSA
                        You are not a failure, don't be so 
                        hard on yourself. Just keep trying.

           Bill looks at her.

                                 MELISSA    
                        Something will happen. I promise.

           There is a moment between them, and Melissa waits for Bill 
           to make a move...but he can't do it...

           The TICK-TOCK of his SNOOPY CLOCK arises out of the silence. 
           Melissa sees it --

                                 MELISSA    
                        I should go.

           EXT. WATTERSON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bill watches Melissa back her car out from the PORCH. She 
           waves good-bye. He waves back. Waits there until she goes.
           INT. BILL'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bill returns. Looks around, sees his DRAFTING TABLE in a 
           corner: waiting, calling to him...

           LATER

           ALL AROUND THE HOUSE, the lights are out...except for BILL'S 
           BEDROOM. Bill is still wide awake and working like a madman.

           We FOLLOW A TRAIL of IN THE DOG HOUSE DRAWINGS on the floor. 
           Heeding Melissa, Bill has included Marvin in every one, and 
           fixed his hair. Marvin looks almost identical to Calvin now.

           And as we track Bill's work, Marvin is becoming more and 
           more the central character -- then, we CLIMB UP, see the 
           CURRENT DRAWING on Bill's table...

           In a treehouse, Sam, Fester, Marvin, and his tiger are 
           hanging out. Marvin is dressed as a pirate and carries a 
           wooden sword, but Sam and Fester aren't really into it.

           Bill scrunches his face -- the older kids just don't fit 
           anymore. He regretfully -- ERASES FESTER. Then -- ERASES 
           SAM. He blows the eraser shavings, wipes -- 

           Just the boy and his doll...better. 

           Bill's erased part of the TIGER on accident. He draws its 
           ear and pirate's eyepatch back in. Studies the doll for a 
           moment longer...cocks his head...

           Something's not there yet.

           Bill jots a note by the toy, his face scrunched --

           "SOMETHING...MISSING...???"

           He sighs, sets his pencil down. Done for the night.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CHAGRIN FALLS - DAY

           CLOSE ON: WHEELS CYCLING...

           Bill is riding his bike down the street. Helmet strapped, 
           enjoying the air. Minding the pedestrians. Next to comic 
           strips, cycling is Bill's passion in life.

           He passes cozy little FIRESIDE BOOKSHOP, peeks inside --

           Keeps riding, but now is conflicted about something. Then, 
           he decides to man up this time, and -- brakes, SKIDS to a 
           stop.
           INT. FIRESIDE BOOKSHOP - LATER

           Bill wanders through the AISLES, drawing satchel over his 
           shoulder. Not shopping, but sneaking glances UP FRONT --

           Where MELISSA is checking out a customer at the register -- 
           this is where she works.

           Melissa glances up, catches a FIGURE DISAPPEAR behind a 
           shelf -- Bill of course. She smiles and shakes her head. 

           UPSTAIRS - LATER

           Bill comes upon a shelf of COMIC STRIP BOOK COLLECTIONS. He 
           runs his finger along the book spines (lifting to skip over 
           the Garfield books) -- and stops on a PEANUTS COLLECTION. 

           He slides it out, flips through it. Charlie Brown, Snoopy. 
           Grinning like a child, admiring the brilliance (even though 
           it's likely he's read these strips many times before) --

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir.

           Bill looks up.

                                 MELISSA
                             (fake serious)
                        If you're not going to purchase 
                        that, I can't let you read it for 
                        free. This is not a library.

           Bill puts the book back.

                                 BILL
                        Sorry.

                                 MELISSA
                        What are you doing here?

                                 BILL
                        Just...shopping. Browsing.

                                 MELISSA
                        Mm-hmm. You on your bike?

                                 BILL
                        Yes.

                                 MELISSA
                        Work tomorrow?

                                 BILL
                        Yes.
           Melissa sighs, squints at him.

                                 MELISSA
                        Meet me outside.

           She walks away --

                                 MELISSA    
                        I'll drive you home.

                                 BILL
                        Oh, okay. Thank you.

           EXT. FIRESIDE BOOKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Bill waits outside. Reads a SIGN on a stand by the door:

           "QUARTERLY ART SHOW -- FRIDAY, 2 P.M. -- COME SEE TALENTED 
           LOCAL ELIZABETH WILSON DISPLAY HER EVOCATIVE ABSTRACTS!"

           Modern art: interesting to some, but stupid to Bill.

           INSIDE THE STORE

           Melissa catches Bill's smirk through the window. Then --

           A RED-HEADED BOY (6) BRUSHES past her, flying a STUFFED TOY 
           BUNNY -- and then, clumsily KNOCKS OVER a display of BOOKS.

           The MOTHER is fast upon her wayward son --

                                 MOTHER
                        What did I tell you? Come here.

                                 MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Melissa. Can you get that please...

           But Melissa is already sneaking out --

           BACK OUTSIDE

           She meets up with Bill, leads him away.

                                 MELISSA
                             (re: the boy inside)
                        Awww, look at his rabbit. So cute.

           Bill glances back at the spat THROUGH THE WINDOW...

                                 MOTHER
                        I said no running.
                                 BOY
                        It wasn't me.

                                 MOTHER
                        What do you mean, it wasn't you?

           SIDEWALK - LATER

           Melissa eats a Ding-Dong. Bill is curiously monitoring the 
           BOY and MOTHER, who now march down the sidwalk on the OTHER 
           SIDE OF THE STREET -- parallel to Bill and Melissa.

           Bill is taken with the boy's STUFFED BUNNY, which the boy is 
           swinging around carelessly again, by the bunny's long ear.

                                 MELISSA
                        You know what I was thinking? You 
                        know why birds don't write their 
                        memoirs? Because birds don't lead 
                        epic lives, that's why. Who'd want 
                        to read about what a bird does? 
                             (beat)
                        Nobody. That's who.

           Bill eavesdrops on the conversation going on across the 
           street...

           (when the boy isn't talking with his mother, he HUMS the 
           tune to the song "Jimmy Crack Corn")...

                                 MOTHER
                        Knocking over a whole bookstand 
                        like that...gotta be kidding me...

                                 BOY
                        It wasn't me.

                                 MOTHER
                        Stop saying that. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Ding-Dong?

                                 BILL
                        Uh, no, thank you.

                                 BOY
                        Mr. Bun did it.

                                 MOTHER
                        It was not Mr. Bun. Mr. Bun did not 
                        run into a table like an imbecile.
                                 BOY
                        Yeah huh.

                                 MELISSA
                        Know what your problem is, Bill. 
                        You have an American car. Try a 
                        Honda, those things never break.

           But Bill is zeroed in now. Trying to figure something out...

                                 MOTHER
                        Thomas, Mr. Bun cannot run. He 
                        doesn't know how.

                                 BOY
                        We were racing each'ofer. 

                                 MOTHER
                        For God's sake, stop it. You know 
                        very well that thing is just a toy.

                                 BOY
                        He's not a toy! He's real!

           Bill's mouth drops. He stops.

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Bill?

           Bill takes another look across the street at the BOY, who is 
           now hopping his TOY BUNNY over newspaper vending machines --

           And then, in SLOW-MO --

           The BUNNY starts to HOP ON HIS OWN across the machine tops 
           -- a living, breathing, stuffed toy. Bill's creative mind, 
           coming to life.

                                 BILL
                        That's it.

                                 MELISSA
                        What's it?

                                 BILL
                        He's real.

                                 MELISSA
                        Who's real?

           Bill hurries towards her, SNATCHES the aforementioned DING-
           DONG. He takes a bite, digs into his satchel. Marching on...
                                 BILL
                        Mr. Bun! HA!

                                 MELISSA
                        Mr. what??

           INT. BEETLE (MOVING) - LATER

           Melissa drives as Bill, trembling with excitement, flips to 
           a new page in his sketchpad, CLICKS lead from his mechanical 
           pencil. 

           He explains as he quickly draws Marvin, with some difficulty 
           due to the moving car --

                                 BILL
                        I was having trouble figuring out 
                        what to do with Marvin's tiger. You 
                        were right, Marvin is great. He's 
                        funny, he's loud, he has no filter. 
                        He's a little like Dennis the 
                        Menace, it's very entertaining.

           SNAP, Bill's lead breaks. He CLICKS more out, keeps drawing.

                                 BILL
                        In fact, I want to base my whole 
                        strip around this character. But 
                        the idea of Marvin's tiger was 
                        incomplete. At first, I threw the 
                        doll in there kind of on a whim, 
                        you know? Kids like to carry toys 
                        around, it was more an aesthetic 
                        choice than anything else. 

           SNAP, CLICK-CLICK-CLICK. Bill finishes Marvin. He stares off 
           only a moment, "picturing", then he starts a new character.

           Melissa tries to get a glimpse, intrigued --

                                 BILL
                        I wasn't seeing the full potential. 
                        I wasn't seeing the toy the way a 
                        child would see it. Children view 
                        the world an entirely different way 
                        than adults. Their imaginations are 
                        boundless. We see a cardboard box--
                        they see a spaceship. We see a few 
                        trees--they see the Amazon. Marvin 
                        is no different from that boy just 
                        now. And, like that boy, he will 
                        have unparalleled creative 
                        powers...and the culmination of his 
                        imaginative experience...will be 
                        expressed --

           SNAP, CLICK-CLICK-CLICK, but the pencil is empty. CLICK-
           CLICK-CLICK. Bill SHAKES the pencil, throws it aside --

                                 BILL
                        -- in a toy doll, who comes to life 
                        whenever Marvin is alone. The tiger 
                        is real. 

           Bill shows Melissa his work: it's a crude but clear drawing 
           of Marvin walking and talking with a SIX FOOT TALL TIGER. 
           Because Bill couldn't finish, the tiger is missing some his 
           stripes, but we can see that he is HOBBES in the making.

                                 BILL
                        It's what I was missing.

           Melissa goes from confused to charmed...

                                 MELISSA
                        Wow. That's lovely, Bill.

           Bill grins. He knows it's something. He sets his notebook on 
           the dash, sighs -- a weight lifted from his shoulders...

                                 BILL
                        This is going to be very good.

           LATER

           Melissa turns down a neighborhood street. Smiles at Bill... 
           who is leaned back, gazing ahead. A rare grin on his face.

                                 BILL
                        Thank you.

                                 MELISSA
                        Thank me?

           Bill nods.

                                 MELISSA    
                        I didn't do anything.

                                 BILL
                        Yes, you did. You always do.

           A pleasant moment of silence. Melissa pulls into BILL'S 
           DRIVEWAY and parks.

                                 MELISSA
                        So. Do you have to send samples to 
                        the syndicates? I mean, first you 
                        have to make them, of course, 
                        but...I forget. What happens now?

           Bill leans in, KISSES HER ON THE LIPS. They part...

                                 BILL
                        This. 

           Melissa gawks at Bill.

                                 BILL    
                        Or, that. That happens. Now. 
                             (beat)
                        I'm sorry.

           But Bill's doubts are quickly assuaged as --

           Melissa KISSES HIM BACK. And this time, they don't part...

                                 HOTEL CLERK (V.O., PRELAP)
                        Mr. Watterson?

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - COLUMBUS, OHIO, 1991 - EVENING 

           BILL (OLDER), stares into space.

                                 HOTEL CLERK (O.S.)
                        Mr. Watterson.

           He snaps out of it, gives his attention back to the -- 

           HOTEL CLERK (20s) behind the FRONT DESK.

                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        Here is your receipt, and here is 
                        your keycard. Room one-oh-seven.

           Bill takes them, nods his thanks...

           ...and carries his bags across the lobby. Like everything 
           else he chooses, Bill has picked a sensible, plain hotel.

           SUPER: COLUMBUS, OHIO

           A MAN IN A BLUE BLAZER gets up from a couch, approaches 
           Bill.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Mr. Watterson?

           Bill slows.
                                 BLUE BLAZER    
                        Bill Watterson? 

                                 BILL
                        Yes.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        It's an honor to meet you, sir. I 
                        am a huge, huge fan of your work. 

           The man extends his hand. Bill leaves it there.

                                 BLUE BLAZER    
                        Can't believe I'm standing in front 
                        of you. I'd guess you're here for 
                        the Festival, is that right? 

           Bill nods. This is weird.

                                 BLUE BLAZER    
                        Great. Great. Well, listen...

           The man gets out a NOTEPAD and PEN.

                                 BLUE BLAZER    
                        I...am actually a reporter for the 
                        Columbus Dispatch...and I was 
                        wondering if you wouldn't mind 
                        answering a few questions.

           It dawns on Bill. The reporter throws a quick glance over 
           Bill's shoulder -- Bill catches it, looks back and spots --

           The HOTEL CLERK, inconspicuously cleaning his work space...

           And Bill puts two and two together -- the hotel clerk may 
           have tipped this guy off. 

           Bill brushes right past the reporter, who follows him.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Just five minutes of your time. The 
                        state of Ohio is very proud of you, 
                        Mr. Watterson. We'd all love to get 
                        a glimpse behind the magic. 

                                 BILL
                        Hard work, and luck. There is no 
                        magic.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bill carries his luggage in, shuts the door. The SHOWER RUNS 
           in the bathroom.

           He plops on the bed. HUFFS on, cleans his glasses. Spots a 
           PAMPHLET his wife left on the nightstand... 

           OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY PRESENTS -- FESTIVAL OF CARTOON 
           ART! ... THIS YEAR'S GUEST SPEAKER ... BILL WATTERSON!

           Bill slumps...

           LATER - NIGHT

           It's DARK apart from a desk lamp, where Bill is WRITING HIS 
           SPEECH. He stops. Brushes his mustache.

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        You might as well tell me, Bill.

           Bill looks at the faint outline of MELISSA (OLDER), in bed 
           but not asleep.

                                 MELISSA    
                        What that meeting was about.

                                 BILL
                        The new book.

           Melissa CLICKS on her lamp.

                                 MELISSA
                        Every time a book is planned, you 
                        come home, and you rave about it 
                        for days. You get giddy, those 
                        books are like Christmas for you. 
                        But you haven't said one word about 
                        this one since you got back. 
                        Something happened out there.
                             (beat)
                        Bill. What happened in New York.

                                 BILL
                        They offered me a new deal. T-
                        shirts.

                                 MELISSA
                        Okay.

                                 BILL
                        And I said no, of course.
                             (beat)
                        And then Lee said I have a week to 
                        say yes...or they're going to... 
                        replace me.
           Melissa props herself up.

                                 MELISSA
                        Replace you?? What do you mean?

           Bill shrugs.

                                 MELISSA    
                        Can they do that?

                                 BILL
                        They can do whatever they want. 

           Melissa tries to think.

                                 MELISSA
                        Well--what are you gonna do?

                                 BILL
                        I don't know. But I'm not letting 
                        them do those shirts. That's for 
                        darn sure.

                                 MELISSA
                        But...they're going to fire you.

                                 BILL
                        So be it.

           Melissa is at a loss.

                                 BILL    
                        What do you think?

                                 MELISSA
                        Um...yeah. Sure, whatever.

           She slides out of bed, heads for the BATHROOM -- 

                                 MELISSA
                        It's your strip. Not mine.

           Enters, SHUTS the door -- leaving Bill to his thoughts.

           EXT. CEMETERY - CHAGRIN FALLS, OHIO, 1985 - DAY

           BILL (YOUNGER) sits on a stone bench, grazing on a PB & J 
           SANDWICH from a sack. He gazes at a FIELD OF HEADSTONES 
           before him...

           Finishes eating, CRUMPLES his sack, strolls away. 
           EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Hands in pockets, through the parking lot, back to work.

           INT. BASEMENT - GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Bill descends stairs as the PHONE RINGS in Hank's office.

                                 HANKS (O.S.)
                        Watterson. Watterson.

           HANKS' OFFICE 

           Bill enters, finds Hanks dangling the phone on his finger. 
           Curious, he takes it --

                                 BILL
                        Hello?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Is this Bill Watterson?

                                 BILL
                        Yes.

           INT. LEE SALEM'S OLD OFFICE - NYC - CONTINUOUS

           LEE SALEM (YOUNGER) swivels around in his char. Same guy. 
           Smaller office.

                                 LEE
                        Bill this is Lee Salem. I'm an 
                        editor at Universal Press 
                        Syndicate. Got a sec? 

           INTERCUT WITH HANKS' OFFICE

           Bill glances at Hanks: he's thumbing through a FISHING 
           MAGAZINE, slopping up a GREASY MEAL.

                                 BILL
                        Can I be alone?

                                 HANKS
                        Excuse me?

                                 BILL
                        This is a private call.

           Hanks gawks. Bill does not flinch. Hanks grabs his things, 
           MUTTERS as he marches out.
                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Yello? Still there?

           Bill puts the phone to his ear.

                                 BILL
                        Yes. Sorry.

                                 LEE
                        This is Bill Watterson, right? The 
                        one who sent us these Marvin & 
                        Hobbes samples?

                                 BILL
                        Yes.

           ON LEE'S DESK is Bill's submission: six four-panel black and 
           white MARVIN & HOBBES STRIPS.

                                 LEE
                             (looking over them)
                        Well, I'll tell you what, Bill--
                        this is some good stuff. The little 
                        kid, the tiger who comes to life--
                        it's a great little world you've 
                        built here. Nice artwork, too. 
                        We're all really impressed.

           Bill covers his phone, takes a deep breath.

                                 BILL
                             (back into phone)
                        Thank you.

                                 LEE
                        Yeah, listen. How old are you?

                                 BILL
                        Twenty-six.

                                 LEE
                        I'm guessing you sent these to 
                        everyone. Get any calls yet?

                                 BILL
                        No...?

                                 LEE
                        Good. I don't wanna beat around the 
                        bush--we think this could be a very 
                        big thing, and we'd like to be a 
                        part of it. We'd like to hire you.

           Lee stifles a yawn.
                                 LEE    
                        How's that sound, huh? You wanna 
                        write cartoons for the papers?

                                 BILL
                        Uhhh...I'm interested.

                                 LEE
                        My secretary will mail a contract. 
                        You can keep sending stuff in the 
                        meantime if you like.

                                 BILL
                        Okay.

                                 LEE
                        K buddy, good stuff--oh, hang on a 
                        sec. The boy's name...
                             (flips through papers)
                        King Features already has a strip 
                        called Marvin...and we don't wanna 
                        confuse our blessed readers anymore 
                        than we have to. Any ideas?

                                 BILL
                        Uhhh...

                                 LEE
                        How about--Jarvin? Darvin? 
                        Sssmarvin?

                                 BILL
                        Calvin?

                                 LEE
                        Eh, good enough. Calvin & Hobbes. 
                        Okay, Willy. Welcome to the club.

           Bill holds onto the phone long after Lee hangs up. Silent, 
           processing. Then...

           Bill WEEPS. 

           OUTSIDE HANKS' OFFICE - LATER

           He emerges, sniffling.

           Hanks stares at him from the break table.

                                 HANKS
                        What's with you?

           Bill grabs some things from his desk, stores them in his 
           satchel.
                                 HANKS    
                        What are you doing? It's two 
                        o'clock, day's not over.

           Bill marches right past him.

                                 BILL
                        It is for me. 

           Bill marches up the stairs with a grin, not even stopping to 
           enjoy the dumb, stupefied expression on his manager's face.

           EXT. DECK - MELISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           MELISSA (YOUNGER) paints a LANDSCAPE of the NEIGHBORHOOD 
           behind her apartment building.

           SPRITE, the gray kitten who we've only seen as a cat, rubs 
           against Melissa's leg.

                                 MELISSA
                        Sprite...

           In the apartment, a KNOCK-KNOCK --

                                 MELISSA
                        It's open!

           A moment, then --

           Bill appears behind her, LILACS in hand. A big goofy smile. 
           He sets the flowers by Melissa --

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill, what are you doing here--

           -- and kisses her hard.

                                 BILL
                        I love you.

                                 MELISSA
                        I love you, too--

                                 BILL
                        Gotta go.

                                 MELISSA
                        Gotta go??

           But he's already gone.
                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        I have work to do!

           INT. BILL'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY

           Bill sits at his table: CRACKS his knuckles, shakes wrists, 
           SHARPENS pencils -- all while going over the following in 
           his head...

           (Bill's thoughts are often accompanied by SOUND EFFECTS in 
           his head -- for instance, when Bill thinks about the jungle, 
           a ROARING LION might be faintly heard in the distance) --

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Now...start from the beginning. How 
                        do Marvin and--no, how do Calvin 
                        and Hobbes meet? Is Hobbes a 
                        Christmas gift? Does Calvin see 
                        Hobbes in a store? No--how would 
                        Calvin think he met Hobbes? Hobbes 
                        is a real tiger, so...probably in 
                        the jungle. Maybe Calvin caught 
                        Hobbes while on an expedition. 
                        Calvin the Safari Hunter. Sets a 
                        trap, finds his best friend: a 
                        tiger. Yes. That's how they meet.

           Bill picks up a pencil, brushes his mustache -- and starts 
           to draw the FIRST OFFICIAL CALVIN & HOBBES STRIP.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        This is going to be very good.

           Bill grins, keeps working.

           MUSIC MONTAGE - CALVIN & HOBBES: THE BIRTH AND "RISE"

           (The following sequence is a whirlwind of art magic. Bill 
           and Melissa fall in love while Bill creates his comic for us 
           to see. CALVIN COMIC STRIPS constantly SCROLL across the top 
           of the screen while being self-drawn in real-time, and/or 
           they slide through SPLIT-SCREENS so we can read them. It's a 
           lot of fun, it feels like we're making the strip with Bill.)

           BILL'S BEDROOM - SAME DAY

           Bill paces to and fro, creating Calvin comic strips in his 
           head, MUTTERING his character's dialogue...

           -- Calvin captures Hobbes with a tuna sandwich as bait --
                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        So long, pop! Off to check my tiger 
                        trap. Tigers will do anything for a 
                        tuna fish sandwich!

                                 HOBBES (BILL) (V.O.)
                             (eating sandwich while 
                             trapped)
                        We're kind of stupid that way.

           -- Calvin and Hobbes hang out under a tree, trying to look 
           "cool". Calvin wears shades, Hobbes...Mickey Mouse pants --

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        Mickey Mouse pants?! You don't look 
                        "cool"! You look like an idiot!

                                 HOBBES (BILL) (V.O.)
                             (hmpf!)
                        Maybe I'm new wave.

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                             (grouchy)
                        Maybe you're just stupid.

           -- Calvin and Hobbes go camping, get ready for sleep...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        Hobbes? Do you believe in ghosts?

           -- and thus, the next morning: they stand outside, guarding 
           their tent, as they have been all night. Frozen in terror. 

           Bill chuckles to himself, sits down, DRAWS...

           NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Bill drives his clunker Chevy over to Melissa's apartment...

           MELISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           -- enters, and tiny SPRITE leaps, hangs onto his pant leg.

                                 BILL
                             (shaking his leg)
                        Down, cat. Down.

           -- Bill shares some of his NEW STRIPS with Melissa over 
           takeout. He watches how she responds to each one, using her 
           laughter as a gauge -- but, she pretty much loves them all. 

           BILL'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bill works some more...
           -- Hobbes teases Calvin about the new girl Susie Derkins --

                                 CALVIN + HOBBES (BILL) (V.O.)
                        There's a new girl in our class. Is 
                        she nice? Who cares? Do you like 
                        her? NO!!!

           -- Calvin and Hobbes have imaginary cowboy gunfights in the 
           house, bouncing off furniture, driving Calvin's mother wild.

           -- Calvin muses with Hobbes while on a walk...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        ...you know why birds don't write 
                        their memoirs? Because birds don't 
                        lead epic lives, that's why! Who'd 
                        wanna read about what a bird does? 
                        Nobody, that's who!

           -- Calvin and Hobbes SPEED DOWN A HILL in their red wagon, 
           over a pond, and Calvin attempts to fly with an umbrella...

           ...but he fails, and SPLASHES straight down INTO THE WATER.

           KITCHEN - WATTERSON'S HOUSE - DAY

           Bill goes over his CONTRACT with Lee over the phone. He can 
           barely hear over his mother's VACUUM from the LIVING ROOM...

           UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - LATER

           Bill finishes with Lee in his PARENT'S ROOM. He hesitates at 
           the contract's last section: "...Syndicate owns the rights 
           to all content and characters created by the artist..."

           And then -- sitting on the floor beside Bill...

           ...are CALVIN and HOBBES, as life-sized, animated cartoons. 
           Both looking bored, like they just want Bill to hurry up.

                                 LEE
                        Any questions?

           Bill sighs -- SIGNS THE DOTTED LINE...

                                 BILL
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        Oka, buddy. Let's show you off to 
                        the world.

           Calvin and Hobbes CHEER, race out and down the hall.
           NEWS BUILDINGS

           Everywhere, newspaper EDITORS open PACKAGES from Universal 
           Press Syndicate. They look over Bill's CALVIN & HOBBES 
           SUBMISSIONS -- and are slowly, but surely, intrigued...

           PRINTING PRESSES

           Thousands of NEWSPAPERS roll hot off the presses. 

           ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

           In HOMES, in OFFICES, on the SUBWAY, on the SIDWALK --

           PEOPLE take notice of CALVIN & HOBBES in their papers. 

           NEIGHBORHOOD - AUTUMN - DAY

           Bill clunkers back to Melissa's, ORANGE LEAVES everywhere.

           MELISSA'S APARTMENT - DAY

           He enters, SPRITE attacks him again --

                                 BILL
                        Down, cat. Stop pouncing on me--

           Bill stops. When Melissa appears, ready to go out, his mind 
           is somwhere else -- a new idea...

           POPCORN SHOP - MAIN STREET - DAY

           Melissa grabs a NEWSPAPER as they emerge from the POPCORN 
           SHOP -- (the same store we saw her painting in her New 
           Mexico studio) -- while Bill DRAWS his idea on a napkin...

           HOBBES pouncing on CALVIN when he opens the front door on 
           his way home from school. The idea he got from Sprite.

           They walk through town, eating popcorn, Melissa flipping 
           through the paper -- 

           Melissa stops, SHRIEKS -- shows her paper to Bill...

           Calvin & Hobbes has debuted in their town! There it is, his 
           very own STRIP in the COMICS SECTION..."by Bill Watterson". 

           Melissa lets Bill take the paper, she hugs and kisses him, 
           and they stroll on, arm in arm...

           As animated CALVIN and HOBBES race through the background. 
           Calvin in a Zorro mask, carrying a white flag. Hobbes 
           chasing him with a volleyball. It's CALVINBALL -- the game 
           where the only rule is you can't play the same way twice --
           And neither Melissa nor Bill seem to notice them.

           ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

           More NEWSPAPERS are pressed, delivered, read -- and this 
           time, we see the STRIPS as they are consumed by PEOPLE --

           -- Calvin and Hobbes dance to loud classical music in the 
           middle of the night, waking and frustrating his parents.

           -- SUSIE hugs Hobbes, and Hobbes enjoys it -- prompting an 
           argument with Calvin, who is against all things female.

           -- HOBBES POUNCES ON CALVIN as he returns home from school. 

           -- HANKS, Bill's old boss, reads the paper, chuckles at a 
           Calvin strip -- then, he drops his jaw when he reads the 
           AUTHOR'S NAME...

           And everywhere, everyone is falling in love with the Boy and 
           his Tiger...

           NEIGHBORHOOD - WINTER - DAY

           Bill pulls up to Melissa's in a new (well, used) '82 RED 
           HONDA CIVIC. Gets out, CRUNCHES over SNOW to the building --

           LIVING ROOM - MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Melissa lays by the FIREPLACE, going over more of BILL'S 
           STRIPS. She takes a break, stretches, yawns. A little feline 
           quality to her. Notices Bill on the couch, drawing her --

                                 MELISSA
                        Let me see.

           He shows: a dozen different SKETCHES OF HOBBES, curling and 
           stretching the same way Melissa has been doing all night.

                                 MELISSA
                        I thought I was Susie.

                                 BILL
                        You are. You're all of them.

           Melissa smiles, continues reading. Bill gazes at her.

           BILL'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bill works well into the night, COMIC STRIPS and ANIMATIONS 
           swirling all around him. Calvin is SPACEMAN SPIFF, a rogue 
           galaxy explorer. He's TRACER BULLET, a tough, cynical, P.I. 
           He's STUPENDOUS MAN, the magnificent superhero, taking on 
           evil babysitters and boring teachers. Calvin and Hobbes 
           explore back woods, they build snowmen, they go swimming --

           -- it's a thrilling ride --

           Bill stops. Looks back over his shoulder at...

           Animated CALVIN and HOBBES, on the floor behind him, with 
           comic books and junk food. Calvin gives Bill a thumbs up, 
           Hobbes smiles --

           And Bill turns back to his desk, and keeps working.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - NYC, 1986 - DAY

           A commercial JET touches down, SCREECHES as it slows. 

           SUPER: 1986

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Bill waits as the elevator CHURNS upwards. Nervous.

           He wears a WEDDING RING now.

           Bill catches his REFLECTION in the ELEVATOR DOORS...

           Sticks out his tongue at it. Slacked jaw. Lowered eyelids... 
           making a FUNNY OGRE FACE.

           Bill chuckles, tries more faces.

           INT. LOBBY - UNIVERSAL PRESS SYNDICATE - DAY

           The elevator DINGS OPEN. Bill steps up to the front desk, 
           where an uglier, OLDER RECEPTIONIST waits. She looks just 
           like MS. WORMWOOD, Calvin's menacing first-grade teacher.

                                 BILL
                        I'm Bill Watterson. I'm here to see 
                        Lee Salem.

                                 OLDER RECEPTIONIST
                        Have a seat.

           Bill finds a sofa, sits. POSTER FRAMES are on the same wall 
           -- the same classic comic strips, but the posters are older.

                                 HANDSOME MAN (O.S.)
                        So you're Bill Watterson.
           Next to Bill on the sofa is -- a suave, HANDSOME MAN (30s), 
           sipping a glass of clear soda, reading the New York Times.

                                 BILL
                        Yes. Hello.

           The man doesn't look at Bill. Just sips and reads.

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Making quite a name for yourself.

                                 BILL
                        I don't know.

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        It's true. You're what, twenty-
                        five? Don't know a single soul who 
                        doesn't love your shit. I'd say 
                        you're pretty much on your way.

                                 BILL
                        On my way? ... To what?

           The DOOR OPENS, LEE steps out, visibly enthused --

                                 LEE
                        Bill.

           He comes over, shakes Bill's hand.

                                 LEE
                        So this is what a genius looks 
                        like. Good to finally meet you.

           Lee nods to the man on the couch.

                                 LEE
                        How you doing, Mr. Trudeau. Frank 
                        should be out here in a sec.

                                 GARRY TRUDEAU
                        I'm in no rush.

           Bill stares back stunned as Lee leads him away.

           BACK OFFICES

           Lee and Bill head towards his office.

                                 BILL
                        That was Garry Trudeau?

                                 LEE
                        Indeed, it was.
           Lee smirks at Bill's starstruck face.

                                 LEE    
                        You like Doonesbury?

                                 BILL
                        Of course.

           LEE'S OLD OFFICE

           Lee leads Bill in, passes him. Bill enters, stops dead in 
           his tracks -- because the entire office is littered with...

           ...CALVIN & HOBBES MERCHANDISE.

           Lee tries to clean up --

                                 LEE
                        Welcome to my abode. As you can 
                        see, it's doubling as a storage 
                        room for all this junk from the 
                        sales teams. Not junk. You know 
                        what I mean.

           Bill walks around, taking it all in...Calvin & Hobbes T-
           SHIRTS are slung over a chair. Framed POSTERS are leaned 
           against the wall. COFFEE MUGS. GREETING CARDS. CALENDARS. 

                                 LEE
                        Was hoping the Hobbes dolls would 
                        be here, but I guess you'll have to 
                        wait to see those. Hey, want a mug? 
                        Take a mug. Give it to that new 
                        wife of yours, she'll love it.

           It's like a gift shop. Bill is speechless.

                                 BILL
                        What is this?

                                 LEE
                        What do you mean?

                                 BILL
                        This. These.

           Lee stops.

                                 LEE
                        This is your bounty, Bill. These--
                        are the fruits of your labor. And 
                        it's just the beginning. 
                                 BILL
                        The beginning?

                                 LEE
                        You are on your way.

                                 BILL
                        To what?

                                 LEE
                        To success! To fame. Fortune. You 
                        are on your way...to the big time.

           Lee aproaches him.

                                 LEE    
                        You know this is why you're here, 
                        right? To go over licensing deals? 
                        I said that, I know I said that.

                                 BILL
                        You said I had to sign papers.

                                 LEE
                        Yes, contracts. For the deals.

           Bill looks around...

                                 LEE
                        I don't get it, what's the problem?

                                 BILL
                        It's just...I don't know if I'm  
                        interested in this sort of thing--

                                 LEE
                        You don't know if you're interest--
                        what are you, nuts?

                                 BILL
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        Bill, do you have any idea what 
                        you've created here? Calvin & 
                        Hobbes is a phenomenon. It's 
                        exceeded every expectation. In less 
                        than a year, you've featured in two 
                        hundred fifty plus papers. That's 
                        the second biggest launch we've 
                        had. Editors are calling me, asking 
                        about the strip. Companies are 
                        pounding at my door, and not just 
                        this stuff, I'm talking, the big 
                        kahounas. I'm speaking with Mattel. 
                        I'm speaking with Kellog's. Sears. 
                        MasterCard. McDonald's. Bill, you 
                        shouldn't be interested, you should 
                        be foaming at the mouth right now. 
                        This is what it's all about. TV 
                        studios want you, animation--

                                 BILL
                        Animation?

                                 LEE
                        Know who called us the other day?

                                 BILL
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        Guess.

                                 BILL
                        I don't know.

                                 LEE
                        Guess.

                                 BILL
                        I don't--

                                 LEE
                        Steven Spielberg. He wants to work 
                        with you. Can you believe that?

                                 BILL
                        Why?

                                 LEE
                        Your cartoon is the goddamn apex of 
                        media entertainment. It's smart. 
                        It's funny. It's insightful, 
                        creative, charming. You've got the 
                        elegant social commentary mixed in 
                        with the burps and booger jokes. I 
                        don't know how it works, but it 
                        does. Adults love it, kids love 
                        it...Bill, it's everything we could 
                        hope for in a comic strip. 

           Lee settles in at his desk, sips coffee from a CALVIN MUG.

                                 LEE    
                        You know, Jim Davis ranked damn 
                        near the top of the Forbes List 
                        last year. Garfield's made him a 
                        millionaire many times over. If you 
                        play your cards right...I don't see 
                        any reason why you shouldn't be up 
                        there with him soon. Hell, Calvin 
                        could be bigger than Garfield, 
                        maybe better. And I'm not just 
                        saying that to butter you up.

           Lee gets out a STACK OF CONTRACTS, pats himself down.

                                 BILL
                        What are those?

                                 LEE
                        We need to get all this junk out of 
                        my office, and into stores across 
                        the country. Johnny Hancock is the 
                        only man standing in our way--

           He finds a PEN in his jacket, CLICKS it, sets it on the edge 
           of the table.

                                 LEE    
                        Come on. Let's start building your 
                        empire.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - HUDSON, OH - EVENING

           Bill pulls into the driveway of his NEW HOUSE. A JUST SOLD 
           SIGN is in the yard.

           SUPER: HUDSON, OHIO - 30 MILES FROM CHAGRIN FALLS

           IN THE CIVIC

           Bill looks deep in thought. He gets out, trudges to the 
           house...

                                 MELISSA (O.S., PRELAP)
                        What do you mean, they weren't your 
                        characters?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - BILL'S HOUSE - LATER

           Melissa PAINTS a portrait of an OLD MAN'S FACE. Unpacked 
           moving boxes sit against the wall behind her.

           SPRITE, no longer a kitten, tiptoes around her feet.

                                 MELISSA    
                        They didn't draw them right?
           INTERCUT WITH BILL'S STUDIO

           Bill is also working.

                                 BILL
                        No--well, yes, the drawings were a 
                        little off, but--those were not my 
                        characters regardless. 

           Bill draws his NEW SUNDAY STRIP. Each of the dozen or so 
           tiny panels has CALVIN making a different FUNNY FACE -- 
           mimicking the ones Bill was doing in the elevator earlier --

                                 BILL    
                        The Calvin and Hobbes on those 
                        products are not the Calvin and 
                        Hobbes I created. Can you imagine 
                        my Calvin, selling his image to a 
                        greeting card company? Selling his 
                        own soul, for a few dollars?

                                 MELISSA
                             (actually)
                        Well...

           Bill DRAWS the LAST PANEL: Calvin's parents flipping through 
           Polaroids -- Calvin used their camera to document his faces.

                                 BILL
                        It doesn't make sense. You put them 
                        on t-shirts, or in a commercial, 
                        and you suck the life right out of 
                        them. You turn them into shells. 
                        Puppets, instead of real people.

           Melissa sighs at her dull PAINTING. She hates it.

                                 MELISSA
                        Honey, they aren't real people.

           She dabs some BRIGHT BLUE PAINT -- paints a childish smiley 
           face over the old man -- ruining all that time and effort.

                                 BILL
                        The point remains. I don't want my 
                        characters living anywhere except 
                        in the world I created them for. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Come on, Sprite. Pumperknickel, 
                        Juniper Boots.

           TWO NEW KITTENS on the couch fall in line with Sprite. They 
           all march single file behind Melissa, into the KITCHEN.
                                 BILL
                        Anything else is...blasphemy.

           Melissa feeds the cats.

                                 MELISSA
                        Blasphemy? God.

                                 BILL
                        Or...I don't know, an insult.

                                 MELISSA
                        Well, I wish you'd at least talked 
                        to me before you said no. A little 
                        extra cash would have been nice. We 
                        did just buy a house. 

                                 BILL
                        I make enough.

                                 MELISSA
                        Okay, but that doesn't mean you 
                        just turn down free money.

                                 BILL
                        The money's not free, there's a 
                        price. There's always a price.

           Melissa shakes her head. Then, something comes to her...

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill.

           BILL'S STUDIO

           Melissa wanders in...

                                 MELISSA
                        How much money did you turn down?

                                 BILL
                        When?

                                 MELISSA
                        Today. In New York. How much did 
                        they offer you if you signed all 
                        the...contracts, or whatever.

                                 BILL
                        It's not a "they". It's not one big 
                        team. And we didn't sit around and 
                        tally the offers up like Scrooges. 
                        I don't see why it matters anyhow--
                                 MELISSA
                        It matters, Bill. If you are just 
                        throwing away large sums of money--

                                 BILL
                        I'm don't care about the money--

                                 MELISSA
                        I'm your wife, this concerns me--

                                 BILL
                        It's my strip. Not yours.

           A beat.

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill, how much--

                                 BILL
                        Two million. At least, probably 
                        more. And there are more offers 
                        coming.

                                 MELISSA
                        Two million dollars?? What are you, 
                        nuts?!

                                 BILL
                        I turned them all down...cause I 
                        don't want any part of that.

           Then --

           Melissa doesn't look so good. She hurries out, into a 

           BATHROOM

           and VOMITS into the toilet. Bill enters shortly.

                                 BILL
                        Are you okay? 

           She waves him away, GROANS, BELCHES -- VOMITS again. 

           BILL'S STUDIO - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Bill works again on the same STRIP...except now, the CALVIN 
           in each panel is making the FUNNY FACES in animated, real-
           time...it looks a little like a cartoon Hollywood Squares.

           Bill nods, bites into his dinner -- a PB & J SANDWICH.

           A SHADOW appears in Bill's doorway --
                                 MELISSA
                        I'm going to bed.

                                 BILL
                        How're you feeling?

                                 MELISSA
                        Just been a little sick lately. 
                        Hey, a reporter called today. I 
                        think he wants to interview you.

                                 BILL
                        Why?

                                 MELISSA
                        Dunno. Maybe cause you're famous. 
                             (long beat)
                        Bill...think of what we could do 
                        with that money. Or even a tenth of 
                        that. We could pay off the house. 
                        We could open a savings account. 
                        Invest. Start a college fund--

                                 BILL
                        We went to college.

                                 MELISSA
                        Not for us, dummy. Our children.

                                 BILL
                        Oh.

                                 MELISSA
                        Think about our future, Bill. 
                        There's nothing wrong with making 
                        money. Nothing wrong with having 
                        success, it's not selling out. I 
                        mean--isn't this what you wanted? 

           A beat.

                                 BILL
                        I have everything I want.

           Bill goes back to work. Melissa lingers. Walks away.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - COLUMBUS, OHIO, 1991 - MORNING

           ...and then MELISSA (OLDER) is walking through the lobby 
           alone. BILL trails a few yards behind with their luggage. 

           The HOTEL CLERK (who may have tipped off that reporter) 
           smiles at Melissa from the FRONT DESK, waves at Bill --
                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        Good day, Mr. Watterson. Hope 
                        you'll see us again next time 
                        you're in Columbus.

                                 BILL
                        Thank you. I don't think we will.

           EXT. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) CAMPUS - MORNING

           Bill drives their RENTAL CAR through a campus entrance -- a 
           red sign says THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY -- ESTABLISHED 1870.

           INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Bill motors them through the beautiful, expansive main OSU 
           campus -- the largest campus in the nation. STUDENTS swarm 
           all around in their red and white Buckeye shirts.

           Bill stops at a CROSSWALK. A CAR idles in front of them. On 
           its BACK WINDOW...

           Is the iconic STICKER OF CALVIN PISSING AND SNICKERING.

           Bill snarls at it.

           EXT. WEXNER CENTER FOR THE ARTS - OSU - MORNING

           Bill and Melissa march towards a curious, modern BRICK 
           BUILDING deep in the heart of the campus. A big banner  
           reads OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY -- FESTIVAL OF CARTOON ART!

                                 MELISSA
                        Did you finish your speech?

                                 BILL
                        I have all day.

                                 MELISSA
                        Just don't say anything stupid.

                                 BILL
                        Like what?

                                 MELISSA
                        You know what. Your boss is here.

                                 BILL
                        I'm going to say exactly what I 
                        want to say. If anyone is offended,  
                        they can go soak their heads.
                                 MELISSA
                        Yeah. Don't say stuff like that.

           INT. ATRIUM - WEXNER CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Bill and Melissa wander into a large open area. CROWDS 
           mingle, chatter. STUDENTS are lined up at tables where 
           famous COMIC STRIP ARTISTS are signing autographs... 

           -- JOHNNY HART (60), for B.C.

           -- JIM BORGMAN (30s), for ZITS.

           -- SCOTT ADAMS (30s), for DILBERT.

           ...and many others -- it's a convention for the comic strip 
           world. Bill notices

           LYNN JOHNSTON (40s), the author of FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. 
           Lynn sees Bill too, smiles, waves. Bill nods awkwardly back.

           Bill moves on, takes in the POSTERS and MERCHANDISE for sale 
           at every table, grumbling to himself over it, then he spots

           GARRY TRUDEAU (40s), chatting up some female co-eds at his 
           own DOONESBURY table, looking suave as ever. Garry salutes 
           Bill with a flick of the fingers. Bill nods back again --

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Who is that?

           Melissa is looking at a TABLE SWARMED BY A CROWD, so thick 
           we can't see through it, until the crowd parts slightly...

                                 MELISSA
                        Oh. 

           It's the GARFIELD table. A bubbly, bald JIM DAVIS (40s) is 
           signing autographs and talking with his fans magnanimously. 
           He's surrounded by dozens of giant Garfield and Odie faces.

                                 MELISSA    
                        It's Jim.

           Bill and Jim lock eyes. Sworn, mortal enemies. Or something.

                                 MELISSA    
                        Hey, there's your table.

           At the end of the row is Bill's spot, identified only by a 
           sheet taped to the table, which just says "BILL WATTERSON".

           Bill takes a breath, creeps towards it...
           And, one by one, people in the crowds start to notice. They 
           whisper to each other, nod towards Bill, their hero emerged 
           from darkness. Even the other artists peek over at him.

           The crowds pool, converge quickly towards his table -- on 
           track to get there even before him --

           -- and Bill redirects himself to an EXIT.

                                 MELISSA    
                        Bill? Where are you going?

           But he's already gone.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER (O.S., PRELAP)
                        One....two....

           INT. BILL'S STUDIO - HUDSON, OH, 1986 - DAY

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Three!

           A CAMERA CLICKS a photo --

           BILL (YOUNGER) is posed at his drafting table. A REPORTER is 
           taking pictures of him for the interview they just finished.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        One more. Aaaanndd...

           He presses -- but it doesn't click this time. Press. Press.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Wuh-oh. Hang on. 

           He tries to fix the camera. Bill rolls his eyes.

           FOYER - SAME

           MELISSA carries in a bag of groceries.

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill? Is that reporter still here?

           No answer.

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           She sets the bag on the counter -- digs in, fishes out...a 
           BABY BLUE ENVELOPE -- "MR. BILL WATTERSON" written on it.

           Melissa smiles at it.
           HALLWAY

           She creeps through, throws a glance at BILL'S STUDIO, where 
           the door is half open...

                                 HUDSON REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Alrigty, that should do it... Nope. 
                        Hang on.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                             (just barely audible)
                        Ugh...

           Twirling the ENVELOPE with pinched fingers as she enters...

           THE BEDROOM

           ...where Melissa delicately props it on Bill's nightstand.

           BILL'S STUDIO

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Okay. Sorry about that. Here we go, 
                        one...two...

           CLICK.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Know what I was thinking? What if I 
                        actually got a couple of you 
                        drawing? Wouldn't that be great?

           Bill glares at the man.

           LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Melissa cleans up the coffee table. Two mugs. The reporter's 
           OPEN NOTEBOOK. PEN. TAPE RECORDER. SPRITE hops up, tiptoes 
           over it all. 

           Some of Melissa's PAINTINGS are on stands in the background. 
           One of them has a FATHER and MOTHER walking their CHILD down  
           a forest trail.

           Melissa admires the FIRST CALVIN & HOBBES BOOK on the table. 
           The cover has Calvin flying with his umbrella over the pond.

           Melissa starts to go, but something else catches her eye. 
           She stops, comes back to the table...

           Where a particular NOTE in the NOTEBOOK stands out to her...

           Melissa picks up the notebook, stares at a sentence. Scans 
           the rest of the page. FLIPS a couple, nothing else related.
           Then...she sees the TAPE RECORDER.

           BILL'S STUDIO

           Bill holds his pencil over a CALVIN STRIP like he's drawing.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Ummm...how about you look back at 
                        the camera. Yeah, yeah look at me.

                                 BILL
                        Am I drawing...or am I looking at 
                        you?

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        You're drawing while looking at me.

           Bill faces him.

                                 BILL
                        This has been a treat.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Now smile.

           Bill bares his teeth awkwardly -- CLICK.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Perfect.

           LIVING ROOM

           Melissa is PLAYING BACK the interview, listening intently...

                                 HUDSON REPORTER (O.S.)
                         ...do you feel about Garfield?

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        How do I feel about Garfield. Well, 
                        I'll tell you--

           Melissa REWINDS, PLAYS...

                                 HUDSON REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...book has sold over five hundred 
                        thousand--

           REWINDS, PLAYS...

                                 HUDSON REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...amazed a guy like you doesn't 
                        have any kids. Any plans for it?

           Now, Melissa listens intently...
                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Nah, I don't think so. I mean, we 
                        haven't talked, but...Calvin's 
                        enough burden as it is. I don't 
                        think I could stand another little 
                        brat running around the house.

           The REPORTER and BILL enter the living room. See Melissa.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Are you saying Calvin runs around 
                        your house?

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Oh, I see. No, of course not--

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        Hello.

           Melissa promptly HITS STOP.

                                 MELISSA
                        I'm sorry. I was just curious.

                                 HUDSON REPORTER
                        I could get you a copy...

                                 MELISSA
                        Excuse me.

           She disappears into the kitchen.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE (ESTABLISHING) - EVENING

           INT. BILL'S STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Bill is going through FAN MAIL. We catch glimpses of the 
           letters people are writing: "DEAR MR. WATTERSON..." -- "I AM 
           YOUR BIGGEST FAN..." -- "HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH..."

                                 BILL
                             (calling out)
                        What is it with these people? Huh? 
                        Interviews, photos, autographs... 
                        who am I, Tom Cruise?

           Bill tears open a new envelope.

                                 BILL
                        Just let me work.

           He slides out a letter, and a PHOTO...
           It's a COUPLE -- dressed up as Calvin and Hobbes. In front 
           of a SEA GREEN VAN. The wife wears a red striped shirt and 
           spiky blonde hair. The husband has an orange tiger suit on.

           It's a little creepy. 

                                 BILL
                        Dear god...

           HALLWAY

           Bill storms out of his studio, PHOTO in hand.

                                 BILL
                        Melissa. Come here, look at these 
                        nutjobs--

           BEDROOM

           He enters -- stops...

           Because Melissa is packing a suitcase.

                                 BILL
                        What are you doing?

           She SNIFFS.

                                 MELISSA
                        I'm going to my sister's. Max is 
                        out of town for a few days, she 
                        needs help around the house.

                                 BILL
                        What? What is going on--

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill, do you want kids?

           Bill stares at her. Melissa stops packing.

                                 MELISSA
                        Do you want to have kids?

                                 BILL
                        Where is this coming from--

                                 MELISSA
                        Tell me.

                                 BILL
                        ... Do you want kids--
                                 MELISSA
                        YES!

                                 BILL
                        Well...I don't know...we haven't--

                                 MELISSA
                        Why not?

           Bill searches...

                                 MELISSA
                        Because they'd annoy you? Are 
                        children some kind of nuisance? A 
                        distraction from your comics?

                                 BILL
                        Comic strips. Not comics. 

           Melissa ZIPS up her suitcase. Lugs it past Bill, stops --

                                 MELISSA
                        You know, I think I've figured out 
                        why you can write Calvin so well. 
                        How you can just live inside the 
                        mind of a little boy.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe it's cause you are one.

           And with that, she leaves.

           Bill stands dumbly for a moment -- then, he spots the BLUE 
           ENVELOPE on the nightstand addressed to him. He slides out 
           the card -- it shows a FLYING STORK and a message:

           "CONGRATULATIONS! ... YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PAPA BIRD!"

           In the distance -- THUNDER BOOMS...

           BILL'S STUDIO - NIGHT

           HEAVY RAIN outside. Gray.

           Bill sits at his table. Not working, but staring...

           OUTSIDE, THROUGH THE WINDOW

           Animated CALVIN appears, walking down the sidewalk with an 
           UMBRELLA. He stops, feels the RAIN. OPENS his umbrella, 
           props it upside down -- hops in, as the water fills up.

           Calvin "TA-DAAS" his hands at Bill: a pool!

           Bill watches the cartoon boy. With a blank face...
           INT. RESTROOM STALL - WEXNER CENTER, 1991 - DAY

           ...and BILL (OLDER) is hunched on a toilet seat, working on  
           his SPEECH. His scribbling HAND drifts left to right across 
           the paper -- revealing, at the bottom of the page --

           A small DOODLE of CALVIN.

           Bill stops. Examines his dumb, lifeless character for a 
           moment -- it's like Bill is just pining for inspiration...

           KNOCK-KNOCK.

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                             (from outside)
                        Bill?

           Melissa sneaks inside the restroom. Checks under the stall 
           doors...

                                 MELISSA
                        Are you in here?

                                 BILL
                        No. Go away.

                                 MELISSA
                        What are you doing, hiding?

           She peeks through a CRACK in Bill's closed door.

                                 MELISSA
                        I seeeee you.

           Bill doesn't think it's funny.

                                 MELISSA
                        They're starting in a few minutes, 
                        Bill. You have to go out there.

                                 BILL
                        Fine.

                                 MELISSA
                        Are you okay? Nervous?

                                 BILL
                        Nope. 

           Melissa squints at him. Bill musters a grin for her...

           Then, a FLUSSSHHHH -- from the LAST STALL. Melissa scurries 
           out as a FAT GUY emerges and washes his hands at the sink.
           Bill sighs -- SCRATCHES OUT CALVIN, gets to his feet.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE, 1986 - MORNING

           Bright and sunny again.

           A UPS MAN stumbles out of a UPS TRUCK with a BIG BOX, 
           marches to Bill's porch...

           INT. BILL'S STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK.

           BILL (YOUNGER) is asleep at his table, right where we left 
           him. Head slung back. SPRITE has climbed onto Bill's shirt, 
           and claws at his wide open, SNORING mouth.

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK... DING-DONG!

           Bill wakes.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           He opens the door. 

                                 UPS MAN
                        Sign here, please.

           Signs.

                                 UPS MAN
                        Hey, are you Bill Watterson?

           Bill takes the box, shuts the door.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           He sets the box down. SLICES, opens it --

           ...and dozens of plush, orange HOBBES DOLLS smile up at him.

           Bill stares at them. Checks the sender address: "DAKIN 
           TOYS...WOODLAND HILLS, CALIFORNIA..."

           And now, Bill is starting to look angry...

           RIIIING. RIIIING. (PRELAP)...
           INT. LEE'S OLD OFFICE - NYC - LATER

           Lee reads his CALLER ID. Picks up the phone -- 

                                 LEE
                        Bill! How you doing, buddy? How's 
                        that wife, she still keeping you 
                        sane?

           INTERCUT WITH BILL'S CARPORT

           Bill paces about his driveway with a cordless phone.

                                 BILL
                        Fine. We're fine, Lee, thanks.

                                 LEE
                        Good news, good news--hey, kudos on 
                        the new book, man. Those things are 
                        selling like hotcakes. Hey, whaddya 
                        say about a book tour...

           LYNN JOHNSTON and GARRY TRUDEAU are in Lee's office. Garry 
           sips his soda, cool as ever. Lynn we recognize as the woman 
           who waves at Bill at the Festival. A perky, bright-eyed 
           blonde, her knees folded on top of her seat like a teen.

                                 LYNN JOHNSTON
                             (hushed, no way)
                        Is that Bill Watterson?

           Garry shrugs.

                                 LYNN JOHNSTON
                        Have you met him yet?

           Garry shrugs again. 

           BACK TO BILL AND LEE

                                 BILL
                        Lee, did you give out my address? 
                        To a company called "Dakin Toys"?

                                 LEE
                        Oh, you got the dolls. Oh, good.

           The BOX of HOBBES DOLLS sit next to a pile of junk against 
           the house, near Bill's feet.

                                 BILL
                        I'd prefer if you didn't hand out 
                        my personal information like that.
                                 LYNN JOHNSTON
                        Ask if he's going to San Francisco.

                                 LEE
                        Hey Bill, you know you just won the 
                        Reuben Award? Cartoonist of the 
                        Year. Lynn Johnston's here, she's 
                        hoping to meet you at the ceremony.

                                 BILL
                        Who?

                                 LEE
                        Lynn Johnston. For Better or--come 
                        on, you don't know Lynn Johnston?

                                 BILL
                        No.

                                 LEE
                        No? 

                                 BILL
                        I'm not going to the ceremony.

                                 LEE
                        Why not?

                                 BILL
                        I don't care about awards.

                                 LEE
                        Come out for drinks then. Meeting 
                        people, that's what it's all ab--

                                 BILL
                        I DON'T CARE ABOUT MEETING PEOPLE!

           Silence. 

           Lynn is stunned. Everyone heard that.

           Bill KICKS the BOX OF DOLLS -- his foot goes through the 
           cardboard side, and Bill struggles to pull it back out.

                                 LEE
                             (to Lynn)
                        Give us a minute?

           Lynn gets up. Taps Garry, who moseys up, follows her out.

                                 LEE
                        Bill, is everything alright?
           Bill topples over, spilling dozens of tiger dolls out onto 
           the driveway. His phone lies stranded on the ground nearby. 

                                 LEE
                        I was trying to get you to have 
                        fun, man. Don't have to be an 
                        asshole. You should go bowling or 
                        something, methinks you're working 
                        too hard. Yello? Bill, you there?

           Bill slides his foot out, grabs his phone. Starts picking 
           up, slamming the dolls back into their box: SMACK! SMACK!

                                 BILL
                        I thought I'd made it clear I am 
                        not interested in these things.

                                 LEE
                        The awards?

                                 BILL
                        These stupid things! 

           SMACK.

                                 BILL
                        Merchandise. I want you to stop 
                        bugging me about merchandising.

                                 LEE
                        Okay...

                                 BILL
                        I said I didn't wanna do it, and I 
                        meant it. It's unethical. Wrong.

           A beat.

                                 LEE
                        Bill, are we gonna have a problem? 
                        You know, you signed a contract. 
                        Technically, we don't have to ask 
                        permission to do any of this.

                                 BILL
                        Fine. Go ahead. Turn me into your 
                        money-making slave why don't you--

                                 LEE
                        Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. I'm 
                        just looking out for number one--

                                 BILL
                        Lee?
                                 LEE
                        What.

                                 BILL
                        Go soak your head.

                                 LEE
                        Go soak my?--

           CLICK, DIAL TONE...

           Bill stares at the LAST HOBBES DOLL in his hand. Its plastic 
           beaded eyes. Its tiny little whiskers. Such a cute little--

           SLAM! Into the box. Bill marches inside.

           MUSIC MONTAGE - BILL & HIS ANGRY, LONESOME SELF

           (This sequence follows the same format as the first montage: 
           split-screen drawings in real-time, comic strips sliding 
           across the screen, Bill voicing his characters' dialogue -- 

           But the feel of it is different. This is not a blossoming 
           artist creating magic for the first time. This is a grumpy 
           man, whose anger does little to make us afraid -- and more 
           often than not, it serves only to make us giggle.)

           BILL'S STUDIO - DAY

           Bill goes through his PRE-ROUTINE...ANGRY STYLE. He WHIPS 
           out a blank page -- SLAPS it on his desk. He CRACKS his 
           knuckles, just by curling his fingers. He GRINDS pencils in 
           a sharperner while gritting his teeth like Schwarzenegger. 

           We spin around Bill as he draws a NEW STRIP of Calvin and 
           Hobbes talking under a tree...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        What do you think is the secret to 
                        happiness? Is it money, power, or 
                        fame? I'd choose money. If you have 
                        enough money, you can buy fame and 
                        power. Happiness is being famous 
                        for your financial ability to 
                        indulge in every kind of excess.

                                 HOBBES (BILL) (V.O.)
                        I suppose that's one way to define 
                        it.

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        The part I think I'd like best is 
                        crushing people who get in my way.
           Bill snickers to himself...then -- RIIIIING. RIIIIING...

           Bill perks up...

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The PHONE BEEPS, a MESSAGE is recorded --

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Hey Bill, it's Lee. Listen, man, I 
                        feel bad about the way things ended 
                        when we talked. Gimme a call when 
                        you get this, I've got some news--

           Bill's FINGER hits the DELETE BUTTON --

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE
                        Message erased.

           BILL'S STUDIO - NIGHT

           Bill works some more...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        A lot of people don't have 
                        principles, but I do! I live 
                        according to one principle, and I 
                        never deviate from it.

                                 HOBBES (BILL) (V.O.)
                        What's your principle?

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        Look out for number one.

           Bill nods, drink his CHOCOLATE MILK, wipes his mouth --

           SPRITE hops on the table, knocks over the glass -- it spills 
           dangerously close to Bill's drawing before he saves it --

           -- and the PHONE starts to RING again...

                                 BILL
                             (to the cat)
                        What are you doing?!

           Sprite HISSES back.

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bill enters, grabs handfuls of paper towels... BEEP!

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Bill. It's Lee again, I'm at 
                        home. Just checking to see if you 
                        got my message--

           Bill picks up the phone, SLAMS it back down. Stops... 
           Considers. He picks it up again, dials... RIIIIING...

           SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The call gets through to a PHONE -- a HAND picks it up --

           SOMEONE'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           ...MELISSA is playing with her sister's CUTE TODDLERS. 

           Her sister JANET (30s) enters, holding the phone.

                                 JANET
                        Bill.

           Melissa stops. Thinks... Shakes her head. Janet leaves.

           BILL'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bill stands with a dead phone in his hand.

           DIRT ROAD - THE NEXT MORNING

           Bill bikes down a path, helmet strapped, spandex tight round 
           the thighs -- enjoying fresh air and nature for a change...

           A PICK-UP TRUCK SPUTTERS by him, horn HONKING -- pulls in 
           front of Bill --

                                 TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Off the road, asshole!

           The DRIVER tosses a BEER CAN out his window -- it floats on 
           the wind delicately...then it SMACKS Bill's shirt, leaving a 
           sticky mess --

           Bill sneers...

           BILL'S STUDIO - DAY

           Bill draws, irate, still in his biker gear...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        Hey dad, I'm doing a traffic safety 
                        poster. Any ideas for a slogan?

                                 CALVIN'S DAD (BILL) (V.O.)
                        Sure! "Cyclists have a right to the 
                        road too, you noisy, polluting, 
                        inconsiderate maniacs! I hope gas 
                        goes up to eight bucks a gal--

           SNAP. Bill's PENCIL HAS BROKEN. He tosses it aside, grabs 
           ANOTHER ONE from a neat line-up of PENCILS, keeps going...

                                 CALVIN'S DAD (BILL) (V.O.)
                        I hope gas goes up eight bucks a 
                        gallon...

           LEE'S OLD OFFICE - MORNING

           Lee opens a PACKAGE FROM BILL -- slides out Bill's NEW 
           STRIPS. Scans over bits we've just seen: "I'd choose money" 
           -- "crushing people..." -- "Look out for number one", etc.

                                 LEE
                        Son of a bitch.

           BILL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Bill is on the floor, SCRIBBLING DIALOGUE and SKETCHES in a 
           NOTEBOOK...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        I stand firm in my belief of what's 
                        right! I refuse to compromise my 
                        principles!
                             (next)
                        In my opinion, we don't devote 
                        nearly enough scientific research 
                        to finding a cure for jerks. 
                             (next)
                        Why should I have to work for 
                        everything? It's like saying I 
                        don't deserve it!
                             (next)
                        The secret to happiness is short-
                        term, stupid self-interest!

           The PHONE starts to RING. Bill stops, shakes out his tired 
           wrist. As he rolls his neck around his shoulders, his eyes 
           fall upon something else in the room...

           KITCHEN - SAME

           BEEP! MESSAGE is RECORDED...

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Alright, buddy. Got your new stuff, 
                        point taken. I'm gonna ship this, 
                        but go easy on the jabs from now 
                        on, okay? Don't make this about us. 

           BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM
           Bill is now gazing solemnly at this mysterious object...

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        You know, merchandising isn't 
                        "wrong". The problem is, you see 
                        everything in black and white. 
                        There are not two sides to every 
                        issue, Bill. There are hundreds. 
                        You're oversimplifying the issue. 

           Bill stands. Marches off with purpose.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Bill? Okay, I'll try again later.

           And the thing he was gazing at was... 

           Melissa's PAINTING of the PARENTS walking their CHILD.

                                 LEE (O.S.)
                        Come on, man. Are you even there?

           BILL'S STUDIO - LATER

           Bill lugs in a big cardboard box, and starts FILLING IT UP 
           with THINGS from his studio. He's what... packing?

           LATER

           The studio is empty now, except for the DRAFTING TABLE -- 
           which Bill is trying in vain to push through the door --

                                 BILL
                        How did you...even. fit. inhere?!

           The CATS jump on top of the table, making it more awkward.

           Bill stops. Sweaty. Pissed -- 

           RIIIIING... RIIIIING... Bill climbs over the table, shooing 
           the cats --

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Picks up the RINGING PHONE, answers this time --

                                 BILL
                        Why don't you go screw yourself!!

           SLAMS the phone back down...

           KITCHEN - JANET'S HOUSE - SAME

           ...and MELISSA, the one who called, holds a dead phone. 
           Janet's KIDS are eating a snack at the table beside her...

                                 JANET
                        What'd he say?

           Melissa is utterly baffled.

           BILL'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Bill has set up a small workplace in his cramped, windowless 
           basement. A carpenter's bench is his desk. The same PEANUTS 
           POSTER from his grocery store days is taped onto the wall.

           LIVING ROOM - SAME

           All THREE CATS wait outside, by the SLIDING GLASS DOOR. Bill 
           has banished them. Pumpernickel gives off a lonesome MEOW...

           BACK IN THE BASEMENT

           Bill works on a SUNDAY STRIP -- calm again...

                                 CALVIN (BILL) (V.O.)
                        ...Calvin suddenly realizes the 
                        world has no hue, value, or chroma! 
                        Have the photoreceptors in his eyes 
                        stopped working properly, or has 
                        the fundamental nature of light 
                        changed? Perhaps objects no longer 
                        reflect certain wavelengths! 
                        Whatever the cause, it's clear to 
                        Calvin there's no point in 
                        discussing anything with his dad!

           Bill stops, sags. Tired. He dips an EGGO WAFFLE into a BOWL 
           OF SYRUP, tears off a bite -- admires his work as he eats...

           END MONTAGE

           INT. LEE'S OLD OFFICE - NYC - MORNING

           Lee opens a PACKAGE from Bill, slides out the strip we just 
           saw him working on -- 

           Calvin is exploring his house in wonder -- everything around 
           him has turned BLACK AND WHITE. Lee scans to the LAST PANEL, 
           which is back to COLOR and has Calvin arguing with his dad.

                                 LEE
                             (reading Calvin's dad)
                        The problem is, you see everything 
                        in black and white...
                             (reading Calvin)
                        Sometimes, that's just the way 
                        things are...

           Lee shakes his head. Sighs. Picks up his PHONE...

           INT. BILL'S STUDIO - DAY

           A BRUSH strokes columns of SKY BLUE PAINT down a wall...

           Bill is painting his studio. In fact, turning it into a BABY 
           ROOM. A brand new CRIB is in the corner. Baby TOYS on the 
           floor. His drafting table is now hidden under a bedsheet.

           Bill looks back over his shoulder at...

           Animated CALVIN and HOBBES, quietly painting another wall. 

           PULL BACK, and reveal the MAN-EATING ALIENS Cavlin's been 
           doodling on the wall in white paint....

           Bill doesn't care. It's good to have them back.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Bill walks through, carrying a tray of dirty brushes.

                                 BILL
                             (humming)
                        Somewhere, over the rainbow...hmm 
                        hmm flyyyy...

           All THREE CATS still wait outside by the SLIDING GLASS DOOR.

           Bill KISSES at them. 

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           He carries in the tray just as the PHONE starts to RING. 
           Bill sighs, sets the tray down. Picks up the phone... 

                                 BILL
                        Hello?

           INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           JANET is on the phone. NURSES and PATIENTS stride down the 
           hallway behind her.

                                 JANET
                        Bill?
                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Yes?

                                 JANET
                        It's Janet.

           INTERCUT WITH BILL'S KITCHEN

                                 BILL
                        Oh. Hello.

                                 JANET
                        Melissa's in the hospital.

                                 BILL
                        What? Where, what happened?

                                 JANET
                        She had a miscarriage, Bill. She 
                        lost her baby. I'm so sorry...

           INT. LECTURE HALL - WEXNER CENTER, 1991 - DAY

           An old lady COORDINATOR speaks from the podium.

                                 COORDINATOR
                        First of all, I'd like to thank 
                        everyone for attending the fourth 
                        quadriannual Ohio Festival of 
                        Cartoon Art. It's been a lot of 
                        fun...and it's about to get even 
                        better. I present to you now, our 
                        guest speaker. The brilliant, the 
                        talented, the uncanny, indisputable 
                        icon of this generation of 
                        cartoonists: Mr. Bill Watterson!

           Bill takes the stage as the AUDIENCE CLAPS -- MELISSA, GARRY 
           TRUDEAU, and LYNN JOHNSTON included. JIM DAVIS...refrains.

                                 COORDINATOR
                        Please, give a warm welcome, and 
                        let him know how grateful we are 
                        for his appearance--as they do seem 
                        to come few and far between.

           Bill stands at the podium, gets out his speech. The APPLAUSE 
           still going. Into the dead microphone --

                                 BILL
                             (barely audible)
                        Thank you.
                                 COORDINATOR
                        Oh.

           The coordinator waddles back up. Turns the mic on, DOUBLE 
           TAPS it.

                                 BILL
                             (loud and clear)
                        Thank you.

           Someone WOOS. Bill flattens his speech before him so he can 
           read it...

                                 BILL
                        When I was five years old, I copied 
                        a picture of Snoopy and turned it 
                        in as my own for a school project. 

           Some CHUCKLES. 

                                 BILL
                        It was hardly a competent tracing, 
                        let alone an actual drawing. But it 
                        was at least good enough to get my 
                        teacher's attention. She confronted 
                        me about my sham assignment, I 
                        confessed, and my parents found out 
                        later that evening. Needless to 
                        say, I learned a great lesson that 
                        day about the value of originality.

           A DOOR in the BACK OPENS -- LEE SALEM and JOHN MCMEEL 
           quietly step in. They settle in against the BACK WALL.

           Bill's sees them, stops. His eyes wander from them, to

           MELISSA in the CROWD. He shares a brief look with his 
           wife...then continues... 

                                 BILL
                        ...about respecting another 
                        artist's work. And, in a more 
                        general sense, I learned about the 
                        difference between right and wrong. 
                        I've tried to carry that lesson 
                        with me throughout my career, not 
                        just in drawing, but in life.
                             (beat, hesitates)
                        But now, I am sad to say...I find 
                        myself in the company of many 
                        artists, many business men, and 
                        many fans...who have yet to learn 
                        or else have completely forgotten 
                        these most basic of moral lessons.
           Quiet CONFUSION falls on the CROWD.

           JIM DAVIS grinds his teeth. GARRY TRUDEAU sips his soda.

           LEE stares at Bill.

           Bill CLEARS his throat, smooths out his page...as Melissa 
           watches him with concern...

           EXT. BACKYARD - BILL'S HOUSE, 1987 - DAY

           The WOODS behind Bill's house extend for some distance...

           MELISSA (YOUNGER) stares vacantly at them. She's in a basket 
           chair on the patio, wrapped in a quilt. It is AUTUMN now...

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        She won't even talk to me.

           INT. KITCHEN - BILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           JANET and BILL (YOUNGER) do the DISHES. Janet washes, Bill 
           dries.

                                 JANET
                        Just sits around all day, staring. 
                        You know, I don't even think she's 
                        cried once?

           Janet's not rinsing well, leaving SOAP on the dishes. It's 
           testing Bill's patience to have to wipe it off each time.

                                 JANET
                        It's not healthy, to bottle stuff 
                        up like that. She lost her child... 
                        she needs to express herself. 

                                 BILL
                        Mmm.

           Janet BURPS.

                                 JANET
                        Excuse me.

           She throws the last dish on the rack, dries her hands.

                                 JANET
                        Okay. I'm gonna run get her meds.

                                 BILL
                        That's alright, I can do it.
                                 JANET
                        Are you sure?

                                 BILL
                        In fact, why don't you go home, 
                        Janet. You've been enough help.

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           Bill steps outside. Melissa has not budged.

                                 BILL
                        I'm going to the pharmacy. Would 
                        you like to come? ... Melissa?

           She gazes ahead. Bill watches her. Retreats into the house.

           EXT. PHARMACY - DOWNTOWN HUDSON - DAY

           Bill parks his RED CIVIC in the lot. Strides into the store, 
           throwing a curious glance at a SEA GREEN VAN sitting nearby.

           INT. PHARMACY - DAY

           Bill walks up to the pharmacy counter, slides over an RX to 
           the PHARMACIST.

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Hiya.

           The pharmacist disappears into the back. Bill waits with his 
           hands in his pockets, surveying the empty store. Then -- we 
           hear a CASHIER SQUEAL with delight --

                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        Well would you look at that! You 
                        two are adorable. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Thank you.

                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        Are you supposed to be Calvin?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        That's right.

           Bill's eyes pop: what. He quickly and quietly snoops ACROSS 
           THE STORE, creeping, sidestepping, like a budding Ethan Hunt 
           -- until he finally stops...and peeks around a corner... 
           CASH REGISTER

           and... it is... THE CREEPY COUPLE. The WOMAN with the 
           treated blonde spikes. The HUSBAND with the tiger suit.

           Bill spies on their conversation, in shock...

                                 CASHIER
                        Gosh, I love your little whiskers. 
                        What is this for, a costume party?

                                 FEMALE CALVIN
                        No, actually, we read an interview 
                        with Bill Watterson, the author of 
                        Calvin & Hobbes, and it mentioned 
                        that he lived in Hudson, Ohio--

                                 BILL
                             (whispers to self)
                        Nutjobs!

                                 CASHIER
                        He does?? I didn't know that.

                                 FEMALE CALVIN 
                        Mm-hmm. So we decided, we're such 
                        big fans...why not just drive out 
                        here and see if we can find him?

                                 CASHIER
                        Well, how bout that.

                                 FEMALE CALVIN
                        No luck yet though...

           Then, a LOUD VOICE from BACK ACROSS THE STORE --

                                 PHARMACIST (O.S.)
                        Mr. Watterson?

           Bill darts his eyes over his shoulder:

           The PHARMACIST is holding up his PRESCRIPTION BAG.

           The CREEPY COUPLE looks back, startled at hearing Bill's 
           name -- but can't see anything. They make for the back...

           Just in time to see BILL SNATCH the meds -- then dash out 
           the store --

                                 PHARMACIST
                        Hey! Hey!
           EXT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

           Bill hurries to his Civic, unlocks, hops in. Fires it up --

           IN THE CIVIC

           -- EEE EEE EEE EEE. EEE EEE EEE EEE.

           And his car won't start.

                                 BILL
                        NOOOOO!!!

           INTERCUT WITH PARKING LOT

           The CREEPY COUPLE emerges, big fat smiles, scouring.

           EEE EEE EEE EEE. EEE EEE EEE EEE.

           Bill stops. He spots a BIKE leaned against the PHARMACY.

           Looks back at the CREEPERS, coming close...

                                 FEMALE CALVIN
                        Mr. Watterson! Mr. Watterson!

           Back at the BIKE --

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Bill speeds down the sidewalk on his STOLEN BICYCLE. 
           Frantic, maneuvering around the strolling town folk...

           The couple's SEA GREEN VAN trailing just yards behind.

                                 FEMALE CALVIN
                        Mr. Watterson! Mr. Watterson, wait!

                                 HOBBES GUY
                        We're your biggest fans!

                                 FEMALE CALVIN
                        Mr. Watterson!

           EXT. DIRT ROADS - DAY

           Bill races his bike. Fast and steady. Flies SMACKING his 
           face. He finally allows a look back over his shoulder...

           -- and the coast is clear. Whew. 

           Bill returns his gaze ahead --
           A CAR IS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM! HORN BLARING --

           Bill swerves his bike, wheels off the gravel...

           -- INTO A DITCH...CRASH!

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

           Bill pushes his bike down the street. Scuffed and scraped. 
           Leaves and branches protruding from his hair and clothes. 

           What a lovely turn of events.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - DAY

           As he nears his house, Bill peers curiously at a FANCY 
           CADILLAC parked on the curb. He comes closer and sees, 
           sitting there on his FRONT PORCH...

           TWO MEN in suits. One carries a BLACK LEATHER FOLDER. They 
           are DON and JOHN, and even though they're hot and sweating, 
           they smile and stand when they spot Bill.

           Bill dumps his bike in the yard as they walk up.

                                 BILL
                        Who are you?

                                 DON
                        Mr. Watterson. It's an honor to 
                        meet you, sir. I'm Don Wilder, 
                        President of Dakin Toys.

           Don extends his hand. Bill leaves it.

                                 DON
                        Mr. Salem gave us your address. Of 
                        course, you'd already know that. 
                        Lee said you love having guests.

                                 JOHN
                        I hope it's not too much trouble, 
                        us coming here. We just have an  
                        exciting proposal for you, Bill.

           John holds up the FOLDER.

                                 JOHN
                        Still got those Hobbes dolls?

           A beat.
           Bill walks right past them, enters his house.

           INT. FOYER - BILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bill strips his shirt off, enters the KITCHEN --

           ...backpedals a second later, back into the FOYER... 

           THROUGH THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR

           he can see MELISSA deep in the backyard. Huddled over 
           something...poking at it hypnotically with a stick...

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Bill steps out, bare-chested, drenched. Crunches over 
           leaves, up to his wife...

                                 BILL
                        Melissa?

           Bill comes upon the OBJECT of Melissa's poking...

           It's a DEAD BIRD.

                                 BILL
                        What are you doing? Don't touch 
                        that.

           Melissa looks up: her EYES are RED, FILLED WITH TEARS. 

                                 MELISSA
                        I think this bird died, Bill. He's 
                        hardly breathing. Can we help it?

                                 BILL
                        No.

                                 MELISSA
                        Can we help him?

                                 BILL
                        No. We can't. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Why not?

                                 BILL
                        Let me have that.

           She drops the stick, hides her head -- SOBS and MOANS... 
           Bill crouches, tries to put her arms around Melissa -- she 
           springs up, fights him off --

                                 MELISSA
                        IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?! HUH?! YOU 
                        SELFISH, PRETENTIOUS ASSHOLE!!!

                                 BILL
                        Melissa--

                                 MELISSA
                        GO DRAW YOUR FUCKING COMICS.

           Melissa brushes right by him, into the house.

           Then, DON and JOHN come around from the side.

                                 JOHN
                        Everything alright? Say, I don't 
                        suppose we could trouble you for a 
                        glass of water--

           Bill walks towards them.

                                 BILL
                             (re: the folder)
                        Is that the offer?

                                 JOHN
                        Well, as a matter of fact--

           Bill snatches the FOLDER from John's hand, keeps going...

           CARPORT

           He drops the FOLDER into the BOX OF HOBBES DOLLS, which are 
           still sitting in a pile of junk -- 

           -- a GAS CAN and MATCHES go in next.

           Bill lifts, marches on with the box now.

           FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Don and John come back to the front of the house to find...

           Bill, standing over the box in the middle of the lawn.

                                 JOHN
                        Mr. Watterson...?

                                 BILL
                        You can have my answer now. 
                        Regarding your proposal...
           He LIGHTS A MATCH --

                                 DON
                        Is this some kind of--

           -- drops it in -- WHOOSH! 

           The NOTEPAD and HOBBES DOLLS go UP IN FLAMES...

                                 BILL
                        I respectfully decline.

           Bill stands there, staring down the shocked men from 
           California, all the while a FIRE BLAZING beside him...

           INT. LECTURE HALL - WEXNER CENTER, 1991 - DAY

           BILL (OLDER) sips water. Swallows. Finishes his speech...

                                 BILL
                        Syndicates, you can do better. My 
                        fellow artists...you can do better. 
                        Stop selling out. Stop licensing. 
                        Stop the toys. The posters. The 
                        shows, the shirts, the bedsheets, 
                        the boxers, the ties. This is not 
                        what comic strips are about. This 
                        infatuation with money and fame and 
                        mass production. Stop all this 
                        foolishness...before you ruin our 
                        beloved industry forever.

           The AUDIENCE is at a loss.

                                 BILL
                        And, finally...stop pestering me. 
                        Leave me alone. Let me work. I 
                        don't think that's too much to ask.
                             (beat)
                        Thank you.

           Bill returns to his seat amidst TOTAL SILENCE. The 
           coordinator stands, walks to the podium...

                                 COORDINATOR
                        Well, uh...yes. Yes. Let's all give 
                        him a warm round of a--

                                 JIM DAVIS (O.S.)
                        You little twat.

           GASPS. MURMURING. 
           JIM DAVIS glares across an aisle at Bill.

                                 JIM DAVIS
                        You think you're better than us? 
                        Think you're some kind of deity?

           Jim stands, approaches Bill.

                                 JIM DAVIS
                        You been turning your nose up at  
                        me for years, Watterson. Saying I 
                        stink. That I make garbage. Don't 
                        think I haven't caught wind of your 
                        little comments. "Garfield? Oh,  
                        I'll tell you what I think about 
                        Garfield". Well, I ain't gonna let 
                        that slide anymore, get up. I'm 
                        gonna teach you a--

                                 GARRY TRUDEAU
                        Oh, shut up, Davis. Go sit down.

           More GASPS. GARRY, sitting behind Bill, has had enough.

                                 GARRY TRUDEAU
                        No one wants to hear your crap. 

                                 LYNN JOHNSTON
                        Yeah. Sit down, Davis. You big, 
                        bald...cat.

           Jim gawks at Bill's defenders...then returns to Bill.

           The CROWD waits. Horrified. Then...

           Bill gets up. He looks Jim in the eyes. Unflinching.

           Jim fumes in place, a big dumb bull...but then good sense 
           takes over, and he waddles back to his seat.

           IN THE BACK

           LEE quietly slips out of the lecture hall. Door SHUTS. 

           Bill sees. He heads out, after Lee. All eyes upon him. 

           EXT. FOUNTAIN - OSU CAMPUS - DAY

           LEE sits on a grassy hill, going through a bag of SUNFLOWER 
           SEEDS. He stares at a big WATER FOUNTAIN -- which looks 
           strangely similar to the one from the earlier Marvin strip.

           Lee ogles young CO-EDS hanging out by the fountain, until...
           BILL sits beside him. Lee offers Bill seeds. He declines. 

           For a moment, just the sound of CHEWING and SPITTING...

                                 LEE
                        That was some speech. You certainly 
                        made an impresson today. Don't know 
                        what kind, but...you sure made one.
                             (beat)
                        I take it you haven't changed your 
                        mind on the shirts.

                                 BILL
                        I'm not gonna say yes, Lee. Not 
                        now. Not ever. You do what you 
                        want, but I won't be the one held 
                        responsible for Calvin's demise--

                                 LEE
                        Calvin's demise? God. Bill, quit 
                        being so dramatic. One commercial 
                        product is not the end of days. 
                             (beat)
                        You know, sometimes I wonder if you 
                        really believe all this stuff 
                        you're saying. Whether it's just 
                        bullshit. Principles, integrity, 
                        ethics, blah, blah. Maybe you just 
                        like to argue with people. Or maybe 
                        you just don't wanna have to talk 
                        to people, I don't know. I wish I 
                        could figure you out, but...guess 
                        it doesn't matter now.

           Lee keeps eating, and doesn't notice the change in Bill.

                                 BILL
                        Please don't fire me. Please.

           Lee looks at Bill. It's a rare moment of vulnerability.

                                 BILL
                        You are asking me to change Calvin 
                        into something else, or to give him 
                        up completely. To gut him or to 
                        leave him. Either way, I lose him.

                                 LEE
                        Are you serious right now?

                                 BILL
                        It's not just beliefs. It's not 
                        just principles. I created these 
                        characters out of love and out of 
                        my life. Calvin and Hobbes aren't 
                        cartoons...they're my children. 

                                 LEE
                        Come on.

                                 BILL
                        Don't replace me. Don't give my 
                        comic strip to someone else...I'm 
                        the only one who can draw them.

           Lee scoffs. Even in this state, Bill can't help being...

                                 LEE
                        Such a snob. 

           Lee thinks. He sighs, CRUMPLES his empty seed bag.

                                 LEE
                        Well...you're in luck. We signed a 
                        new client this week, he'll bring 
                        in quite the payload. Just might 
                        make up for what you've lost us.

           He staggers up.

                                 BILL
                        You're not going to fire me?

                                 LEE
                        Nah. It was wrong of me to put you 
                        in that position. Sorry. We do want 
                        you to be happy, believe it or not. 
                             (beat, begrudgingly)
                        Plus...you're right. No one else 
                        can do Calvin. We'd have a riot on 
                        our hands if we tried to replace 
                        you. Scary fans. With costumes.

                                 BILL
                        Thank you.

                                 LEE
                        Doesn't mean I'm giving up. I may 
                        squeeze something out of you yet, 
                        Bill. A calendar. A pencil box... 
                        something. We're still a business, 
                        we need revenue, I gotta look out-- 

                                 BILL
                        Gotta look out for number one.
                                 LEE
                        Sometimes, that's just the way 
                        things are. 

           Lee heads back up the hill.

                                 BILL
                        Lee. Who did you sign?

           Lee stops.

                                 LEE
                        A big, bald...cat.

           Bill's mouth opens.

                                 LEE
                        Better learn how to make friends. 

           And with that, he goes.

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO - DAY

           Bill's VOLVO pulls into the driveway. He and Melissa get 
           out, lug their bags inside.

           INT. FOYER - BILL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Melissa enters first, Bill trailing.

                                 BILL
                        Would you like to go home?

           Melissa stops, looks back.

                                 MELISSA
                        We are home.

                                 BILL
                        I hate the desert.

           Melissa cracks a smile.

                                 MELISSA
                        Okay...

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - ALBUQUERQUE, NM - CONTINUOUS

           WIDE SHOT of Bill's desert home. And then...it morphs from a 
           REAL picture into an ILLUSTRATED one, right before our eyes.
           A GIANT PENCIL ERASER swoops down onto the SCREEN, erases 
           the scenery -- Bill's house, the desert behind it, etc. The 
           eraser edges its way round the WATTERSON CARS, leaving them 
           in place...

           Then, the PENCIL DRAWS a NEW SETTING around them: a quaint, 
           recently sold RANCH HOUSE, in a familiar Midwestern town...

           It happened so fast, but now it's unmistakable we are in

           SUPER: CHAGRIN FALLS, OHIO - TWO MONTHS LATER

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - CHAGRIN FALLS, OH - DAY

           BILL and MELISSA emerge, head for Bill's car...

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CHAGRIN FALLS - DAY

           Bill and Melissa stroll down the sidewalk on a bright and 
           sunny day. Sharing a bag of caramel treats. Nodding to 
           passers-by. The POPCORN SHOP FACTORY just behind them.

           Melissa snags a paper from a stand. She reads BILL'S LATEST 
           STRIP as they go on: Calvin displays his lunch to Susie...

                                 MELISSA
                             (reading Calvin)
                        My lunch is peanut butter, what's 
                        so disgusting about that? It's my 
                        dessert that's gross. Look, a 
                        thermos full of--oh, Bill, ewww!

           A thermos full of phlegm. 

                                 BILL
                        How about we stop at the bookshop?

                                 MELISSA
                             (whining)
                        Unnh. We got colds in the car.

                                 BILL
                        Just for a minute.

                                 MELISSA
                        Why? Wait, are you trying to get 
                        out of unpacking again? Cause I 
                        gotta tell you, Watterson, that's 
                        going down either way tonight.

                                 BILL
                        Come on.
           He takes her hand, leads her across the street.

                                 MELISSA
                        Fiiinnnneee.

           SIDEWALK (OTHER SIDE)

           They walk. Bill checks his watch.

                                 MELISSA    
                        Know what I was thinking? I was 
                        thinking the more you think about 
                        things, the weirder they seem. Like 
                        milk. Why do we drink cow milk? Who 
                        was the first guy who looked at a 
                        cow and said, "I'm gonna drink 
                        whatever comes out of these things 
                        when I squeeze... their...

           But Melissa is too distracted to finish...

           FIRESIDE BOOKSHOP

           She has stopped in front of her old employer's shop. A very 
           familiar SIGN is on the stand by the entrance. But the words 
           are different...

           "QUARTERLY ART SHOW -- THURSDAY, 3 P.M. -- COME SEE LOCAL 
           ARTIST MELISSA WATTERSON DISPLAY HER PRIVATE COLLECTION!"

                                 BILL
                        Looks like there's an art show.

           Melissa gapes at him.

                                 MELISSA
                        Did you do this?

           Bill shrugs. Gestures her inside...

           INT. FIRESIDE BOOKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Dozens of MELISSA'S PAINTINGS wait on stands in the aisles. 
           Landscapes, portraits. Abstracts. Even the one she splashed 
           over with blue paint. It's everything she's ever done.

           CUSTOMERS are sifting about already, appreciating them.

           Melissa walks around, taking it in...

                                 BILL
                        You're not half as good as me. 
                        You're better. You should show 
                        people your paintings.

           Melissa smiles back at him.

                                 MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Watterson? Think you said you 
                        were bringing more in the trunk?

                                 BILL
                        Oh, right...

           Bill gets out his keys, follows the MANAGER outside.

           DOWN AN AISLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Melissa walks, observing her PIECES. Then, she comes upon...

           The PAINTING of the PARENTS walking their CHILD down a 
           forest trail.

           Melissa stops. Gazes at the little boy...

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        We could try again.

           She turns around. Her and Bill are alone now.

                                 MELISSA
                        Try what again?

                                 BILL
                        We haven't tried in a long time. We 
                        could. "Just keep trying", right?

                                 MELISSA
                        Oh, Bill...

                                 BILL
                        We could see more doctors. We could 
                        do that, I think our ones now might 
                        be bozos anyways--

                                 MELISSA
                        I don't think it's meant to happen.

                                 BILL
                        We could adopt. We could adopt a 
                        baby. That could be good, right?

                                 MELISSA
                        Bill. It's okay. Really.

           A beat.
                                 BILL
                        I don't want you to be sad.

                                 MELISSA
                        I'm not sad.

                                 BILL
                        I don't want you to hate me.

                                 MELISSA
                        I don't hate you.

                                 BILL
                        I am...I am a child, Melissa. You 
                        deserve much better than you got.

           Melissa takes Bill's hand. 

                                 MELISSA
                        That's not true. Don't be so hard 
                        on yourself. You are not a child.
                             (beat)
                        You're Bill.

           INT. UPSTAIRS - FIRESIDE BOOKSHOP - LATER

           Bill strolls through the aisles, hands in his pockets.

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Melissa is chatting with PEOPLE about her PAINTINGS.

           BACK UPSTAIRS

           Bill comes upon the COMIC STRIP BOOKS again. Smirks. Runs 
           his finger along the book spines (bypassing GARFIELD, of 
           course) -- FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, PEANUTS, DOONESBURY...

           ...and then: every CALVIN & HOBBES COLLECTIONS in print. 

           Bill slides out his latest one: REVENGE OF THE BABY-SAT! He 
           flips through it casually, and then...gets a devlish idea.

           Looks left. Looks right. Pulls out a PEN, and...

           ...SIGNS HIS NAME on the inside of the cover. SNICKERS to 
           himself. Loves it so much that he picks out another book, 
           and SIGNS THAT ONE TOO. Gets another book, SIGNS THAT ONE --

                                 RED-HEADED BOY (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir?

           Bill stops, looks up -- a RED-HEADED EMPLOYEE (13) of the 
           bookshop is watching him.

                                 RED-HEADED BOY
                        You can't do that.

                                 BILL
                        Do what?

                                 RED-HEADED BOY
                        You're writing in our books.

                                 BILL
                        No, I'm not.

                                 RED-HEADED BOY
                        I can see you doing it. You're 
                        going to have to pay for those--

           Bill raises his finger to his lips -- SSSHHH. 

           He puts the book back, then...disappears behind a shelf.

           The boy shakes his head: weirdo. He turns and goes, back 
           down the staircase. 

           Bill peeks out from behind his shelf...and then --

           In SLOW-MO, once again...Bill curiously watches....

           The boy, casually dancing a RABBIT'S FOOT down the 
           STAIRWELL...HUMMING the tune to "Jimmy Crack Corn".

           EXT. BILL'S HOUSE - CHAGRIN FALLS - DAY

           Bright and sunny. Birds CHIRP.

           A bronze COUPE putters into the driveway. A MAN gets out, 
           walks to Bill's porch. Wears a familiar BLUE SPORTS COAT...

           INT. BILL'S STUDIO - DAY

           Bill's latest drawing room. Identical to the others.

           Bill works on a NEW CALVIN STRIP. He's having trouble 
           fitting his dialogue within the square panel outlines.

                                 BILL
                             (calling out)
                        How am I supposed to make a comic 
                        strip if they don't even give me 
                        room to draw? Ridiculous. And do 
                        they expect the readers to use a 
                        pair of magnifying goggles? Cause 
                        that's what they'll need now.

           Bill erases a section, starts over.

                                 BILL
                        First thing tomorrow morning, I'm 
                        calling Lee Salem about the new 
                        panel sizes. Don't let me forget--

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Bill.

           He looks up. She's standing in the doorway. Beside her is

           BLUE BLAZER MAN. The reporter from the hotel in Columbus.

                                 MELISSA
                        You have a visitor.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Hi, Mr. Watterson. Thanks again for 
                        doing this. I really appreciate it.

           Bill checks his watch.

                                  BILL
                        Oh. Of course. Well, uhhh...to be 
                        perfectly honest, I think I'd like 
                        to fix myself some lunch before we 
                        do this, if that's alright--

           Melissa holds up TWO PAPER LUNCH SACKS and smiles.

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           Bill and the reporter sit on the same bench from Bill's 
           grocery store days. Bill eats his PB & J sandwich Melissa 
           made him while the reporter prepares for the interview.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Okay, Mr. Watterson. I'd like to 
                        start with just a quick history. 
                        Your background, how you got into 
                        comic strips. That kind of stuff.

                                 BILL
                        Are you eating your Ding-Dong?

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Excuse me?

           Bill points to the reporter's untouched paper sack.
                                 BILL
                        Your Ding-Dong.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Oh. Uh, no.

           Bill digs in, takes out the chocolate snack.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Anyways, some of these questions 
                        might be familiar, so please bear 
                        with me. My first thought was...

           The reporter sets a TAPE RECORDER on the bench, HITS RECORD.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        I'd like to go back to your college 
                        years. Actually, just after that. 
                        You held a job as a political 
                        cartoonist at the Cincinnati Post 
                        for a while. Isn't that right?

           Bill eats his Ding-Dong, nods.

                                 BILL
                        Before they fired me.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Why did they fire you?

           Bill shrugs.

                                 BILL
                        Said I wasn't opinionated enough.

           The reporter jots notes.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Huh. Alright. Okay, how about this: 
                        is it true you were mentored by Jim 
                        Borgman, the artist behind Zits--

                                 BILL
                        You want to know about the magic? 

           The reporter stops.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        The magic?

                                 BILL
                        It's what you asked me.
                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Ohhh...right. I mean, that wasn't 
                        really a specific question. It was 
                        more like, what is the process of--

                                 BILL
                        Ask me why I draw.

                                 BLUE BLAZER
                        Okay. Okay, yeah, that's good, 
                        let's save that one for later--

                                 BILL
                        Ask me why. And then just listen.

           A beat. The reporter grins, gives in.

                                 REPORTER
                        Sure. What the hell.

           He flips to a new page.

                                 REPORTER
                        So, Mr. Watterson. Why do you draw?

           Bill fixes his gaze on the horizon. He loses himself in it. 
           And soon, it's clear that he's somewhere totally else now...

           FINAL MUSIC MONTAGE - THE BOY AND THE TIGER

           BILL'S STUDIO - NEX MEXICO - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           The day Bill and Melissa returned from the Festival.

           Bill checks in, dragging his suitcase.

           A BRISTOL BOARD lies face down on the floor near the back 
           wall. Bill comes over, picks it up...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        I draw...because I have to.

           He examines the white sheet: it is the simple DRAWING of 
           Calvin and Hobbes standing in the center of the page. The 
           one he threw away in frustration at the start of the film.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Because I must.

           Bill sits at his table, lays the drawing before him. 

           Stares at it...
                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        I draw because it's like breathing 
                        air to me. Comic strips have always 
                        been my greatest passion in life. I 
                        didn't have many friends growing 
                        up. Comic strips were my friend.

                                 BILL
                             (to the drawing)
                        Do something.

           Calvin and Hobbes look at each other... back at Bill...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        If you let them...comic strips can 
                        take you away.

           THEN...

           Four life-sized CARTOON ARMS -- REACH OUT OF THE PAGE -- and 
           GRAB BILL -- and PULL HIM IN...

                                                             CUT TO:

           CALVIN'S BEDROOM (ANIMATED)

           Animated CALVIN and HOBBES and a CARTOON BILL CRASH onto the 
           floor. All three stagger up, dust themselves off, COUGHING. 

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Take you away. To a different 
                        place, where time stands still.

           The trio of friends look at each other, then -- they dash 
           out the room... 

           CALVIN'S BACKYARD (ANIMATED)

           Calvin and Hobbes have a WATER BALLOON fight. Bill charges 
           from the side of the house, attacking them with the HOSE.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Where you can be anything you want 
                        to be. Do anything you want to do.

           Calvin cocks back, slings a BALLOON at Bill --

           WINTER (ANIMATED)

           ...and a SNOWBALL replaces it, SMACKS Bill in the face. 

           Bill chases after Calvin, slipping and sliding. Hobbes 
           howling in laughter.
                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Comic strips are unlike any other 
                        entertainment medium that exists.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        You can stir someone's heart. Or 
                        inspire them. Or breathe life into 
                        one's dull and rusted imagination.

           BACK WOODS (ANIMATED)

           Bill pushes Calvin and Hobbes in their RED WAGON, down a 
           dirt path...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        I've experienced all these things 
                        for myself, many times before. 

           He hops into the back, and the trio ROLLS DOWN A HILL 
           together...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        And even if I prefer doing it from 
                        a distance, it brings me joy to 
                        share my work with others now.

           The wagon SPEEDS rapidly, downhill, towards a familiar 
           WOODEN DOCK and POND...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Everyone should have what I have.

           FASTER... FASTER... will they make it over the water??

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        I suppose what I'm saying is 
                        that... I draw comic strips...

           The WAGON LAUNCHES OFF THE DOCK... FLIES ACROSS THE POND...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        ...because I love them so much.

           THEN --

           ...IT KEEPS GOING. HIGHER and HIGHER. Through the SKY. 

           Calvin, Hobbes, and Bill CHEER and SCREAM as their flying 
           wagon takes them on, on towards a glorious PINK HORIZON...

           BACK ROADS - DAY (CHAGRIN FALLS)

           Bill rides his bike. Helmet strapped. Having a blast.

                                 BILL
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Come on, slowpoke!

           Melissa trails behind him, on a bike of her own.
                                 MELISSA
                        I'm tirrrreeeddd...

                                 BILL
                        There's a big bowl of plain oatmeal 
                        just waiting for you back home!

           Melissa groans, hangs her head, keeps pedaling.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Bill eats a big bowl of plain oatmeal. CATS prowling 
           obnoxiously around his table. The PHONE RINGS in the 
           KITCHEN...

           Bill is doodling more CALVIN & HOBBES IDEAS in a notebook -- 
           but now, the characters are alive on the page. Flowing out 
           of Bill's pencil, telling mini-stories of their own...

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        Phone.

                        Lee Salem.

           Bill stops, claps his hands, springs up.

                                                             CUT TO:

           SCHOOL CAFETERIA (ANIMATED)

           Calvin, Hobbes, and Bill settle in at a lunch table. No 
           sonner do they dig in when an ICE CREAM SCOOP SAILS OVER, 
           and PLOPS Calvin in the face.

           MOE, the school bully who just threw it, HAR-HARS from 
           across the cafeteria. Supported by his GOONISH FRIENDS.

           Then -- another SCOOP PLOPS Bill in the head.

           Calvin and Bill rage behind their sticky messes while the 
           CAFETERIA HOWLS...

           SCHOOL YARD - LATER (ANIMATED)

           Moe and his chums pick on an unfortunate four-eyed student 
           by the jungle gym...

           Then, TWO HUMUNGOUS SHADOWS quietly fall over them all...

           The gang stops, looks up at...
           A PAIR OF TYRANNOSAURS REX'S, standing over them. Calvin and 
           Hobbes are perched on one head. Bill's perched on the other.

           Moe gawks in horror... RAAWWWWRRRRR!

           MOMENTS LATER

           Calvin, Hobbes, and Bill RIDE THEIR DINOSAURS through the 
           yard, terrorizing the bullies, laughing their heads off.

                                                             CUT TO:

           LEE'S OFFICE - DAY (NYC)

           Lee and Bill are in the middle of an argument.

                                 LEE
                        Bill, I don't know what you want. 
                        We are not in charge of the panel 
                        sizes, you know the papers are.

                                 BILL
                        But you own a third of the strips 
                        in syndication. You could use that 
                        as leverage, I know you could--

                                 LEE
                        What are you suggesting, that we 
                        threaten to pull our strips out--

                                 BILL
                        If that's what it takes, yes--

                                 LEE
                        This is ridiculous, Bill, come on--

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Mr. Salem?

           They stop. The young RECEPTIONIST who talked to Bill at the 
           start of the film stands in the doorway. A stack of MAIL in 
           her arm.

           Lee takes the mail, sifts through it. He stops on a PACKAGE, 
           looks at it curiously. Glances back and presents it to Bill. 

           Bill nods: yes, that's right. 

           Lee hands the package back to the receptionist.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (reading the package)
                        Oh. Sorry.
           MOMENTS LATER

           The receptionist steps outside, closes the door, confused. 
           Bill and Lee's ARGUMENT ERUPTS AGAIN inside Lee's office.

           As the receptionist walks away, we see the PACKAGE LABEL:

           "FROM: BILL WATTERSON" ... "TO: LEE SALEM'S RECEPTIONIST"

                                                             CUT TO:

           CALVIN'S BEDROOM (ANIMATED)

           CLOSE ON: A CARDBOARD BOX, turned upside down. A paper ARROW  
           is tacked on the side, encircled by WRITTEN ANIMAL NAMES: an 
           eel, a babboon, a bug, dinosaur, polar bear, and more...

           This is the TRANSMOGRIFIER: Calvin's most famous invention.

           BILL'S HAND turns the ARROW to "BRAZILLIAN BLACK TARANTULA". 

           A BUTTON is PRESSED -- "BOINK!!"

           PULL BACK

           as Bill and Hobbes stand before the transmogrifier, waiting 
           cautiously. Then -- the box is lifted, and out crawls...

           TARANTULA CALVIN. A furry spider, still in his red striped 
           shirt and wearing tennis shoes on its back legs. Calvin 
           HISSES his fangs, rubs his front legs together happily.

           As Calvin spider walks all over his room, Bill offers Hobbes 
           a turn. Hobbes declines, gestures: I'm happy with who I am.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Calvin's furry spider peg HITS THE BUTTON -- "BOINK!!"

           PULL BACK 

           as Bill SHRIEKS and spreads his WINGS, throwing the box off 
           his back. He is a BALD WHITE EAGLE -- well, partly an eagle. 
           The transmogrifier has made him kind of half man, half bird.

           The trio race out the room again -- Bill flaps his wings, 
           tries to fly out -- but he CRASHES through the doorway.

                                                             CUT TO:

           PARKING LOT - GROCERY STORE - DAY (CHAGRIN FALLS)

           Bill and Melissa walk back to their car with grocery bags. 
           Bill stops, slows as he comes upon another PISSING CALVIN 
           STICKER, on the back of a PICKUP TRUCK window.

           Bill grrrs, fishes through Melissa's bag...

           MOMENTS LATER

           He DRAWS a TRUCK DRIVER'S FACE with a BAR OF SOAP on the 
           truck's window. Bill has positioned the drawing just under 
           Calvin's stream of urine and has written "<-YOU" beside it. 

           Calvin now pees on the driver's imagined "face".

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey! Whaddya think you're doing?

           Bill stops, looks up -- it's HANKS, Bill's old manager. 

                                 HANKS
                        Watterson.

           Bill freezes -- throws the bar of soap at Hanks -- it SMACKS 
           Hanks in the chest with little force.

                                 BILL
                        Run!

           Bill grabs Melissa's hand, they sprint away, laughing.

           LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bill and Melissa are on the floor by the fire place, having 
           hot chocolate with marshmallows. Melissa reviews Bill's 
           latest COMIC STRIPS. Bill draws a PENCIL SKETCH of MELISSA. 

           Melissa stops, looks up at Bill.

                                 MELISSA
                        Let me see.

                                 BILL
                        No.

           They lock eyes, gaze at each other. Bill continues drawing, 
           not even looking at his sketchpad now. He doesn't need to.

           SPACE (ANIMATED)

           Calvin, Hobbes, and Bill rocket through the galaxy in their 
           flying wagon. EARTH millions of miles behind them. Stars 
           glowing all around them, planets circling in the distance.

           The trio WHOOSHES PAST US, laughing and cheering. They fly 
           on, and fade, into a tiny speck somewhere in the universe...

           SUBWAY - DAY (NYC)

           The RECEPTIONIST sits on a bench as her subway car travels 
           through a dark underground tunnel. Staring at her PACKAGE 
           from BILL WATTERSON. Finally, she opens it, pulls out...

           A NOTE...it says: "FOR YOUR 'DAUGHTER' -- BILL WATTERSON".

           The receptionist curiously reaches further into the package, 
           fishes out...

           A STUFFED HOBBES DOLL. One of the Dakin Toys samples. Bill 
           must have saved a few for himself before burning the rest.

           The receptionist's heart melts as she holds the tiny tiger.

           Melissa has her head laid upon Bill's shoulder. Bill is 
           drawing on his napkin again.

                                 MELISSA
                        I'm glad you're doing this.

                                 BILL
                        Doing what?

                        I know you don't like...people. 
                        It's just nice you're making an 
                        effort.

                                 BILL
                        I'm only going because I didn't win 
                        anything.

                                 MELISSA
                        Does that make you happy cause you 
                        won't have to give a speech, or mad 
                        because you think you deserved one?

           Bill ignores her.
                                 MELISSA
                        Or, does it make you afraid that 
                        Jim Davis might be there, and he 
                        might try and pound you again?

                                 BILL
                        Jim Davis...can go soak his head.

                        Bill.

           Bill stops. Looks her in the eye.

                                 BILL
                        I love you.

           Melissa cocks her head, smiles.

                                 MELISSA
                        I love you, too.

           They kiss.

           A STEWARDESS pushes up her FOOD CART --

                        Sir? What would you like to drink?

                        Uhhh...I'll have a dry martini, and 
                        a tuna sandwich here for my friend.

                                 STEWARDESS #2
                        Sorry?

                                 BILL
                        Nothing.

           The stewardess gives them their snacks and soda.

                                 STEWARDESS #2
                             (re: Bill's napkin)
                        Hey...Calvin & Hobbes, right?

           Bill nods.

                                 STEWARDESS #2
                        That's pretty good.

           She smiles, moves on. 

           Melissa eats her peanuts. Bill studies his sketch. He 
           brushes his mustache. Stares off into space for a bit...
                                 BILL
                        Yes.

           Bill DRAWS, once more... 

           EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS

           Their JET glides on, through the clouds...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        This is going to be very good.

           THEN...

           Not too far behind the plane's tail, we see what looks 
           almost like a TINY RED WAGON, flying through the air...

           And a little BOY, and a TIGER, piloting it...

           Staying close.

                                       EPILOGUE

           -- Bill Watterson drew Calvin & Hobbes for three more years 
           before retiring from comic strips in 1995. 

           -- Nearly 45 million copies of the 18 Calvin & Hobbes book 
           collections have been sold. Only four licensed merchandise 
           items have ever been released. Two of them are calendars.

           -- Bill continued to anonymously sign his own books at 
           Fireside Bookshop in his hometown of Chagrin Falls...but 
           stopped when he found out they were being sold on eBay.

           -- Today, Bill resides somewhere in Ohio.

           -- He paints with his wife Melissa everyday.
