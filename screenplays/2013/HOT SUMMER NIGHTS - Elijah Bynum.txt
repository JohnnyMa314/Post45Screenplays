                                 HOT SUMMER NIGHTS
                                   A TEENAGE LOVE STORY

                                      Written by
                                      Elijah Bynum
           THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY....

                                                   ....MORE OR LESS....
           OVER BLACK

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Every moment in life is the result 
                        of all the moments preceding 
                        it...or some shit like that.

           From the darkness we hear a harrowing roar. Powerful and 
           tragic. Like the aching cry of some prehistoric beast.

           CLOSE ON A HIGHWAY SIGN: WELCOME TO CAPE COD

           Nightfall. We are in the middle of a violent hurricane and 
           what we just heard was the wind. 

           Stinging rain slams into the earth. Snapped power lines and 
           uprooted trees. Nothing’s safe. Mother Nature’s genocide.

           I-6 Westbound. Breaklights for miles. Every Tom, Dick and 
           Harry is headed for the hills. Except for one crazy bastard. 

           Driving headfirst into the storm’s mouth is a ‘91 CHEVY 
           CORVETTE. It blows past us, leaving behind a trail of light 
           in the fog.

           INT. ‘91 CORVETTE. NIGHT

           Behind the wheel sits DANIEL MIDDLETON (18). The boy next 
           door. Awkward, shy and boyishly handsome, although he doesn’t 
           know it yet.

           His childlike features suggest innocence but the fire behind 
           his eyes says otherwise. Checks his rearview. Clammy hands 
           tighten around the wheel. Knuckles whiten.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        We like to highlight so called 
                        “life altering moments” but fail to 
                        realize it’s everything leading up 
                        to that moment that caused it to 
                        happen.

           It’s unclear if Daniel is being followed but his paranoia has 
           him convinced.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        One moment runs into the next. Each 
                        one dictating our trajectory. Each 
                        one equally important.

           Daniel switches lanes. Hits the accelerator. 
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But in the present we are blind. We 
                        think we have the ability to stay 
                        one step ahead, but, as always, 
                        life catches up and we are left 
                        thinking... “whoa”.

           Ahead lies an intersection. Yellow light. Daniel guns it.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Because by the time tomorrow 
                        arrives it becomes today all over 
                        again.
                             (beat)
                        And nobody knows what today will 
                        bring. Nobody.

           BAM! BLIND SIDED by a TRUCK. A violent cacophony of twisting 
           metal and crunching glass. The vehicle tumbles across the 
           road -- somersaulting end over end.

           Lands upside down on its ROOF and skids off the road-- 
           wrapping itself around a steel telephone pole. Upon impact 
           Daniel is EJECTED through the windshield.

           ROAD SIDE

           Sprawled across the breakdown lane. His arm, dislocated at 
           the shoulder and bent around his head. Blood leaking from his 
           ear. 

           Hang on the grizzly sight. The car engine hums. Wheels turn. 
           The wind growls.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        Whoa.

           BLACK

           Over black we hear the mellifluous opening chords of Cyndi 
           Lauper’s Time After Time.

           CLOSE ON DANIEL’S FACE 

           Immense concentration. He stares RIGHT AT US. Perched on his 
           head sit a pair of industrial strength headphones.

           INT. BED ROOM. DAY

           Daniel lays on his bed. PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE resting over the 
           covers. He masturbates vigorously. Lauper, filtering through 
           the headphones, dulls his senses to the outside world. 

           There’s sad and then there’s this.
           Pull back to reveal his room. Action figures. Red Sox hats. A 
           Guns and Roses poster on the wall. A Calvin and Hobbs book.

           It’s very much the room of a boy who has yet to find himself.

           Complete silence except for the distinct swishing sound of 
           bedsheets pumping up and down.

           BACK ON DANIEL’S FACE

           Back in his world--the song crescendos. His face contorts. 
           Climax imminent.

           OVER THE TOP of the magazine we see the door fling open. 
           DANIEL’S MOTHER walks in.

                                 MOTHER
                        Jesus Christ!

           Her coffee mug drops, shatters-- except it’s not coffee. It’s 
           red wine.

           Daniel scurries to cover himself--the headphone cord rips 
           loose and his WALKMAN breaks on the floor.

           Shielding her eyes, Mom steps out and pulls the door closed.

           HALLWAY

           She hovers outside the door.

                                 MOTHER
                        I didn’t see anything.

                                 DANIEL
                             (through door)
                        Go away.

           A beat.

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m making eggs.

           DANIEL’S ROOM

           Panting from both shock and ecstacy, Daniel’s trembling hand 
           reaches for his INHALER. He inhales two quick sprays.

           INT. KITCHEN. DAY

           A new coffee mug is topped off with RED WINE. Daniel’s Mother 
           stands over a skillet, eyes glazed over. Her thinning hair 
           and sunken cheeks imply tough times. The bags hanging under 
           her eyes confirm them. 
                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        What’d you wanna talk about?

           She shakes from her reverie. Daniel sits at the kitchen 
           table.

                                 MOTHER
                        Before we talk about anything I 
                        just wanna clear the air.

           She walks a plate of burnt eggs over and places them in front 
           of Daniel. She sits.

                                 MOTHER
                        I know we agreed we weren’t gonna 
                        harp on it but today would’ve been 
                        his birthday and it feels silly not 
                        to acknowledge that.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. BACK YARD COOKOUT. DAY

           Through grainy, hand held HOME VIDEO we watch DENNIS 
           MIDDLETON (47) turning hot dogs on the grill.

           He’s confident yet modest. Salt of the Earth.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        My father was a man’s man. The kind 
                        of guy who pulled the chair out for 
                        a lady, shaved with a straight 
                        razor and changed his own oil.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. BACK YARD. POOL. LATER.

           HOME VIDEO: Dennis sneaks up behind Daniel’s Mother. She 
           looks younger. Heathlier. Happier. He tosses her into the 
           pool. She SCREAMS.

                                 MOTHER
                        Dennis! You bastard!

                                 DENNIS
                        What’s that? You can’t swim?
                        Fear not my love. 

           He hurls himself into the pool. Splash.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        He was the kind of man I would 
                        never become. 

           Dennis grabs his wife around her hips and pulls her close. 
           She playfully fights away, then gives in.
                                 DENNIS
                             (looks into the camera)
                        You gettin’ this, Danny? Look at 
                        your mother. You’re smarter than me 
                        and you’re better lookin’ so If 
                        you’re half as lucky you’ll find a 
                        woman as beautiful as I did.

           They kiss. She nudges him away.

                                 MOTHER
                             (giggling)
                        You’re still a bastard.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        When he died the light inside of me 
                        burned out with him.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. HOUSE. DAY

           An ELDERLY WOMAN exits her house in a bath robe to fetch the 
           morning paper. It’s not there. She looks around, dumbfounded.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I quit my paper route without 
                        giving notice. After a week Mrs. 
                        Schrader phoned the police to 
                        report that the Puerto Rican kids 
                        had been stealing her newspaper.

           FLASHBACK. DANIEL’S BACK YARD. DAY

           Daniel tosses a bundle of BASEBALL CARDS on top of a stack of 
           NEWSPAPERS. Lights a match and set them on FIRE.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I also burned the baseball cards my 
                        father had bought me last 
                        Christmas. Somehow I thought it’d 
                        help me cope.

           FLASHBACK. DANIEL’S HOUSE. GARAGE. DAY

           A raging FIRE. Black smoke. FIREFIGHTERS hose down the flames 
           which are licking up the garage walls.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        In doing so, the garage and half of 
                        my neighbor’s lawn burned down. I 
                        told my mother it was an accident. 
                        But the school pyschologist, Mr. 
                        Wembley, told her otherwise.
           FLASHBACK. MR. WEMBLEY’S OFFICE. DAY

           Bald, moustached and bifocaled, MR. WEMBLEY talks to us from 
           behind his desk.

                                 MR. WEMBLEY
                        What we’re looking at here, ma’am, 
                        is what we call a cry for help.

           FLASHBACK. PINE GROVE CEMETERY. DAY

           Grey skies. Light drizzle. Daniel stands over his father’s 
           grave. His face flat and numb.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Months had passed since his death 
                        and I still hadn’t cried. And I 
                        felt guilty about that.

           BACK IN KITCHEN

                                 MOTHER
                        So. I’ve been thinking, you know, 
                        and...how would you like to live 
                        with auntie Barb this summer?

                                 DANIEL
                        On the fuckin’ Cape?

                                 MOTHER
                        Yes. And mind your mouth.

                                 DANIEL
                        What am I gonna do, dig for clams 
                        all day? Collect sand dollars?

                                 MOTHER
                        I’m sure you’ll find something. 
                        There are nice girls on the cape in 
                        the summer time, ya know. Maybe 
                        you’ll even meet one. A real one.

                                 DANIEL
                        Jesus, ma.

                                 MOTHER
                        It’ll be good for you and it’s  
                        better than moping around 
                        Leominster all summer with what’s-
                        his-face.

                                 DANIEL
                        Is this one of those times when you 
                        make it seem like I have a choice 
                        but I actually don’t?
           She miles as if to say “yes, it is”. Daniel looks out the 
           window, shakes his head and sighs.

                                 DANIEL
                        This is bullshit.

                                 MOTHER
                        Know what I did the summer after 
                        highschool?

                                 DANIEL
                             (sarcastic)
                        No. Because you haven’t told me a 
                        thousand--

                                 MOTHER
                        Learned to ride a horse, that’s 
                        right.

                                 DANIEL
                             (under his breath)
                        Was that before you started 
                        drinking at breakfast?

           A nerve hit, her face pinches tight and the last of her calm 
           motherly patience slips away.

                                 MOTHER
                        What was that?

                                 DANIEL
                        Nothing.

           A tense beat. He looks away, her eyes bore into him.

                                 MOTHER
                        You know, I hoped by this age you’d 
                        have a little of your father in 
                        you.
                             (she stands)
                        Just a little.

           She leaves the kitchen. Daniel looks down at his plate of 
           eggs. The yolk bleeding into the ketchup...

           He slides it away. Appetite gone.

           EXT. TOWN OF HYANNIS. DAY

           White houses, black shudders, American flags, manicured lawns 
           and sea-shell drive-ways. Timeless New England charm.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Aunt Barb lived in a town named 
                        Hyannis.

                        And that particular summer would be 
                        the hottest summer in 68 years.

           SUPERIMPOSE: SUMMER 1991

           EXT. BACK YARD COOKOUT. DAY

           Two TEENAGE GIRLS dash through a sprinkler while their FATHER 
           flips burgers on the grill.

           EXT. BEACH. DAY

           Hundreds of people lay stretched out along a overcrowded 
           beach.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        When the heat wave hit at the end 
                        of May people thought it would lift 
                        in a week. 

           INT. RESTURANT / KITCHEN. DAY

           A mad frenzy inside the hot and stuffy kitchen. Sweat and 
           steam. The CHEF barks out orders at his exhausted staff.

           TRACK with a tray of ICE CREAM SUNDAE’s as they are carried 
           out the double doors--

           RESTURANT MAIN ROOM

           --and set down before a WEALTHY FAMILY.

           EXT. COUNTRY STORE. DAY

           A HUSBAND and WIFE sit on a wooden porch outside. Bags of ice 
           around their head and ankles. He’s shirtless. She’s in a bra.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It wouldn’t end until the hurricane 
                        in August. As a matter of fact 
                        everything would end with that 
                        hurricane.

           EXT. SUMMER COTTAGE. DAY

           A forest green BMW pulls up to picturesque cottage which must 
           have just leapt off Norman Rockwell’s canvas. 

           From the back seat emerges a GOLDEN RETRIEVER followed by A 
           BROTHER and SISTER. Both 17. Both none too pleased. HUSBAND 
           and WIFE smile and exchange a satisfactory nod.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Every year, between Memorial Day 
                        and Labor Day, the summer birds 
                        would flock to the Cape--barreling 
                        off the 6 and carrying with them an 
                        air of pretentiousness you could 
                        smell from Worcester. 

           The golden retriever BARKS.

           INT. SUMMER COTTAGE. DAY

           The FAMILY walks in and places their bags down.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        They would call it home until it 
                        was time to migrate back to the 
                        lives that awaited them. 

           EXT. CABANA. DAY

           A lively COCKTAIL PARTY is underway. Dozens of SUMMER BIRDS 
           mill about, greeting one another. 

           A HUSBAND pops a bottle of champagne. His WIFE giggles.

                                 WIFE
                             (coy, playful)
                        Richard, the sun’s still up.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        During those three months they were 
                        the first-class citizens of the 
                        peninsula.

           He takes a swig straight from the bottle. She yelps.

           EXT. RUN DOWN HOUSE. DAY

           Shabby lawn and chipping paint. In the drive-way sits a rusty 
           boat that looks as if it hasn’t touched water in two decades.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        There were two types of people out 
                        here. Summer birds and townies.

           Daniel’s ‘82 DATSUN pulls up outside. AUNT BARB waddles out 
           the screen door dressed in a black dress.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hey aun--

                                 AUNT BARB
                        Leave your shit, we’re late.
                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        Not hard to guess which one Aunt 
                        Barb was.

           INT. RUN DOWN FUNERAL HOME. DAY

           Resting on top of a closed casket is the framed picture of a 
           17 YEAR OLD BOY. His glowing smile all the more tragic.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Ricky Orwell was a townie, too. Or 
                        at least he was before he and his 
                        prom date were killed by a drunk 
                        driver on the Mass. Pike. 

           Daniel approaches the coffin and glances down at the Ricky 
           Orwell’s lifeless face.

           LATER

           Daniel stands alone towards the back of the main room.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And although I didn’t know him from 
                        a hole in the wall, for some reason 
                        I felt...

                                 DANIEL
                             (out loud to himself)
                        So sad.

           A RELATIVE overhears this and turns to Daniel.

                                 RELATIVE
                        Isn’t it? What do you remember most 
                        about him?

           Off Daniel’s expression.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Maybe the heat was getting to me.

           INT. CORNER GROCERY STORE. DAY

           Daniel stocks boxes of cereal.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Ricky Orwell had worked as a clerk 
                        at my aunt’s corner grocery. When 
                        he died I took his job.
           EXT. BEACH. DUSK

           Alone on the beach, Daniel chucks a rock into the rising 
           tide. It disappears, not even leaving a ripple.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        I was an only child and was never 
                        one to make friends easily. Over 
                        the years I had become very good at 
                        being alone. Frankly, it was the 
                        only thing I was good at.

           EXT. LEWIS BAY WATERFRONT. DUSK

           Daniel stands before the JFK MEMORIAL which includes a 
           fountain and a field-stone. The inscription reads:

           “I believe it’s important that this country sail and not sit 
           still in the harbor- JFK.”

           It’s as if the late president’s words travelled three decades 
           just for Daniel.

           INT. PIZZA JOINT. NIGHT

           Daniel chews a piece of crust as he plays PAC-MAN on an old 
           arcade machine. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But I always wanted to be something 
                        more. Something I was proud of.

           PAC MAN is eaten. Screen reads: GAME OVER. Daniel leaves.

           EXT. BEACH HOUSE. NIGHT

           A line of parked CARS stretch back half a mile. Scores of 
           drunk TEENAGERS flock across the lawn towards the house.

           They laugh and shriek and enjoy being young. Wind past them 
           up to the front door where Daniel stands before a juiced up 
           makeshift BOUNCER.

           The Bouncer holds a clipboard, scanning for names. Daniel 
           looks on with a false sense of hope.

                                 BOUNCER
                             (without looking up)
                        Sorry, bro.

           Daniel turns, dejected, and brushes against the flow of teens 
           pouring inside.
           Then he looks up and sees it. A candy red ‘87 CHEVY CAMARO 
           CONVERTIBLE roaring in. VAN HALEN blaring from the cockpit.

           The crowd parts, allowing the Camaro to pull into a RESERVED 
           parking spot right in front of the house. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And every now and again I’d see 
                        him. Always with a girl. Always 
                        with a smile. 

           Out steps HUNTER STRAWBERRY(19), sporting a black V-neck and 
           acid washed jeans. 

           He possess a rugged, Brandoesque masculinity. A teenage 
           hearthrob with enough edge to make his girlfriend’s father 
           lose sleep.

           Accompanying him are two blondes and a brunette that are so 
           hot you’re mad at them.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        He was one of those rare 
                        individuals who’d been comfortable 
                        in his skin since he spouted baby 
                        teeth. The teenage version of Joe 
                        Camel. Only cooler.
                             (beat)
                        He was everything I wished I 
                        could’ve been.

           The girls, drunk with laughter, brush past Daniel. To them 
           he’s invisible.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And for those fleeting moments when 
                        our paths overlapped I got to live 
                        in the life of Hunter Strawberry.

           As Hunter glides through the crowd he’s met with an array of 
           greetings. High-fives from the guys and cheek kisses from the 
           girls.

           When he passes Daniel he looks him square in the eye and 
           nods. Cool as fuck, and keeps moving...

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Yes, that really was his name.

           EXT. CHEVY CAMARO. OPEN ROAD. DUSK

           Hunter cruises along. Wind in his hair, sun at his back and a 
           glint in his eye reserved for those at ease with the world.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        He dug pretty chics, fast cars and 
                        rock and roll. He was an old soul. 
                        Beyond his years and ahead of his 
                        time. A relic from some forgotten 
                        era. 

           EXT. GAS STATION. DAY

           Hunter fills his tank.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        He had been on his own since he was 
                        fourteen years old. 

           A SOCCER MOM and her child pull up to the next pump. Hunter 
           smiles and WINKS. Soccer Mom shudders and drives away.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And controversy like that was too 
                        big for little Hyannis.

           INSERT: A POLICE OFFICER talks to us from his cruiser.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        The boy’s a criminal.

           INSERT: A TEACHER talks to us from in front of a chalkboard.

           INSERT: A BASEBALL COACH from the pitcher’s mound.

                        Waste of talent.

           He SPITS.

           INSERT: A PRIEST on the alter, he looks at us and CROSSES 
           himself.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Naturally, rumors began to grow. 
                        His reputation was built by a 
                        collection of stories circled 
                        around dinner tables and through 
                        highschool hallways.

           INT. BED ROOM. NIGHT 

           Hunter in bed with an attractive OLDER WOMAN. Post coital. He 
           sees she’s asleep, slides out of bed and slips out of the 
           room.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        After he was expelled from school 
                        junior year word around Hyannis was 
                        he had slept with vice principle 
                        Finney and never called her back.

           She rolls over and throws an arm over the vacant spot, 
           notices he’s gone and sits up looking perturbed.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Or so they say...

           EXT. SAIL BOAT. NANTUCKET SOUND. DAY 

           Clad in seer-sucker shorts and Grateful Dead T-shirts, a few 
           adult SUMMER BIRDS set sail off the sound. Washing down 
           oysters with Grey Goose.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But he didn’t need school and 
                        within six months Hunter Strawberry 
                        was a prosperous business man. You 
                        see, along with their oxford’s and 
                        country club memberships, the 
                        summer birds also brought a 
                        bottomless appetite for marijuana. 

           The SUMMER BIRDS are doubled over it fits of LAUGHTER.

                                 SUMMER BIRD
                             (knowing)
                        For the love of Pete, what was in 
                        that cigarette?

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        They couldn’t get enough...

           EXT. DARK ROAD. NIGHT

           WE ARE LOW to the ground, racing behind the forest green BMW 
           as it tears down a stretch of road.

           Pan up to see the silhouettes of TWO TEENAGE HEADS through 
           the rear window. Cherry red embers floating before each one.

           The car pulls away from us and disappears around a bend, 
           leaving behind nothing but a stream of WHITE SMOKE which 
           hangs lazily in the thick summer air.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        ...and neither could their kids.
           INT/EXT. HUNTER’S CAMARO OUTSIDE SUMMER COTTAGE. DAY

           Hunter fingers through a handful of cash.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It had to come from someone and 
                        Hunter Strawberry was more than 
                        obliged. 

           He starts the engine and speeds away.

           EXT. VARIOUS BACK DECKS. DAY

           PAN across a strip of white decks jutting from expensive 
           SUMMER HOMES. BBQ’s and cocktail hours.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        People came to Cape Cod to 
                        disconnect from the world. And 
                        that’s exactly what he helped them 
                        do.

           EXT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Party in full swing. Summertime by Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince 
           fuels the inebriated teenagers who vibe in youthful gusto.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        His parties were that of legend. 
                        Setting as the backdrop for storied 
                        nights which would be recounted for 
                        decades.

           TWO GIRLS make-out. Tongues’ unabashed.

           DECK

           Hunter stands alone on a deck high above the crowd--smoking a 
           cigarette--vacant eyes watch the sea of party-goers beneath. 

           Pale moonlight illuminates his face just enough for us to see 
           the loneliness which accompanies him.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But despite all that he had; part 
                        of Hunter Strawberry was missing. 
                        An emptiness that no amount of 
                        liquor, cheap sex or glorified 
                        attention could fill. At the end of 
                        the night he was still just a 
                        townie...

           A SUMMER BIRD GIRL slinks out and whispers something in his 
           ear. She grabs his hand. Hunter snubs out his cigarette and 
           follows her inside.
           EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE. DAY

           Hunter stands near the entrance playing “hey mister”. A black 
           SAAB pulls up and the same SUMMER BIRD GIRL and her PARENTS 
           (the pot smoking summer birds from the boat) get out.

           All three of them cast their eyes down and walk past Hunter 
           as if he doesn’t exist. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        ...and he knew that’s all they’d 
                        ever see him as.

           INSIDE GROCERY STORE

           Daniel is mopping the floor, looking at Hunter out the 
           window. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        In an odd way we were alike.

           Hunter looks inside. Their eyes meet. Daniel quickly drops 
           his head and shuffles away. Then he stops. Turns.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        We both wanted to be part of 
                        something.

           EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE. MOMENTS LATER

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        That won’t work.

           Hunter turns to find Daniel, gives him a dubious once over.

                                 DANIEL
                        Not here at least. Most the 
                        customers are sort of....I know you 
                        usually probably go down to Rhode 
                        Island because they have more 
                        lenient laws about alcohol or 
                        whatever but that’s, what, like an 
                        hour both ways? And you throw a lot 
                        a parties--I’ve heard-- and that’s 
                        a lot a driving and if you’re not 
                        getting reimbursed for gas that, 
                        like, pretty much blows... so I was 
                        thinking-- not a lot but just now--
                        I was thinking I have like a whole 
                        storage room of beer back there so 
                        maybe next time you have one of 
                        your soiree’s I would swing by? 
                        Bring some libations.

           Hunter simply stares back. Eyebrows piqued. An amused little 
           grin working the corners of his mouth. 
                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        Soiree’s? Libations? What the fuck? 
                        It felt like an eternity. And then, 
                        all he said was--

                                 HUNTER
                        Wicked.

           Hunter hops into the CAMARO convertible like a character from 
           Grease and peels away--tires kicking up gravel.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And so it began.

           EXT. HUNTER’S BEACH HOUSE. DAY

           Daiquiri’s. Tiki torches. Planned chaos and nary a policeman 
           in sight. Daniel and Hunter cross the lawn, both carrying two 
           30-PACKS. Daniel stops and takes in the scene as if admiring 
           a fine piece of art, Hunter doesn’t break stride.

                                 HUNTER
                        It’s better inside.

           The enter past the Door Man that had turned Daniel down just 
           days before. Daniel glances back at the winding line of 
           desperate faces.

           INSIDE--MOMENTS LATER

           Deafening music. Daniel’s POV--moving through an ocean of 
           drunk teenagers. Bodies on bodies. Fish out of water. 

           INT. BACK BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER

           Four shirtless DUDES, all blitzed out of their minds, 
           sporting backwards Red Sox caps sit around a BONG. In unison 
           they acknowledge Hunter. 

           Daniel awkwardly searches for one to exchange pleasantries 
           with. They don’t seem to notice him.

                                 HUNTER
                             (throws an arm around 
                              Daniel)
                        This is the guy who brought all the 
                        brew. He’s the fuckin’ man.

           The Dudes look up and nod approvingly. Hunter looks to 
           Daniel, not sure of his name.

                                 HUNTER
                        Uh...
                                 DANIEL
                        Daniel. Dan. Well my mom--

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m gonna call you Danny. Cool?

                                 DANIEL
                        Cool.

           DUDE #1 grabs the BONG and takes a massive hit. He holds the 
           smoke in, throws back a shot of Jack Daniels then cracks a 
           beer and chugs it down in a fluid, succinct motion. 

           Upon completion, he exhales the pot smoke from his lungs--
           COUGHING--and beating his chest like a gorilla in heat.

                                 DUDE#2
                        Pussy.

                                 DUDE#1
                        Fuck your mother.

           As soon as Dude#1 says it he wishes he could have it back. 
           The room goes silent as everyone’s eyes fall to the floor. Or 
           out the window. Or the bong. Anywhere but Hunter, who watches 
           beer dribble from a overturned can. 

           Breaking the awkward silence, Hunter picks up the BONG 
           proffers it to Daniel.

                                 HUNTER
                        Batter up.

           Daniel already looks as if he needs to vomit. He takes the 
           bong with an unsure hand. Hunter registers.

                                 HUNTER
                        Ever smoke bud before?

                                 DANIEL
                        Of course.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I lied.

                                 HUNTER
                        Well you’ve drank, right?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah, of course.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I lied again.

                                 HUNTER
                        Then there’s nothing to it, dude.
           Daniel puts his mouth to the bong. Hunter lights the bowl. 
           Water gurgles. Smoke percolates. Silence falls over the room.

           Daniel inhales. Deep. The audience is impressed.

                                 HUNTER
                        The force is strong with you, young 
                        Skywalker.

           Daniel pulls the bong away from his lips and frantically 
           reaches for the shot of liquor. He throws it in his mouth and 
           fights to swallow but instead ERUPTS into a hysteric coughing 
           fit. 

           Snot, smoke and whiskey shoot from his nostrils. The cough 
           intensifies, dropping him to the floor. His body shakes. The 
           Dudes go apeshit.

           The coughing fit subsides, Daniel lays sprawled out on the 
           floor--eyes glossed over and fixed on the ceiling.

           Tears running down his icy, pale face aren’t enough to 
           conceal the proud grin. 

           For those paying attention you’ll notice that this is the 
           first time we’ve seen him smile.

           Move closer on Daniel. Laughter from the meatheads begins to 
           fade as does the noise from the party. Move closer. 

           Sound falls further away... 

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        I was born again.

           EXT. PUBLIC POOL. DAY

           Daniel stands at the end of the DIVING BOARD. The June sun, 
           so fucking bright.

           Eye lids droop like melted wax. A blissful smirk. We see 
           images through his drug induced eyes. Enhanced colors. 
           Utopia. Nirvana. Chemically manufactured happiness.

           He jumps straight up...

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        A lot of things happened to me that 
                        summer. 

            Then lands on the board catapulting himself even HIGHER.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I lost my virginity. I witnessed a 
                        murder. I grew up.
           Lands and springs higher...

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It was both the best and the worst 
                        summer of my life.

           At the peak of his jump he sees her...

           Across the pool, toweling off, is MCKAYLA (16). Time grinds 
           to a glacial pace and Daniel is literally SUSPENDED in air.

           She’s the kind of beauty that can stop your heart--or in this 
           case time--dead in its tracks. She’s the inspiration of 
           fantasy and the killer of dreams.

           By 16 she’s already caused more heartbreak than most women do 
           in a lifetime and she knows it; arming her with moxie that 
           entices just as much lust as it does envy.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But that’s not what this story is 
                        about. This story isn’t about me, 
                        or Hunter Strawberry or the hottest 
                        summer in 68 years.

           Her electric crystal blue EYES meet Daniel’s.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        This is a story about love.

           Time resumes. Daniel plummets down and SMACKS his head on the 
           diving board-- body crumpling limply into the pool. SPLASH!

           Onlookers gasp.

           VIEW FROM BOTTOM OF POOL

           Serene and tranquil. No noise save for the sound of rising 
           bubbles and the hum of the pool’s ventilation system.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And right there, in that very 
                        moment, I fell in love.

                         SLAM TITLE: HOT SUMMER NIGHTS

           EXT. DESERTED BEACH. DAY

           Sheets of rain fall from the sky. Out over the ocean, thunder 
           clouds break open and give way to golden bands of light 
           cascading from the heavens. The water glitters. Majestic.

           Daniel glides through the hostile deluge. Coolly obstinate. 
           McKayla walks towards him. White T-shirt aptly stuck to her 
           supple skin. Their eyes interwoven.
           They meet and embrace--framed under the arch of a RAINBOW--
           holding eachother as if it were the eve of the apocalypse. 

           Their lips move closer for what promises to be the most earth 
           shattering kiss ever known to mankind.

           But before they meet she gently pulls away. Looks deep into 
           his eyes, transpiercing his soul. And says--

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (in a guy’s voice)
                        Is he breathing?

           POOLSIDE

           Daniel jolts awake--spitting water from his lungs. 

           LOW ANGLE

           We are GROUND LEVEL looking up at three heads hanging above-- 
           silhouetted against the biting mid-day sun. His eyes adjust 
           and sees that it’s Dude #1 and Hunter.

                                 HUNTER
                        That was a nasty little spill, my 
                        man.

                                 DUDE #1
                        Bro...I think you were dead there 
                        for a minute.

           Daniel rubs his eyes and coughs.

                                 DANIEL
                        I do too...

           Dude and Hunter laugh. Daniel doesn’t. He’s hoisted up and 
           they help him walk away. Arms around shoulders.

           He throws his eyes back towards the area where he saw her. 

           She’s gone.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. BRICK WALL. DAY

           TRACK along an inane scribble of dripping PINK SPRAY PAINT 
           until we are dollying alongside it’s source. 

           Teenage girls. Three of them. STEPH, OKIE and McKayla walking 
           in stride. They are the very definition of misguided youth. 

           Steph mindlessly sprays the wall as they walk. All three 
           chew, snap and pop bubble gum.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        She was the leader of a nefarious 
                        crew of rebels with absolutely no 
                        cause.

           Okie KICKS a postal box.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. ICE CREAM STAND. DAY

           The girls smoke cigarettes and drink chocolate malts.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Attempts were made to brand the 
                        group. Names like “the lost girls” 
                        and “devils with pretty faces”. But 
                        they would never call themselves 
                        anything and if you asked them why 
                        they’d say--

           Steph turns to us...

                                 STEPH
                        Fuck off.

           FLASHBACK. INT. HIGHSCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY

           Follow behind Mckayla’s swaying hips as she strides down the 
           hall, leaving behind a wake of turned heads. Some look in 
           contempt. Other’s in want. But they all look.

           One of them is Ricky Orwell.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        She blossomed early. Had a grip on 
                        boys from a young age and never let 
                        go. She was known to devour their 
                        hearts. 

           FLASHBACK. EXT. HIGHSCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME. NIGHT

           PAN across the bleachers until we find McKayla sitting with 
           Steph and Okie. They all wear matching SKIRTS.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        Before he died, poor Ricky Orwell 
                        had developed something of an 
                        obsession with her.

           UNDERNEATH BLEACHERS

           Ricky Orwell and PHIL BEVERLY (15) peer up through the 
           slotted wood at McKayla’s purple polka-dotted underwear. 
           Their jaws slack, eyes glowing, writhing in muted excitement.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        There was the time he and Phil 
                        Beverly stole a look up her skirt 
                        during the homecoming game.

           McKayla looks down. The boys duck and scurry away.

           FLASHBACK. INT. CLASSROOM. DAY

           Ricky Orwell sits at the rear of the class, staring fondly at 
           the back of McKayla’s head. Her pony tail. Her scrunchie. The 
           little blond hairs that run down the nape of her neck.

           He watches as she takes a piece of PINK BUBBLE GUM from her 
           mouth and presses it underneath her desk.

           LATER

           Class is over. Students file out the door. Ricky Orwell 
           sheepishly approaches her empty desk, pulls the gum out from 
           underneath and pops it into his mouth. He smiles.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        That Bazooka Joe was the closest he 
                        would ever come to kissing her. It 
                        wasn’t until he died that she even 
                        became aware that he had ever 
                        existed. Other’s had better luck.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. HIGHSCHOOL GROUNDS. DAY

           Mckayla has All-American bad boy KIRBY WELLS (17) pinned to a 
           tree. They make out with the desperate vigor only teenagers 
           can.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Freshman year in highschool she was 
                        dating senior Kirby Wells.

           FLASHBACK. OPEN ROAD. DUSK

           She sits on the back of Kirby’s MOTORCYCLE as it winds down 
           some long abandoned road towards the setting sun. Neither one 
           wears a helmet. Her hair flows liberally in the wind.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        She was with him the night he 
                        accidently overdosed on heroin. 
                        Rumor has it she didn't bat an eye. 

           FLASHBACK. EXT. SAGAMORE BRIDGE. DAY

           A chiseled FOOTBALL PLAYER (21) clad in a varsity letterman 
           jacket crosses the historic bridge in his convertible.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But Kirby Wells wasn’t her only ex 
                        that ended up dead. By junior year 
                        she was dating a linebacker on the 
                        Boston College football team. He 
                        would drive in from Chestnut Hill 
                        every weekend just to see her.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. MCKAYLA’S HOUSE. DAY 

           The football player POUNDS frantically on the front door.

                                 FOOTBALL PLAYER
                             (shouting up at window)
                        Please, babe! I just wanna talk!

                                 DANIEL  (V.O.)
                        When she dumped him he was so 
                        distraught he quit the team.

           She closes her bedroom window and cranks up her STEREO.

           FLASHBACK. INT. BOSTON COLLEGE DORM ROOM. DAY

           A COLLEGE STUDENT walks into the room. His eyes crane up and 
           go wide with horror as they land on a pair of SHOES swaying 
           above the ground.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And then not too long after he quit 
                        life altogether.

           EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATER. NIGHT

           Built in the 1950’s. A ghost from the distant past. The kind 
           of place that leaves you under a warm blanket of nostalgia, 
           yearning to return to an era in which you never lived. 

           It’s retro double-feature night. THE GRADUATE plays. Light 
           from the screen bounces off car windshields’ which are parked 
           in rows along uneven grass. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But of course I knew none of this. 
                        On that fateful night she was just 
                        a girl who happened to get in my 
                        car.

           INT. DANIEL’S DATSUN. DRIVE IN THEATER. CONTINUOUS

           Daniel sits alone. Sipping a coke. His eyes leave the screen 
           and drift towards the BMW parked ahead of him where TWO 
           FIGURES, a guy and girl, are in a heated argument.
           The GIRL climbs out and SLAMS the door. Screaming something 
           which can’t be heard over the blaring intercoms. 

           Daniel squints. Is that...yeah, it’s Mckayla and she appears 
           to be crying. She’s headed this way. Shit. Did she see me?

           He looks down but the SOUND of his passenger door opening 
           brings his head back up. Mckayla hops in.

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (without looking at him)
                        They fall in love and live 
                        unhappily ever after. Now can you 
                        take me the fuck home?

           He doesn’t react. Still trying to process what’s happening.

           The GUY, judging by his cardigan a wealthy summer bird, has 
           stepped out of his BMW and is now approaching Daniel’s car. A 
           pack of RAISINETS clutched in his hand, his name is BLAIR 
           PRESCOTT (21). He’s Robert Kennedy without the charm.

           Blair BANGS on the passenger side window. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (half-soled attempt)
                        Common gorgeous. Enough with the 
                        hysterics, you’re embarrassing 
                        yourself.

           He uses his tongue and index finger to dislodge the candy 
           from his back molars. He BANGS harder.

                                 BLAIR
                        Who’s the river rat?

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (to Daniel)
                        Or you could stay here.

           Daniel snaps to. He starts the engine, throws it into reverse 
           and guns the pedal. 

           DANIEL’S CAR--LATER

           Driving in silence. It’s evident nothing has been said. 
           Mckayla flips down her visor mirror, checks for running 
           mascara, flips it back up. Pulls a cigarette from her purse.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Want one?
                                 DANIEL
                        What? Oh. No thanks.
                             (beat)
                        I have asthma.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        That sucks.

           She lights up anyway. Daniel politely rolls down his window. 
           Coughs. He surprises himself by saying...

                                 DANIEL
                        He looked like a real asshole.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        And how would you know?

           A pause.

                                 DANIEL
                        He was eating Raisinets.

           She looks at Daniel for the first time and giggles in spite 
           of herself.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Yeah. He is.
                             (realizing)
                        Hey, I know you.

                                 DANIEL
                        No, I, uh--I don’t--

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Yea-huh, you were the kid who 
                        busted his shit at the pool.

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh, yeah... I was really zonked.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Didn’t help that you were friggin’ 
                        staring at me either.

           His ears go hot.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        On the diving board, before you 
                        wiped out, don’t even act like you 
                        weren’t.

                                 DANIEL
                        Your nipples were hard.
           The blood immediately drains from Daniel’s mortified face. He 
           can’t believe those words were his. 

           He quickly turns on the radio. Anything to fill the 
           excruciating void. The Crest’s Sixteen Candles comes on.

           McKayla looks at him, her face twisted into a wry grin. 
           Intrigued by his fumbling, boyish innocence.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You’re a little pervert.

                                 DANIEL
                        No...that’s...
                             (sighs)
                        No I’m not.

           Her grin still withstanding.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Sometimes it’s good to be a little 
                        bad.

           He remains speechless. His petrified glare locked on the road 
           ahead. Her eyes linger on him for a beat. Examining...

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I’m the next left but you should 
                        stop here.

           The car slows and stops about 100 yards from the house. 
           Daniel looks around skeptically.

                                 DANIEL
                        You sure?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Yeah. You don’t wanna get too 
                        close.

           Daniel takes in the house laying ahead. A corroded station 
           wagon sits perched upon cinder blocks in the untamed yard. A 
           malnourished dog paces. A broken home for a broken girl. 

           They sit in silence for a moment. Listening to the music. As 
           McKayla gazes inside the house we see that underneath her 
           calloused exterior lays a vulnerability raw as an open wound. 

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (opens the door)
                        Well. Thanks for the ride. Maybe 
                        I’ll see you around.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah. Maybe.

           She gets out, then turns and leans back in the window.
                                 MCKAYLA
                        What’s your name?

                                 DANIEL
                        Danny.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I’m Mckayla. And I’m gonna call you 
                        Daniel. Cool?

                                 DANIEL
                        Cool.

           And with that she’s gone. Daniel watches her walk away as the 
           ironic 50’s ballad CRESCENDOS. 

           He takes a long and steady pull from his INHALER.

           EXT. BEACH. SUNRISE.

           Daniel and Hunter watch waves crash ashore. The morning sun 
           crowns the horizon, casting a splendid orange glow across the 
           black sea. Hunter smokes a JOINT.

                                 DANIEL
                        You ever worried you’ll get caught?

                                 HUNTER
                        What?

                                 DANIEL
                        Doing...what you do. You ever 
                        worried you’ll get caught?

           Hunter takes a contemplative drag from his joint. Exhales.

                                 HUNTER
                        In fourth grade we took a field 
                        trip to one of those planetariums.
                        They told us that our whole galaxy--
                        you know, Orion’s belt and the 
                        milky way and all that shit--they 
                        told us that in the grand scheme of 
                        things our world and everything in 
                        it is nothing more than the size of 
                        a grain of sand on some beach.
                             (hits the joint)
                        And that’s when I stopped giving a 
                        fuck.

           Daniel smiles.

                                 DANIEL
                             (playfully)
                        So that’s the trick.
                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        Walk on the edge long enough and 
                        you’re gonna fall. Trick is to 
                        enjoy the God damn view first.

           A beat as Daniel chooses his next words.

                                 DANIEL
                        What would you say if I told you I 
                        wanted to get involved?

           Hunter chuckles to himself. Daniel doesn’t. Hunter’s smile 
           fades.

                                 HUNTER
                        You’re serious.

           Daniel nods.

                                 HUNTER
                        You’re a good kid, Danny, that shit 
                        ain’t for you. You got things going 
                        for you.

                                 DANIEL
                        Like what? College?
                             (waves it off)
                        That’s me doing what I’m supposed 
                        to do. Life’s too short.

                                 HUNTER
                        Which is why you shouldn’t fuck 
                        yours up.

                                 DANIEL
                        I got my reasons, man.
                             (beat)
                        I met this girl.

                                 HUNTER
                        And you think this will prove 
                        something to her?

                                 DANIEL
                        Sometimes it’s good to be a little 
                        bad.

                                 HUNTER
                        You get that off a fuckin’ bumper 
                        sticker?

           Daniel regathers and tries again.

                                 DANIEL
                        ‘Know how if people tell you you’re 
                        something enough times after awhile 
                        you start to believe it?
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        I’m tired of believing it.

           Hunter adverts his eyes. He knows all to well how that feels.

                                 HUNTER
                        No pair of tits are worth the 
                        trouble. Trust me. If you’re gonna 
                        do it do it for the cash--or the 
                        danger--or as a fuck you to your 
                        parents--anything but a broad.

                                 DANIEL
                        Right.

           Daniel’s eyes drop--deflated. Subconsciously, Hunter scoops a 
           handful of sand and lets it slip through his fingers. Remorse 
           in his voice.

                                 HUNTER
                        If you’re gonna go off and do 
                        something you can’t undo you better 
                        have a damn good reason. There’s no 
                        coming back from that.

           It’s evident Hunter wishes these words were once shared with 
           him. Daniel does his best to lift the somber mood.

                                 DANIEL
                        I drove her home the other night, 
                        right...and the whole time, dude, I 
                        had the craziest fucking bonner.

           Hunter chuckles.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m serious. It didn’t go down for 
                        like half an hour.

                                 HUNTER
                        So who’s the lucky girl?

                                 DANIEL
                        You probably know her--her name’s 
                        McKayla--her tits are unbeliev--

                                 HUNTER
                             (closes his eyes)
                        --Ah shit.

                                 DANIEL
                        What? 

           Hunter shakes his head.
                                 DANIEL
                        What? Is she really a man or 
                        something?

           Hunter remains quiet.

                                 DANIEL
                        Say something, dude.

                                 HUNTER
                        She’s my kid sister you little 
                        shit.

                                 DANIEL
                             (stunned, deflated)
                        Oh.

           Hunter’s tone darkens a little. Silence.

                                 HUNTER
                        There are plenty of chics out here. 
                        Leave her alone.

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay...

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m serious. Leave her alone.

           The mood downshifts. Evaporating the preexisting levity. 
           There’s a moment of awkward silence. Waves lap. Seagulls cry.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well forget her then. I still want 
                        a piece of your action.

                                 HUNTER
                        What for?

                                 DANIEL
                        I wanna enjoy the God damn view.

           Hunter lets go a wan smile. His words turned.

                                 HUNTER
                             (laughs, inwardly)
                        Gravity, man.

                                 DANIEL
                        What? You’re high.

                                 HUNTER
                        Life is like gravity. Doesn’t 
                        matter who you are, we’re all gonna 
                        end up where we’re supposed to 
                        whether we like it or not.
                                 DANIEL
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 HUNTER
                             (hands the joint over)
                        Danny Middleton, you ever sell weed 
                        before?

                                 DANIEL
                             (taking the joint)
                        No.

           Daniel nods his head towards the rising sun.

                                 DANIEL
                        But it’s a new day.

           He smiles and takes a long drag. Hunter can’t help but smile 
           too as he casts his eyes towards the sun.

                                 HUNTER
                        Yes it is.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY

           Daniel and Hunter stand over several bags of WEED spread 
           across the kitchen counter.

                                 DANIEL
                        India?

                                 HUNTER
                        Indica. There are only two types of 
                        weed. This is one of them. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Really? I thought there were, like, 
                        hundreds.

                                 HUNTER
                        There are hundreds of variations, 
                        yeah. Sure. Just like there is 
                        green tea, mint tea, peppermint--
                        whatever--at the end of the day 
                        it’s still tea. Ya dig?

                                 DANIEL
                        I think.

                                 HUNTER
                             (picks up the weed)
                        Notice the dark leaves? This shit 
                        will leave you brain dead and couch 
                        locked-- watching ‘Knight Rider’ 
                        reruns while spooning a tub of Ben 
                        and Jerry’s.
           Daniel laughs.

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m serious. This is important. You 
                        wouldn’t trust a mechanic who 
                        couldn't tell the difference 
                        between diesel and unleaded. 

           Daniel picks up a different looking piece of weed.

                                 DANIEL
                        Is this the same stuff?

                                 HUNTER
                        Nah, that’s Sativa. The ying to 
                        Indica’s yang. Go ‘head ‘n smell 
                        it.

           Daniel takes a whiff. His nose twitches.

                                 HUNTER
                        A few pulls of that’ll put your 
                        brain on skates-- have  you 
                        contemplating outer space and the 
                        evolution all while cleaning the 
                        bathroom and alphabetizing your 
                        cassette tapes.

                                 DANIEL
                        To each his own.

                                 HUNTER
                        To each his own.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. GARAGE. DAY

           Daniel and Hunter stand before a work table. On the table are 
           JARS of weed, zip lock BAGS and a SCALE.

                                 HUNTER
                             (holding up little bag)
                        One gram costs ten bucks. We call 
                        it a dime bag.

                                 DANIEL
                        Isn’t this what we smoked at the 
                        party?

                                 HUNTER
                        Good. I’m working with a natural.
                             (picks up larger bag)
                        3.5 grams, also known as an eighth, 
                        goes for 30 to 40 depending on how 
                        dank the bud is. This is what most 
                        people will buy.
                                 DANIEL
                             (pointing at an even 
                              bigger bag)
                        What’s that?

                                 HUNTER
                        That’s a zip. An ounce. 200 bucks 
                        give or take. If more people bought 
                        these life would be easier.

                                 DANIEL
                        And what’s it called if they want 
                        more than that?

           Hunter looks up from his work--sporting a sly grin.

                                 HUNTER
                        A good day.

           EXT. HYANNIS PORT. DAY

           Passengers board a Martha’s Vineyard bound FERRY. A portly 
           GATE GUARD named GUS checks tickets. Daniel and Hunter are 
           next in line.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Hunter taught me how to make 
                        friends in the right places. How to 
                        take care of people.

                                 HUNTER
                        Morning, Gus.
                             (re: Daniel)
                         This is your new best friend. 

           Hunter gives the nod and Daniel slips GUS a bag of weed.

                                 HUNTER
                        Beautiful day for the open sea.

                                 GUS
                             (smiling wide)
                        Beautiful indeed.

           The boys board the Ferry.

           INT/EXT. MARTHA’S VINYARD FERRY. DAY

           They lean against the rail. Wind passing through their hair 
           as they watch the glittering water pass below.

                                  DANIEL (V.O)
                        If there was something Hunter did 
                        better than anyone it was recognize 
                        an opportunity and then seize it.

                                  DANIEL (V.O) (CONT'D)
                        For instance, he was the only 
                        dealer on the Cape who wasn’t 
                        afraid of the black kids from Oaks 
                        Bluff.

           EXT. OAKS BLUFF / INKWELL BEACH. PARKING LOT. DAY

           Hunter introduces Daniel to two PREPPY BLACK TEENAGERS named 
           BLAKE and MYLES. They look like Tiger Woods and Carlton 
           Banks.

                                 BLAKE
                        ‘Preciate you coming all the way 
                        out here again.

                                 HUNTER
                        Not a problem, man. Smoke that shit 
                        in good health.

                                 MYLES
                        Amen.

                                 BLAKE
                        Preach.

           Daniel and Hunter turn and walk away.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        He let me adopt some of his old 
                        customers and helped me make new 
                        ones of my own. But most 
                        importantly he taught me how to be 
                        smart.

                                 BLAKE
                        Hey man, you ever going to tell me 
                        your name?

           They turn back around.

                                 HUNTER
                        Less you know the better, right?

                                 BLAKE
                        Preach.

                                 MYLES
                        Amen.

           EXT. HUNTER’S GARAGE. DAY

           A BACKPACK being stuffed with baggies of weed. Hunter zips 
           the bag then tosses it to Daniel who drops it in the TRUNK of 
           his car. Then he hands him a BEEPER.
                                 HUNTER
                             (re: the beeper)
                        Keep this on your hip at all times. 
                        Weed heads are impatient, if you 
                        take too long to hit ‘em back 
                        they’ll call the next guy.

           Hunter pulls out his BEEPER, flashes the screen towards 
           Daniel, it reads: 37 NEW MESSAGES.

                                 HUNTER
                        See what I mean? But as long as 
                        this bitch is buzzing we’re gravy.

           Daniel nods his head as he climbs into his Datsun.

                                 HUNTER
                        Okay, you got two drops in 
                        Yarmouth, two in Brewster, three in 
                        Harwich and one in Chatam. And 
                        remember she’s a little deaf so--

                                 DANIEL
                        Honk twice. I got it.

                                 HUNTER
                        That’a boy.

           Hunter holds out $40 dollars. Daniel looks at incredulously.

                                 DANIEL
                        What--

                                 HUNTER
                        For gas.

                                 DANIEL
                        No, it’s all good, man, I’m okay on 
                        gas.

                                 HUNTER
                        Then buy yourself a fuckin’ 
                        milkshake. Just take it.

           Daniel takes the money and starts backing out of the 
           driveway. Hunter shouts after him like a concerned mother.

                                 HUNTER
                        Turn your headlights on and drive 
                        slow. Not too slow.

           INT. DANIEL’S CAR. MOVING. DAY

           Police lights flare up in his REARVIEW mirror.
                                 DANIEL
                        Shit.

           He pulls the car to the side of the road. Cuts the radio.

                                 DANIEL
                        Shit.

           ROADSIDE

           We FOLLOW BEHIND the narrow shouldered police officer. Gravel 
           crunches under his boots. Uniform damp with sweat.  

           This is SHERIFF FRANK CALHOUN(49). He walks with the stiff, 
           calculated  gait of a man who takes himself very seriously 
           and has left little room for humor.

           DANIEL’S CAR

                                 DANIEL
                        Be cool...

           Knock knock. Calhoun raps his knuckles on the window. His 
           head is back-lit by the sun, masquerading his face behind a 
           shadow. All that can be seen is a hard jaw and dark eyes.

           Daniel cranks down the window.

                                 DANIEL
                        Afternoon offi--

                                 CALHOUN
                        License.

           Daniel hands over his license. Calhoun begins filling out a 
           CITATION. There’s a dark, forboding aura about him. Almost 
           otherworldly.

                                 CALHOUN
                        You’re new out this way.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes sir.

                                 CALHOUN
                        That wasn’t a question.

           There’s an awkward, uncomfortable silence. Daniel swallows.

                                 CALHOUN
                        I pulled you over this afternoon 
                        because you have expired.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?
                                 CALHOUN
                        Your plates. They have expired.

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh. Right. Shoot, that’s right. 
                        I’ll be sure--

                                 CALHOUN
                        I see you passing through here 
                        often. I’m curious as to why.

                                 DANIEL
                        Here? Oh, uh, vi--visiting my 
                        grandma. In Wellfleet. She’s sick. 
                        Real sick. 

           Calhoun remains silent. Inscrutable. But if you had to guess 
           he’s not buying it.

                                 CALHOUN
                        You’re due in for a hard and trying 
                        summer.
                             (glances at the sun)
                        Looks like we all are. When the 
                        air’s so heavy you can’t breathe 
                        and your stomach turns sour, the 
                        nights will get long and sleepless 
                        and the world can feel like it’s 
                        folding in. And when it does it’s 
                        me who will be there to greet you.
                             (he spits)
                        The heat will change a man, Mr. 
                        Middleton. Make him do things he 
                        otherwise would not do.

           He scribbles out the last of the citation and RIPS it off the 
           pad.

                                 CALHOUN
                        And as he yearns for cooler times 
                        do you know what it is that will 
                        tear him apart?

                                 DANIEL
                        No sir.

           Calhoun leans down and hands over the ticket, revealing his 
           face. It looks as his voice sounded--rawboned and soulless.

                                 CALHOUN
                        Denying that which is inevitable.
                             (tips his hat)
                        See you further down the road, Mr. 
                        Middleton.

           He walks away. Through the rearview mirror Daniel watches 
           Calhoun recede back to his vehicle. 
           The interaction has left him shaken and unsettled--stuck with 
           sickening feeling that looms after waking from a bad dream.

           EXT. MINOR LEAGUE BASBALL GAME. DUSK

           Stadium lights cast down on a manicured basball diamond. An 
           electricity is in the air. America's pastime. Cape Cod’s 
           lifeblood. 

           Daniel and Hunter sit high in the BLEACHERS chewing sunflower 
           seeds. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Sounds like Calhoun. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Who?

                                 HUNTER
                        Calhoun. He’s the sheriff of this 
                        little waterin’ hole. That’s his 
                        game--putting the fear of God in 
                        anyone who’ll let him.

                                 DANIEL
                        Well he put it in me.

                                 HUNTER
                        Don’t sweat it, bro.

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know about you but I don’t 
                        wanna end up in Walpole getting 
                        raped by a skinhead in the showers.

                                 HUNTER
                        Whoa. Easy. Take it easy.

                                 DANIEL
                             (getting worked up)
                        We’re over exsposed--all the back 
                        and forth--driving all across--

                                 VENDOR (O.S)
                        Peanuts!

           They turn to find a long suffering PEANUT VENDOR making his 
           way down the steps. He carries concessions and the broken 
           pride of a man who gave up on the world long before it gave 
           up on him.

                                 VENDOR
                             (sullen)
                        Get’cha peanuts, here.

           They both decline and the Vendor continues down the steps.
                                 HUNTER
                        Keep your voice down, will ya.

                                 DANIEL
                             (lower voice)
                        Right now we’re nothing more than 
                        glorified delivery boys. The risk 
                        verse reward is all fucked.

                                 HUNTER
                        If your hands are startin’ to shake 
                        maybe this ain’t for you.

                                 DANIEL
                        You don’t get what I’m saying.

                                 HUNTER
                             (agitated)
                        No, I don’t.

           A tense lull in the conversation. Their eyes go to the 
           infield. A BATTER takes the plate. The first pitch. Ball one. 
           Low and away.

                                 DANIEL
                        We have to choose.

                                 HUNTER
                        Huh? Choose what? Danny you need to 
                        chill, get a beer or somethi--

                                 DANIEL
                        You want to be the guy selling 
                        peanuts or the guy who owns the 
                        peanut company?

           Hunter turns to Daniel-- a glint in his eyes.

           CRACK! The Batter sends a line shot deep into left field. 
           Home run. The crowd ROARS. 

           Their eye contact doesn’t break.

           EXT. STREET. NIGHT

           Hunter’s CAMARO winds through a Boston neighborhood which is 
           in it’s budding years of gentrification. 

           INT. HUNTER’S CAMARO. SAME

           Hunter drives. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Where’re we going?
                                 DANIEL
                        What do we have now--twenty five 
                        customers? Maybe thirty? Altogether 
                        about a pound a week, right?

                                 HUNTER
                        Where’re we going, man?

                                 DANIEL
                        What I’m saying is we can move 
                        five, maybe ten times that much and 
                        cut out all the nonsense. How’s 
                        that sound?

                                 HUNTER
                        Sure it sounds good. Tit fucking 
                        Heather Locklear sounds good, don’t 
                        mean it’s gonna happen. Now 
                        where’re we going?

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s because your supplier is 
                        crap. No offense, but he is. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Three weeks ago you’d never held a 
                        bong before, now you’re gonna tell 
                        me how to flip weed?

                                 DANIEL
                        Have I disappointed you yet?

           Hunter looks away. Point taken.

                                 HUNTER
                        Where the fuck are we going?

           Daniel smiles as they pull up outside a HOUSE PARTY. Music 
           pours from inside. Daniel nods towards the house.

                                 HUNTER
                        You’re not gonna find a bigger 
                        connect than I got.

                                 DANIEL
                        You sure about that?

                                 HUNTER
                        Nobody out here can get you 10 
                        pounds a week--yeah I’m sure about 
                        that.

                                 DANIEL
                        Can’t be sure until we ask.

           Hunter’s eyes crawl across Daniel’s face. He’s not used to 
           having us judgment called into question.
                                 HUNTER
                        What’re you even looking for in 
                        there?

                                 DANIEL
                        A guy with a pony tail?

                                 HUNTER
                             (scoffs)
                        A guy with a pony tail.

                                 DANIEL
                        My cousin says he’s cool. It’s 
                        gonna work. Don’t worry.

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m not worried.

           Daniel unbuckles his seat belt.

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s right--you don’t worry about 
                        anything.

           He opens the door.

                                 DANIEL
                             (Schwarzenegger voice)
                        I’ll be back.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE. NIGHT

           Follow behind Daniel as he makes his way through the party. 
           Kegs of IPA. Grungy Yuppies. R.E.M’s Losing My Religion. 

           TOWARDS THE BACK 

           PONYTAIL has some poor girl cornered. He’s a greasy low-life 
           burnout. A seedy local who never got out and lives for 
           parties like this.

           Daniel timidly approaches him from behind. Taps his shoulder. 
           Ponytail startles and spins. He’s blasted out of his mind on 
           coke.

                                 PONYTAIL
                        Whoa! Can’t be sneakin’ up on 
                        people, little man.

                                 DANIEL
                        Sorry.

           There’s an awkward beat where they both wait for the other to 
           speak. The poor girl uses this as her window to leave.
                                 DANIEL
                        I heard you had weed.

           Ponytail’s shifty bloodshot eyes shoot around the room. Pure 
           paranoia. He takes Daniel by the arm--

                                 PONYTAIL
                        C’mere.

           --and pulls him towards a more secluded hallway.

                                 PONYTAIL
                        Who are you?

                                 DANIEL
                        Danny. Taylor’s cousin.

                                 PONYTAIL
                        You a cop?

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

                                 PONYTAIL
                        You a snitch?

                                 DANIEL
                        No. No. Taylor didn’t tell y--

                                 PONYTAIL
                        Okay. Cool...okay...How much you 
                        lookin’ for, kid?

                                 DANIEL
                        A lot. Like as much as you can get. 
                        Like...pounds.

           Ponytail looks up and around once more. Lowers his voice.

                                 PONYTAIL
                        Yeah?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.

                                 PONYTAIL
                        Okay. Okay.

           He places a hand on Daniel’s shoulder and leans in as if to 
           whisper something and POW! SOCKS him in the stomach.

           Daniel pitches forward. BAM! A FIST cold clocks him in the 
           FACE. He drops to the floor--curls into the fetal position.

           Ponytail winds up and KICKS him in the ribs.
                                 PONYTAIL
                        You tell your cousin...

           Another KICK!

                                 PONYTAIL
                        That two bit Jew fuck! You tell him 
                        I’m no stupid motherfuc--

           WHACK! 

           Ponytail’s body goes limp and he drops to the floor into an 
           unconscious, twitching heap of flesh.

           REVEAL: Hunter standing behind him--clutching a 750ml BOTTLE 
           OF LIQUOR. A demented scowl on his face. A burning lunacy in 
           his eyes. 

           He grabs Ponytail by the throat, crushing his wind wipe. 
           Blood vessels in his eye rupture. Skin turns blue.

           Hunter is a man possessed. Void of any cognition. Pure Id. 

           He picks Ponytail’s head back up.

           WHACK! 

           Sounds like a watermelon breaking open.

           WHACK!

           This time the bottle SHATTERS.

           Ponytail’s body convulses. A crimson pool of blood leaks from 
           his head. Hunter stands over him. Not an iota of emotion.

           Daniel looks on--petrified. 

                                 HUNTER
                             (eyes still on Ponytail)
                        Let’s go.

           Daniel scurries up and staggers towards the door. Hunter 
           finally peels his eyes away from his victim and follows 
           behind. Onlookers stand by. Mouths agape. 

           INT. HUNTER’S CAMARO. MOMENTS LATER

           They sit in silence. Hunter gazes into the distance. A cold 
           and numb thousand yard stare. Daniel’s hands shake.

                                 HUNTER
                        Family. That’s all I got.
                             (beat)
                        That’s what I worry about.
           He starts the ignition. The engine purrs. And they drive off.

           EXT. CUSHMANS DRUG STORE. DAY

           A local mom and pop pharmacy that has stood the test of time. 

           CLOSE ON: Daniel’s BLACK EYE staring directly into frame. His 
           cornea rich with ruptured blood vessels.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        The next time I saw McKayla 
                        Strawberry it was a Tuesday. 
                        Earlier that day I had tried 
                        Nutella for the first time. It was 
                        also the same day Terminator 2 came 
                        out.

           Flip to see what he’s looking at: GAUZE and BANDAGES. He 
           grabs a box of each.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I don’t think any of those events 
                        were related but I can’t be sure.

           He turns and sees Mckayla standing further down the aisle. 
           She hasn’t noticed him yet. 

           He looks away sharply and stands still, trying not to be 
           seen. When he looks back up she’s walking into the next 
           aisle. He follows cautiously behind, peeking around the 
           corner. 

           Whatever she’s looking for isn’t in this aisle either. She 
           moves to the next. So does he. There’s a fine line between a 
           creep and a boy in love--he’s shaded towards the latter. 

           He takes a deep breath and musters up all the courage he has. 
           Clears his throat then opens his mouth to speak.....

           Nothing comes out.

           She starts out of the aisle. Daniel sees his opportunity 
           slipping away and out of sheer reaction violently swats a row 
           of boxes off the shelf. They crash to the floor and scatter 
           She turns. He feigns innocence.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Daniel?

                                 DANIEL
                        Oh. Hi.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Wow. 
                             (indicates eye)
                        Where’d you catch the shiner?
                                 DANIEL
                        Oh, this? Just a fight.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Naughty. I’m guessing I should see 
                        the other guy.

           Daniel laughs awkwardly.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah...

                                 MCKAYLA
                        How long have you been following 
                        me?

                                 DANIEL
                        What? Who? Me following you?

           She casts her eyebrows and smirks. Not buying the bullshit. 
           He guiltily adverts his eyes. She changes the subject.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I’m looking for epsom salt. You 
                        ever thrown epsom salt on a slug?

                                 DANIEL
                        No. What’s it do?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        It’s awesome. But I can’t find any.

                                 DANIEL
                        Slugs?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Epsom salt.

           There’s a gap in the conversation. Sure the silence is 
           uncomfortable but it’s ripe with sexual tension. 

           HONK HONK. Daniel looks out the store window and sees BLAIR 
           sitting in his BMW. He honks a third time.

           His stomach drops through the floor. His chest collapses.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I gotta...

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.

           She spins on her heels and begins to leave, then turns back.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You going to the fireworks 
                        Thursday?
                                 DANIEL
                        I dunno.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        It’s cheaper than a movie and the 
                        cops don’t bust anyone for 
                        drinking.

                                 DANIEL
                        Maybe I’ll check it out.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I think you should.

           She backs out of the door. Daniel watches as she climbs into 
           the BMW. She glances back over her shoulder and their eyes 
           meet briefly once more before the car pulls away.

           EXT. STREET. DUSK

           Daniel walks alone down the sidewalk. Head down. Shoulders 
           hunched. The final light of the day at his back. 

           A BLACK VAN casually rolls past. He hardly notices. Then it’s 
           tires SCREECH. The Van hooks a U turn and accelerates back 
           towards Daniel.

           The passenger door flings open and out hops DEX(38). A 
           formidable presence with a face like an old catcher’s mit.

           Instinctively, Daniel turns to run away but it’s of no use. 
           Dex snags him by the collar--stopping Daniel in his tracks.

           Daniel frantically pulls out his velcro wallet.

                                 DANIEL
                        Here! Take it! It’s all I have!

           Dex ignores the desperate plea.

                                 DEX
                        We have something you want. No 
                        black eye necessary.

           After a beat Daniel calms a bit, realizing what this may be.

                                 DEX
                        We should talk.

                                 DANIEL
                        How did...how--

                                 DEX
                        Get in.
                                 DANIEL
                        I can’t do anything without my 
                        partner. So unless--

           Dex pulls the Van’s’ sliding door open. Inside is Hunter. 
           Arms folded, trying not to look scared. 

                                 DEX
                        I won’t ask again.

           INT. LUCY’S 24 HOUR DINER. NIGHT

           Daniel and Hunter sit on one side of a booth. Dex and the 
           DRIVER of the Van sit across the table.

                                 DEX
                        I’ve been watching you. Longer than 
                        you’d be comfortable with knowing. 
                        You got reach, I’ve seen that. 
                        You’re smart. Careful. But not 
                        careful enough. You caught my 
                        attention which means before long 
                        you’ll catch the wrong kind of 
                        attention.

                                 HUNTER
                        Not sure how close you’ve been 
                        watching, bro, but I’ve been around 
                        the block if you know what I mean. 
                        Cops out here ain’t worth spit in a 
                        bucket.

                                 DEX
                        I’m not just talking about the 
                        cops.

           Hunter and Daniel trade glances. Hadn’t thought of that.

                                 DEX
                        Know what your problem is?

                                 HUNTER
                        Got a feeling you’re about to tell 
                        me.

                                 DEX
                        You’re sitting at the penny slots 
                        hoping to take down the house.

           Daniel shoots Hunter a passive aggressive ‘told you so’ look.

                                 DEX
                        Gotta play big to win big.

           Daniel now shifts his entire body so it faces Hunter. Eyes 
           boring into the side of his head. 
           Hunter gnaws at the inside of his cheek. Foot agitatedly 
           bouncing under the table. He refuses to look back at Daniel.

                                 DEX

                        end one of two ways. Either you’ll 
                        end up in Walpole getting raped by 
                        a skinhead in the showers or--

           Daniel excitedly pounds the table. Silverware rattles. Dex 
           pauses for a moment....then continues.

                                 HUNTER
                        You’ve made your fuckin’ point. 

                                 DEX
                        The idea is to work as a

                        four or five--spread out over a 
                        couple of cities--and you move in

                        And what do you do exactly?

                                 DEX
                        The man I work for, who you will 
                        never meet, will provide as much 
                        product as you can handle. I make 
                        sure you pay us back on time.

           The Driver has yet to speak, he just stares blankly at the 
           boys like a dumb owl.

                                 HUNTER
                             (re: the Driver)
                        And what does he do?

                                 DEX
                        He drives.

                                 DANIEL
                        How do we know this isn’t some sort 
                        of sting set up thing...how do we 
                        know you’re not cops? 

           Dex deftly SLAPS Daniel across the face.

                                 DEX
                        Cops can’t do that.
           Hunter shoots up from his seat, ready for a brawl. But 
           neither Dex or the Driver budge. Completely nonthreatened.

                                 DEX
                        Sit down.

           He holds ground. Fists bawled. Just waiting to be provoked.

                                 DEX
                        Sit down.

           Hunter’s not used to being challenged, physically or 
           psychologically, but Dex strikes him a man better left 
           unfucked with.

           His fists uncurl and he slowly lowers himself back into the 
           seat.

                                 DEX
                        What happens from here is something 
                        of a trial period. If both parties 
                        are happy with the outcome we’ll 
                        take it from there.

                                 DANIEL
                             (rubbing his jaw)
                        How’s it work?

                                 DEX
                        We front you some weight--you have 
                        till Thursday and not a second more 
                        to flip it and pay us back the 
                        principal. No vig. Whatever you 
                        make over that is yours to keep. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Thursday? You’re only giving us two 
                        days?

                                 DANIEL
                             (to Dex)
                        What are we looking at?

           Hunter glares at Daniel.

                                 DEX
                        Two pounds. High quality. Better 
                        than anything you have. Twelve 
                        hundred a piece.

           The boys exchange a glance. Each trying to read the other. 
           Hunter tries to conceal his doubt. Daniel, on the other hand, 
           looks different. A burgeoning valiancy within. 

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s--
                                 HUNTER
                        I know what it is.

           Their non verbal deliberation continues. Hunter breaks it by 
           looking back to Dex.

                                 HUNTER
                        Seems kinda steep, I don’t--

                                 DANIEL
                        How about five pounds?

           Hunter’s eyes go wide.

                                 DEX
                        Think you can handle five?

           Hunter’s quick to camouflage any doubt. His eyes narrow.

                                 HUNTER
                        Shouldn’t be a problem. But say 
                        something happens. Say we’re a 
                        little late. What happens then?

           Dex shrugs.

                                 DEX
                        You’ve seen the movies.

           EXT. LUCY’S 24 HOUR DINER. PARKING LOT. LATER

           WHAM! Hunter’s trunk door slams shut. Dex nods at them from 
           the Black Van before it drives away. 

           Hunter yanks out a pack of CIGARETTES and jostles out a butt. 

                                 HUNTER
                        You out of your fuckin’ mind, 
                        Danny?!

                                 DANIEL
                        I got a plan.

                                 HUNTER
                        Your brain dead cousin? Same one 
                        who caught you that black eye?

                                 DANIEL
                        Trust me.

                                 HUNTER
                        And what if it doesn't work?
                                 DANIEL
                        It has to.
                             (re: the cigarettes)
                        Now gimme one of those.

           EXT. ALLEY WAY. NIGHT

           Follow behind TAYLOR MIDDLETON(24)tearing ass full steam down 
           the alley--BACKPACK swinging from his tattoo laden arms. A 
           fat, overworked, underpaid SECURITY GAURD gives chase.

           Taylor was born on the wrong side of the tracks and never 
           looked back. He’s the kid that the D.A.R.E Program warned us 
           about and he’s currently running like the devil’s on his 
           heels.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        My cousin Taylor lived out in 
                        Quincy. He was sent away at ten 
                        years old after being caught 
                        lighting squirrels on fire at a 
                        family cookout. I hadn’t seen him 
                        since.

           Taylor stumbles, catches his balance and without breaking 
           stride checks over his shoulder. FREEZE FRAME on his face.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I figured if anyone could get rid 
                        of 5 pounds of pot overnight it was 
                        him.

           Resume. Taylor skids to a stop in front of a CHAINLINK fence. 
           He tosses the backpack over, scales to the top and flips over 
           effortlessly to the other side. He’s done this once or twice.

           He turns a corner and finds Daniel waiting inside his idling 
           Datsun. Taylor rips the door open and dives in.

           DANIEL’S DATSUN

                                 TAYLOR
                        Go motherfucker! Go!

                                 DANIEL
                        Did you get it?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Go!

           Daniel jams the gas--sending the car lurching from the 
           shadows. Once on the main road, he slows to an appropriate 
           speed. Cautiously and meticulously checking his mirrors.

                                 DANIEL
                        Did you get it?
           Face split in a grin, Taylor unzips the backpack and begins 
           pulling out wads of CASH.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why were you running?

           Taylor flashes a villainous grin.

                                 DANIEL
                             (shaking head)
                        Jesus.

           Taylor holds the cash in the air, tilts his head back and 
           hollers to the heavens like some drunken redneck.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        God damn, boy! You grew up fast! 
                        What in fuck’s hell gotten into 
                        you?!

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know.

           And he really doesn’t.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It was the biggest gamble I had 
                        ever taken.
                             (beat)
                        And I won.

           INT. HUNTER’S GARAGE. DAY

           Dex drops a large DUFFLE BAG on the ground.

                                 DEX
                        Same time next week.

           He shakes hands with both Hunter and Daniel before climbing 
           into the Black Van and driving off.

           Once the van is out of sight Daniel jumps up and down-- 
           bursting with excited energy.

                                 DANIEL
                        Did I tell ya or did I tell ya?

           Hunter smiles weakly and looks downward at his high-tops.

                                 DANIEL
                        Common. Say it.

           He playfully punches Hunter in the arm.

                                 DANIEL
                        Say it...
                                 HUNTER
                        You were right. I was wrong.

           He puts an arm around Hunter.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s all good. You know what they 
                        say about broken clocks.

                                 HUNTER
                        Actually, nah, I don’t.

           The boys stare at the bag on the floor.

                                 DANIEL
                        Man. I have a feeling this is the 
                        start of something huge.

           Daniel bends down to examine the contents in the duffle bag. 

           Hunter’s smile quickly fades and an unsettling darkness fills 
           his eyes.

           EXT. FAIR GROUNDS. NIGHT

           We are at the annual FIRE WORKS show and it really is the 
           talk of the town. Hundreds of people mill about hay lined 
           walk-ways boarded with an array of concessions.

           Hot dog stands. Cotton candy. Giraffe shaped balloons. The 
           fireworks show is mere moments away and the air is buzzing 
           with excitement.

           BLAIR feeds a piece of fried dough to a giggling Mckayla. 
           Emotionally she’s not there but over time she has mastered 
           the art of pretense.

           Joining Mckayla and BLAIR are Steph, Okie and one of BLAIR’s 
           BUDDIES.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m gonna go grab some more booze 
                        from the Beemer. You ladies have 
                        any requests?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Something strong.

                                 BLAIR
                        You little devil.

           BLAIR slaps McKayla’s ass then grabs his buddy in a headlock 
           and they walk away.
                                 OKIE
                        He’s fuckin’ wicked hot, Kay. Not 
                        to mention, like, rich as f’ing 
                        God.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        He’s okay.

                                 OKIE
                        You always do this. You wouldn’t 
                        know prince charming if he came in 
                        your mouth.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Ew. Sick. 

                                 OKIE
                        I’m just saying.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Whatever, Okie.

           Okie nudges Steph.

                                 OKIE
                        Um, hello, am I wrong?

                                 STEPH
                        Fuck off.

           ON DANIEL

           Moving towards the group. Clutched behind his back is a BOX 
           of EPSOM SALT.

           FRIED DOUGH STAND

           Okie sees Daniel approaching.

                                 OKIE
                        Wow. Loserville U.S.A. Two o’clock.

           McKayla looks up and sees Daniel. He locks eyes with her and 
           holds it for the duration of the conversation.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hey.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Look who showed up.

                                 DANIEL
                        I brought you something.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Oh yeah?
           He pulls the box of salt from behind his back. Her cheeks 
           flush red. She’s used to boys trying to impress her, she’s 
           not used to it working.

                                 DANIEL
                        I gave it a shot. You’re right, it 
                        is awesome.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Where’d you...find this...?

           Daniel shrugs. Nothing to it.

                                 OKIE
                        What the fuck’s going on?

           Sparks fly. Intense eye contact. Okie’s question goes 
           unanswered.

           In the distance, Daniel see’s BLAIR and his buddies heading 
           back--six packs and brown bagged liquor bottles in tow.

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t kill ‘em all at once.

           She fights back a smile.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Make sure you do the same.

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s too late.

           A grin crawls across his face. He looks deep into her eyes.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m hooked.

           His eyes linger for a second more before he turns and leaves.

                                 OKIE
                        Um, what the hell was that?

           McKayla doesn’t respond. She’s too busy watching Daniel walk 
           away. BLAIR returns.

                                 BLAIR
                        Who let the clodhopper out of his 
                        shed?

           Everyone laughs. McKayla doesn’t.

           ON DANIEL

           Heading towards us. Over his shoulder we can see the group 
           laughing at his expense. He pulls out his inhaler, shakes it 
           and brings it up to his lips. 
           Then he hesitates, stops walking and turns around. He DROPS 
           the inhaler to the ground and makes a beeline for McKayla. 

           We follow behind him as he approaches. Resolute. A boy who 
           will not be deterred.

                                 BLAIR
                        Listen you piece of trash she 
                        doesn’t--

           He struts up to McKayla, grabs her by the hips and KISSES 
           her. 

           At first she’s startled, then after a second or so she drops 
           the box of salt and kisses him back.

           Just then the FIREWORKS go off. 

           Red, white and blue explosions flood the night sky.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Okay so there weren’t any 
                        fireworks.

           The fireworks immediately evaporate from the sky and the rest 
           of the GROUP stands in collective awe watching the kiss.

                                 DANIEL
                        But of all life’s moments we’re 
                        lucky if we can call a handful of 
                        them “perfect”. A super-massive 
                        black hole could have swallowed the 
                        entire universe but nothing could 
                        have taken that moment away from 
                        me. 

           INT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM. GIANT OCEAN TANK. DAY

           Daniel and McKayla stand before the gigantic glass tank. A 
           window into another world. Sharks, sting rays and sea turtles 
           float in the abyss. The water’s soft blue glow bouncing off 
           their faces.

           His hand brushes against hers. Fingers interlock. They smile.

           EXT. NEW ENGLAND AQUARIUM. GIFT SHOP. DAY

           Daniel and McKayla walk out of the store. She holds a plastic 
           bag with a GOLDFISH.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Daniel meet Oliver the fish. Oliver 
                        the fish, meet Daniel.
                                 DANIEL
                        How do you know his name is Oliver?

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (duh)
                        Look at him.

           She holds the bag up to Daniel’s face.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Here, give him a kiss.

                                 DANIEL
                             (ducking away)
                        Ah!

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (faux pout)
                        What if a wizard turned me into a 
                        fish? Would you stop kissing me, 
                        too?

                                 DANIEL
                        Nah.

           He throws his arm around her.

                                 DANIEL
                        If you were turned into a fish I’d 
                        learn how to breathe under water.

           EXT. KARTWHEELS GO KART TRACK. PARKING LOT. DAY

           Standing outside Daniel’s Datsun, shotgunning can’s of Busch. 
           Beer foam dribbles down their chins. Daniel gags and spits. 

           She can’t hold her laughter and the beer erupts from her 
           mouth and nose.

           INT. KARTWHEELS. MOMENTS LATER

           It’s the Chuckie Cheese of Cape Cod. Batting cages. Mini 
           golf. Ice cream stands and--

           Go Carts! Daniel in one cart, McKayla in the other. She revs 
           her engine, he responds. Go! Their cars peel out and begin 
           whipping around the track, laughing so hard they can’t 
           breathe.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        We were both wandering souls, lost 
                        and drifting about in a random 
                        world.
           She loses control of her cart and they SLAM HEAD FIRST into 
           each other.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And for whatever reason we had 
                        collided.

           INT. DANIEL’S DATSUN--MOVING. EVENING

           They sing along with a song on the radio. The parking lot for 
           Lucy’s 24 hour diner is approaching on the right.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But of all the girls in the world I 
                        could have fallen in love with I 
                        fell for the only one that I 
                        couldn’t.

           Daniel spots Hunter’s CAMARO parked in the lot and....vroom, 
           keeps driving...

           McKayla looks out at the passing diner. Confused.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Thought you wanted pancakes.

                                 DANIEL
                        Chinese sounds better.

           Odd. He goes back to singing, trying his best not to show the 
           sweat. After a moment she’s over it and back to singing.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And I wasn’t the only one venturing 
                        onto dangerous grounds.

           INT. LUCY’S 24 HOUR DINER. SAME 

           Hunter sits alone in a booth, smoking a cigarette while 
           sipping a milk shake. 

           He doesn't see Daniel’s CAR passing out the WINDOW because 
           his eyes are currently stuck on a table of TEENAGE GIRLS.

           And although her back is turned, one in particular has him 
           rapt in adoration. Her pony tail. Her scrunchie. The little 
           blond hairs that run down the nape of her neck...

           Her name is AMY (15). She’s a blonde haired blue-eyed angel--
           so traditional she makes American pie insecure.

           GIRLS TABLE:

           They share a huge plate of FRENCH FRIES.
                                 FRIEND #1
                        Oh my Gosh. Amy, he’s like, so 
                        staring at you.

                                 AMY
                        Stop.

                                 FRIEND # 2
                        He’s such a fox.

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Ew. More like a retarded grease 
                        monkey.

                                 FRIEND # 2
                        Whatever. I’d let him take a 
                        bite...

                                 FRIEND #1
                        Yuck.

                                 FRIEND # 3
                        Oh no. Oh no, he’s coming over.

           Amy turns her head to find Hunter approaching. A thumb hooked 
           in his belt loop, he braces a forearm against the coat rack 
           and leans in.

                                 HUNTER
                        Hey.

                                 AMY
                        I have a boyfriend.

           Hunter smiles.

                                 HUNTER
                        Nah, you don’t. But if you don’t 
                        quit being so friggin’ cute you 
                        will soon.

           The girls blush as if he’s talking directly to them. Amy dips 
           a french fry in KETCHUP and pops into her mouth, doing her 
           best to remain impervious.

                                 AMY
                        You don’t know the first thing 
                        about me.

                                 HUNTER
                        I know you like ketchup.

           An involuntary grin slips across Amy’s mouth. Hunter smiles.
           EXT. CARNIVAL. NIGHT

           Ferris wheel lights and the smell of candied popcorn. A 
           magical evening. Hunter and Amy walk hand in hand. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        He was the town’s black eye and she 
                        was pure as the driven snow but as 
                        fate would have it they had found 
                        each other. 

           LATER

           Hunter sits in a dunking booth. Amy winds up and strikes the 
           target--he plunges into the water. Soaking wet, he climbs out 
           and bear hugs her. She screams.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        They had been going to the same 
                        school since the first grade but he 
                        had never noticed her. 

           LATER

           They strike various poses in a PHOTO BOOTH. The flash bulb 
           POPS.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Maybe he had readjusted his 
                        priorities. Maybe it was her timely 
                        growth spurt. Maybe she was just 
                        tired of playing by the rules. 

           LATER

           They make out at the top of the FERRIS-WHEEL.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Whatever it was, the girl who had 
                        once been invisible was now at the 
                        center of Hunter’s universe.

           HUNTER’S CAMARO--LATER

           Back lit by a low hanging MOON as it races down a coastal 
           road.

           Amy sits perched atop the HEAD REST, eyes closed and arms 
           flanked to the side for balance as the wind whips through her 
           hair.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        Hunter and I were just two kids, 
                        foolishly and helplessly in love.
           EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. ROLLERCOASTER. DAY

           Daniel and McKayla’s car climbs towards its apex. They squirm 
           with anticipation.

           At the peak there is a moment of overwhelming calm. They look 
           into eachother’s eyes and hold the gaze--laughing as the 
           rollercoaster catapults back down to earth.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Being around her left me dizzy. 
                        Weak. Weightless.

           EXT. MINI GOLD COURSE. NIGHT

           Daniel stands behind McKalya, arms wrapped around her 
           shoulders, teaching her how to putt.

           LATER

           They make out behind the WATER FALL on the 7th hole.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It was the little things--the 
                        imperfections that made her so 
                        perfect. Like her pigeon toes or 
                        the soft patch of peach fuzz under 
                        her bottom lip. 

           EXT. MCKAYLA’S HOUSE. ROAD. NIGHT

           Daniel’s car comes to a stop same place it did last time--100 
           yards short of the house.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why can’t I get any closer?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You don’t want to. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Why not?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Just trust me. Please.

           She hops out, provocatively strutting away in the SPOTLIGHT 
           of the cars’ headlamps.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Other imperfections were less 
                        visible.
           INT. MCKAYLA’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           She enters her bleak and lifeless home. The house is 
           completely dark save for the overly loud TV which pumps out 
           some tacky game show.

           Her FATHER sits on the sofa. His back is turned but the glow 
           from the TV silhouettes his figure. A few cans of cheap 
           domestic beer sit next to an over flowing ash tray.

           Without turning around, he GRUNTS. McKayla pauses.

                                 FATHER
                             (slightly slurring)
                        Where’ve ya been?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Out.

           She waits awhile for him to say more, but that was it. 

           ROOM

           She shakes a few pellets of food into Oliver’s FISH BOWL 
           which sits on bureau next to a FRAMED PICTURE of a WOMAN. The 
           woman has McKayla’s eyes. Her smile.

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (to picture)
                        I think you would’ve liked him.

           She flops onto her bed and stares up at the glow in the dark 
           stickers on her ceiling and smiles...something she hasn’t 
           done in a very long time.

           EXT. SAND DUNES. NIGHT

           They walk through a narrow path in the dunes that leads down 
           to a secluded stretch of beach.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        There are few things as powerful as 
                        first love. Or as scary.

           EXT. BEACH. NIGHT

           Waves gently ease ashore. A sensationally clear evening. They 
           lay on their backs, staring up at the twinkling stars. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It’s the punch to the gut kind of 
                        feeling you only get to experience 
                        once in life;

                        and I would wake up afraid every 
                        morning that it had all been just a 
                        dream.

           They look at each other.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And if there really was such thing 
                        as ‘forever’ I wanted to live in it 
                        with her. 

           LATER

           Hand in hand they sprint into the water while screaming at 
           the top of their lungs.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But as awesome and earth shattering 
                        as that feeling was I had found 
                        something that made me feel just as 
                        good.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. BASEMENT. DAY

           PAN across a table holding stack after stack of hard CASH. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I got Waltham. Half of Cambridge. 
                        My cousin out in Quincy. My guy out 
                        in Natick. Amherst. If Lawrence 
                        comes through that’s...

                                 HUNTER
                        Thirty-five pounds a week.

                          HUNTER
                                                         DANIEL
           Holy shit.
                                              Holy shit.

                                 DANIEL
                        What are you at?

           Hunter’s excitement quickly softens, realizing what he has to 
           say next...

                                 HUNTER
                             (flat)
                        Fifteen.

           An awkward silence. Neither boy knows what to say.

                                 DANIEL
                        We’re killin’ it, dude.
                                 HUNTER
                        Yeah...

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        For the first time in my life I was 
                        good at something. 

           INT. AUNT BARB’S HOUSE. DANIEL’S ROOM. DAY

           He stuffs cash into an empty CEREAL BOX and carries it to his 
           closet. He opens the door, the small closet is packed to the 
           gills--floor to ceiling with bulging cereal boxes. No room. 

           There’s a knock, Aunt Barb sticks her head in the room--
           Daniel freezes.

                                 AUNT BARB
                        McKayla’s on the phone.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’ll call her back.

                                 AUNT BARB
                        Second time she’s called.

                                 DANIEL
                        I said I’ll call her back.

           EXT. AUNT BARB’S HOUSE. UNDERNEATH DECK. MOMENT’S LATER

           On his back, in the cobb-webbed crawl space under the deck, 
           Daniel duct tapes the cereal box to the wood paneling above.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Really good.

           EXT. CHEVY AUTO DEALERSHIP. DAY

           Hunter and Daniel stand before a brand new ‘91 CHEVY 
           CORVETTE. A ‘SOLD’ sticker stuck proudly on the windshield.

                                 HUNTER
                        What are you gonna tell your mom?

                                 DANIEL
                             (coolly)
                        Oops. Didn’t think of that.

           Hunter chuckles. Daniel joins him.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Really, really good.

           LATER
           The car speeds out of the lot. Tires smoke and belch.

           MONTAGE

           HUNTER’S BASEMENT

           Hunter stuffs several shrink wrapped brick sized parcels of 
           marijuana into a duffle bag. Daniel takes the bag.

           EMPTY PARKING LOT

           Daniel hands the duffle bag to DEALER #1. Dealer #1 hands him 
           a bulging brown paper bag.

           SHOPPING MALL

           Daniel hands a duffle bag to DEALER #2. Dealer #2 slips him a 
           fat manila envelope.

           HIGHWAY REST STOP

           Daniel hands a duffle bag to his cousin Taylor. Taylor tosses 
           Daniel a back pack.

                                 TAYLOR
                        It wasn’t enough.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?

                                 TAYLOR
                        I need more. Like, a whole fucking 
                        lot more.

           HUNTER’S BACK DECK--NIGHT

           POP!

           Champagne spews into the air. Hunter douses a swarm of wild 
           partying teenagers.

           OCEAN

           Daniel and Hunter race SKI-DO’s along the coast. They hoot 
           and holler and laugh uncontrollably.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        And it was around this time that we 
                        both realized that life as it once 
                        was didn’t always have to be.
           INT. HUNTER’S CAMARO- STREET INTERSECTION. NIGHT

           Hunter’s making Amy laugh as they wait at a RED LIGHT when a 
           CAR full of DRUNKEN COLLEGE BOYS pulls up next to them.

           They begin to whistle at Amy. One of them flicks his tongue 
           at her. The light turns GREEN and the car speeds out--kicking 
           up exhaust and cutting Hunter off.

           Hunter’s jaw clenches tight. He JAMS the stick shift into 
           gear--about to punch the gas when Amy puts her hand on top of 
           his. 

           Their eyes meet. Her gaze is soft and sweet and for the first 
           time in Hunter’s life he decides to let it slide.

           EXT. THE LOBSTER POT SEA FOOD SHACK. DAY

           It’s one of those outdoor shack’s who's walls are decorated 
           with fishing nets and lobster buoys. The kind that serves 
           food on paper plates that you can smell from a mile out.  

           CLOSE ON a basket of bright red steaming hot CRABS as they’re 
           carried by a WAITRESS over to Daniel and Hunter.

           She places the basket down next to a heaping mound of 
           discarded crab shells and legs.

                                 DANIEL
                        I thought no pair of tits were 
                        worth the trouble.

                                 HUNTER
                        Neither did I but--I dunno, she’s 
                        funny as hell, she has a righteous 
                        ass--her hair always smells killer. 
                        God damn! She’s just so fuckin...--
                        I can’t explain it. It’s just one 
                        of those things, you know?

           Daniel shrugs, picks at a crab leg. No eye contact.

                                 DANIEL
                        Can’t say I do.

           Hunter holds his eyes on Daniel for just a beat too long. He 
           finds something about Daniel’s behavior just a tad peculiar.

                                 HUNTER
                        I swear you and Amy are like the 
                        only people in my life who take me 
                        for what I am. You get me, you 
                        know?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah.
           Hunter’s eye contact is severe. Does he know something?

                                 HUNTER
                        That’s all I ask. Don’t lie to me  
                        and don’t play me for a fool and 
                        we’re all good. ‘Don’t see why so 
                        many people have a problem with 
                        that.

                                 DANIEL
                             (looking down)
                        Yeah...

           There’s a long, uneasy pause. All that can be heard is sea 
           breeze and cracking shellfish.

                                 HUNTER
                        You hear about the fireworks?

           Daniel nearly chokes.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?

                                 HUNTER
                        Word is some summer bird walked up 
                        to my baby sister at the fireworks 
                        and kissed her on the mouth.

           The hair on Daniel’s neck stands. He clears his throat.

                                 DANIEL
                        Really? 

                                 HUNTER
                        Right in front of her pussy 
                        boyfriend. Crazy, right?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah...
                             (then)
                        Why do you let her go out with that 
                        guy anyway?

           There’s a pause. Hunter shrugs then delivers the next line 
           with a sense of hopelessness.

                                 HUNTER
                        You know what happens to someone 
                        like me if I touch someone like 
                        him?

           Daniel considers this.
                                 HUNTER
                             (re: the crabs)
                        Common we gotta ways to go. Time to 
                        man up.

           Hunter smiles and cracks open a claw. Daniel follows suit.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        We ate 36 pounds of crab that day 
                        and shattered the record which had 
                        been in place since 1972.

           LATER

           The MANAGER of the sea-food shack holds up the boys’ arms by 
           the wrist like a referee would the winning boxer of a fight.

           They both look queasy, about to burst, but manage to smile as-

           --SNAP the waitress takes a PHOTO. 

           The photo is tacked to the WALL under “CHAMPIONS”.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        He was the best friend I ever had. 
                        Hell, he was the only friend I’d 
                        ever had. 

           PUSH IN on the photo and their smiling faces.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And it was crushing me.

           EXT. DRIVE-IN DINER. DUSK

           Daniel’s new CORVETTE is parked at the far end of the lot. 
           Weed SMOKE curls up from the widows.

           A recent storm has cleared, leaving the sky looking like a 
           plate of melted plum sherbert. Crickets summon the looming 
           twilight.

           INT. DANIEL’S CORVETTE. DRIVE-IN DINER. SAME

           They share a banana split. Extra whip cream.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I wish I had a grandma that bought 
                        me Corvettes for graduation.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah, she’s a pretty cool for an 
                        old lady.
                                 MCKAYLA
                        She give you that lame-o haircut, 
                        too?

           Daniel self-consciously runs a hand through his hair. We’ll 
           notice it’s been cut in strikingly similar fashion to 
           Hunter’s.

                                 DANIEL
                             (playfully nudges her)
                        Shut up.

           She giggles. Then there’s a comfortable, thoughtful silence.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I love how it gets after a storm. 
                        The air’s so light. I feel like I 
                        could float.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I’m just really stoned.

           They giggle.

                                 DANIEL
                        I could get more. A bunch more.

           Her smile fades, the comment clearly made her uncomfortable.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?

           She dismisses it with a shake of her head.

                                 DANIEL
                        No, tell me. What is it?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Just reminds me of someone I used 
                        to know.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who?

           A beat.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        My brother. 

           Daniel’s intrigue grows. He racks his brain for a follow up 
           question.

                                 DANIEL
                        You said ‘used to know’?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I don’t talk to him anymore. 
                        Haven’t in a long time. 
           More silence.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You wanna ask what happened, don’t 
                        you?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah. But I won’t.

           She draws in a breath. Opening up isn’t easy for her.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        It was when my mom was really sick. 
                        She kept getting worse. And my 
                        brother, he was getting in 
                        trouble...selling drugs... Got 
                        kicked out of school and 
                        everything. My mom asked him to 
                        stop. Told him it’d mean the world 
                        to her if he did.
                             (beat)
                        But he didn’t.
                             (beat)
                        And then she died. 

           Her eyes water. Daniel’s eyes drop. She composes herself.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        He still comes by sometimes.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. MCKAYLA’S STREET. NIGHT

           Pitch black save for a set of RED BREAK LIGHTS several 
           hundred feet before us. The car idles alongside a mailbox. 

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        He leaves money. I know where it 
                        comes from...

           The SHADOWY FIGURE places a bulky ENVELOPE in the mailbox 
           then drives away, steam whirls from the exhaust pipe. 

           After the car is a safe distance, McKayla emerges onto the 
           road. She stares longingly at the car lights as they fade 
           into the night.

           FLASHBACK. INT. MCKAYLA’S BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER

           Balancing on her tip-toes atop a chair, she lifts a ceiling 
           panel and slides the ENVELOPE up into the ATTIC.

           ATTIC

           From up here we see the DOZENS of ENVELOPES that have 
           accumulated over time.
                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        I can’t use it. I just can’t.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (shrugs)
                        It is what it is.

           They’re talking about two different things.

           The conversation has darkened and they both feel it. She 
           quickly lightens the mood by flicking a spoonful of whip 
           cream onto his face. He flicks some back. They both laugh.

           A WAITRESS skates up to the car window, CHECK in hand.

                                 WAITRESS
                        So, how will you be settling the 
                        bill tonight?

           Daniel opens his wallet, careful to hide the wad of dirty 
           drug money within. He takes out a $5, and hands it over--at 
           this point he’s completely crushed by the guilt.

                                 DANIEL
                        Cash.

           EXT. SPRAWLING OPEN MEADOW. LATE AFTERNOON

           Half eaten deli sandwiches and cans of Cola strewn across a 
           blanket.

           Daniel and Mckayla lie on their backs under a willow tree. 
           They stare up at dark THUNDERCLOUDS which threaten to break 
           open.

                                 DANIEL
                        If I could be anything? Oh, I 
                        dunno..Mick Jagger maybe.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You’d need lip injections first.

                                 DANIEL
                        True.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        What else?

                                 DANIEL
                             (after a thoughtful pause)
                        My dad.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANIEL (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        Yeah. I’d be like my dad.

           There’s a lull where both teenagers reflect on their 
           respective fathers. Good, bad or otherwise.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Deep.

                                 DANIEL
                        I guess. 
                             (beat)
                        What about you?

           She shrugs as if she’s concealing something.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I dunno.

                                 DANIEL
                        Common, what is it?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        It’s stupid.

                                 DANIEL
                        I promise I won’t laugh.

           McKayla takes a beat to decide if she trusts him.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        A writer. Like poetry and stuff.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Fuck you.

                                 DANIEL
                        No, it’s just...I thought you hated 
                        reading.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        That’s because I always hate the 
                        writing.

           Daniel smiles, point taken. She takes the smile as mockery, 
           gets embarrassed and quickly turns defensive.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Whatever, this game’s dumb. I’m 
                        pretty sure I know how my story 
                        ends.

           The comment throws him--Daniel sits up.
                                 DANIEL
                        What’re you talking about?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I’ve never left before.

                                 DANIEL
                        Left what?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        This stupid fucking island. If it 
                        wasn’t for TV I couldn’t tell you 
                        what the world looked like on the 
                        other side of that bridge.

                                 DANIEL
                        So?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        So look around. Look where I’m 
                        from. People come into this town 
                        for the summer and then they leave 
                        and the ones who stay...well they 
                        don’t go anywhere. If you’re smart--
                        or lucky--you hitch a ride out with 
                        one of those summer birds.

                                 DANIEL
                        How could you say that? Don’t say 
                        that.

           Daniel pulls her by the arm so she sits up. He looks her 
           square in the eye.

                                 DANIEL
                        Look at me. If you want to be a 
                        writer than that’s what you’ll be. 
                        I promise.
                             (smiles)
                        So you can go ahead and rewrite 
                        that sad ending of yours.

           She smiles back. Transpierced.

           A flash of LIGHTNING scatters across the sky. Thunder BOOMS. 
           Mackayla screams. Daniel jumps to his feet and takes her by 
           the hand.

           Rain breaks from the sky. They dash through the meadow, hand 
           in hand, shrieking and laughing hysterically. 

           They reach his car, frantically pull open the doors and crawl 
           inside.

           CORVETTE
           The downpour, severe. The car, quiet. Only sound comes from 
           the rain beating on the roof and their panting breath.

           They start kissing. Tender at first but with building 
           intensity. Wet clothes peel off wet skin. Windows fog.

           DING... DING... DING... HAIL STONES pummel the roof, the 
           hood, the windshield. Rapid. Violent. Ecstacy to the ears.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        She smelled like Marlbolo Light’s 
                        and vanilla lotion.

                                 DANIEL
                        I, um...I’ve never...before...

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Me neither.

           He didn’t see that coming. LIGHTNING cracks--illuminating the 
           goosebumps rippling across their skin. 

           She pulls back--

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I mean...I’ve never wanted 
                        to...before...

           Her vulnerability washes over him. His jaw slackens. She 
           pulls him on top of her. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        But there were problems to come. 
                        One of which just so happened to be 
                        unfolding across town that very 
                        evening.

           EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATER. NIGHT

           It’s the same theater where Daniel and McKayla met.

           Terminator II is on the screen and Hunter and Amy share a box 
           of candy as they watch from his convertible.

           CRACK!

           A gigantic flash of LIGHTNING radiates across the sky. 
           Everyone screams. Rain pours down into Hunter’s car.

           He cuts on the engine and slams on the gas.

           EXT. AMY’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Hunter’s Camaro is parked a few driveways down. The rain is 
           still coming but the top’s up. They make out feverishly.
                                 HUNTER
                             (playfully fighting her 
                              off)
                        You gotta go.

                                 AMY
                        No.

           She kisses him again.

                                 HUNTER
                        I don’t want you gettin’ in 
                        trouble, c’mon.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, okay.

           She opens the door.

                                 HUNTER
                        Wait.

           He grabs her arm, pulls her back and they kiss again.

                                 HUNTER
                        Okay.

           She begins to leave then turns back and kisses him.

                                 HUNTER
                        Call ya when I get home.

                                 AMY
                        You can’t, remember? 

           He punches the steering wheel.

                                 HUNTER
                        God, this is so stupid.

                                 AMY
                        I know. How long’s it take you to 
                        get home?

                                 HUNTER
                             (shrugs)
                        Like fifteen.

                                 AMY
                        ‘Kay. I’ll call you in sixteen.

           They kiss once more and she hops out of the car and into the 
           storm.
           INT. SHERIFF CALHOUN’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

           Calhoun and his WIFE sit on the couch watching T.V. Out the 
           window Calhoun sees Hunter’s CAMARO whip down the street.

           Calhoun has a thought. A troubling one. He gets up from the 
           sofa.

           OUTSIDE

           Amy dashes across her lawn. Through the hail. Past an old 
           tire swing.

           INSIDE

           Calhoun stalks down the hall way. Past family portraits.

           OUTSIDE

           Amy scales the vine fence onto the roof of the garage. Opens 
           her window.

           INSIDE

           Calhoun ascends the stairs, opens Amy’s door to find--

           AMY’S BEDROOM

           --her laying in bed, in her pajamas, towel wrapped around her 
           head to conceal wet hair. She’s reading SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE. 

                                 AMY
                        Hey, Daddy.

           He squints, shooting her a dubious glare.

                                 AMY
                        Hearing things again?

                                 CALHOUN
                        You been up here the whole night?

                                 AMY
                        Where else would I be?

           After a beat his glare softens.

                                 CALHOUN
                        You should turn in soon. We have 
                        church in the morning.

                                 AMY
                        Okay, Daddy.

                                 CALHOUN
                        G’night, sweetheart.
                                 AMY
                        G’night.

           He closes the door, she rolls onto her back, smirking 
           blissfully towards the heavens. Ah, young love.

           HALLWAY

           Calhoun turns away. He’s no fool and after twenty years of 
           police work he’s developed a sixth sense for bullshit.

           PUSH IN on his dark, smoldering eyes.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And as they say, trouble comes in 
                        bunches.

           INT. ARCADE. NIGHT

           It’s a dark room with a sticky floor and the unmistakable 
           stench of bubble gum and body odor. Daniel and McKayla play 
           STREET FIGHTER II.

                                 DANIEL
                        Wow. I’m kicking your ass. I 
                        thought you said you were good.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Shut up. You put codes in.

                                 DANIEL
                        Did not.

           She slaps the joy stick out of his hand. They both start 
           LAUGHING.

                                 DANIEL
                        You dirty cheater.

           He puts the final touches on her fighter--knocking him out. 
           The 20 second TICKER begins to count down to game over.

                                 DANIEL
                        Go get more coins. Hurry!

           She sprints around the corner leaving Daniel alone.

                                 HUNTER (O.S.)
                        Danny boy!

           Daniel spins to find Hunter and Amy, arm in arm, walking into 
           the arcade. His eyes begin an immediate and frantic search 
           for McKayla. She’s nowhere to be found.

                                 HUNTER
                        What are ya doin’ here?
                                 DANIEL
                        I’m just...what are you doing here?
                             (indicating Amy)
                         Is this, uh..

                                 HUNTER
                        Danny, Amy, Amy, Danny.

                                 AMY
                        Hi.

           Daniel offers a back a weak smile. 

                                 HUNTER
                             (pinches Amy’s chin)
                        Cute, isn’t she?

           Just then, McKayla rounds the corner and the oxygen is sucked 
           from the room. She stops in her tracks.

           She and Hunter exchange the uncomfortable glare that exists 
           only between those with a fragile and complicated history.

                                 HUNTER
                        What is this?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        What is what?

           At this point Daniel’s brain has ceased to operate but 
           McKayla poise is unrattled. She’s yet to look Daniel’s way.

                                 HUNTER
                        You know each other?

           McKayla looks slowly over at Daniel as if seeing him for the 
           first time. Her eyes searching for recognition....

           He stares back, not able to figure her out.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Mmmmm. Nope. Sorry have we met?

           Daniel gently shakes his head, no. Mckayla turns her 
           attention back to Hunter and shrugs, remaining both wary and 
           defiant. Hunter squints. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Since when do you go to the arcade?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I don’t. Okie was supposed to pick 
                        me up from the mall at six but 
                        never showed and I needed quarters 
                        to call her.
           She rattles the QUARTERS in her palm. It’s terrifying just 
           how convincing she is. 

           Poor Amy hasn’t said a word but the unnerving tension has 
           left her anxiously twisting her french braid.

           Hunter trades glances between Daniel and his sister and 
           decides he’ll take her at her word.

                                 HUNTER
                        How’s dad?

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (shrugs)
                        He’s dad.

                                 HUNTER
                        You been getting the mail?

           McKayla shoots a self conscious glance at Daniel before 
           gently nodding her head. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Good. 

           More heavy silence filled only by the arcade’s ambient sound.

                                 HUNTER
                        Well, at least let me give you a 
                        lift home.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I’ll walk.

           The level of tension reaches it’s pinnacle here as Daniel and 
           Amy helplessly watch the heavyweight stare down.

           After a beat McKayla brushes past Hunter on her way out of 
           the arcade. As she exits she turns back around to Daniel...

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Nice meeting you.

           With that she’s gone, leaving Daniel, Hunter and Amy shell 
           shocked on the arcade floor.

           INT. DANIEL’S CORVETTE--MOVING. DUSK

           Up ahead he sees McKayla walking alone on the side of the 
           road. He slows and pulls up alongside her. She climbs in.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why’d you do that back there?

           There’s a long pause... 
           When she finally speaks her voice is nothing more than a 
           hollow whisper but it’s filled with worry.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        How do you know my brother?

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t really. Met him at a party 
                        once.

           She goes quiet. Unsure if she believes him.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You know what he does?

                                 DANIEL
                        No. 

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You know anything about him?

                                 DANIEL
                        No, not really.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        If you did you’d understand why I 
                        had to do that.

           There’s a very long and very uncomfortable silence in which 
           each simply listens to the other’s breath.

           She SIGHS heavily, shakes her head, then says...

                                 MCKAYLA
                        He’s gonna kill you.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. GARAGE. DAY.

           Daniel enters hastily through the side door.

                                 DANIEL
                             (hurried)
                        Is it packed up, ‘cus I gotta--

           He notices Hunter sitting on a work bench, his hands curled 
           into fists. A perturbed scowl on his face.

                                 DANIEL
                        ...hit the road...

           Daniel slows, then proceeds with caution.

                                 DANIEL
                        You alright, man?
           No response from Hunter. His eyes fixed on a HAMMER resting 
           on the shelf. Then, finally, through gritted teeth:

                                 HUNTER
                        Like she don’t even know me.

           He stands. Daniel’s worried eye’s follow him. Wary.

                                 HUNTER
                        After all I’ve done for her. She 
                        looks at me like she don’t even 
                        know who I am.
                             (he turns; locks eyes)
                        You know what that feels like?

           Daniel swallows, shakes his head, no. There’s a pause...

           Then Hunter lets go a wretched primal SCREAM and PUNCHES a 
           hole clear through the wall. Chunks of dry-wall crumble onto 
           the ground. Daniel flinches. Never taking his eyes away.

                                 HUNTER
                        It’s getting dark.

           And with that Hunter leaves the garage.

           INT/EXT. DANIEL’S CORVETTE--MOVING--LAWRENCE STREETS. DUSK

           Lawrence is an old mill town whose best years are two 
           generations in the rearview and Daniel’s shiny car and fair 
           complexion are at odds with his surroundings.

           He pops TWO CAFFEINE PILLS into his mouth and we notice the 
           dark rings growing underneath his eyes.

           He pulls outside a track of ROW HOMES.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It was the last drop of the day. I 
                        hated going there but at ten pounds 
                        a week the ends justified the 
                        means.

           Resting on the passenger seat is a BLACK DUFFLE BAG. He grabs  
           the bag, but right before he opens the car door something 
           snags his attention.

           Parked on a perpendicular street is what appears to be an 
           unmarked police cruiser. CROWN VIC. Tinted windows. 

           Daniel pauses. His eyes move between the Crown Vic and the 
           ROW HOME. A stake out? An ambush? Worse?

           Decision made. He starts the engine up and casually drives 
           away. At the stop sign he nonchalantly glances at the Crown 
           Vic then turns right, in the opposite direction.
           HEADLIGHTS on the Crown Vic flicker on and it pulls out 
           behind him. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Motherf....

           Daniel turns onto a busier road. The crown vic follows. Calm 
           and steady, two mph under the speed limit to be safe.

           Ahead lies a MCDONALD’S. Daniel pulls into the parking lot 
           and parks. The Crown Vic follows, parking at the lot’s far 
           end.

           Daniel grabs the duffle bag, exits the car and marches 
           evenly, head down, into the restaurant.

           INSIDE

           His pace quickens, fear betraying him. He knocks a customer 
           out of the way, shoving open the BATHROOM DOOR.

           BATHROOM

           Kicks open a stall. From the duffle bag he pulls out a brick 
           of marijuana, shrink wrapped in plastic. In a mad frenzy now, 
           frantically trying to rip it open--fingers aren’t strong 
           enough--no nails.

                                 DANIEL
                        Fuck!

           He tears at it violently with his TEETH.

           The bag finally gives and he dumps the contents into the 
           toilet. Followed by another. Then another. And another.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I flushed ten pounds or twelve 
                        thousand dollars worth of pot down 
                        that toilet.

           MAIN RESTURANT--LATER

           Daniel emerges from the bathroom looking worn. Empty duffle 
           bag dangling limply from one hand. He approaches the front 
           door, pauses and takes a deep breath. Ready to be tackled, 
           pepper-sprayed--the whole nine.

           He pushes the doors open and emerges into the--

           PARKING LOT

           Braces for impact...but nothing happens.
           The Crown Vic is gone. He looks to his right, nothing. To his 
           left, nothing. A sickening wave of dread crashes over him.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And as Sheriff Calhoun had warned, 
                        the world felt like it was folding 
                        in.

           EXT. STRIP MALL. PARKING LOT. DAY

           Daniel and Hunter wait on the curb outside a hole in the wall 
           Chinese restaurant. Daniel runs his fingers along his scalp, 
           a pile of smoldering cigarette butts sit at Hunter’s feet.

                                 HUNTER
                        It looked like a cop or it was a 
                        cop?

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know.

                                 HUNTER
                        What do you mean you don’t know?

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know! I don’t fuckin know, 
                        okay! How many times do I have to 
                        explain this to you?

                                 HUNTER
                        I’m not the one you should be 
                        worried about explaining it to.

           A grim silence. Neither boy can stand to look at the other. 

                                 HUNTER
                        You have the cash to cover it?

           Daniel looks down, remains quiet.

                                 HUNTER
                        You just had to get that fucking 
                        car, didn’t you.

           Just then Dex’s Black Van pulls into the parking lot.

                                 HUNTER
                        Let me do the talking.

           The Van pulls dangerously close to them. Window rolls down.

                                 HUNTER
                        Listen, this whole thing--

                                 DEX
                        Shut your mouth.
           Hunter goes quiet. Grits his teeth.

                                 DEX
                        He wants to talk.

                                 DANIEL
                        Who?

                                 DEX
                        You know who.

           A cold sweat breaks from Daniel’s brow as this realization 
           lands.

                                 DANIEL
                             (to Hunter)
                        Okay...well I’m sure we can expl--

                                 DEX
                        To you. Just you. Alone.

                                 DANIEL
                        What?!

                                 DEX
                        Be here tomorrow. Same time. I’ll 
                        take you up. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Wait! Wait a second. Take me up 
                        where?

           Dex nods as if to say “you know where”.

                                 DANIEL
                        In person? Why does he need to see 
                        me in person? 

           Dex rolls up the Van window.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hey! Why does he need to see me in 
                        person? What does he want?!

           Dex glares at Daniel. Deep. Piercing. The steely and macabre 
           glare reserved for assassins and war generals.

           Daniel opens his mouth to respond but can’t find the words. 
           The Van screeches out, kicking dust into his face.

           He looks at Hunter, desperate for some sort of calming 
           reassurance.

                                 HUNTER
                        You fucked it up. Now handle it.

           Daniel pitches forward and VOMITS onto his shoes.
           EXT. BEACH. NIGHT

           Bonfire on the beach. Steph, Okie and several other TEENAGERS 
           laugh and drink around a boom box. Off to the side, just out 
           of the flame’s glow, sit Daniel and McKayla.

           His worried eyes watch the fire. She looks at him, concerned.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Is there something you wanna tell 
                        me?

           He shakes from his trance and lays his head down in her lap. 
           He wants to tell her everything...

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        You swear?

           Fire crackles. Waves crash. Laughter in the distance.

                                 DANIEL
                        I swear.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        I remember thinking it could be the 
                        last time I ever saw her.

           INT. DANIEL’S BED ROOM. NIGHT

           He lays in bed. Wide awake. Tears flow down his cheeks.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And for some reason, that night the 
                        grief from my father’s death came 
                        crashing down and I cried harder 
                        than I ever had before.

           TIME LAPSE: The moon falls, the sun rises and the tide of the 
           dawn’s light passes over his face. He hasn’t slept a wink.

           Alarm clock buzzes. Daniel slowly swings his legs out of bed.

           INT. DEX’S BLACK VAN. DAY

           Nobody speaks. From the back seat, Daniel watches as suburbia 
           fades into countryside. Houses become barns. Lawns become 
           fields. Cars into tractors and stores into corn stands.

           An ‘ENTERING NEW YORK’ sign. But this isn’t the New York 
           we’re used to. This is farm country. 

           LATER
           The Van trudges down a painfully long dirt road at the end of 
           which sits a lowly FARM HOUSE. It’s quaint and homey--an 
           antique from simpler times, but despite it’s rustic charm a 
           malevolent aura lurks. 

           On the PORCH sits a MAN (50’s) swaying in a rocking chair.

           Caught somewhere between a roughneck and an economics 
           professor who’s lost his way in life; he has a cerebral mind 
           tucked under the rugged guise of a Sam Peckinpah protagonist.

           He wears Chuck Taylors and has the sleeves of his Henley 
           rolled just high enough to let the forearm tattoos breathe. 

           We’ll never learn his name so for now BOSS MAN will have to 
           do.

           INSIDE THE VAN

           Dex cranes his head towards the back seat to address Daniel.

                                 DEX
                        He’s going to ask you some 
                        questions. If you lie he’ll be able 
                        to tell. If you don’t know what the 
                        answer is don’t bullshit, just say 
                        “I don’t know how to answer that”. 
                        Got it?

                                 DANIEL
                        What’s his name?

           Dex looks at the Driver then back at Daniel.

                                 DEX
                        Mind your fucking business. That’s 
                        his name.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Daniel exits the Van and walks up the porch steps. Boss Man 
           drinks him in through opaque eyes.

           PORCH

                                 BOSS MAN
                        Sit.

           Daniel takes a seat on a wicker chair. Boss Man stares at 
           him. Daniel tries to stare back but his eyes can’t hold.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        You have some sort of idea what 
                        you’re doing here?

           Daniel opens his mouth to answer.
                                 BOSS MAN
                        No, you don’t. You don’t have the 
                        slightest cocksucking clue.

           Boss Man pours himself a glass of ICE TEA from a nearby 
           pitcher.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        You know what it is that I do?

           Again Daniel opens his mouth to answer.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        No, you don’t. Nobody does and it’s 
                        why I’m still here.
                             (admires the glass of tea)
                        Drinking this lemony tea...

           He hands the glass to Daniel.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        Here. I made it myself.

           Weary hands take the glass. Daniel studies it. The beading 
           condensation. The floating lemon wedge. He takes a sip. 

           Winces. Had to have been bitter.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        How is it?

           Daniel swallows.

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know how to answer that.

           Boss Man smiles. He likes him.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        Let’s take a walk.

           PUMPKIN ORCHARD

           They stroll through a secluded edge of the farm. Late day 
           sunlight bleeds through the trees.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        What you did out there in Lawrence 
                        was the right thing to do. 

           Boss Man approaches a nearby tractor and casually lifts a 
           PUMP ACTION REMINGTON 870 off the seat. He cocks it.       
           The blood leaves Daniel’s face.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        The ten pounds...
                             (shrugs)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOSS MAN (CONT'D)
                        Cost of doing business. I can live 
                        without them. What I can’t live 
                        with is you getting caught.

           BANG! Boss Man blasts a PUMPKIN to smithereens.

           Daniel flinches.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        That, I can’t live with.

           Daniel looks around for Dex, the Van, anything, but he’s all 
           alone.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        It’s not for just anyone, 
                        this...line of work. Takes a 
                        certain kind of grit. A certain 
                        tenacity. Seems like you might just 
                        got it, would you agree?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yessir. I think so.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        You tell me right now that you want 
                        out and I’ll think no less of you. 
                        But if you agree to be part of this 
                        then you’ll be part of this. You 
                        understand?

           Daniel nods.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        So what’s it going to be?

                                 DANIEL
                        I want to be part of it.

           Boss Man nods. Cocks the shotgun.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        Good.

           BANG. Another pumpkin. Another flinch.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        The young man who’s head was caved 
                        in down in Alston--he’s been 
                        looking for you.

                                 DANIEL
                        That wasn’t--how’d you even...
                                 BOSS MAN
                        Sooner or later he’s going to find 
                        you and he’s going to return the 
                        favor. Unless of course I see that 
                        he doesn’t. Would you like me to 
                        stop him?

                                 DANIEL
                        How, uh...how do you stop--

                                 BOSS MAN
                        It’s a simple question, son. Would 
                        you like me to stop him or not?

           Daniel swallows.

                                 DANIEL
                        Okay.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        Very good. One last thing...

           BANG. Another pumpkin. Another flinch.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        That partner of yours...

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes?

                                 BOSS MAN
                        Get rid of him.

                                 DANIEL
                        Get rid of him? Why?

                                 BOSS MAN
                        You’re bringing in a considerable 
                        amount more than him, am I wrong?

           Daniel considers. It’s true.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        More than twice as much if I have 
                        my numbers right. If it wasn’t for 
                        you he’d still be slinging ten 
                        dollar bags to tourists. All you’ve 
                        gotten out of him is a target on 
                        your head.

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know, sir... he’s...

                                 BOSS MAN
                        A friend of yours?
                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah. A good friend.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        I had a friend once, too. I don’t 
                        need to tell you what happened.

           Boss Man stops walking, turns to Daniel and places a hand on 
           his shoulder. Looks him square in the eye.

                                 BOSS MAN
                        You gotta ask yourself...when the 
                        day comes that your life plays out 
                        before your eyes will you be proud 
                        of what you see?

           On Daniel, deciding...

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. GARAGE. DAY

           Hunter lays on a CREEPER which is rolled UNDERNEATH the body 
           of his CAMARO. Daniel stands by his feet. 

           HENDRIX blares from a nearby stereo.

                                 DANIEL
                             (straining over music)
                        So it’s cool because you won’t have 
                        to worry about anything anymore. 

           No response.

                                 DANIEL
                             (louder)
                        I’ll deal with all the heavy 
                        lifting and you’re like the big 
                        boss behind the scenes.

           Still no response. Daniel turns down the volume on the 
           stereo.

                                 DANIEL
                        Less customers, less risk, just 
                        like you wanted.

                                 HUNTER
                        You mean just like you wanted.

           A pang of guilt knocks Daniel’s eyes to the floor. There’s a 
           stiff silence as Daniel racks his brain for something to say.

                                 HUNTER
                        Hand me the toolbox on the shelf.
           Daniel sighs, agitated with the direction of the 
           conversation. He scans the utility shelves behind him for the 
           tool box.

           Once spotted, he goes to grab it but something else catches 
           his eye... 

           Next to the tool box is a RAG which is draped over a PISTOL--
           the handle sticks out plainly. Almost blatantly.

           Troubled eyes rest on the pistol for a moment, then Daniel 
           pulls down the tool box and slides it to Hunter.

                                 DANIEL
                        You’re not going anywhere, man. 
                        We’re still partners. It’ll just be 
                        a little different.

           Silence.

                                 DANIEL
                        Hunt, what do ya say?

           After a few moments...

                                 DANIEL
                        Hunter?

                                 HUNTER
                        Turn the music back up, would ya?

           Daniel cringes. Sick inside.... BEEP. BEEP. Daniel looks down 
           at his hip. His Beeper is going off.

           He checks it, then turns the volume back up on the stereo and 
           walks out of the garage.

           Once alone, Hunter wheels out from under the car. There’s a 
           reason he was hidden under there--his face is a twisted knot 
           of worry. 

           His eyes move towards the BEEPER on his hip. The screen 
           reads: 0 NEW MESSAGES. He chucks it into a wall. It smashes 
           into pieces.

           INT. AUNT BARB’S HOUSE. DANIEL’S ROOM. DAY

           Daniel lays on his bed, eyes on the ceiling, deep in thought.

           LATER

           Daniel scans through a PRINCETON REVIEW BOOK. He tallies up 
           numbers on a piece of scrap paper. 
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        The average starting salary for a 
                        college graduate in 1991 was around 
                        30,000 dollars. With the new deal I 
                        was clearing that in a week.

           LATER

           Daniel is now on the PHONE.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Fifteen minutes after I did the 
                        math I called up Fitchburg State 
                        and withdrew my admission. Problem 
                        was the admin. office sent an 
                        official letter of withdrawal to my 
                        residence. 

           EXT. SAGAMORE BRIGE. DAY

           Daniel’s Corvette races across the brige towards the 
           mainland.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I drove home to Leominster every 
                        day for two weeks to intercept it.

           EXT. DANIEL’S HOUSE. LEOMINSTER. DAY

           Standing in front of the mailbox, Daniel sifts through a 
           stack of envelopes. Bills. Coupons. CC statements. 

           He stuffs the letter in is pocket and flips the lid closed 
           just as--

           --his Mother pulls up in her car.

                                 MOTHER
                        Daniel?

           She parks and quickly hops out of her car.

                                 MOTHER
                        Heavens, I didn’t recognize you 
                        near that race car. Who’s is that?

                                 DANIEL
                        Just borrowing it from a friend.

                                 MOTHER
                        Must be a good friend.

           There’s a beat of awkward silence.
                                 MOTHER
                        Well you look just great.

                                 DANIEL
                        Thanks, ma.

           They hug.

                                 MOTHER
                        Come in, let me fix you some 
                        supper.

                                 DANIEL
                        I gotta go.

                                 MOTHER
                        Don’t be silly. Just for a bit. I 
                        haven’t seen you in...what’s it 
                        been--months?

                                 DANIEL
                        I really gotta run. I got a date 
                        tonight with a girl. A real one.

           She smiles, bittersweet. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Okay...

           He kisses her on the cheek and climbs into his car. She 
           watches him back away, a sadness around her. Then she 
           remembers something.

                                 MOTHER
                             (shouting after him)
                        Oh! Daniel. Daniel! There’s--

           Daniel shouts back through a rolled down window.

                                 DANIEL
                        Ma, I really can’t talk right now.

                                 MOTHER
                        But there’s--

                                 DANIEL
                        I’ll call you.

           He reverses out of the drive way and pulls away. She watches 
           him to the end of the street. Tears welling in her eyes.

                                 MOTHER
                             (to herself; sad)
                        There’s a storm heading your way...

           Hold on her frail body standing in the drive way.
                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It would be the last time I ever 
                        saw her.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN. ARIEL VIEW. DAY

           Silence.

           A breath taking view as we soar high above the sprawling 
           expanse of a massive hurricane. Thick clouds ripple and 
           spiral, forming peaks and canyons that roll on forever.

           Sporadic flashes of lightening down below illuminate dark 
           pockets. From up here they are nothing more than tiny muffled 
           purple strobes.

           We fly over mile after mile of the storm, feverishly building 
           momentum until we reach its vortex--a depression sunk in a 
           wall of towering thunderstorms--and all goes still.

           Float there, gazing down into the eye of the beast, clear and 
           calm--the ocean surface swells thousands of feet below--the 
           simple beauty of it is beyond words.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Hunter and Amy lay asleep in his bed. The soft glow from the 
           TV flickers against their naked bodies.

           The NEWS plays on TV.

           GRAINY STOCK FOOTAGE:

           A WEATHER MAN indicates a storm cell out over the Atlantic.

                                 WEATHER MAN
                        ...right now it’s about 300 miles 
                        to the east, southeast of North 
                        Carolina and moving northward. 
                        Again, it appears from the 
                        satellite indication that we have a 
                        rapidly strengthening storm system 
                        on our hands...

           Amy stirs then abruptly sits up, realizing she had 
           accidentally fallen asleep. She checks a bed side clock.

                                 AMY
                        Oh my Gosh! Hunter wake up--we 
                        gotta go!

           EXT. OUTSIDE AMY’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Hunter’s car screeches to a stop. Amy hops out--
           LAWN

           --and dashes across the lawn, past the old tire swing and--

                                 CALHOUN (O.S.)
                        Why are you doing this, Amy?

           Amy SCREAMS--nearly leaping out of her skin. She whips around 
           to find Calhoun sitting in a chair on the back porch.

                                 AMY
                        Daddy! My gosh, you scared me.

           Her comment is met by stale silence. Calhoun stares back--
           eyes darkened by the shadows. 

                                 AMY
                        You see Sarah’s new car?

           Long pause. Crickets and owls.

                                 CALHOUN
                        Of all the boys in this town.

           She’s caught. The consummate Daddy’s girl-- but tonight she’s 
           love drunk and at some point even the most obedient children 
           must defy their parents.

                                 AMY
                        He’s not what everyone says he is.

                                 CALHOUN
                        He’s no good, sweetheart, and I 
                        won’t have him around you.

                                 AMY
                        You don’t know him, Daddy.

                                 CALHOUN
                        You’re not to see the boy, you 
                        understand?

                                 AMY
                        You can’t do that!

                                 CALHOUN
                        I can, Amy. And I’m going to.

                                 AMY
                        I’m in love with him and there’s 
                        nothing you can do about it!

           She runs into the house and SLAMS the door, leaving Calhoun 
           standing alone in the shadows. Silently brooding.
           EXT. SUMMER COTTAGE. DAY

           PUSH across the lawn and towards the front door of this 
           picturesque vacation home.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Theoretically speaking everything 
                        can be traced back to the beginning 
                        of time--but for the sake of this 
                        following case a nine year old boy 
                        is as far back as we’ll go.

           A BOY (9) busts out of the front door wielding a BASEBALL BAT 
           and glove. He sprints down the driveway.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        His name was--

           His MOTHER steps out from the front door.

                                 MOTHER
                        Thomas William Scott, you’re to be 
                        home at six o’clock and not a 
                        minute after!

           FREEZE FRAME on his gap-toothed grin.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Tommy’s father had made a killing 
                        on Wall Street throughout the 
                        eighty's. Up to that point The 
                        Hampton’s had been their go to 
                        vacation spot, but due to the 
                        recent recession belts had to be 
                        tightened and Cape Cod became the 
                        new summer nest. 

           Unfreeze. Tommy bolts down the street.

           LATER-- FRIEND’S BACK YARD

           TOMMY and a FRIEND (9) play baseball in the friend’s 
           BACKYARD. The friend winds up and chucks a fastball, Tommy 
           swings and connects. CRACK!

           The line drive tears across the street and slams into the 
           TAIL LIGHT of a late model Mercedes. The light SHATTERS.

           For a second the boy’s stand there in shock, then Tommy drops 
           the bat and high tails it home.

           LATER--DRIVEWAY

           We’re in the driveway with the car, staring at it’s broken 
           tail light. In the background two FIGURES exit the house and 
           approach the car.
           It’s Blake and Myles, the preppy black teenagers we met 
           earlier.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Roughly twenty minutes later, Blake 
                        and Myles Abernathy climbed into 
                        their parents car, without noticing 
                        the light, and drove it onto the 
                        mainland.

           The boys get in and drive off.

           INT. MARTHA’S VINYARD FERRY. DAY

           Track along the parked cars in the ferry’s underbelly until 
           we stop on the Mercedes and it’s broken tail light.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        A place they never go. But it just 
                        so happened to be ‘All You Can Eat 
                        Night’ at The Lobster Pot. And it 
                        was enough to lure them away from 
                        the comforts of Martha’s Vineyard.

           EXT. THE LOBSTER POT SEA FOOD SHACK. DAY

           The late model Mercedes pulls into the lot--right past a 
           parked POLICE CRUISER--and winds all the way to the back.

           Meanwhile, Calhoun spits the last of a shrimp tail into a 
           pile of discarded shells, throws a tip down on the table and 
           gets up to leave.

           He’s 90% of the way back to his cruiser when he just so 
           happens to glance over at the Mercedes parked in the back of 
           the lot. 

           He sees the broken tail light and squints suspiciously.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        It was the tail light that Tommy 
                        Scott had broken that got Calhoun’s 
                        attention.

           Calhoun beings towards the Mercedes.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And what started out as a routine 
                        violation ended up as more than 
                        anyone could have expected.

           INT. MERCEDES. CONTINUOUS.

           Blake and Myles are smoking a JOINT.
                                 BLAKE
                        No, man, you only use one finger.

           He makes a circular motion with his index finger.

                                 BLAKE
                        Like this. It’s like a little 
                        button, near the top. She’ll go 
                        crazy.

                                 MYLES
                        Wait--

                                 BLAKE
                        Yeah, like out of her mind crazy.

                                 MYLES
                        Wait, no, I’m saying--it’s near the 
                        top?

                                 BLAKE
                        Yeah, dude. Common.

                                 MYLES
                        Shit. That makes sense now...

           KNOCK KNOCK. 

           They startle, then snap around to find Sheriff Calhoun 
           outside the car, his badge gleaming in the sunlight.

                                 CALHOUN
                        You boys can go to jail or you can 
                        go home. It’s up to you.

           Gulp.

           LATER

           Calhoun interrogates the two terrified boys outside of his 
           cruiser which is parked near the front of the Lobster Pot. 
           Rubber neckers gawk from nearby picnic tables.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Sheriff Calhoun did what he does 
                        best--he scared the living snot out 
                        of those boys--but they had nothing 
                        to give.

                                 CALHOUN
                        Mom and Dad know of your 
                        whereabouts?

                                 BLAKE
                        Yessir.

           Calhoun holds up a small baggie of weed.
                                 CALHOUN
                        I’m bettin’ they don’t know about 
                        this, now do they?

                                 MYLES
                             (barley audible)
                        No sir.

                                 CALHOUN
                        Say it again.

                                 MYLES
                             (louder)
                        No sir.

                                 CALHOUN
                        And I’ll give you one chance to 
                        keep it that way.

                                 BLAKE
                        I told you, sir, we don’t know 
                        their names.

                                 MYLES
                        They never told us. 

                                 BLAKE
                        We swear.

           Calhoun stares angrily at the boys--sees he’s getting nowhere-
           -and dramatically pulls a pair of handcuffs from his belt.

                                 CALHOUN
                        Well then, looks like you’re shit 
                        out of luck.

           Myles starts to cry. They turn around--hands behind their 
           backs--waiting to be arrested.

                                 BLAKE
                        Please, God. Help us.

           Just then Myles’ crying subdues then stops all together. 
           Blake looks to his brother and sees his teary eyes fixated on 
           something ahead. He follows his gaze--sees what he sees...

           The PHOTO of Daniel and Hunter tacked to the exterior wall of 
           the Lobster Pot. Arm in arm, their smiles beaming.

                                 MYLES
                        Sir...

                                 BLAKE
                        You’re never going to believe this.

           At this point Calhoun has also seen the picture and now has a 
           sinister little grin stretched across his face.
                                 CALHOUN
                        Oh, I believe I will.

           EXT. LONG POND. NIGHT

           A full moon hangs amid the clouds--draping a soft curtain of 
           light over the land below. The water is still and calm. 
           Reflecting the galaxy of twinkling stars above.

           Hanging over the pond is a haze of floating lights. 
           FIREFLIES.Dimming in and out as they dance in the summer air.

           It’s one of those sights that if experienced would be seared 
           into your memory forever.

           Daniel and McKayla sit on the edge of a dock. Their feet 
           dangle above the water. OLDIES leak out of a nearby STEREO.

                                 DANIEL
                        How’d you find this place?

           She shrugs.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Sometimes you just find things.
                             (beat)
                        I used to catch them, you know.

                                 DANIEL
                        Catch what?

           She nods towards the FIREFLIES. He follows her gaze.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        When I was a little kid I’d put 
                        them in a glass jar and they’d 
                        light up my room at night.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why’d you stop?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Because they’d always die, like, 
                        within a day. 

                                 DANIEL
                        You always tell me to enjoy 
                        something for what it is. Even if 
                        it’s only for a moment. 

                                 MCKAYLA
                        That’s different.

                                 DANIEL
                        Not really.
                                 MCKAYLA
                        I just don’t think there’s anything 
                        worth holding on to.

           Daniel’s chest starts to tighten.

                                 DANIEL
                        Why not?

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Because everything dies--everything 
                        goes to shit in the end.

                                 DANIEL
                        It doesn’t have to be that way.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Yes it does.

           Daniel shifts his body towards hers, his eyes; two black 
           saucers of vulnerability. 

                                 DANIEL
                        What about us?

                                 MCKAYLA
                             (shrugs)
                        What about us?

           More silence.

                                 DANIEL
                        I think some things are worth 
                        holding on to...

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Then I hope you’re good at being 
                        hurt.

           His heart explodes and whatever’s left drops into his 
           stomach.

           There’s a long stretch in which nothing is said. The silky 
           love song on the radio plays as an ironic juxtaposition to 
           the crushing blow.

           It’s unclear if she realizes exactly what she said but the 
           damage has been done.

                                 DANIEL
                        There’s something I’ve been wanting 
                        to talk to you about.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Can it wait?
                                 DANIEL
                        Wait for what?

           A sultry grin crawls across her face as she stands up.

                                 DANIEL
                        What are you doing?

           She unzips her pants, pushes them down and flings them off.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I wanna try something.

           She turns her back and unhinges her bra, letting it slip off 
           onto the dock. She smiles over her shoulder then leaps into 
           the water.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Common!

           Daniel stands up and strips down to his boxers.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        Everything.

           He blushes, then awkwardly slides his boxers down and kicks 
           them aside. Then he jumps in.

           LAKE

           She takes him by the hand and they sink beneath the water.

           UNDER WATER

           Beams of moonlight penetrate the surface, lighting their skin 
           against the dark abyss. She pulls him close. They kiss for a 
           few seconds then break into laughter letting loose a flurry 
           of bubbles from their mouths.

           INT. DANIEL’S CAR--OUTSIDE HUNTER’S HOUSE. NIGHT 

           His hair still damp, Daniel watches the yellow light glowing 
           inside Hunter’s garage. Worry in his eyes. The RADIO plays.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        Every Friday night we’d count our 
                        take from the week. There was a 
                        time when I looked forward to these 
                        moments.

                                 RADIO DJ 
                        ...and yes folks it’s gonna be a 
                        big one so go out this weekend and 
                        stock up on water, batteries, 
                        canned goods--Hurricane Bob is 
                        knocking on the door--
           Click. Daniel cuts off the radio and gets out of the car.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. GARAGE. NIGHT

           Hunter sorts CASH by denomination on a work table. In the 
           corner, a RED SOX game plays on a small T.V.

           There’s a knock on the garage window, Hunter looks up to find 
           Daniel on the other side. He clicks the remote and the garage 
           door slides open.

           Backpack slung over one shoulder, Daniel stands with the 
           sheepish posture of someone riddled with apprehension.

                                 DANIEL
                        You ready?

           INT. SHOWER. MCKAYLA’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Beads of water pour over her stoic face. Her eyes are distant 
           and sad. Her mind wrestling with an ocean of troubled 
           thoughts. What exactly they are we will never know.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. GARAGE. SAME

           The boys work efficiently and silently. No eye contact. No 
           words. The room choked with tension. The only SOUND is 
           provided by the baseball game on the tube and the mechanical 
           flutter of the CASH COUNTING MACHINE.

           The game cuts away to commercial. It’s a LOCAL NEWS BREAK.

                                 TV ANCHOR
                        Tonight at 11-- more on this 
                        developing story as state police 
                        have now confirmed that the body of 
                        the man found dead in the Lynn 
                        marshland yesterday is that of 22 
                        year old Spencer Cheaney.

           Both their eyes move towards the T.V. On screen is the face 
           of PONYTAIL (a.k.a Spencer Cheaney). The caption reads: BODY 
           FOUND.

                                 TV ANCHOR
                        Cheaney was reported missing three 
                        days ago near his home in Alston. 
                        Boston City Police are urging 
                        anyone with information to come 
                        forward. We’ll bring you the latest 
                        after the game.

           Their eyes move off the screen and towards one another. 
           Stomach’s sinking with this sobering realization.
                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        And that night I had to face the 
                        consequence of my actions.

           INT. MCKAYLA’S ROOM. NIGHT

           She flops onto her bed--

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And she had to face hers.

           --when her eyes tilt up to the ceiling they catch on 
           something...

           The PANEL DOOR leading to the attic.

           INT. MCKAYLA’S ATTIC. MOMENTS LATER

           Its dark. But only for a moment, then the panel slides away, 
           light pours in and McKayla’s head pops up from below. She 
           switches on a FLASHLIGHT and illuminates the dozens of 
           ENVELOPES. Conflict on her face. Resolve in her eyes.

           It’s time.

           INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE. GARAGE. SAME

           Daniel adds the last stack of CASH into a large duffle bag 
           and zips it closed. Nothing has been said in a long time.

                                 HUNTER
                             (reaching for bag)
                        Where am I meeting him?

           Daniel clutches the bag.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’ll take it up.

                                 HUNTER
                        Thought it was my shift.

                                 DANIEL
                        Don’t worry. I got it.

           A gut wrenching stare down. Hunter’s glare is lethal, 
           chilling--but Daniel doesn’t look away.

                                 HUNTER
                        You wanna be straight with me?

                                 DANIEL
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.
           Palpable tension. The air smells of frayed nerves and 
           adrenaline. 

           On T.V. the CROWD reacts to a play. Their eyes don’t part.

           Hunter gently releases his grip on the bag, and Daniel slowly 
           takes it, slings it over his shoulder.

                                 DANIEL
                        I’m gonna put this in the car.

           Hunter’s stare remains fixed as Daniel moves over to the 
           garage door. He clicks it open, the door slides up revealing--

           --McKayla--standing in the driveway--TWO TENT BAGS in her 
           hand. She’s silhouetted by the glaring HEADLIGHTS of OKIE’S 
           CAR.

           There’s a brief moment where none of the parties can believe 
           what’s happening. Three sets of confused eyes jump back and 
           forth as the ground falls out from beneath them.

           McKayla looks to Daniel who’s literally caught in the 
           headlights--both of them holding bags of dirty money.

           His face tells the whole story. She drops the bags and 
           PUNCHES Daniel in MOUTH. Hard. At least as hard as a 16 year 
           old girl can. SCREAMS. Then walks away, shaking her wrist.

           Bleeding--paralyzed by shock, all Daniel can muster is--

                                 DANIEL
                        Wait.

           But she doesn’t. She gets into the passenger seat of OKIE’S 
           CAR which then reverses out and speeds away. 

           Daniel looks back at Hunter--freaks--then dashes into his car 
           and speeds off down the street in the opposite direction.

           Through all of this Hunter has remained oddly still. Numb. 

           He bends to a knee, unzips one of the TENT BAGS McKayla left. 
           Bundles of ENVELOPES stare back up at him. Years worth.

           Hunched under the bitter garage light, those vacant eyes come 
           back. Distant and filled with despair. The wind HOWLS.

           INT. DANIEL’S BED ROOM. DAY

           His head pressed up against the window, stuck in a perpetual 
           state of gloom as he watches the wind expose the Oak leaves’ 
           pale under bellies.

           A RED CAR drives down the street. Is it Hunter? Daniel’s eyes 
           widen and he slowly moves his head back away from the window. 
           But it’s not Hunter, just some old man.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        I didn’t leave my house for 2 days.

           LATER

           Daniel stares hard at the phone. Chewing his nails, biting 
           his lip. Deliberating. He picks up dials. Ring.

           INT. MCKAYLA’S ROOM. SAME

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        And neither did she.

           She sits on her bed in a towel. Her hair wet and her eyes 
           swollen from crying. She lets the phone ring... 

           When its done, her gaze moves over to OLIVER THE FISH who is 
           floating belly up, DEAD in his little bowl.

           INT. DANIEL’S ROOM. SAME

           He hangs up. Dejected. He cranks his stereo all the way up. 
           April Come She Will by Simon and Garfunkel comes on.

           Then he flops back onto his bed and buries his face in the 
           pillow.

           MONTAGE

           The song plays over various images as the town of Hyannis 
           preps for the big storm. The sweet and soft spoken music 
           gives an eerie sense of calm before the impending mayhem. 

           I. An ELDERLY COUPLE boards up the front window of the 
           Cushman Pharmacy.

           II. The GROUNDS CREW pulls a tarp over the baseball diamond.

           III. Pan across empty shelf after empty shelf in a aunt 
           Barb’s store. Batteries. Flashlights. Gallon water jugs. All 
           gone.

           IV. Sand bags are stacked along Buzzards Bay.

           V. A line of CARS bottlenecked at the Sagamore Bridge. Crane 
           up to see that the line stretches back for 11 miles.

           INT. DANIEL’S BED ROOM. MORNING

           He lays asleep in bed, fully dressed. The PHONE rings and he 
           immediately jolts awake. Picks up.
                                 DANIEL
                        Mckayla?

                                 DEX
                             (through phone)
                        You’re late.

           Daniel’s shoulders drop, a little hope lost.

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah...I’ve been...don’t worry I’ll 
                        get it to you.

                                 DEX
                        By sun down.

                                 DANIEL
                        There’s a God damn hurricane headed 
                        this way. You can’t be serious.

           Click. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Hello? 

           Daniel looks at the phone. Dial tone taunting him.

           LATER

           He pulls a DUFFLE BAG out from under his bed.

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        I had five hours to drive fifty-
                        thousand dollars to upstate New 
                        York. On any other day that 
                        wouldn’t have been a problem. On 
                        any other day.

           Out the window he see’s a row of cars, bumper to bumper, 
           crawling down the street. 

           LATER

           He steps out of his room. Aunt Barb is cleaning the dishes.

                                 DANIEL
                        Where’s everyone going?

                                 AUNT BARBERA
                        Somewhere far away from here.

           A sudden realization hits Daniel and he turns and runs out 
           the front door. Aunt Barb shakes her head and goes back to 
           scrubbing pots.

           MOMENTS LATER
           He comes barreling out the front door, BACK PACK around his 
           shoulder--but then something comes over him, he slows then 
           stops all together. 

           He looks around, taking in the atmosphere. The wind ruffles 
           his clothes and tousles his hair. The air smells of rain and 
           panic.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        When I woke up that morning I knew 
                        it would take a miracle to get out 
                        of the mess I had made. I also knew 
                        that I was running out of time.

           He tilts his head up towards the darkening sky. It’s a 
           forboding medley of green, purple and black--like that of 
           some disturbed toddler’s water painting.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        What I didn’t know is that that day 
                        would be the day that I died.

           A singe RAIN DROP falls and lands on his forehead. He blinks.

           EXT. LUCY’S 24 HOUR DINER. DAY

           Steph and Okie are standing outside the front door in their 
           tacky waitress uniforms. 

           Okie flips the door sign around-- ‘CLOSED FOR THE STORM’-- 
           then pulls the door shut and locks it. Steph stands nearby, 
           shivering in the cold, sucking down a cigarette.

           Daniel’s car comes flying around the corner, skidding to a 
           stop. In a frenzy, he hops out without putting the gear into 
           park, the car rolls, he hops back in throws it in park then 
           stumbles back out. 

           The girls stare at him like he’s some mental patient.

           He runs up to Steph.

                                 DANIEL
                        I need your help. Where’s Mcka--
                        nevermind.

           He turns to Okie.

                                 DANIEL
                        Okie. Please. 

                                 OKIE
                        You fucked up, kid. 

                                 DANIEL
                        I know. I know I did.
                                 OKIE
                        She doesn’t wanna see you.

                                 DANIEL
                        Just tell me where she’s going--can 
                        you do that?

                                 OKIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 DANIEL
                        For the storm--where’s she going? 
                        The summer’s ending I don’t know if 
                        I’ll ever...Okie, please.

                                 OKIE
                        You’re really not from around here, 
                        huh?

           He stares back blankly.

                                 OKIE
                        Only the birds run for cover. We 
                        just dig our heels in and pray.

                                 DANIEL
                        Thanks, Okie.

           Daniel runs back to his car and speeds away. They watch as he 
           swerves wildly down the road.

                                 OKIE
                        That boy’s crazy.

                                 STEPH
                        No, he’s just in love.

           INT. DANIEL’S CAR. MOVING. DAY

           The rain’s coming down now and windshield wipers struggle to 
           keep pace.

           He turns onto McKayla’s street-- racing towards her HOUSE. 
           When he reaches the street lamp 100 yards out he hits the 
           breaks. Skidding to a stop.

           He stares at the house. It’s daunting. What would he even say 
           at this point? 

           He checks the dash board CLOCK and then the DUFFLE BAG 
           resting in the passenger seat. Fuck. Can’t bring himself to 
           do it.

           He punches the gas and jets out of there, hating himself as 
           he watches the house fall further and further away in the 
           rearview.
           INT. BARNSTABLE POLICE STATION. DAY

           Calhoun stands before a group of officers. We can’t hear what 
           he saying but we get the idea he’s giving the run down. 

           Pictures are pinned to the cork board behind him. Dex. The 
           Driver. Spencer Cheaney with a BULLET in his head. Daniel and 
           Hunter from the lobster pot. Their cars. License plates, etc. 

           VARIOUS SHOTS

           I. Kevlar vests are pulled on.

           II. Police belts are secured. 

           III. Guns are shoved into holsters.

           IV. Cruisers pull out of the lot.

           INT. DANIEL’S CAR. MOVING. LATE AFTERNOON

           He’s now far outside the Cape, approaching farmland. It’s 
           still raining but the severity has drastically declined. 

           Up ahead, to the side of the road, stands a gigantic WHITE 
           SIGN with a picture of a huge STRAWBERRY painted on it. 

           It’s an advertisement for a strawberry farm. 

           The sign reads: STRAWBERRIES U-PICK.

           Daniel blinks. Not believing what he’s seeing.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        Coincidence? A cosmic sign from the 
                        Universe? Fate?

                                 DANIEL
                        You’ve got to be kidding.

           He looks over at the DUFFLE BAG--grimaces--gotta make a 
           choice---then cuts the wheel hard to the left--spinning the 
           car around into the opposite direction. Horns flare.

           EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT

           Nightfall. I-6 Westbound. Break lights for miles. Every Tom, 
           Dick and Harry is headed for the hills. Except for one crazy 
           bastard. 

           Driving headfirst into the storm’s mouth is a ‘91 Chevy 
           Corvette. It blows past us, leaving behind a trail of light 
           in the fog. 
           We’re back where we began.

           INT. DANIEL’S CAR. MOVING. SAME

           Jittery eyes scan around. Checking mirrors--front, side, 
           left, right. 

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        There come’s a point in every boy’s 
                        life when he must become a man. 
                        When he must choose what he stands 
                        for. 

           Ahead lies an intersection. Yellow light. Daniel guns it.

                                 DANIEL (V.O)
                        When he must--

           BAM!

           CUT TO WHITE

           Silence.

           A flutter of images flash before us.

           Rapid. Fleeting. Holding only a moment before burning away.

           Birthday candles. Scraped elbows. Coloring books. Snowmen. 
           Pillow fights. Water slides. A Red Sox game. A broken arm. 
           Tree forts. A loose tooth. Sun burns. Christmas lights.  
           Calvin and Hobbs. The ocean. Fireworks. Fireflies. McKayla.

           Black.

           From within the darkness we see a distant point of light. 
           Blinding and magnificent. It appears to be at the end of a 
           tunnel, moving towards us... 

           An otherworldly sound. Gentle yet haunting. Imagine the hush 
           of an angel’s whisper or a giant sea-shell pressed to the 
           ear.

           The light moves closer. Growing larger and brighter. Burning 
           with splendid intensity.

           Behind the frayed edges we can make out a FACE staring at us. 

           Dad? 

           God? 
           INT. HOSPITAL. MORNING

           Nope. Just the RESIDENT PHYSICIAN checking Daniel’s pupils. 
           Daniel lays in a hospital bed, dressed in a HOSPITAL GOWN. 
           Heavy eyelids flicker. He stirs awake.

                                 RESIDENT PHYSICIAN
                        Ah, there he is. Welcome back, 
                        Daniel.

           The Physician plucks his gloves off and smiles.

                                 RESIDENT PHYSICIAN
                        So, you have a mild concussion a 
                        dislocated shoulder and that wicked 
                        lump there above your eye, but all 
                        in all you’re doing surprisingly 
                        well.

           He clicks open a pen and jots something on his clipboard.

                                 RESIDENT PHYSICIAN
                        Must have someone watching over 
                        you.

           Daniel mumbles something inaudible from cracked lips.

                                 RESIDENT PHYSICIAN
                        I’m sorry what was that?

                                 DANIEL
                        My bag. Where is it?

           The Physician smiles warmly.

                                 RESIDENT PHYSICIAN
                        Well there’s a nice police man who 
                        would like to speak with you about 
                        that.

           The Physician then leaves the room.

           HOSPITAL ENTRANCE

           Automatic doors slide open and Calhoun marches in from the 
           storm. Water drips from the brim of his trooper hat. He 
           approaches the SECRETARY who points towards URGENT CARE.

           HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER

           Calhoun stalks down the empty hallway. His wet boots squeak 
           and moan, leaving an ominous string of FOOTPRINTS dotting the 
           linoleum title.

           Arrives at the door with a name plate that reads: MIDDLETON.
           He enters--

           HOSPITAL ROOM

           Nothing. Ruffled sheets and a flat lining heart monitor. His 
           brow lowers and his jaw clenches.

           ANOTHER HALLWAY

           Stark and quiet but only for a moment. 

           First we hear the hollering, then the footsteps, then Daniel 
           comes wheeling around the corner--charging full speed ahead--
           his hospital gown barely clinging on--a hospital bag swinging 
           in his hand. 

           Two MALE NURSES and a SECURITY GAURD give chase.

           OUTSIDE--MOMENTS LATER

           Daniel flys through the automatic doors and gets slammed by a 
           tidal wave of wind and rain. 

           He fights forward, dashing across the parking lot. Untied 
           shoelaces and his naked ass flapping in the wind. 

           STREET

           Daniel scrambles across. Horns. Lights. Rain. Oncoming 
           traffic swerves, narrowly avoiding him.

           The security guard and two nurses pull up short of the 
           street, unwilling to go any further.

           Calhoun steps out behind them and together they watch Daniel 
           disappear.

           ON DANIEL

           Running as if it was his last day on Earth. Muscles stiffen, 
           lungs burn. The desperate stride of someone riding on nothing 
           but intestinal fortitude.

           A horrific bolt of LIGHTNING spiderwebs overhead. 

           Hail stones dent car hoods. Electrical transformers snap off 
           telephone poles--EXPLODING into FIREBALLS in the sky.

           Daniel doesn’t flinch.

           INT. DEX’S BLACK VAN. MOVING. MORNING

           The Van glides through the hurricane ravaged neighborhood. 
           Tree limbs. Mailboxes. Rooftops--tumbling across the street.
           Driver and Dex sit in blood chilling silence. Eyes scanning.

           In Dex’s lap rests a WALTHER P-22 PISTOL equipped with a 
           silencer. It’s a murder weapon. Plain and simple.

           EXT. BUS STOP. DAY

           Under the shelter of the bus stop Daniel yanks his clothes 
           out from the hospital bag. He pulls them on. They’re wet and 
           bloody but they’re clothes.

           A POLICE CRUISER turns down the street, his SPOTLIGHT 
           scanning. Daniel sinks down, trying to look inconspicuous 
           then decides it’d be better to run. Sirens belt out.

           EXT. DEX’S BLACK VAN. MOVING. SAME. 

           Rounding the corner. Up ahead they spot Daniel running down 
           the street--police cruiser closing ground.

           Dex taps The Driver on his shoulder, indicating for him to 
           fall back. The Driver breaks then turns down an adjacent 
           street.

           ON DANIEL

           Cutting through adjoining BACK YARDS--knocking over trash 
           barrels, under swing sets, around swimming pools.

           MCKAYLA’S STREET--MOMENTS LATER

           He’s approaching that spot, 100 yards from the house, and 
           when  gets there he....blows past it without a second 
           thought.

           MCKAYLA’S HOUSE--MOMENTS LATER

           He scurries up to the front door and starts banging away.

                                 DANIEL
                        McKayla! 

           He knocks harder. Faster.

                                 DANIEL
                        McKayla!

           More knocking.

                                 DANIEL
                        I know you’re in there!
                             (softer)
                         Please.

           INSIDE
           McKayla is hidden behind a curtain, teary eyes watching out 
           the window.

           OUTSIDE

           He stops knocking, realizing that door will never be opened. 
           He slowly backs away and centers himself on the front lawn. 
           Gale force winds rock his frail body. Rain stings his face. 
           He doesn’t give a fuck.

           He SHOUTS over the deafening roar of the wind.

                                 DANIEL
                        I understand if you never want to 
                        see me again. I just need you to 
                        know...I love you. I’m fucking in 
                        love with you, okay. And I know 
                        that scares the shit out of you but 
                        I don’t give a fuck. I’ve been in 
                        love with you since the moment I 
                        saw you and I always will be. I’ve 
                        never been more sure of anything in 
                        my entire life. I’m sorry. I’m 
                        sorry for lying to you and I’m 
                        sorry about how it came out. But 
                        I’m not sorry for what I did 
                        because, honestly, if I hadn’t done 
                        it I don’t think I would’ve ever 
                        been with you.

           INSIDE

           On McKayla as a lone tear rolls down her cheek.

           OUTSIDE

                                 DANIEL

                             (his voice begins to give 
                              out)
                        You’re the best thing that could 
                        have ever happened to me. You gave 
                        me a purpose in this fucked up 
                        world. You saved my life. You were 
                        my God damn view.
                             (throws his arms up)
                        Okay. That’s it. That’s everything.

           The howl of the wind dies and is replaced with an eerie 
           nothingness. A disturbing silence that’s as bleak as it is 
           soothing. This is the eye of the storm.

           Overhead, clouds give way to blue skies and the sun pours 
           down with all it’s splendor. Daniel tilts his head up and 
           greets the warm and wonderful glow with an enlightened grin.
           The CREAK from the front door opening brings his eyes back 
           down.

           HUNTER steps out from the house, a PISTOL by his side.

           Their eyes meet.

           Hunter raises the gun. Daniel’s smile holds.

           BANG!

           The bullet catches Daniel square between the eyes, his legs 
           buckle and he drops into a PUDDLE.

           ON MCKAYLA

           As she wipes the tear from her cheek and composes herself 
           with a deep breath. Pull back further to see she’s not inside 
           the house. She never was. She’s somewhere else. Far away. 

           OUTSIDE

           Hunter approaches the body and crooks his neck so he can look 
           into Daniel’s lifeless eyes. There’s an odd peacefulness in 
           them.

           ANGLE FROM BELOW

           Hunter stands over us. Staring down into our eyes. He aims 
           the gun right into frame.

           BANG.

           Black.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        Daniel Middleton died on August 
                        19th, 1991. It was a Monday.

           FADE IN:

           ANGLE FROM BELOW

           Same angle, but instead of Hunter standing over us it is now 
           Calhoun. His head backlit by the sun, shadowing his face just 
           like when we first met him.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        Because of the storm they didn’t 
                        find his body for three days.

           Calhoun grimaces at what must be a truly unpleasant sight. 
           Those eyes have seen a lot but never anything like this.
           MONTAGE

           I. A roofless house.

           II. An upside down school bus.

           III. A sailboat stuck in a tree.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        At the time, Hurricane Bob was the 
                        second costliest hurricane in 
                        American history with damages well 
                        surpassing a billion dollars.

           IV. A cereal box floats down a flooded street. Several soggy 
           dollar bills drift out.

           V. The DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATER leveled. A half century of 
           memories reduced to rubble.

           EXT. DANIEL’S MOTHER’S HOUSE. DAY

           Calhoun knocks. Daniel’s Mother answers. This is the worst 
           part of the job. He removes his hat. Sorrow in his eyes. No 
           words need to be said.

                                 MCKAYLA(V.O.)
                        Much was lost in that storm.

           EXT. HOUSE (UNDER CONSTRUCTION). DAY

           A team of VOLUNTEERS tack up new dry wall.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        But life moves onward.

           NEXT SUMMER

           I. Two TEENAGE GIRLS dash through a sprinkler while their 
           father flips burgers on the grill.

           II. Hundreds of people stretched along an overcrowded beach.

           III. Follow ICE CREAM SUNDAE’S from a kitchen out to the 
           table of this wealthy family.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        And those who are gone will be 
                        replaced.

           IV. A family of SUMMER BIRDS arrive outside their cottage. 
           One of them, an innocent 14 year old BOY.
           V. From a distance that same kid watches a group of “COOL 
           KIDS” smoking cigarettes and setting off FIRE CRACKERS.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE. DAY

           Dex’s Black Van pulls up and a TWENTY YEAR OLD KID walks up 
           the front steps to meet Boss Man. Ice tea at the ready.

           EXT. GRAVE YARD. DAY

           A bleak afternoon hangs over a funeral procession as it winds 
           through the cemetery's cast iron gates.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        Daniel Middleton replaced Ricky 
                        Orwell as the new dead boy in town.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. LONG POND. DAY

           Rain pounds the surface of the same pond where Daniel and 
           McKayla went skinny dipping just a few nights before.

           Hunter stands on the dock, holding the PISTOL in his 
           trembling hands. Rain rolling down his face. He brings the 
           barrel to his temple...grimaces...moves it into his 
           mouth...closes his eyes, tasting the steel on his tongue...

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        He had become the villain that 
                        people always wanted him to be. 
                        There are those who say he ended up 
                        somewhere in Idaho or Nevada in 
                        some lost little town on the 
                        fringes of some forgotten little 
                        city.

           He’s too afraid to die. Too afraid for what awaits him. He 
           yanks the gun from his mouth and hurls it out into the water.  

           His chin quivers. He wobbles--drops to his knees--cradling 
           his skull between his hands. And then it comes, an avalanche 
           of raw, unadulterated emotion. The turmoil. The regret. The 
           pain. The pain. The pain.

           Pain that’s been 19 years in the making.

           FLASHBACK. EXT. AMY CALHOUN’S HOUSE. DAY

           Hunter dashes across the lawn--through the rain--past the old 
           tire swing, up the vine fence and starts pounding on Amy’s 
           window. She opens it. He’s sopping wet. His eyes, teary and 
           swollen.
                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        Other’s will tell you he left the 
                        country all together.

           He starts desperately explaining something to her that we 
           can’t hear. She shakes her head and breaks into tears. 

                                 AMY
                        You can’t!

                                 HUNTER
                        This is only for now.

           He cups his hands around her face.

                                 HUNTER
                        Look at me. Only for now.

           She nods. Wanting her damndest to believe him. He kisses her 
           passionately on the forehead then turns and runs away.

           STREET LEVEL--LATER

           Pulling away from us, the RED BREAK LIGHTS of his CAMARO 
           disappear into the fog.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        But as far as the town of Hyannis 
                        was concerned that was the end of 
                        Hunter Strawberry. He was never 
                        seen again.

           EXT. BACK YARD COOKOUT. DAY

           Two COUPLES chat over cocktails.

                                 WIFE
                        I heard he was a drug dealer.

                                 HUSBAND
                         A major one.

           INT. TEENAGERS BEDROOM. NIGHT

           Two TEENAGE GIRLS lie next to each other in sleeping bags.

                                 GIRL
                        A murderer.

           EXT. WOODS. NIGHT

           A group of BOYS huddled around a CAMPFIRE, eyes glued to the 
           speaker.
                                 SPEAKING BOY
                        ...and poof! He just...vanished.

           The rest of the boys gasp.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        But his legend lived on.

           FLASHBACK. INT. MCKAYLA’S BEDROOM. DAY

           She sits on her bed in a towel. Her hair wet and her eyes 
           swollen from crying. The phone is ringing (it was Daniel). 
           She doesn’t pick up...

           When its done her gaze moves over to OLIVER THE FISH who is 
           floating belly up, DEAD in his little bowl.

           CLOSE ON: A bag being stuffed with clothes.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        First there was Kirby Wells, then 
                        the Boston college football player, 
                        then there was Daniel Middleton.

           LIVING ROOM--MOMENTS LATER

           With bag in tow, McKayla sneaks past her drunken FATHER on 
           the couch.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        Coincidence or something else?

           FLASHBACK. EXT. BUS STOP. DAY

           She boards a departing bus.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        I’ll let you decide.

           INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT (YEARS LATER)

           The teenage girl Daniel once loved has grown into a beautiful 
           young woman.

           She sits at a desk writing in a NOTE BOOK. 

                                 MCKAYLA(V.O.)
                        And as life carries on I’ll laugh 
                        and dance and have my heart broken 
                        and new memories will replace the 
                        old.

           Once finished adding her final thought she flips the cover 
           closed. 
           It reads: HOT SUMMER NIGHTS

           LATER

           Laying in bed, her eyes rest on a mantle which holds a GLASS 
           JAR of FIREFLIES. They dim and glow. Dim and glow. 

           She let’s go a faint and wistful smile.

                                 MCKAYLA (V.O.)
                        But those who are gone can live 
                        only in the moments when they are 
                        remembered. And their whispers will 
                        echo for eternity, crying out to be 
                        heard.

           One last firefly flickers then fades out, casting us into...

           Darkness.

           CHYRON: Daniel Middleton is buried in Pine Grove Cemetery in 
           Leominster, Massachusetts.
