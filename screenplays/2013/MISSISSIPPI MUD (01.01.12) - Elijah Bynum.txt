          1/1/12
           FADE IN:

           Dusk. A rural Mississippi countryside. Bleak and malevolent. 
           Violent rain bludgeons the terrain. 

           Voice of a southern teenage girl.

                                 GIRL (V.O.)
                        The Lord is my shepherd, I shall 
                        not want. He makes me lie down in 
                        green pastures, he leads me beside 
                        still waters, he restores my 
                        soul...

           Another desolate landscape.  An old, rickety windmill 
           struggles to keep up with the storm.

                                 GIRL (V.O.)
                        ...he leads me in the right paths 
                        for his name’s sake. Even though I 
                        walk through the valley of the 
                        shadow death I fear no evil...

           Another landscape. Silo’s dot the horizon, abandoned barns 
           and overgrown barbwire fences serve as the only sign of human 
           existence. 

                                 GIRL (V.O.)
                        ...for you are with me; your rod 
                        and staff--they comfort me. You 
                        prepare a table before me in the 
                        presence of my enemies...

           A sprawling meadow melting into the edge of the forest. Far 
           in the distance sits a house--draped in darkness.

                                 GIRL (V.O.)
                        ...you anoint my head with oil, my 
                        cup overflows. Surely goodness and 
                        mercy shall follow me all the days 
                        of my life...

           INT.GIRLS BEDROOM.NIGHT

           CLOSE ON HER FACE. A battered and swollen eye. The other one 
           sitting above her tear streaked cheekbone. For the prayer 
           she’s composed herself best she could.

                                 GIRL
                        ...and I shall dwell in the house 
                        of the lord forever. Amen.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She crosses her chest and releases a shaky sigh.

           QUICK SHOTS

           --On her bureau stands a JESUS NATIVITY SET. She moves the 
           Virgin Mary aside, lifts the barn and pulls out a key from 
           underneath.

           BED

           She lays flat on the floor and reaches underneath the bed to 
           pull out a CHEST.

           --Locks pop. The CHEST jumps ajar. She pulls out a BLACK 
           PLASTIC TRASH BAG tied closed with a knot.

           --TRASH BAG and various items of clothing are stuffed into a 
           backpack.

           --Feet slip into a pair of RAIN BOOTS.

           INT.KITCHEN.NIGHT

           She scoops several handfuls of CHEERIOS into a Ziploc bag and 
           seals it shut.

           LATER

           We are now facing the girl, looking directly into her sullen 
           eyes. She speaks softly as to not wake anyone in the house.

                                 GIRL
                        Forgive me lord for I have sinned. 
                        But I have faith that you will 
                        protect me....becuase this is what 
                        you have chosen.

           Flip to reveal she is in her BATHROOM, speaking to herself in 
           the mirror.

           INT.BATHROOM.NIGHT

           Her gaze drops, she cups a handful of water into her mouth 
           from the running faucet, then grabs her toothbrush and stuffs 
           it into the backpack.
           INT.HALLWAY.NIGHT

           She creeps past a narrowly cracked bedroom door. A slight 
           hesitation, she peeks in. T.V glare illuminates the room. A 
           pair of feet sit motionless at the end of the bed. 

           BACK DOOR

           She pulls on a yellow raincoat, flips the backpack strap over 
           her shoulder, unlocks the door and slips out.

           OUTSIDE

           The downpour is tumultuous and unforgiving. Rain pummels her 
           face. She heads into a barren field stretching into the 
           horizon. At first she walks, after several steps it turns 
           into a slow trot, she pulls the backpack straps over both 
           shoulders and breaks into a hysterical sprint into the 
           darkness......

           INT.FIRST NATIONAL BANK.DAY

           CHASE WALDRUP (35) simple, friendly and his PREGNANT WIFE, 
           RILEY (31), a no bullshit bitch with the attitude to boot, 
           wait in a small, downscale, bank lobby. Riley is less than 
           pleased to be here. Chase is oblivious to this.

                                 CHASE
                        It’s been rainin’ for six days. 
                        You’d think the sky woulda ran 
                        outta water. And I hear it worse up 
                        in uh, Carroll County...supposedly 
                        it’s really comin’ down up there. 
                        Don’t imagine it’s too good for the 
                        farmers...can’t be too good for the 
                        farmers up there. Thing is when 
                        there’s a drought all you hear ‘em 
                        talkin’ ‘bout is needin’ rain but 
                        soon as it gets to rainin’--

                                 RILEY
                        You got somethin’ you plan on 
                        sayin’ when we get in there?

                                 CHASE
                        Whaddaya mean?

                                 RILEY
                        Whaddaya mean ‘whaddya mean’? A 
                        plan.  Some way to dig us outta 
                        this mess.

                                 CHASE
                        I was gonna hear what Sam had to-- 
                        I don’t have nothin’ written down 
                        but--Riley, there ain’t much to 
                        say. Facts are facts. 
                             (Beat)
                        It might not be as bad as you think 
                        anyhow...Show some faith.
                             (Long pause)
                        The world ain’t comin’ to an end.

                                 RILEY
                        Our’s is.

                                 CHASE
                        Last time he said he’d run the 
                        numbers again and see if--

                                 RILEY
                        I know what he said, Chase.

           A DOOR opens off screen drawing the attention of both of 
           them. 

           From the office emerges LUTHER GUTHRIE (40’s), carrying the 
           rugged disposition of man who the world hasn’t been very nice 
           to and in return hasn't been very nice to the world.

           Following him is SAM WEBB (40’s) a portly fellow with a kind 
           face. They seem to have been discussing something heavy. 
           Luther and Chase exchange a glance. Tension. There’s history.

                                 WEBB
                        Mr. and Mrs. Waldrup, pleasure to 
                        see ya again.

           INT.SAM WEBB’S OFFICE.MOMENTS LATER

           Simple, blue collar. The faux wood decor is decorated with a 
           framed picture of Ronald Reagan. An American flag stands in 
           the corner next to a plastic Ficus plant.

           Webb sits reclined in his chair. The Waldrups sit across the 
           desk from him, erect, tense. Neither party at ease.

                                 WEBB
                        Boy, it’s rainin’ out there.

                        Cats ‘n dogs.       Dogs n’ cats.

           CONTINUED:

           Short beat.

                                 CHASE
                        I hear it’s really comin’ down out 
                        in Carroll County.

                                 WEBB
                        Is that right?

                                 CHASE
                        That’s what they’re sayin’.

                                 WEBB
                        Can’t be too good for the farmers.

                                 CHASE
                        Don’t imagine it is.

           Another short, uncomfortable beat.

                                 WEBB
                        Why don’t you tell me how that job 
                        hunt comin’ along, Chase?

                                 CHASE

                        about yet but it’s only been, oh...
                             (Looks at Riley for help)
                        What’s it been three months? Three 
                        months and a Sunday or two?

                        Sixteen weeks. So I’m guessin’ 
                        somthin’s fixin’ to fall inta place 
                        soon.

                                 WEBB
                        Uh-huh. How ‘bout you Mrs. Waldrup, 
                        any luck with a second job yet?

                                 RILEY
                        Hospital won’t allow it, ‘member? 
                        We been over this. Nurses ain’t

                        Right, that’s right, you did run 
                        that by me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Webb leans forward and uncomfortably shuffles through loose 
           papers on his desk.

                                 WEBB
                        We’ll here’s the thing, you see, I 
                        ran your numbers again and the only 
                        way it could work is--well, you 
                        see, okay, well, it’s been over 
                        thirty days since the Notice to 
                        Accelerate, so at this point we 
                        can’t accept a partial payment no 
                        more... you’re gonna hafta pay the 
                        entire delinquent amount plus all 
                        the late fees that’ve been rackin’ 
                        up. This was all in the demand

                        Last time you said there was a way 
                        for us to pay it down in 
                        increments.

                        this is stretching back even before 
                        you were laid off, Chase. Now 
                        thirty days have passed since the

           Webb clears his throat. Tries again.

           awaiting an answer.

           Chase shoots his wife a pointed look. Webb’s demeanor 
           stiffens.

           Webb stares hard into Riley’s eyes. His jaw clenches subtly. 
           A nerve’s been hit. He decides not to address her question.

                        now.

           Webb tries his best to eke out a smile. The room reverberates 
           a silent, uneasy tension.
           INT. WALDRUP TRUCK. DUSK

           Chase sits behind the wheel. Riley slumped against the 
           passenger window. No words. A CROSS methodically swings back 
           and forth  from the rearview mirror as the truck moves along 
           the road. 

           Squeaky wipers and the distinct sound of rain pinging off the 
           roof save us from complete silence. Zero eye contact. Then, 
           finally.

                                 CHASE
                             (softly)

                        uh,....things aren’t, uh...

           Chase's voice trails off. Riley's eyes stay locked straight 
           ahead. More silence. They arrive outside the nurse's entrance 
           at HUMPHREYS COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

           Riley, eyes still fixed ahead.

                                 RILEY
                        I get off at 6:30. Try not to 
                        forget.

           She gets out and SLAMS the door behind her.

           INT. BASEMENT. DAY

           At the bottom of rickety basement steps sits a behemoth of a 
           REFRIGERATOR. Chase stares at the beast, sizes it up, then 
           looks at the steep narrow stairs behind him. A seemingly 
           impossible task.

           Chase stands backwards on the steps and carefully lowers the 
           fridge down horizontally onto its side. The wooden steps 
           creak under the weight. 

           He grabs the top of the fridge; hunched over at an awkward 
           angle. With a grunt he begins to drag the fridge backwards up 
           the steps.

           Slow and unsure, he blindly steps backwards with his left 
           foot and plants it on the next step. He pauses. The 
           cumbersome fridge shifts its weight. Chase struggles to 
           adjust his grip.

           Another grunt. A pause. Then his right foot cautiously inches 
           back in the same manner as the left, desperately searching 
           for the next step.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He pulls the fridge with all his might; it budges, just 
           barely, the steps moan. Sweat has already begun to bead 
           around his brow. Chase cranes his neck to look behind him. 
           The door at the top of the stairs is a lifetime away. 

           LATER

           Chase is near the top of the staircase. Two or three steps 
           left. Breath is heavy. He steps back slowly and steady with 
           the left foot, phase one of this cyclical method. He yanks on 
           the fridge. 

           It doesn't budge. He yanks again, harder. His hand slips. The 
           fridge starts to slide. Frantic hands search for a hold. The 
           refrigerator shifts off its course and ferociously crushes 
           his knuckles against the wall. He screams in agonizing pain 
           and inherently clutches the wounded hand. 

           The fridge starts on a rapid free fall back down the steps 
           and ends in a deafening CRASH back at the bottom. An hour’s 
           work undone in a moment.

           INT. ELDERLY WOMAN’S KITCHEN. NIGHT

           Chase and an ELDERLY WOMAN stand in front of the fridge.

                                 ELDERLY WOMEN
                        I think I like the othuh wall 
                        betta.

                        Yeah, put it ‘gainst the othuh 
                        wall.

           Off Chase’s expression.

           EXT. ELDERLY WOMEN’S DRIVEWAY. NIGHT

           Chase stands outside his PICK UP TRUCK. Rain beats down. He 
           examines his bloody, tissue wrapped hand, tries to make a 
           fist, cringes in pain.

           The front door of the house opens, the ELDERLY WOMAN ambles 
           out sheltered by an UMBRELLA. She makes her way over to Chase 
           and hands the umbrella to him.

                                 ELDERLY WOMEN
                        Hold it over me.

           Chase abides.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She hands Chase a small amount of cash, mostly singles. Then  
           unscrews a JAR pinned under her arm, scoops out a handful of 
           change and begins to count it out.

                                 ELDERLY WOMEN
                        Been tryin’ to get rid of this for 
                        some time now.

                        Yes, Ma’am.

                                 ELDERLY WOMEN
                        I’m sure ya don’t mind.

                                 CHASE
                        No, Ma’am.

           She finishes counting and dumps the change into Chase’s 
           bloodied bandage. Chase eyes his earnings. No more than $25.

                                 CHASE
                        You take care now.

           The elderly women takes her umbrella back and walks away 
           inviting the rain to spit on Chase’s head.  Chase opens the 
           door to his pickup truck and climbs in. He sits brooding in 
           silent anger. Distraught. Exhausted. He watches the elderly 
           women hobble back inside and close her front door. 

           SMACK! A handful of coins explode on the windshield and 
           scatter across the dashboard onto the upholstery. Chase 
           erupts into an animalistic rage.  Rapidly and violently he 
           pummels the STEERING WHEEL with both fists. 

           ACROSS THE STREET

           From a distance we watch a grown man have a spoiled toddlers 
           conniption. His cry is inaudible. All that can be heard are 
           the short, spastic whimpers teetering out of the horn.

           INSIDE THE TRUCK

           Then, as fast as the outrage began, it ends. Tears follow. He 
           sobs hard. The way a man cries when he’s been holding it in 
           for years. 

           Deep breaths. He wipes away snot, tears and saliva from his 
           face. Still weeping, he bends down and begins to pick up the 
           coins strewn across his truck floor.
           INT. WALDRUP PICKUP TRUCK. NIGHT

           Chase travels down the road. Rain falls down in sheets, 
           assaulting the windshield, rendering visibility non-existent.

           He mumbles to himself, eyes his severed knuckles, then 
           mumbles some more. He glances at the FOLDER from the bank 
           resting on the passenger side dashboard.

           He stares at it a beat, contemplates, then grabs the FOLDER 
           and pulls it onto his lap. Checks the road then pulls out one 
           of the sheets of paper and begins to study it. 

           The information makes him frown. He flips the sheet over in a 
           search for better news; squints and tries to make out the 
           fine print.

           THUD! A heavy, wet object bangs off the front of the truck. 
           Chase slams on the breaks, his truck comes skidding to a stop 
           on the slick road.

                                 CHASE
                        What in the Sam hill?!

           EXT. ROAD. NIGHT

           We sit road level facing Chase’s truck. One HEADLIGHT is out, 
           the other illuminates the sea of rain falling from the ink 
           black sky.

           Chase timidly steps out and makes his way to check the 
           damage. 

           He peers back down the road. Blackness stretching into 
           eternity. Waits for his eyes to adjust. He squints and is 
           able to spot a figure about 150 feet back, pushed off to the 
           side of the road.

           Chase slowly walks towards it. Each step brings with it 
           additional angst. Shrouded in a haunting darkness all that 
           can be heard is the rapid patter of rain colliding with 
           asphalt. 

           Chase approaches, curious at first, but as he nears and the 
           figure begins to take shape, his curiosity gives way to 
           trepidation. 

           Wrapped in a blood sodden raincoat lays the RUNAWAY GIRL. 
           Neck mangled, body contorted into an inhuman shape.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Chase gasps and jams a fist into his mouth. He kneels down 
           and lightly shakes her in a weak attempt to bring the fresh 
           corpse back to life.

                                 CHASE
                        Oh Lord....Oh, Jesus fucking 
                        Christ. Fuck. Fuck, fuck....fuck.

           He stands, surveys his surroundings. Nothing. No witnesses, 
           not even the moon saw him.

           As he glares at the muddled body he draws a forearm across 
           his brow to clear rain. What now? Several seconds pass. He 
           looks around again, just for good measure, then uses the heel 
           of his boot to nudge the body further off the road into a 
           shallow ditch.

                                 CHASE
                        Jesus Christ. Jesus fuckin’ Christ.

           The body slides to a rest, Chase looks around once again then 
           slowly trots back to his idling TRUCK. 

           Three quarters of the way between the BODY and his TRUCK, 
           HEADLIGHTS pop over the horizon, several hundred yards away, 
           heading towards him. 

                                 CHASE
                        Christ.

           Temporary paralysis suffocates him. He eyes his TRUCK, then 
           the BODY, then the oncoming HEADLIGHTS, then back to his 
           TRUCK again. 

           Impulse kicks in. He runs to the TRUCK, hops in, throws it in 
           reverse and guns it backwards to the body. Tires spit rain 
           water.

           He hops out and pops down the TAILGATE on his truck bed.  
           Checks the distance of the approaching vehicle. Impending 
           doom. 

           He grabs the body by the wrists and tries to drag it out of 
           its shallow grave. The dead weight is stubborn, he struggles, 
           losing grip several times letting the body slide back into 
           the muddy ditch.  

           Finally, he gets a solid grip under her armpits and is able 
           to pull her out onto the road.

                                 CHASE
                        Jesus fuckin’ Christ!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He props the body into a sitting position then squats, bear 
           hugs her around the shoulders, and with a guttural snort, 
           power lifts her torso into the truck bed. THUD. Her legs 
           dangle freely out off the tailgate. 

           He pauses for a moment--sucks wind. The body begins to slide 
           off the tailgate, he catches her. After he secures the body 
           in his arms he takes several deep breaths, fighting 
           exhaustion and preparing for the next big heave.

           He lifts the body all the way into the TRUCK BED. Grabs a 
           TARP and scrambles to cover as much of the body as he can; a 
           poor attempt.

           The approaching car is now mere yards away, it becomes 
           evident the once unidentifiable vehicle is a POLICE CRUISER.

           The CRUISER pulls up parallel to Chase in sync with him 
           shutting the tailgate.

           Officer DALE WERNER(28),rail thin, and green behind the ears, 
           stops his cruiser and rolls down the window. He exudes a 
           quirky, boyish innocence.

                                 WERNER
                        Evenin’, partner. You stuck?

                                 CHASE
                        No. Well, yeah, I was, I uh, 
                        managed to drag her on out.

                                 WERNER
                        Yup, it’s a tough night. F-150’s 
                        rarely get stuck. I seen plenty of 
                        Silverado’s suckin’ mud, it’s rare 
                        to see a 150.

           Chase stands still as a statue, numb to the biting rain.

                                 CHASE
                        Yeah, well, she’s gettin’ old so...

                                 WERNER
                        Ain’t we all, partner. How old is 
                        she?

                                 CHASE
                        What?

                                 WERNER
                        Your truck. How old is she? Looks 
                        like a ninety six.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Ninety four.

                                 WERNER
                        Mmmmm. Could be why she’s gettin’ 
                        stuck.

                                 CHASE
                        Could be.

                                 WERNER
                        I see Silverado’s eatin’ mud all 
                        the time but I’ll be damned if I 
                        ever seen a 150.

                                 CHASE
                        Well she’s gettin’ old so...

                                 WERNER
                        Yeah, you said that.

           Awkward silence. Idling engines and rain patter. 

                                 WERNER
                        Don’t let her die.

                                 CHASE
                        Wh-what?

                                 WERNER
                        You leave that engine runnin’ long 
                        ‘nough she gon’ stall out ‘n you 
                        gon’ be stuck all over again.

                                 CHASE
                        Right, well I’d better get goin’ 
                        then. I ‘preciate it officer.

                                 WERNER
                        Alrighty, stay dry, partner.

           Werner rolls up his window and pulls away. Chase’s tension 
           dissipates.

           The cruiser doesn’t move but five feet before it stops 
           abruptly. Red break lights elucidate Chase’s face. Werner 
           slowly backs up until he is even with Chase again and rolls 
           the window back down.

                                 WERNER
                        You ain’t happen to see a teenage 
                        girl runnin’ about?

           CONTINUED:

           Chase is frozen once again. His brain trying to play catch 
           up.

                                 WERNER
                        Luther Guthrie’s girl done ran off. 
                        To be honest it don't much surprise 
                        me. She always has been a wild 
                        card. Was only a matter of time 
                        before--well, it ain’t any business 
                        of mine I suppose. Give us a holler 
                        if ya spot her, will ya?

                                 CHASE
                        I’ll keep an eye out.

                                 WERNER
                        Alrighty partner, stay dry.

           Hanging overhead we watch the rain fall away as the cruiser 
           drives off. In Chase's TRUCK BED the blatant outline of a 
           human body, poorly hidden under a TARP; feet sticking out and 
           all.

           INT. HUMPHRY’S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. YOUNG BOY’S ROOM. NIGHT

           A HEART MONITOR beeps. A RESPIRATOR hisses. Tubes run out of 
           a gravely ill YOUNG BOY. 

           Riley enters with a tray of food and places it beside him.

                                 RILEY
                        Kitchen says we’re runnin’ outta 
                        spinach. I tried tellin’ ‘em it’s 
                        just a little boy but they 
                        convinced Popeye’s in here eatin’ 
                        it all up.

           The boy fights to smile.

                                 RILEY
                        You’re looking stronger every day. 
                        ‘Fore long your muscles gon’ bust 
                        out your shirt.

           The boy emits a weak giggle. Riley leans in close, brushes 
           the hair back off his forehead.

                                 RILEY
                             (hushed)
                        I’m proud of you.

           INT. NURSE’S QUARTERS. MOMENTS LATER

           Riley enters the room, plucks off her gloves and begins 
           washing her hands. Another nurse, LYNETTE, washes her hands 
           at the next sink.

                                 RILEY
                        He’s on his way out.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Sorry, Riley.

                                 RILEY
                        Don’t waste your sympathy on me.
                             (beat)
                        I dunno what’s worse; when they got 
                        no shot at all or when there’s help 
                        just outta arms reach like that boy 
                        in there.

                                 LYNETTE
                        They both end up in the same place.

                                 RILEY
                        But they don’t have to is my point.
                             (beat)
                        Who ever said ‘money ain’t 
                        everything’ musta had a shit ton of 
                        it.

           Another nurse pops her head in the door.

                                 NURSE
                        Chase on the phone.

           HALLWAY

           Riley saunters over towards a PHONE mounted on the wall. 
           Picks up.

                                 RILEY
                        What.
                             (Listens)
                        WHAT?!

           EXT/INT. WALDRUP TRUCK. NIGHT

           Chase sits in his idling truck outside the hospital. Wet hair 
           plastered to his forehead, clothes stuck to his skin. His 
           mind running laps trying to digest what just happened and how 
           to explain it. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The trance breaks when he spots Riley jogging out from the 
           hospital, newspaper over her head to shield her from the 
           rain. She scurries up to the passenger door and pulls. It’s 
           locked.

                                 RILEY
                        Damnit, Chase!

           Chase snaps to and unlocks the door. Riley climbs in. She 
           looks at him anticipating an explanation, instead he simply 
           returns the stare.

                                 RILEY
                        Speak!

                        on my way home I stopped over at 
                        Gravelston Farm to pick up some 
                        eggplant 'cause I was hoping you'd 
                        fix up one of them eggplant 
                        casseroles but they wasn't sellin' 
                        em'cause of the rain n' all. But at 
                        that point I had my mind set on 
                        eggplant cassarole so I headed over 
                        to that stand out there on Rokeby 
                        with the little boy who got the eye

                        they had the road blocked off, 
                        somethin’ 'bout downed power lines

                        This can’t be real.

                        The girl ran off from home. Cop was 
                        lookin’ for her.

                                 RILEY
                        And he saw you?!

                                 CHASE
                        Yeah, but I had already hid her 
                        body.

                                 RILEY
                        Hid her body!? Jesus fuck, Chase. 
                        You better hope you wasn’t spotted.

                                 CHASE
                        Ain’t no way. I was all the way up 
                        on route 149, nobody saw me. But 
                        here’s the issue I took--

                                 RILEY
                        You know one of them farmers up 
                        there is gon’ find her first thing 
                        in the mornin’. Then the whole 
                        state gon’ be lookin’ for who done 
                        it and that cop gonna put two and 
                        two together.

                                 CHASE
                        They ain’t gon’ find her, Riley, 
                        that’s the issue I--

                                 RILEY
                        The hell they won’t. Right there on 
                        the side of the road like that. 
                        Won’t take ‘em but a few minutes.

                                 CHASE
                        They ain’t gon’ find her.

                                 RILEY
                        No? On what miracle?

           Chase glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR. Riley doesn't 
           understand. Chase jerks his head several times back towards 
           the TRUCK BED. This time Riley follows the cue. She twists 
           around and peers through the WINDOW back into the TRUCK BED 
           where her eyes find the TARP COVERED BODY.

           She looks back at Chase. He studies her expression. SLAP! 
           Riley’s hand across his face.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I couldn’t just leave her there! By 
                        the time I seen she was dead there 
                        was another car on top of me!

                                 RILEY
                        So you took her?! That’s about the 
                        dumbest thing you coulda done!

           Chase’s eyes tell us he’s realizing just how fucked he is. 

                                 CHASE
                        I dunno, I could--what if--whaddaya 
                        say we just roll her out here in 
                        front of the ER? It’ll look like 
                        she died on the way. 

                                 RILEY
                        If brains was grease you couldn’t 
                        slick the head of a pin. Think 
                        ‘about what you’re sayin’ before 
                        you say it.

           Chase doesn’t realize why his “plan” doesn’t line up.

                                 RILEY
                        They get hold of her n’ forensics 
                        won’t only tell how you killed her 
                        but what you had for supper ‘fore 
                        you did it.

           Anger and fear wells inside his gut.

                                 CHASE
                             (shouting)
                        She was in the middle of the road! 
                        In the rain! In the dark!

                        And she’s dead! What’s your point!?

           Chase ponders.

                                 CHASE
                        It was a damn accident. People will 
                        understand.

                        What people?

           Chase studies his wife’s face. Has something he wants to say, 
           quietly deliberates wether he should say it.

                        How you know the forensics won’t 
                        come looking for us?

           Riley considers taking a low blow but decides against it.

                                 RILEY
                        In three months I’m having this

                        without her father. End of 
                        discussion.

           Chase goes quiet. Can’t argue against that.

                                 CHASE
                        Alright. What’s next then?

           CLOSE UP ON A BEDSIDE CLOCK. The second hand sweeps past 
           making it 5:15 AM. BEAU SAWYER(60’s) lays in bed, his eyes 
           watching the ceiling fan.

           INT. SAWYERS BEDROOM. DAWN

           A faint blue glow seeps in through the curtains. The room is 
           barren, unwelcoming. If a woman ever lived here she is long 
           gone.

           With a grunt, Sawyer swings his legs out of bed and sits 
           looking off into space. He rubs his knees, his elbows, coughs 
           up some phlegm that has accumulated in his lungs over night, 
           then stands.

           He heads towards the bathroom walking with the unsteady 
           hobble of a man who has seen life catch up with him.

           BATHROOM

           He shaves in front of a fogged mirror.

           CLOSE UP

           Two feet slipping into black boots.

           KITCHEN

           Two eggs breaking into a pan.

           A COFFEE MUG being filled half way with coffee, the other 
           half with WHISKY.

           Dressed in POLICE UNIFORM, Beau Sawyer sits alone at his 
           Formica kitchen table in the lonely silence that he has grown 
           accustomed to. He chews his eggs, disengaged; his eyes cold 
           and distant.   

           EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY

           On an angle high and wide above the local police station we 
           watch a cruiser pull into the puddle ridden parking lot. 
           Sawyer steps out, walks through the mud and into the 
           building.

           INT. POLICE STATION. DAY

           The interior reflects the consequences of statewide budget 
           cuts. An elderly secretary, BETSY (60’S) greets him.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Still north of the dirt.

           INT. POLICE STATION. BACKROOM. MOMENTS LATER

           Werner sits reclined in a chair watching the morning news. 
           Sawyer enters. 

                                 WERNER

                        Deputy.

           Sawyer takes a seat adjacent to Werner, coffee mug in his 
           hand. After a few moments of silence...

                                 SAWYER
                             (re: the tv)
                        Anythin’ good?

           Werner thinks.

                                 WERNER
                        Lots a rain.

                                 SAWYER
                        Mmhmm.

           Both men continue to gaze at the screen. The newscaster talks 
           about what else--rain. Sawyer sips his coffee.  For the 
           duration of the conversation neither of them take their eyes 
           off the TV. 

                                 WERNER
                        Luther Guthrie’s girl snuck out the 
                        house last night and she ain’t been

                        over there in a bit, do some 
                        investigative work.

                        Mmhmm.

           INT.GUTHRIE’S KITCHEN. DAY

           LUTHER GUTHRIE, MRS. GUTHRIE and Beau Sawyer sit around the 
           kitchen table. Werner stands behind Sawyer, arms folded. 
           Luther fires up a cigarette. Sawyer addresses the couple with 
           a calm, steady cadence.

                                 SAWYER
                        Nobody is making those accusations, 
                        Luther. It’s protocol, that’s why I 
                        ask. And no, Ma’am, I ain’t 
                        accusing you of poor parenting. 
                        Once again, just protocol.

                                 LUTHER
                        Don’t think I don’t know what y’all 
                        think ‘bout me. What ya’ll think 
                        ‘bout us.

                                 SAWYER
                        It ain’t like that, Luther.

                                 WERNER
                        Luther, it ain’t like that.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Well then how come you can just 
                        assume she up ‘n ran off?

                                 SAWYER
                        Well, Ma’am, I got a bevy of facts 
                        laid out in fronta me, you see, and 
                        facts don’t lie.

                                 WERNER
                        They don’t lie, Ma’am.

                                 SAWYER
                        It's my duty, as a law man, to 
                        examine those facts presented to 
                        the best of my ability.

                        If my intuition is on point, which 
                        it often is, those facts generally 
                        lead to me making some sort of 
                        assumption as to the course of 
                        events that took place. Now, your

                        of her clothes is missin', too. 
                        That's also a fact. Her tooth brush 
                        is missin'....fact. With no sign of 
                        forced entry and no sign of a

                        girl left outta here on her own 
                        volition. Why? I dunno.  

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Don’t make no sense. She got no 
                        reason to leave. Got nowhere’s to 
                        go.

                                 SAWYER
                        Perhaps. But the young are seldom 
                        rational.

                                 LUTHER
                        So that’s that?
                             (smacks hands together)
                        Poof. She disappeared like piss in 
                        a lake. Now what? We supposed to 
                        sit on our ass till she come back? 
                        Is that what a law man does? Hell’s 
                        bells, I’ll be damned.

                                 LUTHER
                        I’d hate to see you two wastin’ 
                        valuable time that could be spent 
                        eatin’ at Jackie’s and pullin’ cats 
                        outta trees.

           Stone cold faces from Sawyer and Werner. Luther takes a long 
           drag from his cigarette. Exhales. Then leans forward.

                                 LUTHER
                        Betcha' this. If Howie Boykins 
                        little girl was missin' you'd have 
                        every cop in Mississippi lookin'.

                        The back door was open plain as

           Sawyer is unfazed by Luther’s rising temper.

                        You was born 'n bread in Louise, 
                        Luther. You know better than anyone 
                        how it is. Quiet town. Good people. 
                        Christian people. We don't bother 
                        nobody and nobody bothers us. Why 
                        your girl left?
                             (shrugs)
                        But then again there are a whole 
                        lot a things that happen in this 
                        world that I ain't sure of.

           Sawyer holds up his hand to indicate for Werner to stop but 
           holds eye contact with the Guthries.

                                 SAWYER
                        They got the point, deputy. My 
                        hunch tells me she gon' come back 
                        when she's ready n' willin. Like 
                        you said, she got nowhere to go.

                        Yessir. Well I was under the 
                        impression it was the humidity in 
                        the air that weakened their leg

                        Either way tell me why I drove past 
                        the Keenan Ranch the other day and 
                        there wasn’t but one cow lying 
                        down. Hell I think some of them was 
                        square dancin’. Buncha dumb cows.

                                 SAWYER
                        Could be.

                        that question we wouldn’t be 
                        sittin’ here sippin’ on coffee, now

                        Odds are she’s holed up somewhere

                        another delinquent who’s equally if

                        I suppose they’re one in the same.

                        I wonder if she knows how worried

                        Yessir. I figure we should start 
                        askin’ ‘round. You know, people who 
                        might have seen her or know where 
                        she of ran off to.

                                 SAWYER
                        Wouldn’t be a bad place to start. 
                        Gotta be delicate now , deputy. 
                        Wouldn’t wanna stir up any 
                        commotion. Last thing we need is a 
                        big ol’ misunderstandin...those 
                        often get messy.

           P.O.V FROM GROUND

           Riley and Chase stand over us, glaring downwards. They look 
           perplexed, distraught, unnerved. Chase rubs his jaw. Riley 
           pulls her hair back into a ponytail. We see fiber glass and 
           piping in the ceiling, suggestive of an unfinished basement.

                                 RILEY
                        Jesus. Fuckin’. Christ.

           FLIP TO THEIR VIEW

           We are now staring down at the mangled BODY, back pack 
           resting next to it.

                                 RILEY
                        She gotta go.

                                 CHASE
                        Don’t look like she goin’ anywhere.

                                 RILEY
                        Right now you’re lookin’ at first 
                        degree and I’m gonna be the accomp-
                        uh, access--uh, whatever it is they 
                        give to the other person.

           She bends down and pulls one of the girls boots off. Clunk.

                                 CHASE
                        I don’t think those is your size.

           Riley walks over to a small IRON FIREPLACE, yanks open the 
           handle and pops the BOOT into the blaze. Chase looks on, 
           dumbfounded, waiting for an explanation. Riley wipes her 
           hands clean.

                                 RILEY
                        No evidence, no crime.

           She makes her way back over to the body and starts on the 
           other boot.

                                 RILEY
                        C’mon now, quit your dagum staring. 
                        This mess ain’t gon’ clean itself. 
                        All her clothes and everything in 
                        that bag need to go.

           Riley pulls off the other BOOT, clunk, and brings it over to 
           the FIREPLACE. Chase squats down, unzips the BACKPACK and 
           pulls out some clothing.

                                 RILEY
                        That’s how you wind up caught-- 
                        leaving belongings behind.

                                 CHASE
                             (re:the body)
                        ‘N whadda ‘bout her?

           Riley pauses, eyes up the small fireplace then the body.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 RILEY
                        Well God knows she ain’t fittin’ in 
                        there. You gon’ have to bury her 
                        out back.

           Chase cringes at the thought. He continues to pull items from 
           the BACKPACK and heave them over near the fireplace. The bag 
           of CHEERIOS lands among them. Riley picks it up.

                                 RILEY
                        No use in tossin’ these.

                                 CHASE
                        Huh?

           Chase is still on the floor digging through the back pack. He 
           pulls out the knotted BLACK TRASH BAG.

                                 RILEY
                        Were you not in the same bank as me 
                        earlier? Did you not hear what Sam 
                        Webb said? Things are changin' 
                        round here! Last time I checked 
                        food ain’t free and money don't 
                        grow on trees--

           Chase lets out a high-pitch shriek, startling Riley and 
           cutting her off mid sentence. He is on his knees holding the 
           BLACK TRASH BAG bag open, mouth agape.

                                 RILEY
                        What?!

           Chase remains frozen, staring into the bag.

                                 RILEY
                        What?!

           In a trance, Chase methodically stands up clutching onto the 
           trash bag, arms rigid as if holding a porcelain dish, eyes 
           still fixated inside.

                                 RILEY
                        Say somthin’ damnit!

           He turns the bag upside down, dumping its contents. A throng 
           of fat, rolled, RUBBER-BANDED BILLS flop onto the concrete 
           floor landing with a pleasant flutter.

           Riley's face softens, pure disbelief. She looks at the money, 
           then up at Chase. Chase looks at Riley, then back down at the 
           money. Both rendered speechless.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           All that can be heard is the crackle of the fireplace, rain 
           patter muffled through the basement windows.

           A craggy old women's voice breaks the silence. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s burnin’?

           A startled jump from Chase and Riley. They direct their 
           attention to the voice atop the staircase. Riley ducks her 
           head under the banister and looks up. Chase remains back near 
           the body, out of sight.

           Standing at the top of the staircase is an elderly women in a 
           nightgown holding a hot water bag.

                                 RILEY
                        Jesus, Momma you scared the piss 
                        outta me.

                        What in tarnation is gon’ on down 
                        der? It smell like the south end of 
                        a north bound cat.

                                 CHASE
                        We’re just--

                        Is that you down der, Chase?

           Chase looks to Riley, “should I answer”? Riley looks back, 
           “answer, idiot”.

                                 CHASE
                        Ye--yes, Ma’am.

                                 MOMMA
                        Huh?

                                 CHASE
                             (louder)
                        Yes, Ma’am.

           Momma takes a step down.

                                 RILEY         CHASE
                        No!                   No!  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She stops.

                        Basements’ flooded, Momma. You

                                 CHASE
                        Yeah, you stay put now. We don’t 
                        need you comin’ down here ‘n 
                        breakin’ a hip.

                                 MOMMA

                        No, I said we don’t nee--

                                 RILEY
                        Momma, please, would you?

           Silence. Long pause....

                                 MOMMA
                        You want Johnnycakes, too?

                                 RILEY
                        No, just--

                                 CHASE
                        I’ll take some Johnnycakes.

           Riley shoots Chase a menacing glare. He reconsiders. We hold 
           on the silence for a beat until we hear floor boards creak as 
           Momma recedes into the kitchen.

           Their attention then returns to the situation at hand. The 
           couple stands there in a mesmerized gaze--before them lays a 
           pile of money and a bootless dead girl.

                                 RILEY
                        Baby, if God has a sense of humor 
                        we’re lookin’ at it.

           EXT. GUTHRIE’S PORCH. DAY

           A gentle breeze rustles the leaves knocking the last of the 
           rain water loose. A lone crow caws somewhere in the distance. 

           Guthrie sits slumped languidly in his rocking chair. Swaying 
           gently. A lit cigarette dangles from his lips. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           His eyes glazed over, fixed on nothing in particular off in 
           the distance. Worry. Remorse. Confusion. Grief. 

           The sound of an ENGINE brings him back. He lifts his eyes and 
           turns his head towards the hum of the approaching vehicle. A 
           glimmer of hope. He slowly rises from his chair and begins to 
           make his way down the porch steps. 

           The source emerges from the cottonwoods. A MAIL TRUCK. It 
           stops; the mailman puts a few envelopes in Guthrie's mail box 
           and drives away.  

           Any seed of hope that had been planted immediately fades. 
           Guthrie flicks the cigarette off the porch and heads back 
           inside.

           INT.GUTHRIE’S KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER

           Luther enters. Mrs. Guthrie is on the phone. They look at one 
           another as she speaks.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE 
                             (into phone)
                        Oh sure.
                             (listens)
                        Yes, of course.
                             (listens)
                        Thank you, Wilma...I will. Buh bye 
                        now.

           She hangs up.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        She ain’t with Judee Ann either.

           Mrs. Guthrie waits for some reassurance from Luther but is 
           met instead with an agony stricken stare. Her chin quivers.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                             (frazzled)
                        Oh, Luther.

           Luther walks over and embraces his wife. She buries her face 
           in his shoulder. They share a moment of sadness...

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        I need you to tell me everything is 
                        gon’ be alright.

           Hesitation. Luther doesn’t know if everything will be 
           alright. He does his best.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        She’s gonna come home. And she’ll 
                        knock right on that front door.

           EXT. WALDRUP’S BACK YARD.DAY

           We are looking down at the DEAD GIRL, wrapped in her 
           raincoat. Her eyes, still open, stare right back. A calm, 
           peaceful look on her face. Her skin has turned blueish gray, 
           rigor mortis has taken it course.  

           Plop. A load of dirt splashes over her face. We pull back to 
           see that she lays in a DITCH. Chase stands over her, 
           sweating, fatigued. He throws another shovel load full of 
           dirt over the body and wipes his brow.  

           INT. WALDRUP’S KITCHEN. DAY

           Riley sits at the KITCHEN TABLE. Piles of BILLS in front of 
           her have been separated by denomination. Mostly $1’s, $5’s 
           and $10’s. Definitely not drug money.

           She takes another roll, peels off the rubber-band, licks her 
           thumb and begins to count.

           Chase enters the kitchen and stands behind her. Sweat bleeds 
           through his shirt around the chest and underarms, dirt covers 
           his face and hands.

           Riley eyes him up, takes it in, nods, then goes back to 
           counting.

                                 CHASE
                             Where’s your Mother?

           No answer.

                                 CHASE
                        Ry, where’s your--

                                 RILEY
                        Shhh....countin’.

           Riley finishes sorting the money in her hand.

                                 RILEY
                        Momma’s at Sullivan’s.
                             (beat)
                        There’s already ‘nough here to

                        done sortin’.

                                 RILEY
                        The bank, the IRS, the credit card 
                        whatever else.

                                 CHASE
                        No, who did Momma go to Sullivan’s 
                        with?

                        Who you think she went with? Did 
                        you not hear what I said? There’s 
                        over eight thousand dollars here 
                        and I ain’t done countin’.

                        I’m headed into town.

           Riley takes her eyes off the money for the first time and 
           turns to face Chase.

                                 RILEY
                        For what?!

           EXT. GAS STATION. DAY

           A HIGH POWERED HOSE blows water into a TRUCK BED. Bloody 
           water careens through the grooves of the truck bed and drips 
           onto the ground. Chase’s troubled eyes scan the surroundings.

           EXT/INT.WALDRUP PICKUP TRUCK.DAY

           Chase drives alone in silence. Exhausted eyes, the weight of 
           the world on his shoulders. He SLAPS himself twice in the 
           cheek trying to get a grip. The gravity of the situation 
           beginning to set in.  

           INT. HARDWARE STORE. DAY

           A bored STORE CLERK watches as Chase enters the door.

                                 CHASE
                        Where your headlights?

                                 CLERK
                        You mean headlamps?

                        No, you mean headlamps.

                        No, I--what’s the difference?

                                 CLERK
                        Headlamp is the technical term for 
                        the device itself. Headlight is 
                        referin’ to the beam of light it 
                        produces.

           Chase returns a blank stare.

                                 CLERK
                        Dodge, Ford or Chevy?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Chase stands in front of a row of HEADLAMPS. His eyes study 
           the options.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Chase stands in front of the clerk. He places a HEADLAMP on 
           the counter.

                                 CLERK

           Chase tenses, swallows hard.

           Chase throws some cash on the counter.

                        Here. Gimme the damn light.

           He grabs the HEADLAMP and begins to leave the store. The

                        Okay, sir.....I do urge you to re-
                        issue the claim in six months time. 
                        At that point--

                        No, you see, that’s --six months is

                        At this time your son’s condition 
                        is not covered under your current 
                        HMO plan. Fortunately, you do have 
                        the option to raise your monthly 
                        premium--

                                 WEBB
                        The premium is already sky high, 
                        and the, the uh, the deductible is -
                        -last time I was told the same 
                        thing and I told you people I can’t 
                        afford to pay more.

                                 VOICE
                        Sir, this is why I suggest you wait 
                        six months and perhaps by then you 
                        can reconsider adjusting your 
                        monthly premiums.

           INT.WALDRUP’S KITCHEN. DAY

           Riley stands over the KITCHEN TABLE which has now been swept 
           clean of bills. Several SHOEBOXES sit meticulously arranged 
           in a row on the table, chock full of cash. 

           She carefully arranges the last stack of bills, places a 
           rubber band around them, and stuffs them into one of the shoe 
           boxes. 

           She takes a step back and surveys the finished product. Her 
           masterpiece. At first her glare is intense, deeply focused. 
           As her eyes dance along the boxes her gaze begins to soften. 
           A small, satisfied grin creeps across her face. 

           She closes her eyes and slowly tilts her head up towards the 
           ceiling as if reciting a prayer. Tranquility.

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!!!

           She spastically leaps out of her moment of bliss.

                                 MUFFLED VOICE
                             (through door)
                        Sheriff’s department.

           Riley leaps into action. She grabs two of the  SHOEBOXES 
           under her arms and sprints into the living room where she 
           tosses them on the SOFA. 

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!!!

                                 MUFFLED VOICE
                             (through door)
                        Sheriff’s department. Anyone in?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Riley runs back into the kitchen; her socks cause her to slip 
           and slide around the linoleum floor. She is clumsy. Awkward. 
           She picks up two more boxes and heaves them into the LIVING 
           ROOM. Bills flop out as they land.

                                 RILEY
                             (shouting)
                        Justa sec.

           She picks up the final box and runs it into the living room. 
           Does her best to scoop the fallen bills back into their 
           respective boxes but in her frenzy leaves some on the ground.

           Then she runs back to the FRONT DOOR, grabs the HANDLE and 
           pauses for a second. She takes a long, deep breath to compose 
           herself.

           KNOCK KNOCK!-- It startles' her, she flinches, then pulls the 
           door open quickly. Sawyer and Werner stand in front of her. 
           Werner is mid shout.

                                 WERNER
                        Sherrifs dep--...Mornin’, Ma’am.

                                 WERNER
                        Well actually, Ma’am, this here is 
                        Sherriff Sawyer, I’m Deputy Werner.

                        What’s the matter? I didn’t call no 
                        police.

                                 WERNER
                        Right, well we’re here for

                                 WERNER
                        That’s right, questionin’.

                                 SAWYER
                        We’d just like a word with your 
                        husband, Ma’am, he ‘round?

                                 RILEY
                        No he ain’t. And whateva it is you 
                        gotta ask him you can ask me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 SAWYER
                        With all due respect, Ma’am, I 
                        don’t believe you could provide us 
                        with the answers we’re lookin’ for.

                                 RILEY

                                 WERNER
                        No, Ma’am, that ain’t the case. 
                        Luther--

           He looks to Sawyer for permission. Sawyers gives him the 
           approving nod.

                                 WENRER
                             (hushed voice)
                        Not to cause any concern but Luther 
                        Guthrie’s girl snuck out the house 
                        last night and she ain’t been home 
                        yet.

                                 RILEY
                        Uh-huh.

                                 WERNER
                        So we're taking all the 
                        precautionary steps and measures 
                        required as enforcers of the law 
                        and all the uh, all the 
                        investigative processes that uh, 
                        are necessary in such a predicament 
                        to see if we can't uh,--you see the 
                        Guthrie's are gettin' worried, 
                        naturally, you know, picturin' the 
                        worst and whatnot. I don't have 
                        kids of my own so I can't 
                        realistically put myself in their 
                        shoes or what have you--

                                 SAWYER
                        Deputy Werner saw your husband up 
                        on route 149 same night the girl 
                        went missin’, not too far from the 
                        Guthrie’s home. Figured your 
                        husband may have seen her. Saw what 
                        direction she was headed.

                                 RILEY
                        Well, he didn’t.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SAWYER
                        Okay. Well. Once again. With all 
                        due respect. How can you be sure of 
                        that?

           An awkward silence ensues. Riley stands arms folded, glaring 
           back at Sawyer. His look is softer but his eye contact 
           remains strong.

                                 RILEY
                        ‘Cause, he didn’t say nothin’ ‘bout 
                        it.

           Werner's eyes have shifted away from Riley in the DOOR FRAME 
           and have moved back into the LIVING ROOM where he squints at 
           several turned over SHOEBOXES.

                                 SAWYER
                        Right. When was the last time you 
                        saw your husband, Ma’am?

           Werner’s eyes have made Riley nervous. She steps outside and 
           pulls the front door closed behind her.

                                 RILEY
                        Listen, when I see Chase I’ll tell 
                        him to give y’all a holler.

           The sound of a TRUCK ENGINE accompanied by gravel crunching 
           under tires grabs everyone’s attention.

           EXT/INT. WALDRUP’S TRUCK. SAME

           Chase pulls the truck into the DRIVE WAY. From his P.O.V we 
           see Riley, Werner and Sawyer congregated on his front steps. 
           They all turn in unison and stare daggers at him as he 
           approaches.  

                                 CHASE
                             (under his breath)
                        Jesus Christ.

           EXT. WALDRUP’S FRONT STEPS. SAME

           The three watch as Chase's truck comes to a stop. He throws 
           the gear into PARK. The engine groans. The trio continues to 
           stare at him. He stares back.

           EXT/INT. WALDRUP’S TRUCK. SAME

                                 CHASE 
                        Oh boy.
           EXT. WALDRUP’S FRONT STEPS. SAME

           Several long, agonizing seconds pass before Chase cuts the 
           engine off. He timidly opens the door. Creek. He climbs out.

                                 CHASE
                             (nervous)
                        Howdy.

           SMASH CUT:

           INT. WALDRUP’S BATHROOM. DAY

           Chase is on all fours VOMITING violently into the toilet. 
           Riley stands in the door frame.

                                 RILEY
                        Pull yourself together.

           He hesitates over the toilet, burps, then sits on his ass, 
           back against the wall. Short of breath, vomit gathered in the 
           corners of his mouth.

                                 RILEY
                        You’re fine, they didn’t suspect 
                        nothin’. For all they know the girl 
                        up ‘n ran off on her own.
                             (beat)
                        Which she did. If they sniffed 
                        somethin’ we wouldn’t be sittin’ 
                        here right now.

           Chase nods.

                                 RILEY
                        But why you go ‘n tell ‘em you hit 
                        a deer? Everyone knows there ain’t 
                        no deer ‘round this time of year.

           Chase searches for an answer but finds none.

                                 RILEY
                        I'll tell you what, that girl out 
                        there makes me nervous. I don't 
                        like her just layin’ ‘round like a 
                        damn lawn ornament. Not with police 
                        shoving their noses here n' there. 
                        You might have to dig her on up  
                        and move her somewheres else...

           Chase, who’s head had been hanging, now perks up.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        ...and if you gon’ do it you gon’ 
                        have to do it soon. Ain’t much 
                        longer ‘fore she’s gon’ turn like 
                        spoiled meat--body gon’ rot into 
                        pulp, skin and flesh gonna be 
                        sliding off her bones and once that 
                        happens...

           Suddenly Chase jolts forward off the wall and pukes into the 
           toilet again.

                                 RILEY
                        ...things could get messy.

           EXT. TOW YARD. DAY

           A TOW TRUCK enters through the main gate hauling behind it a 
           broken down car.

           INT. TOW STATION/ AUTO SHOP. DAY

           Several TOW TRUCK DRIVERS sit around a table chatting. One is 
           telling a humorous story. The mood is light. Happy.

           Luther enters dressed in his soiled blue uniform, wearing a 
           scowl on his face, wiping oil from his hands with a rag. The 
           man telling the story is distracted by Luther’s presence. The 
           mood takes a noticeable shift downwards. The fun banter burns 
           out. The story teller shuts up all together.

           Nervous eyes watch Luther, gauge his mood. He feels them but 
           acts as if he doesn’t. Finally one brave DRIVER breaks the 
           tension.

                                 DRIVER
                        Your wife called, Luther.

           Luther doesn’t react, or seem to care.

                                 DRIVER
                        ‘Bout twenty minutes back.

           No response.

                                 DRIVER
                        Sounded upset....

           This, however, snags his attention.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUTHER
                        How does what she sound like 
                        concern you?

                                 DRIVER
                        It don’t.

                                 LUTHER
                        You felt the need to bring it up.

                                 DRIVER
                        I dunno...I thought maybe you 
                        should know.

           The other drivers are watching, tensing up, feeling sorry for 
           their companion who has ventured onto dangerous ground.

                                 LUTHER
                        Anything else you care to tell me 
                        ‘bout how I deal with my wife?

           The Driver has no response. His fate has been set. Luther 
           approaches the Driver, who is still sitting in a chair, and 
           stands right before him. Other drivers brace for impact.

                                 DRIVER
                        I just....I thought it coulda been, 
                        I thought maybe it was news ‘bout 
                        your girl--

           Before the word “girl” fully leaves the Drivers mouth Luther 
           has him by the THROAT. A death grip which collapses the 
           windpipe entirely.

                                 OTHER DRIVERS (IN UNISON)
                        C’mon Luther / Easy now / Let him 
                        go.

           Their attempts at salvation are uninspired, and although 
           Luther is outnumbered 5 to 1 nobody does anything. Instead 
           they sit and watch as Luther chokes their co-worker like a 
           rag doll.

           The man struggles to free himself but this only agitates 
           Luther further.

           Luther lifts the man off his chair by the neck and SLAMS him 
           into the wall. His grip tightens. The Driver’s face is 
           turning blue. Blood vessels in his eyes rupture.

           Luther leans in close. Nose to nose.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUTHER
                        Say somethin’ ‘bout them again and 
                        I’ll cut the air out your lungs.

           With that he lets go, the Driver gasps and crumples to the 
           floor. The other drivers watch in shame but not awe, Luther 
           has done something like this before--they knew he had it in 
           him.

           EXT.FIRST NATIONAL BANK. DAY

           Chase and Riley pull up in their truck outside the bank.  In 
           unison they both glare at the DUFFLE BAG full of money then 
           at the bank.

                                 RILEY
                        Don’t fuck this up.

           INT.SAM WEBB’S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

           Webb has a look on his face as if he was just asked something 
           peculiar. Riley and Chase are on the edge of their seats-
           hanging on Webb’s every word.  After several long seconds....

                                 WEBB
                        Well...I must say, that would be 
                        peculiar.

           Chase and Riley slump back in their seats, deflated after not 
           hearing the response they wanted. 

                                 WEBB
                        I suppose it's possible for folks 
                        to stumble across an unforeseen 
                        fortune...lottery perhaps, or maybe 
                        the timely death of a family member 
                        which would result in a life 
                        insurance settlement, but then 
                        again if the death was too timely 
                        that would cause a fuss in and of 
                        itself. 

                                 RILEY
                        What if there ain’t a good reason? 
                        What if the debts are just paid off 
                        and that’s that?

                                 WEBB
                        Well, it would depend on how much 
                        debt we’re talkin’ about. If--

                        three dollars and twenty eight 
                        cents.

                                 WEBB
                        Well--

                                 RILEY
                        And an undisclosed automobile 
                        payment.

           Webb looks uneasy.

                                 WEBB
                        I’m assuming this hypothetical 
                        fortune would come in the form of 
                        cash?

                                 RILEY
                        Cold n’ hard.

                                 WEBB
                        Well, you see, there are some 
                        instances in which cash just wont 
                        be accepted. Credit card bills, 
                        mortgage payments, back taxes--
                        things of that nature. You can’t 
                        walk into the IRS and just slap 
                        down a bag of money.

           To the Waldrup’s this news is more than discouraging.

                                 RILEY
                        So then it would all go down the 
                        toilet?

                                 WEBB
                        ‘Course it wouldn’t. What would hap-
                        -and we’re still speakin’ 
                        hypothetically--what would happen, 
                        hypotherically, would be the cash 
                        would get entered into a bank 
                        account and from there checks could 
                        be written out.

                                 RILEY
                        And what if there’s a lien on that 
                        account? And they can’t open any 
                        new ones?

           Webb is now fully aware of their ploy and the tension on his 
           face shows it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Well the bank is aware of--there 
                        wouldn’t be any way to, uh...sneak 
                        anything in without entering some 
                        murky waters. It’s bank policy.

                                 RILEY
                        Whaddaya sayin’?

                        Nothin’. What’re you sayin’?

           An awkward silence. Webb sweats it out. Riley stares at him 
           hoping he may cave, Webb notices this but again doesn't want 
           to go there. Chase just looks nervous.

                                 WEBB

                        I understand the walls are closin’ 
                        in and when push comes to shove we 
                        gotta look out for our own neck...

                        know about it. Or else, being the 
                        Christian that I am...
                             (even lower)
                        I would feel obligated to bring it 
                        to attention.

           Long silence. Tense, darting  eye contact.

                                 CHASE
                        Christ, Sam, we went boar huntin’ 
                        together!

           EXT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK. DAY

           Chase and Riley lean up against their TRUCK. Defeat has 
           engulfed them both.  Riley looks straight ahead as she 
           speaks. Chase waits for her to speak.

                                 RILEY
                        That wasn’t good.

                                 CHASE
                        Sure wasn’t.

                                 RILEY
                        He wasn’t as receptive as I hoped 
                        he would be.

                        Sure do.

           Long pause. Neither of them wants to say what’s coming next.

                        We on our own.   We gotta kill him.

           They look at one another for the first time in the 
           conversation--surprised by what the other said.

                                 RILEY
                        What!?

                        You said you wanna kill Sam Webb.

           Chase realizes the enormity of his comment.

                                 CHASE
                        What’d you say?

                        I like your plan better.

           A long silence ensues. Both Riley and Chase look off into the 
           distance. Mulling over the situation they’re in and 
           contemplating how to best get out of it. Chase glides his 
           hand across Riley’s STOMACH with a gentle, fatherly touch.

                                 CHASE
                        She got an angel watchin’ over her

           Tears begin to sizzle in Riley’s eyes. She fights them back. 
           Lays her head on Chase’s shoulder. His arm around her, 
           comforting his wife with his eternal loyalty.

           INT. SAM WEBB’S OFFICE

           Hold on his face. He’s thinking. Deep. Long. Hard. A clock 
           ticks. Cluck. Cluck. Cluck.

           He’s eyes move onto something sitting on his desk-- out of 
           our sight. He holds them there for a long while.

           Flip to reveal what he’s looking at. A FRAMED PICTURE of his 
           son--the SICK BOY from the hospital. Webb’s mind is made.

           He picks up the office phone and dials.

           EXT. RUNDOWN HOUSE. DAY

           Sawyer and Werner stand on the stoop of a very modest home.  
           Junked car parts and tattered plastic toys clutter the lawn.  
           A malnourished dog barks hysterically from his chained dog 
           house.

           Sawyer knocks on the door.

                        How you know this boy’s friends 
                        with the Guthrie girl?

           The door opens. A scrawny, wife-beater sporting, CLAYTON 
           JONES (17) takes one look at the officers before trying to 
           slam the door shut. Sawyer stops it with his hand.  

           Clayton realizes his attempt has failed and turns to bolt 
           back inside. He doesn't make it far before WHAP! His MOTHER 
           slaps the side of his head sending him toppling to the floor.

           INT. CLAYTON’S LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER

           Old plywood paneling. Dated furniture. A creeking ceiling 
           fan. Clayton sits on his couch messaging the side of his 
           head. His Mother sits next to him, poised to strike again. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Ma’am, I can assure you although

                        less than savory activities in his 
                        day that’s not what brings us here.

           Clayton squares his chest--a moment of triumph over his

           WHAP! Clayton’s Mother slaps him upside the head again.

                                 CLAYTON’S MOTHER
                        What I tell you’bout bein’ smart!?

                        Ma’am, it’s not necessary to strike 
                        the boy.

                        law.

           Sawyer subtly shakes his head at Werner “now’s not the time”. 
           Clayton holds a trained eye on his Mother.

                                 CLAYTON
                        I don’t know where she at.

                                 SAWYER
                        So that’s startin’ with the fact 
                        that you’re aware she’s missin’?

                                 CLAYTON
                        Everyone knows she missin’.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Not too well. A medium amount I’d 
                        say.

                                 SAWYER

                        That’s what I said.

                        Would you say it was a medium

           INT. WALDRUP’S DINING ROOM.NIGHT

           Chase, Riley and Momma sit around the table eating their 
           Chicken fried steak dinner. Sounds from the TV stream in from 
           the living room. Chase hasn’t touched his food.

                                 MOMMA
                             (re: Chase’s food)
                        What’s the matta wit it?

                                 CHASE
                        Nothin’. It smells good. My 
                        stomach’s tender is all.

                                 MOMMA
                        It ain’t gonna eat itself. Pour 
                        some of the gravy over top. I left 
                        the giblets in.

                                 RILEY
                        The chicken turned out good, Momma.

                                 MOMMA
                        I know, I’m eatin’ it.

           Momma shoots a cutting stare at Chase. He feels it and 
           responds by forcing a bite into his mouth.

           Looking to Riley.

                                 CHASE
                             (mouth full)
                        I wonder if the chicken ever 
                        thought ‘bout leaving it’s nest.

                                 RILEY
                        What?

                        Maybe a fox been lingerin’ ‘round 
                        waitin’ for the chicken to slip up.

           It takes a moment for Riley to pick up on the innuendo.

                                 RILEY
                        Yeah? And where you think the 
                        chicken would go?

                                 CHASE
                        I suppose it could take all them 
                        eggs its just found ‘n go build 
                        another nest somewhere’s safe. 
                        Somewhere’s that don’t have a dead 
                        chicken buried out back that will 
                        only bring about more fox’s.

                                 MOMMA
                        How ‘bout it goes into your mouth 
                        and muffles this nonsense.

                                 RILEY
                        The fox’s are dumber than a box of 
                        hair and there ain’t as many eggs 
                        as you think.

                                 MOMMA
                        Eat the food ‘fore it grow cold.

                                 RILEY
                        The chicken was born in that nest, 
                        raised in that nest, watched her 
                        daddy die in that nest and sure as 
                        HELL ain’t leavin’ it for no fox!

           Silence falls over the table.

           KNOCK KNOCK at the front door. They look at eachother. 
           Visitors are rare.

           Chase opens the front door. Sam Webb stands on the other side 
           looking unsure of himself.

           INT. WALDRUP’S LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER

           Riley enters with a pot of coffee and joins Chase and Sam 
           Webb. Webb wrings his fingers, fusses with his hair, loosens 
           his collar--all the telltale signs of a nervous man.

                                 WEBB
                        I take my job seriously. I respect

                        man.

           Riley and Chase are put off by Webb’s edgy intensity.

                        You came all the way here to tell

                        When my oldest boy was playin’ ball 
                        I paid Coach Gilroy 500 dollars to 
                        put him up on varsity. And last 
                        year at the county fair I placed 37 
                        orders of my wife’s rhubarb pie to 
                        see to it she placed first. ‘Course 
                        neither of them ever found out but 
                        I did it ‘cause I care ‘bout them. 
                             (beat)
                        Is it right being dishonest? I’d 
                        like to think so. If the intentions 
                        are right and nobody gets hurt.

           Long pause. Chase and Riley look at one another, confused. 
           Webb contemplates. Then...

                                 WEBB
                        I don’t wanna know where y’all got

           Webb stands.

                        Maybe I should--

           Webb eyes the door, then sits back down. He truly is 
           conflicted. A long, pregnant silence.

                                 WEBB
                        I don’t wanna know how y’all got 
                        that money.

                        You ain’t have to. Chase, tell him 
                        he ain’t have to’.

           Pause. Chase, still uncertain, obeys his wife.

                                 CHASE
                        You ain’t have to.

           Again Webb contemplates. His eyes move back and forth between 
           the couple. Decisions, decisions.

                                 WEBB
                        It’s simple. You give the cash to 
                        someone you trust, they put it in 
                        their account under their name and 
                        write off checks to everyone you 
                        owe.

                                 RILEY
                        What?

                                 WEBB
                        You give the cash to someone you--

                        I heard what you said but I--you 
                        want us to give that money to 
                        someone else?

                                 WEBB
                        I don’t want you to do anything. 
                        I’m tellin’ you that’s the only way 
                        it would work. The only way.

                                 RILEY
                        So we just sign it over to them?

                                 WEBB
                        There’s no signing involved. No 
                        paperwork. It’s strictly under the

                                 RILEY
                        No record?

                        And what if we don’t trust nobody?

           Webb shrugs.

                                 WEBB
                        You’re gonna have to. What other

                        No bank in the country gonna let

                        you got a government lien on the 
                        current one. Paired with your toxic 
                        bankin’ records, they’ll tell ya to 
                        get lost. I can assure you of that.

                                 CHASE
                        Then I’ll ask same my wife did: You

                        us that?

                        I came to tell y’all I can help.

                                 RILEY
                        Why should we trust you?

                                 WEBB
                        I know my way through the system 
                        better than anyone. I know how to 
                        get caught. I know how to not get 
                        caught. I know what they do to 
                        those who do get caught. I’m 
                        puttin’ just as much on the line as 
                        y’all are. And I know if you hand

                        in this world I got by myself.

           CLOSE UP ON HUMAN TARGET PAPER

           BANG! A BULLET rips through the chest.

           EXT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

           Flip to see Sawyer holding a RIFLE, smoke trickling from the 
           barrel. Werner standing to his side.

                                 WERNER
                        Sweet shot, Sheriff.

                                 SAWYER
                        Ain’t so sweet if ya on the other 
                        end.

                                 WERNER
                        No sir, that’s for sure.

           Sawyer cocks the barrel, the chamber regurgitates a shell.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’m cleanin’ you out today, son. 
                        I’m up what? Sixty? Seventy now? 
                        Your wife’s gonna be madder than 
                        hell. Speakin’ of which, how’s she 
                        been?

                                 WERNER
                        Well, you know.

                                 SAWYER
                        No, I don’t. That’s why I asked.

                                 WERNER
                        Welp. How’s that sayin’ go? ‘Are ya 
                        married or are ya happy’?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Werner chuckles. Sawyer doesn't find this even slightly 
           amusing.

                                 SAWYER
                        Be careful, Dale. You’d be 
                        surprised how quickly someone can 
                        slip outta your life.

                                 WERNER
                        I ain’t gonna fret, Sheriff. I’d 
                        like to think there’s a reason 
                        behind everything that happens.

                                 SAWYER
                        Everything?

                                 WERNER
                        I’d like to think.

           Sawyer ponders.

                                 SAWYER
                        You ever heard of Loretta Fortner?

                                 WERNER
                        Can’t say I have.

                                 SAWYER
                        Mmm.

           Sawyer aims the rifle back up to the target and fires again. 
           BANG! He doesn't drop his eyes.

                                 SAWYER
                        18 months on the job I was called 
                        to Mrs. Fortner’s house....
                             (to himself)
                        ..or was it 19?...
                        anyhow,her husband  was in the 
                        yard, had been workin’ on a log 
                        with an axe, he hauled back, the 
                        damn thing slipped out his hands n' 
                        caught their seven year old son 
                        clean between the eyes. Doctors had 
                        to shave down the boy’s skull n’ 
                        yank the blade out so they could 
                        get the casket closed. Wasn't much 
                        longer before the husband put a 
                        bullet through his own head leaving 
                        Mrs. Fortner behind with nothin’ 
                        but her thoughts.
                             (looks at Werner)
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:
                                 SAWYER (CONT'D)
                        Why don't you go an' explain to her 
                        the reason behind that? I'm sure 
                        she's been wondering. I know I 
                        have...lives on Montgomery road.

           Of course Werner has no rejoinder. Who would?

                                 SAWYER
                        Oftentimes life has plans of its 
                        own. You can’t stop tomorrow from 
                        comin’.

           The echo of another GUN BLAST causes Sawyer and Werner to 
           look down the row. Forty yards down, in his own firing 
           station, Luther Guthrie reloads. He looks up and notices 
           them. He spits then heads over, shotgun in tow.

                                 WERNER
                        Aw shit.

           Guthrie heads towards them, his eyes burn holes through 
           Werner. Werner turns noticeably uncomfortable. Swallows hard.

                                 LUTHER
                        You boys figure you’d find my girl 
                        at a firin’ range?

                                 WERNER
                        G’mornin’, Luther.

                                 LUTHER
                        Ain’t nothin’ good ‘bout this 
                        mornin’ but glad to see y’all are 
                        enjoyin’ yourselves.

                                 WERNER
                        We’re--

                                 LUTHER
                        And don’t tell me you’re ‘doin’ 
                        everythin’ you can’, I ain’t dumb 
                        as a horse.

           Luther can smell the insecurity seeping out. Werner buckles 
           under the heat.

                                 SAWYER
                        Things are in the works.

                                 LUTHER
                        ‘Things are in the works’, what’s 
                        that ‘posed to mean?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 SAWYER
                        It means things are in the works.

           Luther, growing increasingly agitated by the minute, shifts 
           his eyes back and forth between Sawyer and Werner.

                                 LUTHER
                        Y’all don’t have any idea what 
                        you’re doin’ do ya?

                                 SAWYER
                        Why don’t you go home and be with 
                        your wife.

                                 LUTHER
                        I don’t take well to being told 
                        what to do.

                                 SAWYER
                        And I don’t take well to being told 
                        how to do my job.

           Good ol’ standoff. Toe to toe, nose to nose. Each man with a 
           high powered weapon in his hand. The tension is palpable. 
           Once again, Werner can’t handle it.

                                 WERNER
                        We questioned Chase Waldrup the 
                        other day.

                                 LUTHER
                        Didja now?

           Sawyer’s eyes cut deep into Werner. Werner notices and tries 
           to recover.

                                 WERNER
                        I spotted him ‘round your area near 
                        the time your girl went missin’. 
                        Thought maybe he seen her. No dice.

           Something goes off in Luther’s head-- a shred of suspicion. 

                                 LUTHER
                        Is that so?

           Werner nods, he thinks he has diffused the situation. 

                                 WERNER
                        We’re doin’ everything we can.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SAWYER
                        The riff between you and that boy 
                        is dead and buried. Don’t go 
                        lookin’ for a reason to dig it back 
                        up.

           Luther trades glares between both men then takes a step 
           closer to Sawyer.

                                 LUTHER
                             (to Sawyer, sinister)
                        I wonder if there’d be a heightened 
                        sense of urgency if you were the 
                        one missin’.

           Luther holds his eyes hard and tight on Sawyer. Sawyer stares 
           back. A long, silent, humming tension follows...

           A GUN SHOT in the distance causes Sawyer to FLINCH ever so 
           slightly. An imperceptible grin dashes across Luther’s face.

                                 LUTHER
                        I’m itchin’ to find out.

           Luther walks away, GUN slung over his shoulder. As Sawyer 
           watches Luther slink away he addresses Werner with a hint of 
           worry in his voice.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s why you don’t feed the 
                        animals.

           INT. UPSCALE BANK LOBBY. DAY

           Riley sits anxiously in a well furnished bank lobby. She 
           shifts. She fidgets. A wealthy couple sits near her. The 
           women’s eyes judge Riley--classism at its finest. Riley 
           notices. She shifts. She fidgets.

           A FEMALE BANK ATTENDANT comes out of her office. She’s stern, 
           composed and all too pleased with herself.

                                 FEMALE BANK ATTENDANT
                             (to Riley)
                        Why don’t ya come on in.
           EXT. UPSCALE BANK PARKING LOT. LATER

           The beat up, broke down, eye sore known as the Waldrup truck 
           sits in the back corner of the parking lot--the ugly 
           duckling.

           In the distance, out of focus, Riley exits the bank and heads 
           towards the truck. At first she is even keeled but as she 
           gets closer her emotions begin to wobble. It isn’t yet clear 
           if she is on the verge of elation or agony.

           INT. WALDRUP TRUCK

           Riley hops in and starts the engine. It coughs. Tries again. 
           No go. Again. Sounds like an emphysema patient. A beat.

           Her breath turns choppy. Her chin quivers. She slaps a hand 
           over her mouth. A sea of tears begin to pool in her eyes. She 
           fights them. Her face contorts. Her body begins to shake and 
           the tears break free and flee down her face like escaped 
           convicts.

           She can’t hold on any longer and finally gives in to her 
           emotions displaying a level of genuine vulnerability we have 
           yet to see. She buries her head in her chest and weeps.

           INT. WALDRUP’S KITCHEN. DAY

           Chase sits at the table staring at a stack bills and notice 
           letters. The numbers are daunting. The front door opens, it 
           brings his attention up. Riley marches in holding the duffle 
           bag. No eye contact. She stomps off into the bedroom. Chase 
           watches.

                                 RILEY
                        Call Sam Webb.

           The bedroom door SLAMS.

           INT. GUTHRIE’S BEDROOM. DAY

           Mrs. Guthrie lays in bed, covers pulled up to her throat, 
           eyes wide open and glossed over. Luther enters with a bowl of 
           soup.

                                 LUTHER
                        You should think ‘bout gettin’ up 
                        for a ‘lil, sweetheart. Layin’ in 
                        bed all day ain’t good for your 
                        legs.

           She responds by pulling the blankets over her head.

                                 LUTHER
                        At least get some food in ya.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Ain’t hungry.

                                 LUTHER
                        The food will make ya--

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Said I didn’t want nothin’, Luther.

           Beat. Blankets come off her head. She still faces away.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        I shouldn’t have cussed at her like 
                        that.

                                 LUTHER
                        This ain’t your fault. Mother’s n’ 
                        daughters argue, that’s what they 
                        do.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Police say in most cases like this 
                        they come home within a day or 
                        so...

           Luther ponders his wife’s reasoning; chooses his next words 
           carefully.

                                 LUTHER
                        Police said they spotted Chase 
                        Waldrup up the road from here same 
                        night Abby went missin’.

           Mrs. Guthrie flips around to face her husband. Her eyes 
           nearly POPPING out of her skull.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        You don’t think...

                                 LUTHER
                        I dunno.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        You got over on him pretty good, 
                        Luther. What made you think he 
                        wouldn’t come back for your neck?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUTHER
                        I didn’t think he’d come like this. 
                        Don’t think he has it in him. But I 
                        dunno.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Well you need to find out!
                             (beat)
                        I knew this would happen. When you 
                        run your jooks on people you 
                        puttin’ more than yourself at risk.

                                 LUTHER
                        You can’t place this on me.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Yes I can! And I will! I told you 
                        if you cheat people long ‘nough 
                        it’s gonna come back to bite us. I 
                        been told you that!

                                 LUTHER
                        My beef with Chase ain’t that 
                        serious.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        Look at ‘cha now tryin’ a 
                        backpedal. Luther, you wouldn't 
                        have brought it up if you didn’t 
                        think there wasn’t somethin’ to it.

                                 LUTHER
                        You know better than to tell a man 
                        how to conduct himself.

           Mrs. Guthrie flips back around, facing away.

                                 MRS. GUTHRIE
                        If I was talkin’ to a man I 
                        wouldn’t feel the need to.

           INT. ROADSIDE DINER. DAY

           Stuffy air. Overweight waitresses. A spattering of local riff 
           raff. Tacky 1970's color scheme. A squatting cliché. 

           A nervous Sam Webb enters and does a once over of the joint. 
           Then he makes his way past several OPEN booths before seating 
           himself in the far back corner. He removes his coat, turns it 
           INSIDE OUT, and hangs it on the coat rack next to his seat.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He does his best to act normal but his body language says 
           otherwise. His eyes bounce off each one of the patrons’--he's 
           looking for someone.

           A waitress comes to pour coffee, he shoos her away.  After a 
           minute or so a MAN comes out of the bathroom. An imposing 
           figure. Broad shoulders, deep set eyes--Ivan Drago meets 
           Anton Chigurh.

           Webb's INSIDE OUT COAT grabs his attention.

                                 MAN
                        You’re Sam Webb?

           Webb nods.

                                 MAN
                             (amused)
                        You?

                                 WEBB
                        Yeah.

                                 MAN
                        You were supposed to sit near a 
                        window.

                                 WEBB
                        Shoot,I thought you said don’t sit 
                        near a window. Shoot I’m sorry. We 
                        can move if you’d like.

           The Man takes a seat in Webb’s booth.

                                 MAN
                        Eh, it doesn't matter. You have it 
                        with you?

                                 WEBB
                        Yeah, I have it. Black duffle bag, 
                        sorted by denomination. Left it in 
                        the car like you said. What, what, 
                        uh, what should I call you?

                                 MAN
                        You don’t call me nothin’. You 
                        understand? Nothin’. As far as 
                        you’re concerned I don’t exist. Can 
                        you grasp that?

                                 WEBB
                        I got it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The man breaks into a wheezy, irritating laugh. Webb looks 
           mortified.

                                 MAN
                        Ease up, man. You look like your 
                        sack just caught fire. You want 
                        some bacon?

                                 WEBB
                        I’m okay.

                                 MAN
                        Have some bacon.

                                 WEBB
                        I’m okay.

                                 MAN
                        This place has fantastic bacon.

                                 WEBB
                        I’ll get some on the way out.

           The Man breaks into the annoying laugh again. Webb’s anxiety 
           grows worse.

                                 WEBB
                        Are you gonna be able to clean it?

           The Man’s laugh cuts off as if his plug was yanked from the 
           wall. His face hardens and he SLAMS his fists on the table. 
           Silverware rattles.

                                 MAN
                        What the fuck did you just say fat 
                        boy!? You think for one second I 
                        wasn’t capable of upholdin’ my end 
                        of the deal? Do I look like a 
                        sloppy-brained, limp dick, inbred 
                        redneck to you?

           Webb knows he has overstepped. Goes quiet. Several patrons 
           look over at the commotion. Webb wants to bail.

                                 MAN
                        Didn’t think so.

                                 WEBB
                        So we’re all straight on this?

                                 MAN
                        What’d I just say?

                        that. Me. I ask ‘em. 

           Webb nods.

                        you see,--Luther said we were all

                        was I pay you on the back end not 
                        up front, this was mapped out real 
                        clear, Luther didn’t tell me you 
                        expected that I was--

                                 MAN
                        I didn’t expect anything.

                                 WEBB

                        Around ten thousand--just over ten 
                        thousand.

                                 MAN

           Webb looks around the Diner. “What have I got myself into?”. 
           The man looks at him, amused by Webb's insecurity.

                                 MAN

           Then he erupts into his laugh again.

           The Man laughs once more then stands from the booth.

           Luther stands behind the counter, a smoldering ashtray in 
           front of him. The MAN from the diner leans against the other

                        when he comes rappin’ on your door

                        I’ll answer it.

                        What’s he gonna say?

           The MAN realizes he’s not changing Luther’s mind and doesn’t 
           dare to push it further.

                        It’s a nice chunk of change. Five

                        Five? He was talkin’ like it was

                        It’s still a good chunk of change. 
                        I just don’t understand where the

                        best.

           EXT/INT. SAWYERS CRUISER. DAY

           Sawyer drives along the dead-straight, 2-lane road named 
           ROUTE 149. The local news plays over the RADIO gently in the 
           background. Sawyer turns up the volume.

                                 RADIO VOICE
                        ...Local authorities continue their 
                        search for a Louise girl who 
                        disappeared from her home early 
                        last week...

                                 SAWYER
                        Disappeared?

                                 RADIO VOICE
                        ...while foul play has yet to be 
                        ruled out authorities currently 
                        have no leads.

                                 SAWYER
                        Leads? Foul play?

           Then his eyes spot something on the road ahead that demands 
           his immediate attention. Two flush, ripe, SKID MARKS in the 
           opposite lane cause Sawyer to slow down before coming to a 
           stop on the shoulder.

           His rearview mirror frames the SKID MARKS beautifully. Sawyer 
           picks up his POLICE RADIO.

                                 SAWYER
                             (into radio)
                        Sawyer to Deputy Werner, you on 
                        radio, Dale?

                                 WERNER
                             (through radio)
                        Right here, Sheriff.

                                 SAWYER
                             (into radio)
                        What was your 10-20 when you 
                        spotted Chase Waldrup on 149?

                                 WERNER
                             (through radio)
                        Oh....hmmm...I’d say I was near 
                        ‘bout a mile south of Rokeby road.

                        Maybe a mile point five. Couldn’t 
                        have been more I was--

                                 SAWYER
                        10-4.

           Sawyer hangs up the POLICE RADIO and peers back at the skid 
           marks in his rearview.

           EXT. RT. 149. MOMENTS LATER

           Sawyer walks alongside the SKID MARKS studying them like a 
           drill Sargent would his line of cadets. Then he throws his 
           eyes back down the road, towards the origin.

           He approaches skeptically, same path Chase took several night 
           prior. No sound save for the clucking of boots on pavement 
           and the whistle of the breeze.

           Immense concentration on his face. Werner's voice blares out 
           from the POLICE RADIO mounted on Sawyers shoulder-- 
           interrupting the silence.

                                 WERNER
                             (through radio)
                        I’d say a mile and a quarter that’s 
                        my best bet.

           Sawyer ignores this. He approaches the area Chase pulled the 
           body out of several nights before.

           Sawyer studies the ditch. One part in particular looks out of 
           place. The mud and grass has been interrupted by something. 
           Sawyer cocks his head to the side--intrigued by the disrupted 
           ground.

           He sees something. He squats and sticks his fingers in the 
           mud. Pulls them back out. Between his thumb and index finger 
           he holds a BLOODIED TOOTH.

           EXT. SAM WEBB’S HOUSE. DAY

           Webb’s truck pulls alongside his MAILBOX. Webb pulls out 
           today’s mail.

           INT. SAM WEBB’S KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER

           Webb plops the mail onto the counter and works lose his shirt 
           collar with the other hand. His eyes catch something. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He slows. Grabs an ENVELOPE from the pile of mail and tears 
           it open. 

           Jittery eyes scan the letter inside...

           His jaw slackens. His hand shakes. Sheer disbelief.

           INT. HUMPHRY COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. NURSES QUARTERS. DAY

           Riley sits and gazes at a static, 12 inch, black and white 
           TV. Lynette enters the room with an unlit CIGARETTE pinched 
           between her teeth.

                                 LYNETTE

                        with me.

           Riley doesn’t respond. 

                                 LYNETTE
                        Beats lookin’ at that TV.

           EXT. HUMPHRY COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. MOMENTS LATER

           Lynette and Riley stand outside the nurses quarters. Lynette 
           smokes.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Sam Webb was in here earlier.

           Riley looks at her, didn’t expect to hear that. Tenses up.

                                 LYNETTE
                        ...visiting his boy.

           Riley’s tension eases.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Did ya hear? The insurance company 
                        went ahead and accepted the claim. 
                        They gonna go ahead with the 
                        treatment.

           Riley is genuinely happy.

                        Well I’ll be.

                        Well, Lynette, God shine’s on those 
                        who do good for others.

                                 LYNETTE
                        I patch people up for a living an’ 
                        God ain’t shinin’ on me.

           Riley ignores the comment. Still feeling blissful.

                                 RILEY
                        I suppose it’s true what they say 
                        ‘bout good things comin’ in 
                        bunches.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Well then there ain’t enough 
                        bunches.

                                 RILEY
                        Quit it now, things ain’t that bad.

                                 LYNETTE
                        You go 'n try to tell that to the 
                        Guthrie's.... Police sayin’ the 
                        girl ran off but buzz ‘round town 
                        is there’s more to it. I might just 
                        believe it given this senseless 
                        world we live in.

           A hint of concern dashes across Riley’s face.

                                 RILEY
                        You been watchin’ too much crime

                                 LYNETTE
                        Maybe I have. But, Luther doesn’t 
                        strike me as the kind of man who’s 
                        gonna sit around and wait for the 
                        law to sort things out. You know

                        At the high school football game. 
                        Yeah, I remember.

           A long beat.

                                 LYNETTE
                        That girl means the world to him.

                        someone up n’ snatched her I 
                        wouldn't be surprised neither.

           Just then Chase pulls up in the TRUCK. He beeps twice and 
           waves. Lynette returns a small nod of the head.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Call it whatchya want but the older

                        by the bundle.

           INT. TOW YARD/AUTO SHOP.DAY

           Luther sits alone in the break room, eating lunch, watching 
           TV. A gentle knock on the door. Sam Webb steps in.

                                 WEBB
                        Hey sorry to bother you, Luther. 
                        How’s it goin’?

           Luther doesn’t take his eyes off the TV. They stay absently 
           glued to the screen for the duration of the conversation.

                                 LUTHER
                        Ain’t my partner neither.

                                 WEBB
                        Okay. Well who ever he is I gave 
                        him the money already, you see, he 
                        has the money, but then I got that 
                        news today and now I need the money 
                        back because--

                                 LUTHER
                        Then call the deal off.

                                 WEBB
                        That’s the thing,I tried callin’ 
                        the guy to let him know the deal’s 
                        off but the number you gave me 
                        ain’t workin’. So I was hoping 
                        maybe you could relay the message.

                                 LUTHER
                        You said the number don’t work. How 
                        you expect me to do that?

                                 WEBB
                        Right. But I thought maybe you knew 
                        where to find him, or another way 
                        to get in touch or--

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUTHER
                        You thought wrong.

                                 WEBB
                        Okay, well. Maybe you could tell me 
                        his name and I’ll go ahead and find-

                                 LUTHER
                        Don’t know his name.

                                 WEBB
                        We’re talkin ‘bout ten thousand 
                        dollars here for Christ sake!

           Luther finally turns and looks at Webb. Realizing he’s been 
           double-crossed by the Man, it shows on his face. Luther’s 
           hardened grill is too much for Webb.

                                 WEBB
                        Alright. Well I’ll let you get back 
                        to your lunch there.

           Webb turns and leaves the room.

           EXT/INT. WALDRUP’S TRUCK. DAY

           Chase and Riley pull into thier drive-way. From their P.O.V 
           we see a CAR PARKED. They look at each other with confusion. 
           Panic.

           With the truck still rolling Riley hops out and hurries 
           inside. 

           INT. WALDRUP’S LIVING ROOM. DAY

           Momma sits on the sofa in a nightgown and shower cap, eating 
           Ritz crackers and drinking Whisky.

                             (loud whisper)

                                 MOMMA
                        Where?

                                 MOMMA

                        Who’s car in the driveway?!

           Momma thinks for a second. Takes another cracker and nibbles.

                                 MOMMA
                        Oh, him. Some boy said he was 
                        fixin’ to appraise the house. Said 
                        he had to inspec’ it first.

           Riley turns and sprints out of the room. Chase comes busting 
           through the front door.

                                 CHASE
                        Who the hell’s here, Momma!

           INT. WALDRUP’S KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER

           Through the KITCHEN WINDOW we can see the HOUSE APPRAISER 
           outside in the back lawn. Riley comes dashing through the 
           kitchen, she doesn't notice him. She leaves.

           We hold on the image of him in the backyard. Clipboard in 
           hand. Staring at the part of yard that has been dug up.

           Riley slowly re-enters the kitchen, her neck craned towards 
           the window. She watches the man who is standing mere feet 
           from the buried dead girl.

           Chase enters the kitchen. 

                                 CHASE
                        What in the name of Christ is goin’ 
                        on?

           He notices Riley's gaze out the window. He follows her eyes. 
           He sees what she sees. They stare. The ice cracking beneath 
           their feet. 

           EXT.WALDRUP’S BACK YARD. MOMENTS LATER

           EARL, the house appraiser, scratches his head as he studies 
           the section of ground that has been dug up. Chase and Riley 
           cautiously emerge from the back door like guilty toddlers.

                                 EARL
                        So is it a boy or girl you got down 
                        there?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           A stiff silence sweeps across the lawn. Riley’s face goes 
           white. Chase wants to run for the hills. Earl approaches the 
           couple and offers a kind smile.

                                 EARL
                             (to Riley)
                        In your belly. Did you take a peek 
                        or are you gonna wait it out?

           Chase and Riley exhale relief from there lungs.

                                 EARL
                        Touchy subject, I get it. M' names

                        Well, you got a beautiful home here 
                        and a nice chunk of open land. Sure

                        around the bath tub this place 
                        looks spic n' span. You folks 
                        should be able to sell it for a

                        We ain’t sellin it. It’s gettin’ 
                        took from us.

           Awkward silence.

                        least ya got your health.

           Earl walks over to the dug up ground.

                                 EARL
                        I apologize for my insensitivity 
                        but the bank don’t tell me much.

                        this darned divot here is still a 
                        concern.

           He begins to stomp on it in an attempt to flatten it out. 
           Chase and Riley tense up.

                                 EARL
                        Issue is the septic system on this 
                        house is runnin’ near 25 years old 
                        n’ I’d bet my last dime the bank 
                        gon’ wanna replace it. A new septic 
                        system will raise the quote on this 
                        place by a considerable amount. 
                        Talk about flushin’ money down the 
                        toilet.

           Earl chuckles. Chase and Riley share a look.

                                 EARL
                        You happen to know how this came to

                        to be relocated. At least to 
                        somewhere else on the lawn. You can

           Earl scribbles something on his clipboard.

           The garage door is pulled open. Light pours in. We are on the 
           inside looking out at the silhouettes of Chase and Riley. 
           They enter.

           Riley begins rifling through some tools.

                                 RILEY
                        Where is it?

                                 CHASE
                        It might not be that simple...

           Riley keeps plowing through the tools.

                                 CHASE
                        ...her body might not be, uh...

                                 RILEY
                        She been dead 72 hours. We got 72 
                        more ‘fore she turns to cottage 
                        cheese. Now where the hell is it!?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Chase reaches up to a shelf and pulls down a SHOVEL. Riley 
           takes it from him.

                                 CHASE
                        It might not be all that simple.

                                 RILEY
                        And the tarp?

           Chase reaches up to another shelf and drags down a TARP. 
           Riley takes that, too.

                                 RILEY
                        I’ma dig her up ‘n you gon’ take 
                        her over to the lumber yard once 
                        it’s dark. If that ain’t simple I 
                        don’t know what is.

                                 CHASE
                        Why can’t I handle it right now?

           Riley stops what she’s doing and addresses Chase directly.

                                 RILEY
                        It’s Sunday and you ain’t exactly 
                        been a saint lately.

                                 CHASE
                        Oh c’mon, I don’t--

                                 RILEY
                        And Chase, make sure you pray for 
                        us.

           EXT. CHURCH. DAY

           Establishing shot from the front lawn. The town’s pride and 
           joy. The nicest building around, no contest. Pickup trucks 
           and SUV’s populate the parking lot.

           From outside we hear the daily Psalm being recited over an 
           organ.

                                 CHOIR (O.S)
                        Near the cross, a trembling soul,   
                        Love and mercy found me;   
                        There the bright and morning star   
                        Sheds its beams around me. 
           INT. CHURCH. MASTER SHOT OF CONGREGATION

           A packed house. People are on their feet singing along in 
           unison with Priest and choir.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        In the cross, in the cross,   
                        Be my glory ever;   
                        Till my raptured soul shall find   
                        Rest beyond the river.   

           CUT TO THE GUTHRIES

           Somber. Worn. They sit front row. The guests of honor.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Near the cross I'll watch and wait   
                        Hoping, trusting ever,   
                        Till I reach the golden strand,   
                        Just beyond the river.   

           CUT TO CHASE AND MOMMA

           Momma looks straight ahead. Chase steals looks at the 
           Guthrie’s who sit several pews in front of him.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        In the cross, in the cross,   
                        Be my glory ever;   
                        Till my raptured soul shall find   
                        Rest beyond the river. Amen. 

           At the consummation of the prayer people take their seats. 
           The PRIEST approaches the pulpit. Silence falls over the 
           crowd.

                                 PRIEST
                        We gather here today with both pain 
                        and confusion in our hearts. One of 
                        our own, a beloved child of this 
                        community, has fallen upon 
                        difficult times.

           Back to Priest at pulpit.

                                 PRIEST
                        It is common in times such as 
                        these, times when we feel 
                        vulnerable and helpless, times when 
                        life's circumstances leave us 
                        perturbed, that our belief and our 
                        conviction may become confounded.  

           CUT TO CHASE

           His eyes trade between Luther and Mrs. Guthrie. Luther turns 
           back and catches him looking. Chase looks away.

                                 PRIEST (O.S.)
                        This is when it becomes essential 
                        to remember as God’s children we 
                        must accept all circumstances from 
                        God. 

           BACK TO PRIEST

                        Jeremiah 29:11. For I know the 
                        plans I have for you,' declared the 
                        Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not 
                        to harm you, plans to give you hope 
                        and a future.

           Hang over Riley as she shovels away. A three foot heap of 
           dirt sits next to her. She has made considerable progress. 
           The body lays curled in the fetal position in a heap at the 
           bottom of the ditch.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        God has indeed constructed a 
                        blueprint for our lives. It 
                        requires effort to understand and 
                        absorb God's wishes, but they are 
                        not obscure; the process of 
                        studying His Word reveals all His 
                        will.

           CLOSE ON BOTTOM OF GIRLS FEET. They drag across grass. In the 
           b.g. we see Riley pulling the girl by her wrists. She dumps 
           the body onto the TARP.

                        heart, and lean not on your own 
                        understanding.

           INT. CHURCH HALLWAY. LATER

           The congregation files out the door. Luther is engaged in 
           conversation with an elderly couple who appear to be giving 
           their condolences. 

           Chase and Momma walk past. Chase and Luther lock eyes again 
           before Chase sheepishly drops his gaze.
           EXT. CHURCH. MOMENTS LATER

           Chase and Momma leave through the church doors. Luther shouts 
           out from inside.

                                 LUTHER
                        Hey, Chase Waldrup!

           Chase pretends not to hear. He continues to walk. Momma turns 
           around then tugs at Chase’s arm.

                                 MOMMA
                        That boy hollerin’ for ya, Chase.

           Chase doesn’t look back, he puts a hand on Momma’s back in an 
           attempt to hurry her along.

                                 LUTHER
                        Chase Waldrup, hold up a step.

                        Church steps ain’t no place to lose 
                        your manners.

           Chase slows then stops and turns to face Luther who has now 
           caught up.

                                 LUTHER
                        You have a minute?

                                 CHASE
                        Uh...

           Chase looks out into the parking lot hoping to find Riley 
           waiting with the truck--she’s nowhere to be found.

                                 LUTHER
                        It’s been awhile.

           More awkward tension.

           Chase returns a blank stare.

                        I'm gonna come right out with it. 
                        Father Wilson was givin' me some 
                        guidance and your name came up. 
                        Mentioned that you and your wife

                        similar a ways back.

           Chase looks around uncomfortably.

                        relate to what it feels like losin’ 
                        a child n' all. Father Wilson said 
                        sometimes the best way to cope with 
                        these things is to talk to someone 
                        who's been through it.

                        life deals us a bad hand and that

                        breathin’. I’d go to the edge of 
                        the earth to get her back. 

                                 CHASE
                        Yeah,...I--

                                 LUTHER
                        I need you to tell me everything is 
                        gonna be just fine.

           Riley pulls up in the TRUCK. She HONKS twice. Her sleeves 
           rolled up. Covered in dirt to the elbows.

           Chase looks over--his way out. Luther’s eyes stay locked on 
           Chase--gauging his reaction to the confrontation, awaiting an 
           answer.

                                 CHASE
                        I can’t do that, Luther. Truth is 
                        nobody knows how things are gonna 
                        end up. Sometimes I wonder if God 
                        himself knows.

           INT/EXT. WALDRUP’S TRUCK. LATER

           Riley is driving--shaking her head. Chase stares absently out 
           the window. Momma sits between--in her own world.

                                 RILEY

                        Not now. We in too deep now.

           Chase stays fixated on the passing country. More quiet.

                                 CHASE
                        He knew ‘bout Haley.

           This gets a rise our of Riley. A name she hasn’t heard in 
           some time. She thinks.

                                 RILEY

           INT. COUNTRY STORE. DAY

           A clerk sits behind the register filling out a crossword 
           puzzle in the NEWSPAPER. Webb approaches the counter with a 
           gallon of milk. Eyes blood shot, hair frayed. Terrible 
           condition. The clerk sets down the newspaper.

                                 CLERK
                        You feelin’ alright there, partner?

                                 WEBB
                        Just the milk will do.

           As the clerk is ringing him up Webb glances at the NEWSPAPER 
           on the counter. He spots something. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           It’s an ADVERTISEMENT “FORSWORTH’S LUMBER”, with a big 
           picture of the MAN (JIM FORSWORTH) smiling right next to it.

           Just then, we, along with Webb, realize the MAN’s name is Jim 
           Forsworth.

                                 WEBB
                        And the paper. How much for the 
                        paper?

                                 CLERK
                        Sir, this here is yesterday’s 
                        paper. Today’s is just over there.
                             (nods head)

                                 WEBB
                        I need that one.

                                 CLERK

                        How much God damnit!

                             (confused)
                        But, sir, this here is old news.

           INT. SAWYER’S OFFICE. NIGHT

           Sawyer sits at his desk. He shakes it lightly, the desk 
           wobbles atop a faulty leg. Betsy enters holding a file in her 
           hand.

                                 BETSY
                        Lab just sent this over.
                             (places file on desk)
                        It’s Abigail Guthrie’s dental 
                        record compared with the tooth you 
                        found up on 149.

           Sawyer looks at the file, not sure if he wants to see what it 
           has to say.

                                 BETSY
                        Anything else, sir, before I quit 
                        the buildin’?

                                 SAWYER
                        You know what kinda bolts this desk 
                        take? 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BETSY
                        That’s my first order of business 
                        tomorrow mornin’.

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s all I got.

           Betsy goes back to her desk to gather her belongings and 
           close out for the night. 

           Sawyer looks at the folder again. Grimaces. Anyway you cut it 
           the information inside won’t be good. After a brief staredown 
           he flips the file open. His eyes crawl back and forth down 
           the page.

           His face blank and emotionless save for the twitch of a 
           raised brow. Mind churning. He shouts into the other room.

                                  SAWYER
                        You like catfish, Betsy?

           Betsy, now with coat and keys in hand, pokes her head back 
           into the room.

                                 BETSY
                        Sorry?

                                 SAWYER
                        Catfish. You like it?

                                 BETSY
                        This a trick question?

                                 SAWYER
                        You know me too well, but no it 
                        ain’t.

                                 BETSY
                        In that case then, yes, I do. If 
                        it’s cooked right.

                                 SAWYER
                        My father was a catfish farmer. 
                        Started by chance as most good 
                        things do. He was makin’ a livin' 
                        growin' rice--had a place just east 
                        of Holly Bluff  n’ during one of 
                        them summers where the rain won't 
                        quit his rice field flooded up. But 
                        my father, always making the most 
                        of what he had, turned the thing 
                        into a pond. Started raisin’ 
                        catfish.

                        That’s nice.

                                 SAWYER
                        Summer 1932 all the fish in Five 
                        Mile Lake started floating up dead 
                        on the surface and washin' a shore. 
                        The frogs followed. Wasn't long 
                        before the town was buzzin', people 
                        thought the plague had descended on 
                        lil ol' Louise, Mississippi.
                             (laughs)
                        My father was no different. He 
                        pulled out every last fish from his 
                        pond--was convinced they had the 
                        devil in 'em.

                                 BETSY
                        Panic will do that to people.

                        'Course turns out it was where the 
                        moonshine runners had been hiding  
                        their bootlegged liquor, they were 
                        filling those oak casks and sinkin’ 
                        'em out in the lake. The moonshine 
                        was leakin’ into the water and I 
                        already told you what happened 
                        next.

                                 BETSY
                        Nothin’ is ever what it seems now

                                 SAWYER
                        That’s the point I’m gettin’ at.

                                 BETSY
                        May I ask why you tellin’ this to 
                        me?

           A beat.

                                 SAWYER
                        Not sure. I tend to ramble when I’m 
                        thinkin’.

           INT. WALDRUP’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

           Chase sits on the edge of his bed massaging his temples. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           --Pulling on a pair of BOOTS. Trembling hands struggle to tie 
           the laces. 

           BATHROOM

           Chase hovers over the toilet waiting to vomit. He dry heaves. 
           Looks at himself the mirror. Vigorously splashes cold water 
           on his face.

                                 CHASE

           BEDROOM

           Chase leans in and kisses a sleeping Riley on her forehead.

           LIVING ROOM

           He creeps stealthily towards the front door.

                                 MOMMA (O.S)
                        Where you goin’?

           Chase nearly jumps out of his skin. Momma sits calmly in her 
           recliner.

                                 CHASE
                        Momma! Why you up? Go back to bed?

                                 MOMMA
                        Where you goin’ child?

                                 CHASE
                        Go back to bed. I won’t be long.

           There is a long, unsettling stillness. Momma addresses Chase, 
           worry in her voice, sadness in her eyes.

                                 MOMMA
                        When Riley was a girl I knew when 
                        she was up to no good 'fore the ‘no 
                        good’ even got goin’. I could smell 
                        the contrition. She’d lie. I'd tell 
                        her she can crook the truth all she 
                        want with me but there ain’t no 
                        foolin’ him. He's always watchin'.

           Chase is shaken to the core. Fear, guilt and uncertainty gush 
           through his internal organs. He wants to say something but 
           doesn't. He opens the front door and walks out. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           INT. SAM WEBB’S HOUSE. HALLWAY. NIGHT

           Light pours from the room into the dark hallway. We sit out 
           there and listen to Sam Webb’s voice bellowing out of the 
           room.

                                 WEBB (O.S.)
                             (aggravated)
                        No, you listen up now, Jim. A 
                        deal’s a deal damnit....

           Beat. Then, slightly less agitated.

                                 WEBB (O.S.)
                        I know and I’m sorry things didn’t 
                        work out, I..

           Beat. Aggravated again.

                                 WEBB  (O.S.)
                        I got a helluva mean streak, Jim, 
                        and trust me you don’t...

           Push into the room.

           INT. WEBB’S BATHROOM

           Webb stands before a mirror. Reciting his lines. Looking 
           worried, insecure. Trying to conjure up any and every fiber 
           of courage he has.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Webb opens the front door to his house. He turns and shouts 
           upstairs.

                                 WEBB
                        Hon’, I’m headed over to the 
                        Waldrup’s place to talk ‘bout the 
                        huntin’ trip. Don’t wait up.

           He leaves.
           INT. LUMBER YARD. OFFICE. NIGHT

           In the stillness of night Jim Forsworth sits at a table 
           inside his stark, windowless office. He looks unsettled.  
           Thinking. The murky, yellow, fluorescent OVER HEAD BULB 
           pulsates emitting static electric hum. ZZZ.ZZZ.ZZZ. Light 
           flickers in and out.

           The sound of a TRUCK ENGINE filtered through the wall brings 
           Forsworth’s eyes up. Headlight beams slip in between the 
           wooden planks on the wall casting odd shadows across his face 
           during the intermit moments of darkness. He listens...

           Engine cuts off. A CAR DOOR opens and closes. Footsteps...

           More footsteps. Forsworth's eyes go to his OFFICE DOOR. It 
           swings open. Luther enters--a man on edge.

           EXT. LUMBER YARD ENTRANCE. NIGHT

           From an angle above we see as CHASE’S TRUCK pulls into the 
           LUMBER YARD.

           EXT. BACK OF LUMBER YARD. MOMENTS LATER

           The LUMBER YARD sits several hundred feet in the distance. 
           Chase stands at the trucks' TAILGATE peering down at the 
           BODY. She's mummy wrapped in the tarp, bungee cords holding 
           everything in place. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Chase approaches an old rusted INCINERATOR. He pops open a 
           trap door just large enough to fit a log through.

           MOMENTS LATER

           He stands behind the ancient machine. Screws on the propane 
           tank. Hiss, click, click. Poof. The flame leaps to life.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Chase lifts the mummy wrapped body out of the truck bed and 
           dumps her on the ground. Plop. He grabs hold of her ankles 
           and begins to drag her towards the INCINERATOR.

           HEADLIGHTS wrap around the corner, crawling quickly across 
           the ground before they land on Chase and stop abruptly. Chase 
           becomes fully illuminated against the dark night. Bent at the 
           waist, dragging a dead body by the ankles. Frozen, he looks 
           back at the source. A deer in headlights.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           INTERCUT. WEBB'S TRUCK. SAME

           Webb's face falls flat as he takes in the scene. From his 
           P.O.V we see Chase, still frozen, caught red handed. Light 
           reflecting off his eyes. A schoolgirlish gasp escapes Webb. 
           He slams a palm over his mouth. 

           INTERCUT CHASE P.O.V

           The headlights are blinding. Finally, the truck shifts into 
           reverse and floors backwards. It travels 10 feet before 
           slamming into a stack of logs. Stuck. Wheels churn 
           desperately. Deeper and deeper into the mud they go.

           Webb abandons his truck, stumbles out and bolts through a 
           column of stacked logs. Chase finally drops hold of the body 
           and pursues the fleeing witness.

           A week of dizzying rain has turned the terrain into lumpy 
           muck. Although both men are running with all their might 
           neither is moving very fast. Their clunky boots sink into the 
           mud with each step resulting in an awkward, uncoordinated 
           foot chase.

           In an attempt to slow his pursuer, Webb knocks over a pile of 
           2x4 WOOD BEAMS. Chase does his best to dodge the falling wood 
           but one smacks him in the chest, he grabs a hold of it and 
           continues his pursuit. 

           Chase is 20 yards behind and closing. Webb checks over his 
           shoulder and as he does so his foot twists on uneven ground 
           sending him face first into a sea of mud.

           He scrambles to get back on his feet but struggles to regain 
           footing. Chase comes into focus from the background-- 
           wielding the 2x4 over his head like Samurai warrior. Webb 
           looks back just in time to see the pine colliding with his 
           forehead. CRACK!

           INT. LUMBER YARD. OFFICE. SAME

           Luther and Jim Forsworth now sit across the table from one 
           another. The YELLOW LIGHT BULB strobes in a choppy, irregular 
           sequence. ZZZ.ZZZ.ZZZ. Forsworth puts a BULKY MANILA ENVELOPE 
           on the table.

                                 FORSWORTH
                        Your half.

                        Is it?

           A slight pause.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 FORSWORTH
                        It’s all there. As promised.

           A short stare down ensues. Forsworth quickly looks away.

                                 LUTHER
                        On my way here I passed Georgey 
                        Leigton’s old house.

                                 FORSWORTH
                        Hell, that’s a name I haven’t heard 
                        in, what’s it been, thirty years?

                                 LUTHER
                        Do you know how he died?

                                 FORSWORTH
                        Yeah, Luther I--everyone knows.

                                 LUTHER
                        Do you know how he died?

           Luther's odd behavior causes Forsworth to shift in his seat. 
           The frequency of the BULB quickens. Light flickers faster, 
           harsher, the BUZZING intensifies.

                                 FORSWORTH
                        What're you--yeah, uh, you, you n' 
                        him was messin' ‘round out near the 
                        lake n' Georgey slipped in and 
                        drown. You were just a boy, Luther, 
                        there wasn't nothin' you coulda 
                        done. It was an accident. You 
                        shouldn't carry ‘round all that 
                        remorse.

                                 LUTHER
                        I don’t.

           Dead silence....Forsworth goes to change the subject.

                                 FORSWORTH
                        Okay. So we’re finished here then?

                                 LUTHER
                        I dunno, are we?

           More silence. The electric BUZZ escalates towards its 
           crescendo. Forsworth eyes the BULB, Luther eyes Forsworth.

                                 FORSWORTH
                        Luther, I--

           CONTINUED:

                                 LUTHER
                        We found a model airplane in the 
                        woods a few weeks before. Georgey 
                        n’ me. One of them radio-controlled 
                        ones. Real nice. The left wing was 
                        broke but Georgey convinced me he 
                        could take it home n’ fix it new. 
                        Wasn’t but two days later he told 
                        me he lost it. Told me it was gone. 
                        I believed him, I trusted him. 
                        ‘Course when I found out he had 
                        kept the thing for hisself my 
                        feelin’s towards him changed. Come 
                        the day I asked him out to the lake 
                        my mind was made.
                             (beat)

                        ...Do you know how he died?

           On cue the LIGHT BULB POPS and darkness swallows the room.

           Black.

           EXT. BACK OF LUMBER YARD. NIGHT

           Chase is in panic--moving a million miles a minute. He pulls 
           a TOW CABLE from his truck and hooks it to the front of 
           Webb’s truck.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The lifeless bodies of Webb and the girl sit propped against 
           the incinerator, heads dangle from limp necks.

           Chase bear hugs Webb around the belly and slides him up the 
           incinerator wall and head first into the slot. Tight squeeze. 
           His stomach gets caught. Chase is forced to shove Webb by the 
           ass. Its awkward to say the least. Chase BELTS OUT a foray of 
           curses.

           INT. LUMBER YARD. SAME

           Outside the closed office door. Luther emerges holding the 
           MANILA ENVELOPE. He examines his hands. Then his forearms. 
           Then he heads towards the front door. He stops. Listens. He 
           hears something...
           EXT. BACK OF LUMBER YARD. SAME

           Chase still cursing away. He shoves Webb’s ass with all his 
           might. Clunk. Webb gives way and plops into the blaze.

           P.O.V. FROM INSIDE LUMBER YARD THROUGH A WINDOW

           Half the incinerator is blocked by Chase’s truck. Chase ducks 
           behind the truck. He is obscured for a moment. Then he 
           emerges dragging the girl. He flips her up over his shoulder 
           and pops her in the incinerator with ease.

           Hops in his truck and drives off hauling Webb’s truck behind 
           him.

           FLIP ANGLE to see Luther, concealed in darkness, having just 
           witnessed this through a SMALL WINDOW. Flame from the 
           incinerator reflects off the panes of glass. Luther’s eyes 
           burn with the fervent passion of hatred.

           CLOSE ON

           The inside of a WINDSHIELD.  Liquid floods across it.

           EXT. ROAD SIDE. NIGHT

           WEBB's TRUCK sits on the side of a desolate country road. 
           Chase pours GASOLINE over the hood.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Opens the driver side door and scratches off the VIN NUMBER.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Unscrewing the LICENSE PLATE.

           MOMENTS LATER

           With his teeth, Chase tears away a chunk of fabric from his 
           shirt sleeve. He lights it then tosses it on the hood. POOF. 
           Flames lick around the truck. Chase stands back, watching the 
           spectacle, processing what just happened. Through distorted 
           heat shimmers we see his face contort--on the verge of a 
           meltdown. Orange light bouncing off his cheeks.

           LONG SHOT

           Amidst an imperviously dark night the flame radiates a 
           haunting glow; and from the distance we hear the ghastly howl 
           of a debilitated man.
           EXT. FULL MOON

           An opulent full moon hangs ominously in the damp Mississippi 
           air. Crickets, owls and lotuses sing their nocturnal 
           lullabies.

           INT. WALDRUP’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

           The chilling BLUE LIGHT emitted from the moon sneaks through 
           the curtains. We get the feeling it's humid. Chase hasn't 
           slept a wink.  His eyes focus on the shifting shadows on the 
           ceiling as if they may provide a remedy for his predicament.

           A noise from the HALLWAY catches his attention. His head 
           lifts off the pillow. Hold....

           There it is again.

           Chase gently slips out of bed as to not wake his wife then 
           cautiously tip toes into the hallway.

           HALLWAY

           His eye’s sweep the hall. Nothing. Then he notices WET 
           FOOTPRINTS dotting the floor leading around the corner. Like 
           a bloodhound he follows the trail.

           One foot print, then another and another. Hansel and Gretel.

           As he rounds the corner he stops abruptly in his tracks. 
           Right before him stands the DEAD GIRL draped in her raincoat. 
           She is in the same condition in which Chase buried her--
           battered, bruised, pale and bloody. She looks at him 
           apathetically.

           INT. WALDRUP BEDROOM. NIGHT

           Chase's eyes pop open as he snaps out of the nightmare. It 
           takes him a moment to figure out where he is. The pale 
           moonlight glistens off his sweat drenched face. 

           Riley sleeps soundly on her side-- faced away from us. The 
           sight of her laying there has a soothing effect on Chase. He 
           scoots over and nuzzles up behind her. He actually looks at 
           ease for a moment. But something quickly puts an end to this. 
           Something doesn't feel right. 

           Chase pulls his arms back to find that they are lathered in 
           MUD. He slides back away from Riley and watches in 
           bewilderment as MUD oozes through the sheets like molten 
           lava.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Chase pulls the mud soaked blankets back to find SAM WEBB; 
           gashed and bloodied forehead, swollen eyes gazing back at 
           him.

           INT. WALDRUP BEDROOM. NIGHT

           With a shrill shriek Chase jolts awake and sits up in bed 
           panting like a scared pig. He looks at Riley--affraid of what 
           he may see. She’s there. No mud. Just lightly snoring.

           He scampers out of the bed in what looks like a drunken 
           stupor and stumbles into the hallway.

           KITCHEN

           Chase enters the Kitchen clutching his CHEST. His breathing 
           is erratic,weezy.

           He opens a CABINET and clumsily rifles through for a bottle 
           of ASPIRIN. His shaky hands struggle with the child-proof lid 
           before finally popping two tablets into his mouth. He chews 
           then swallows them down with water from the KITCHEN FAUCET. 

           Chase braces himself against the sink, with each breath his 
           anxiety dissipates further. Water and white aspirin paste 
           dribble down his chin. As he regains composure Chase drearily 
           gazes out the kitchen window at the FULL MOON. It meets his 
           gaze-- big, bold and haunting in all its glory. 

           EXT. ROAD SIDE. EARLY MORNING

           Sawyer and Werner stand before the charred corpse of WEBB’s 
           TRUCK. Smoke still trickling off the cooling iron. 

                                 WERNER
                        His wife called in ‘n said he left 
                        out the house last night and ain’t 
                        been home yet. A hunter called the 
                        truck in about an hour ago. Tags 
                        and VIN number been removed but it 
                        fits the description of Webb’s 
                        vehicle.

                                 SAWYER
                        I’d be surprised if it wasn’t.

                                 WERNER
                        This is gettin’ eerie, Sheriff.

                        I had a thought that he musta set 
                        fire to the truck here then quit 
                        town, you know, one of those self

                                 WERNER
                        Then I had another thought that 
                        maybe Sam Webb and the Guthrie girl 
                        are tucked up somewhere together.

                                 SAWYER
                        Could be.

                                 WERNER
                        But you doubt it?

                        her husband wasn’t?

                        No, sir. How’s it go?

           Sawyer opens his mouth to respond then decides against it.

                        From what I can tell he loved his 
                        wife plenty. And their boy for that 
                        matter. Then again, I’ve been 
                        deceived by love before.

                        She ain’t doin’ so well--Mrs. Webb.

                                 SAWYER
                        Given the circumstances few would 
                        be.

                                 WERNER
                        Said last she heard he was headed 
                        over to the Waldrup’s to talk ‘bout 
                        boar huntin’. Said he was actin’ 
                        funny.

           This brings Sawyers attention off the truck and over to 
           Werner.

                                 WERNER
                        No, sir. That’s what I thought.

                        That or he’s the one makin’ it.

                                 WERNER
                        How you figure?

                        Phone Betsy, let her know we’re 
                        headed over to the Waldrup 
                        residence.

                                 WERNER
                        You take him to be caught up in all 
                        this, Sheriff?

                                 SAWYER
                        I think he got hisself into a mess 
                        thick as the Mississippi mud.

           INT. WALDRUP’S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING

           Riley in bed sleeping. Her eyes flicker. She stirs, rolls 
           over to put an arm on Chase. He's not there. She wakes. Her 
           groggy eyes search the room. Her dresser has been rummaged 
           through. Closet doors flung open, clothes missing from the 
           rack. She looks concerned, confused.

           Chase enters the room carrying an armful of Momma’s clothes. 
           Riley sits up in bed.

                                 RILEY
                        What the hell?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Chase stuffs the clothes in a duffle bag.

                                 CHASE
                        Anything you can do without is 
                        gettin’ left.

                                 RILEY
                        Left where? What the hell, Chase?

           Chase crosses the room and pulls more belongings from the 
           dresser.

                                 CHASE
                        C’mon, get up. Momma’s already set 
                        to go.

                                 RILEY
                        We ain’t goin’ nowh-

                                 CHASE
                        God damnit, woman, get up!

           Riley is taken back by Chase’s uncharacteristic 
           assertiveness. She calmly lifts the covers off her legs and 
           steps out of bed.

                                 RILEY
                             (calm)
                        You wanna tell me what’s goin’ on?

                                 CHASE
                        This ain’t the time for explainin’.

           Chase moves her aside and continues packing.

                                 RILEY
                             (calm)
                        Chase, tell me what’s--

                                 CHASE
                        Listen--

                                 RILEY
                        No, you listen to me you 
                        sonnabitch! We are not leavin’ this 
                        damn house. That’s the end of it.

           Chase stops packing and looks Riley square in the eye.

                                 CHASE
                        I’ll be cut down for what I done. 
                        Either by God or the law. I can’t

                        everything that happened was out of

                        you were only doin’ what you had to

                        No, Riley, I was doin’ what you 
                        told me to do. For Pete sake I’ve 
                        been doin’ what you told me for the

                        her body into your truck, you took 
                        that upon your damn self.

           She realizes she has stumped him but stumping Chase is 
           nothing new and it sure hasn't changed his position on the 
           matter. She tries an alternative route.

                        But for the last week that money’s 
                        had us flirtin' with hell, we came 
                        this far and I ain't ready to skip 
                        out on it yet. Once Sam Webb has 
                        everything situated we can plot out 
                        our next move.

           Chase is quiet. Then, almost to himself.

                                 CHASE
                        All this. And for what?

                                 RILEY
                        For what?! Chase, listen to 
                        yourself. That’s more money than 
                        either of us ever saw before!

                        It don’t matter! It don’t matter no 
                        more!

           Chase slams his fist into the wall. Again. Again. Again. 
           Harder. Harder. Harder. The wall DENTS inward, drywall 
           crumbles to the floor. Riley backs away in fear--she has 
           never seen this side of her husband.

           After he exhausts himself Chase collapses onto the edge of 
           the bed.

                                 CHASE
                             (soft)
                        I’m finished....

           Riley sits beside him and places a comforting hand on his 
           back. She speaks to him gently.

                                 RILEY
                        Don't you see what this is? You
                        think you just happened to stumble
                        across that by chance? Of all times 
                        in the world that girl coulda chose  
                        to run away it was that night. Of 
                        all the people in the world to 
                        cross her path it was you. And she 
                        just so happened to have what we 
                        needed most, during a time in our

                        sit ‘round and try’n figure out

                        one is hard to miss. This one
                        slapped us clean across the nose...
                        God put that girl in our lives. He
                        delivered us that miracle. Why’d
                        he choose to bless us? I dunno. I
                        don't care. It ain't our place to
                        question it. You talk about

                        greater than to turn down God’s
                        goodwill.

           Chase takes a moment to let it soak in. Riley thinks she may 
           have gotten through. Chase rises from the bed and continues 
           packing.

                        Sam Webb’s dead, baby. The money’s

                        Riley. It’s all gone.

           The blood drains from her face. She shakes her head in a 
           panicky disbelief.

                        N-n..I...

           Once Riley’s brain registers the information she wobbles and 
           falls onto her hands and knees. Trembling.

                                 CHASE
                        If God put it there ask him why he 
                        took it away.

           Air escapes the room. Silence. Chase packs. Riley, still on 
           the ground, sobs. No words. Just the sound of clothes 
           flopping into bags. Zippers. Sniffles. Whimpers.

           CONTINUED:

           With two loaded duffle bags slung over his shoulder he grabs 
           Riley by the wrist and drags her out of the room. She digs 
           her heels in the ground. No use. Her butt slides and skips 
           across the floor.

           HALLWAY

           Chase releases his hold. Riley sits on the floor like a 
           pouting child, her knees tucked into her chest.

                        truck. When I come back have your 
                        act together. Don’t let Momma see 
                        you like this.

                        What?

                                 RILEY
                        Where we gonna go?

                                 CHASE
                        I dunno.

                                 RILEY
                        This is the end for us, ain’t it?

           Chase turns from the door to face his wife. He looks deep 
           into her eyes.

                                 CHASE
                        I hope not.

           He turns, opens the door, and steps out.

           EXT. WALDRUP’S FRONT STEPS 

           BANG!

           A shotgun blast nails him square in the chest. He flies back 
           onto the steps like a limp ventriloquist puppet. The gun shot 
           echoes through the woods. A flock of birds scatter in the 
           distance.

           Hold on the maroon colored blood bubbling from the quarter 
           sized craters in the center of his chest. 

           Riley comes to the front door. She looks at her husband. 
           Watches him struggle for his final gasp. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Her eyes move towards the driveway where she finds Luther 
           Guthrie holding a SHOTGUN--smoke percolating from the barrel. 
           His face calm, serene. His shotgun still aimed forward. Their 
           eyes meet.  

           Guthrie cocks the barrel. The shotgun spits out a shell which 
           lands on the driveway with an unnerving ping.

           He then lowers the barrel so it aligns with Riley's pregnant 
           stomach.

           She doesn't budge. Accepting her fate.

           Cold in his eyes. 

           Hold. 

           He squeezes the trigger.

           BANG!!!

           The shotgun backfires.

           The force of the kickback sends the steel barrel swinging 
           back towards Guthrie's face where it nails him square under 
           the chin--knocking him out cold.

           INT/EXT POLICE CRUISER. DAY

           Werner drives along absently minded, whistling a song. Sawyer 
           sits shotgun. They round the corner and the Waldrup’s 
           driveway comes into his line of sight.

           WERNER/SAWYER P.O.V

           Chase--face up on the porch, a pool of blood making its way 
           down the front steps. Riley kneeling beside him. Guthrie 
           awkwardly sprawled out on the pavement--murder weapon to his 
           side. The sun is out. Birds chirp. A beautiful spring 
           morning.

           Werner steps out of his car. His face ashen. Sound gradually 
           becomes distorted,muffled. Most noise is muted out however 
           other noises are intensified.

           He takes in the scene that lay before him. Then all sound 
           cuts out. Werner looks up to see Riley. Her eyes meet his. 
           Two individuals whose lives will never be the same.

           BLACK.
           INT. SAWYERS OFFICE. DAY

           Sawyer lays on his back under the desk like a car mechanic. 
           He tries to screw a bolt back into place on the faulty desk 
           leg. He fumbles, his frustration builds. The bolt won't fit, 
           the screw driver slips and tumbles to the ground.

                                 SAWYER
                        Damnit.

           Sitting on the floor, shirt untucked, Sawyer looks 
           despairingly at the desk. Around his shabby office. Then he 
           gets an idea. He pulls open the desk drawer and takes out a 
           bottle of Whiskey. Unscrews the top.

           A quick knock. The door opens. Betsy pokes her head in. See’s 
           Sawyer about to indulge. Sawyer makes no attempt to cover it 
           up.

                                 BETSY
                        Oh. I- sorry...should I..

                                 SAWYER
                        Go ‘head with it.

                                 BETSY
                        It’s jus--well, Sheriff Reid from 
                        Rankin County is itchin’ to talk to 
                        ya.

                                 SAWYER
                        What line?

                                 BETSY
                        He’s here.
                             (lowers voice)
                        Right outside. I can tell him now’s 
                        not a good time.

                                 SAWYER
                        No, no, just gimme a sec. Count to 
                        30 then send him in.

                                 BETSY
                        Yessir. Sorry, sir.

           She turns quickly and scurries out. Sawyer pulls himself off 
           the ground, makes a half ass attempt to tuck his shirt in, 
           sits in his chair and takes a healthy swig from the bottle. 
           He waits.....and waits. Then grows impatient.

           SHERIFF REID (40’s) enters cutting Sawyer off mid-sentence.

                                 REID
                        Hey there, Sheriff, how ya been?

                        It’s goin’. Hell, the rain’s been a

                                 SAWYER
                        Some folks walk in the rain, others 
                        just get wet.

           Silence. The comment soared over Reid’s head.

                                 REID
                        Word’s spreadin’ quick ‘bout the 
                        events out this way. Between the 
                        murder, the two missin’ person’s 
                        and the poor sap who bought it in 
                        his own lumber yard I’d say you got 
                        your work shaped up.

                                 SAWYER
                        Mm.

                                 REID
                        It’s gonna get ugly, Sheriff.

                                 SAWYER
                        It already is, and if it ain’t I 
                        don’t wanna be around when ugly 
                        shows up.

                                 REID

                        takin’ it.

                                 SAWYER
                        Well Sheriff, as I'm sure you’re 
                        aware, given your line of work, 
                        things are gonna happen that are 
                        out of our control. He’s about sick

                        I told him to take some time, 
                        gather his thoughts and what-have-
                        you. Soon as he comes to grips with

                        Time numbs pain, it don’t heal it.

           Reid eyes the Whiskey bottle sitting on the desk. Sawyer 
           takes note.

                                 REID
                        So the one fella shot the other

                        Papers called it an act of God. I

                        dependin’ on the party concerned.

                        She was in charge of the church 
                        donations. Turns up she was pickin’ 
                        the pot for quite some time. Built 
                        herself a fancy little fortune. By 
                        the time someone caught on to what 
                        she was doin’ she took her money 
                        and skipped town. Odd thing is they

                        That would depend on whose

           CLOSE ON TWO FEET.

           They move briskly along the road. A pitter-patter of 
           uneasiness. We pan up to see legs. 

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Then a torso, and finally a face. It belongs to a TEENAGE 
           GIRL (16). We have never seen her before.

           She is disheveled, tired, anxious, guilty. Her steps begin to 
           slow, then she finally stops in her tracks; her eyes fixated 
           on something ahead. Hesitation. Regret. A deep breath. 

           The angle flips and we see what see is looking at.........

           The Guthrie home.

           She walks down the driveway, up the front stoop and 
           delicately knocks on the front door.

           After a few seconds it opens. Mrs. Guthrie appears. She’s a 
           wreck. With an oddly impassive look Mrs. Guthrie studies the 
           girl.
