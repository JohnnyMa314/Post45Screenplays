           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DUSK

           The sun sets as 4,500 BRITISH REDCOATS march onto Washington.  

           TITLE:  AUGUST 24, 1814

           The British soldiers are a sight to behold.  Professional, 
           well-trained, orderly.  Several haphazardly-dressed AMERICAN 
           MILITIA run from the capital, not even bothering to fire back 
           in defense.  The sound of BRITISH WAR DRUMS fills the city. 

           GENERAL SIR EDWARD PACKENHAM (36) rides forward on his horse.  
           Handsome and strong, Packenham has earned the respect of his 
           veteran troops.  He comments after the retreating militia --   

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        Such cowardice!  Their bellies are 
                        as yellow as their teeth! 

           The men cheer.  Packenham eyes the surrounding buildings -- 
           THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, THE CAPITOL, and in the far distance 
           across a great field, THE WHITE HOUSE...

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM (CONT’D)
                        Captain, fire your torches!  All 
                        public buildings, we shall burn 
                        them straight to the ground! 

           EXT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS - DUSK

           The British troops approach lighting TORCHES.  Several 
           LIBRARY WORKERS are pulled out the front of the building. 

           Around back, the matronly LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS meets with an 
           OLD FARMER in the alley.  The farmer has a line of PRODUCE 
           CARTS pulled by a tired donkey.    

                                 LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS
                        For the Patterson farm in Manassas.

           The librarian hands over a STACK OF PAPERS.  The farmer 
           unceremoniously places the stack in a cart full of apples.

           And as the farmer covers the cart with a tarp, we see these 
           aren’t just any old papers -- these are the original copies 
           of THE CONSTITUTION and the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.  

           The farmer pulls away.  The building burns.  
           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DUSK 

           A SERVANT uses a LOOKING GLASS to survey the chaos across the 
           city.  The redcoats turn toward the White House.  

                                 SERVANT
                        Mrs. Madison, we best be leaving! 

           The servant hightails it down a hall and into --

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DUSK

           Where FIRST LADY DOLLEY MADISON (46) is supervising a quick 
           collection of important items from the house.    

                                 DOLLEY MADISON
                        With care, gentlemen!  Let’s keep 
                        it a painting worth our efforts.     

           Two WORKERS cut out a full-length OIL PAINTING of GEORGE 
           WASHINGTON from its frame hanging on the wall.  Other workers 
           carry in sacks full of silver and other wares.   

                                 SERVANT
                        Mrs. Madison, the redcoats.  

                                 DOLLEY MADISON
                             (to the workers)
                        Carry everything we can.  Who knows 
                        what they’ll see fit to pillage.  

                                 VALET
                        Dinner’s already been served ma’am.

                                 DOLLEY MADISON
                        Then leave it for them.  May it be 
                        the last hospitality they receive.   

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Packenham watches as the redcoats use a BATTERING RAM to 
           break down the FRONT DOOR.  The British storm the castle.

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The redcoats move from room to room, ransacking as they go.  
           No table is left unturned, no artifact intact. 
           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Packenham arrives at the STATE DINING ROOM.  He gives pause -- 
           indeed, a full DINNER has been left served on the table.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Sir?  

           The soldiers wait as Packenham tries the soup...

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        A fouler meal never tasted so well.  
                        Shame to let it waste. 

           The soldiers help themselves.  Packenham finishes his soup, 
           revealing a victorious scene from THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 
           etched on the bowl bottom.  Packenham SMILES at the irony.

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

           The city is on FIRE.  Flames climb high into the sky.  The 
           British abandon the WHITE HOUSE and light the exterior walls. 

           It’s unlike anything we’ve seen... and it actually happened. 

           Packenham overlooks the carnage from atop his horse.  And as 
           a BRITISH UNION JACK is raised over the American capital -- 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           THE WAR OF 1812.  FORTY YEARS AFTER GAINING INDEPENDENCE, THE 
           UNITED STATES IS ONCE AGAIN AT WAR WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 

           AFTER RECENTLY DEFEATING NAPOLEON’S ARMIES IN EUROPE, THE 
           BRITISH HAVE REFOCUSED THEIR MILITARY EFFORTS IN AMERICA. 

           WITH PUBLIC SUPPORT WANING AND THE BURNING OF WASHINGTON, THE 
           UNITED STATES IS IN DANGER OF SURRENDERING TO THE REDCOATS. 

           THIS IS A TRUE STORY. 

           EXT. COTTON FIELD - DAY

           Deep in the South.  A handful of SLAVES works the fields.    

           TITLE:  MOBILE, ALABAMA

           A young BOY turns his head and sees a THOUSAND AMERICAN 
           TROOPS making their way down a country road.  The boy waves 
           to the troops, but the troops are too tired to wave back.
           They’ve been on a journey.  Of the thousand, about 400 are 
           regular enlisted men, while the rest are ragtag militia.  

           And even though some look like they’d be pretty good in a 
           fight, just from their disposition marching through the hot 
           sun, it’s clear -- the British redcoats, these men are not. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Company, halt!

           The men do, a few immediately taking a knee and drinking from 
           dry canteens.  The CAPTAIN surveys an area over the ridge 
           ahead of them as a man rides up on his HORSE from the rear...

           Distinguished, but considerably rough around the edges, this 
           is MAJOR GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON (47).  Once a militia man 
           from Tennessee, Jackson is now a commissioned officer in the 
           UNITED STATES ARMY and for lack of a better word, a hard ass.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Captain, these men aren’t scheduled 
                        to break for another --

           But Jackson stops when he sees it.  The quaint French-Spanish 
           city of MOBILE sits before them on a bay off the GULF COAST.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        We’re here, General. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Good.  I need a drink. 

           EXT. MCKINLEY’S ALE HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING  

           A corner TAVERN.  Quite a rowdy crowd has gathered inside.  

           INT. MCKINLEY’S ALE HOUSE - NIGHT

           A wide swatch of TOWNSPEOPLE.  A few of Jackson’s OFFICERS 
           and ENLISTED MEN drink at nearby tables, happy to have 
           reached their destination.  Dependable BRIGADIER-GENERAL JOHN 
           COFFEE (45) finishes his beer and looks across the room... 

           And sees Jackson sitting ALONE at the bar separated from his 
           men.  The BARTENDER pours Jackson a shot.  Jackson drinks.    

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Again. 

           Down the bar a few LOCALS are engaged in drunken discussion.  
           Jackson can’t help but listen with half an ear.
                                 MUSTACHE
                        Invade Canada -- that was their 
                        brilliant plan?  The currish louts!  

                                 WIRE RIM GLASSES
                        Brits turned us away at Montreal, 
                        marched straight through Maine --

                                 MUSTACHE
                        Maine has fallen by God!  Maine is 
                        gone!  I barely even knew her. 

           MUSTACHE raises a glass in a faux-toast.  Everyone drinks.

                                 TALL MAN
                        Word from Washington is ten times 
                        worse.  The nancy boy Northerners --

                                 MUSTACHE
                        Couldn’t even hold the damn capital 
                        city!  Their militia run like dogs 
                        without even firing a shot!

                                 TALL MAN
                        Dolley Madison a better leader than 
                        her windbag husband.  The rest of 
                        the lot, throw ‘em into the fire. 

                                 WIRE RIM GLASSES
                        Best be practicing our salute to 
                        the King and the Queen.  Up yer 
                        ass, yer Majesties, our leaders 
                        were no better than you I reckon.

           One of the men with them is an eager NEWSPAPERMAN (22).  He 
           eyes Jackson at the bar.  The newspaperman sidles over.  

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                        My apologies.  General Jackson?  
                        Don’t mean to be interrupting --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then you’ve failed already. 

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Saw your men march in town today.   
                        Came from Fort Jackson after the 
                        battle with the Creeks.  Big deal 
                        there, sir.  Lots of land had.  

           Jackson shoots the newspaperman an annoyed look over his 
           glass -- who are you and why are you bothering me? 
                                 NEWSPAPERMAN (CONT’D)
                        Pardon my manners.  Bertram Iger, 
                        sir, Mobile Register.  As long as 
                        you’re here, would appreciate a 
                        quote about the state of the war --  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                             (re: the locals)
                        Your companions know more than I.  
                        Put their names in the paper.    

           But the newspaperman won’t be denied. 

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                        The British strong through Canada 
                        and the Atlantic, the Spanish with 
                        a hold in Florida and the Indians 
                        still terrorizing the West.  There 
                        are whispers the redcoats who 
                        defeated Napoleon himself have 
                        already set sail --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Exactly how old are you, Mr. Iger? 

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Twenty-two.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        And what have you done besides ask 
                        questions of this war?  Ever fired 
                        a pistol or been in battle?      

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                        No, sir.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then seeing as you have nothing 
                        substantial to add, tell your 
                        friends there and readers thus -- 
                        the blood of our Founding Fathers 
                        was not shed to kneel before a King 
                        and Queen forty years hence.  And 
                        any man who disagrees is as stupid 
                        as he is a burden to the air I do 
                        breathe.  Now if you’ll excuse me, 
                        I will return to the manner I was 
                        before your admitted interruption.  

           Through this an ARMY MESSENGER has arrived behind Jackson and 
           handed Brigadier-General Coffee a long-winded LETTER.  Coffee 
           reads as the newspaperman steps away from the bar --

           But the newspaperman just can’t let it go.  He turns back --
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        You’re a down-right nuisance. 

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                             (a bit of gossip)
                        The Benton Brothers?  Your duel?  
                        Please, General, the story lives to 
                        be passed in rooms like this.  Will 
                        you confirm, even off the record --

                                 JOHN COFFEE (O.S.)
                        General. 

           Coffee is there with the letter.  He hands it to Jackson.  
           Jackson reads.  The newspaperman is keenly interested...  

           Jackson finally finishes.  He slams his fist against the bar. 

                                 NEWSPAPERMAN
                        Good news? 

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jackson walks the hall with his officers from the bar.  They 
           knock on bedroom doors, waking the rest of his high-command. 

           A door opens revealing prim LIEUTENANT DANIEL ADLER (38) in 
           his bed-clothes.  Adler fusses with his glasses. 

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        This couldn’t wait until morning? 

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT

           A room too small for so many men.  Everyone is gathered 
           around a table as Coffee reads the letter by candlelight. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        “Natives of Louisiana.  On you the 
                        first call is made to assist in 
                        liberating from a faithless and 
                        imbecile government your paternal 
                        soul.  The American usurpation in 
                        this country must be abolished --

                        Usurpation my bleeding arse. 

           Jackson is pouring SHOTS OF WHISKEY for the officers just 
           woken out of bed.  Adler shakes his head in refusal.
                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        -- I am at the head of a large body 
                        of Indians, well armed, disciplined 
                        and commanded by British officers.” 

                                 OFFICER
                        An Indian in a redcoat!  That would 
                        be a sight!   

           The officers laugh at the prospect. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        “Seconded by the powerful aid of 
                        numerous British and Spanish Ships 
                        and Vessels of War.”  And it goes 
                        on like this... for quite awhile.  
                        Sent to every town and city two 
                        hundred miles within the Purchase.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        When did the British move onto 
                        Pensacola? 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Our spies have them boarded six 
                        weeks ago in the Spanish garrison.

           This point riles Jackson. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The comandante there, Garcia, as 
                        spineless a man I ever met.  Had 
                        nerve to call me “impertinent”.   

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        General, this is not an unexpected 
                        development.  The British were want 
                        to encroach on the South, our 
                        orders are still to remain here. 

           Jackson unfurls a MAP of the southern U.S. on the table.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Our orders are months old.  If the 
                        British have indeed moved here --
                             (points to Pensacola)
                        They will most certainly move here.

                        New Orleans.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The key to the Mississippi and this 
                        country’s future freedom.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT'D)
                        If the British take the River, they 
                        will surround us on all sides.  And 
                        with this “proclamation”, a 
                        declaration to turn our citizens 
                        against us -- I’ve seen it tonight 
                        in that tavern, these men have the 
                        constitution of a hot house flower.  
                        The people will fall if we let 
                        them, not to say anything of the 
                        British sending the same Indians 
                        we’ve defeated against us.  We must 
                        march onto Pensacola immediately. 

           Furtive glances around the room.  That was unexpected.  

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Sir, while I principally agree, the 
                        men are tired.  We’ve fought many 
                        battles and travelled many miles --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        And I was there for all of them, 
                        General Coffee, lest you forget.

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        At least send word to Washington --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Or Philadelphia or New York or 
                        wherever the government now sits 
                        and wait three months for a reply?  
                        If so there will be tea down our 
                        throats by New Year.

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        Perhaps.  But Mobile is between 
                        Pensacola and New Orleans, General.  
                        Let us gather, rest and prepare, 
                        then we will fight.  It’s the most 
                        prudent course of action.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Wars, like women, Lieutenant, are 
                        rarely won with prudency.

           And as the men realize their stay here will be short-lived --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        My dearest Rachel --

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE - ROOM - MORNING

           Jackson in his dressing clothes.  He writes a letter. 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        I write with apologies, my beloved 
                        wife, for circumstances have 
                        changed and we must delay our 
                        inevitable reunion. 

           EXT. STAGING GROUND - DAY

           Jackson’s men preparing to MARCH.  They are not happy.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        The British have moved onto Florida 
                        and I have no recourse but to move 
                        them out.  The men, of course, are 
                        disagreeable, but our duty does not 
                        care for our disposition.

           Jackson rides through the yard.  The soldiers are respectful 
           with their greetings, but there’s clearly no love lost here.  

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                             (as Jackson passes)
                        Old Hickory bastard. 

           EXT. SPANISH GARRISON - DAY

           In Pensacola.  The BRITISH and SPANISH FLAGS fly at the same 
           height over the stronghold.  COLONEL EDWARD NICHOLLS (36) 
           confers with COMANDANTE FERNANDO GARCIA (54) behind the wall.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        I wish only to be with you and the 
                        children again, but Colonel Edward 
                        Nicholls, a British scant of a man, 
                        a fly, has made that impossible.   

           Behind them two dozen RED CREEK INDIANS are being trained by 
           BRITISH COMMANDERS.  It’s not going well for either party. 

           EXT. MOBILE BAY - MORNING

           The sun rises over the water.  Jackson watches from shore as 
           he fingers a small COLONIAL COIN.  It means something to him. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        How is it I’ve found myself here?  
                        A simple man of the militia.  But I 
                        shall not stand idle like so many 
                        others and watch my country fall.  
                        I have sacrificed far too much for 
                        history to remember me as such.       
           INT. BOARDING HOUSE - ROOM - MORNING

           Jackson finishes dressing.  He is meticulous. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        I miss you, my love, and my heart 
                        yearns.  Please hold me in your 
                        prayers and pass my love to the 
                        children.  Your dearest, Andrew. 

           There’s a knock at the door.  John Coffee enters. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I’m ready.

           Jackson heads for the door, but not before -- 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Sir -- if I may -- there’s over 
                        three hundred miles of shore on our 
                        coast, with myriad routes into New 
                        Orleans, while Nicholls commands 
                        but a small legion of troops --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You believe I’m the fool. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        I believe if we move to Pensacola, 
                        the British will move to Mobile or 
                        Biloxi or straight into the River.  
                        They have options, sir, we have 
                        none.  And we know no one will come 
                        to our assist.  How many times have 
                        we called for reinforcements this 
                        past year and received nothing in 
                        return?  No matter how many battles 
                        won, no matter how much land had.   

           Coffee speaks candidly with Jackson and Jackson, unlike with 
           others, listens.  A friendship formed over many years.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We must not let them gain solid 
                        ground, John.  Not even a moment.

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        The British Armada has sailed, 
                        General.  20,000 troops.  Perhaps 
                        more.  They have finished with 
                        Napoleon and now they come for you.   
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        No.  They come for us.  
                             (beat)
                        Myriad routes, yes, by land and by 
                        sea.  But with the sea comes marsh.  
                        Swamps.  Inlets as wide as a man.  
                        We move to Pensacola and force them 
                        off dry land so into the River they 
                        must go.  I have seen the British 
                        march and I will take my chances 
                        with the bog and the mud any day.      

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        My concern, General, is they are 
                        aware of this as well.  If we force 
                        them into the River, what will we 
                        find when we meet them there? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The Devil himself  But fear not, 
                        John, we shall fight.

           And as we hear the sound of a BOAT fighting against the sea --

           EXT. BARATARIA BAY - MORNING

           A BRITISH LONGBOAT is rowed through the rough waters of the 
           Gulf.  Behind it waits the imposing brig-sloop HMS SOPHIE. 

           TITLE:  BARATARIA BAY - FORTY MILES SOUTH OF NEW ORLEANS

           CAPTAIN NICHOLAS LOCKYER (36) and two other BRITISH OFFICERS 
           are on the boat.  Lockyer looks through a SPYGLASS toward --

           Another BOAT being rowed out to meet them.  A tall, handsome 
           WELL-DRESSED MAN (32) stands in the bow while four other men 
           do the rowing.  The other men are dressed like, for lack of a 
           better word, PIRATES.  Bandanas and brightly colored shirts. 

           Lockyer shares a look of trepidation with his officers. 

           EXT. BARATARIA BAY - MORNING

           The two boats converge.  The British are aghast by the 
           appearance of the disheveled rowers.  Lockyer stands --

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                             (in French; subtitled)
                        My name is Captain Nicholas 
                        Lockyer, British Royal Navy.  I am 
                        here to gain audience with the 
                        pirate Jean Lafitte.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER (CONT'D)
                        We offer your men no harm, though 
                        we caution you of the closeness of 
                        our brothers.

           The well-dressed man considers Lockyer a moment.  And then --

                                 WELL-DRESSED MAN
                        I will take you to Lafitte. 

           EXT. GRAND TERRE ISLAND - BEACH - MORNING

           The two boats come on shore at a nearby ISLAND -- an eighteen 
           square-mile sliver off the coast of Louisiana.  They are 
           greeted by several hundred men, women and children.  

           These are the BARATARIANS OF GRANDE TERRE ISLAND.  Like the 
           rowers of the boat, they are best equated with traditional 
           PIRATES.  Free men of the seas, mostly French in descent.  

           The island is a WONDERLAND.  There are huts and thatched 
           cottages as well as larger homes.  Music is played on the 
           beaches, men passed out in the sand from the night before.  A 
           fleet of battle-worn PIRATE SHIPS is anchored just off shore. 

           It is a paradise of a certain kind.  To the British, they are 
           decidedly uncomfortable by their surroundings. 

                                 WELL-DRESSED MAN
                        Welcome to Grande Terre.  

           Lockyer has his hand on his PISTOL as the well-dressed man 
           leads the officers through the CROWD.  A few of the rougher 
           Baratarians great them with jeers and cigar smoke. 

           The men head up a PATH into the woods.  Lockyer eyes a FORT 
           built at the end of the beach well-armed with rows of CANNONS 
           and HEAVY ARTILLERY.  They continue onto the island.  

           EXT. GRAND TERRE ISLAND - LAFITTE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The men finally arrive at a GRAND HOUSE in the trees.  It’s 
           tastefully constructed with a magnificent wraparound BALCONY.  

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        Is this where we will meet Lafitte?   
                        I do not wish to be delayed 
                        further, we are on official 
                        business of the Crown.

           The well-dressed man turns... then SMILES gregariously.  He 
           switches to a slightly French-accented English --
                                 WELL-DRESSED MAN
                        Messieurs, I am Lafitte.  And if 
                        it’s business you have, we will do 
                        so only after a proper breakfast.

           EXT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING  

           A few hours later.  Many of the BARATARIANS from the beach 
           have taken position around Lafitte’s house in the trees. 

           They are clearly interested by what’s happening inside.  And 
           as LAUGHTER wafts out the open FRENCH DOORS of the balcony -- 

           INT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Lockyer and his officers are finishing up what could only be 
           described as a FEAST.  A long dining table has remnants of 
           every type of breakfast food imaginable -- MEATS, FRUITS, 
           PASTRIES -- all served on fine silver with accompanying WINE. 

           Lafitte sits at the head of the table, relaxed and charming.  
           Next to him are his two brothers -- PIERRE LAFITTE (40) is 
           nebbish and not as handsome as Jean, while DOMINIQUE YOU (33) 
           is Pierre and Jean’s half-brother and just a bull of a man.  

           And while Jean and Pierre are dressed somewhat like 
           businessmen of the time, Dominique is pure RUFFIAN PIRATE.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        -- we found the sailor shivering in 
                        a row boat wearing nothing but his 
                        dressing clothes.  He paid twice as 
                        much to tow him back to his ship!  

           More laughter.  A SERVANT BOY fills Lockyer’s cup.  

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        Monsieur Lafitte, we must give 
                        thanks for such warm hospitality. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Please, Captain.  It is our nature.    

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        Fruit from the West Indies, the 
                        best wines of Old Spain.  And your 
                        wares of the house -- Chinese silk 
                        on the table, French silver and 
                        crystal.  Even -- yes, I’m quite 
                        sure -- is that not a British 
                        chronometer in the corner?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER (CONT'D)
                        I believe it is actually, one 
                        issued to Her Majesty’s trading 
                        ships just this past year.  Quite 
                        rare to be found in residences such 
                        as these.

           That was casually direct.  Lafitte plays it cool.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I see we have arrived at the 
                        business portion of our encounter.

           Lockyer nods -- and so we have.  One of Lockyer’s OFFICERS 
           places a worn HAND-BILL in the center of the table. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        Shall I read it or am I to assume --

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        It’s a bill.  Offering $500 reward 
                        for anyone who may deliver you to 
                        Governor Claiborne of Louisiana.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Surely you’re not here to arrest me 
                        -- not after a feast such as this.

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        You’re no friend to America.    

           Dominique You scoffs.  He speaks rapidly with heavy accent.

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        It ain’t worth the paper that prick 
                        Claiborne had it printed on.  We 
                        put our own bounty on him!  $5000 
                        anyone delivers le gouverneur ici!

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        Yes, quite diplomatic.  And he sent 
                        word to the President himself about 
                        such worrisome “hellish banditi”.  
                        You are outlaws and always shall be. 

           Lockyer enjoys being a prick.  Dominique is riled further, 
           but Lafitte calms him with a raise of his hand.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Captain Lockyer, you say you have 
                        business here -- what is it? 
                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        My colonel, Edward Nicholls, is the 
                        first to arrive in the area of many 
                        of Her Majesty’s men and ships.  We 
                        are to take New Orleans by land and 
                        by sea, conquer the Mississippi and 
                        push the inbred Americans into the 
                        Atlantic.  Now despite your 
                        plundering of numerous British and 
                        Spanish vessels and disenfranchised 
                        status, I am here to offer peace.  
                        A full pardon to each of your men, 
                        citizenship, protection from all 
                        enemies, and for you, Monsieur 
                        Lafitte, enlistment as captain in 
                        Her Majesty’s Royal Navy as well as 
                        land in these here colonies.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        What generosity.  And in return? 

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        You shall be the key to her front 
                        door.  You will provide knowledge 
                        of these dreadful swamps and guide 
                        Her Majesty’s forces to the city 
                        supplying as many men and munitions 
                        as necessary.  And for that, 
                        Monsieur, you will be invaluable.  

           There it is.  If Lafitte is surprised by Lockyer’s offer, he 
           doesn’t show it.  Pierre and Dominique, not so much.  

           There’s a long beat as Lafitte considers.  And then --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Do you know, Captain, why earlier I 
                        chose not to reveal you my true 
                        identity?  

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        I assume you preferred to negotiate 
                        at your table rather than at sea. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (congenial)
                        Indeed.  But it also allowed me to 
                        have your throat slit on the beach 
                        if I saw fit.  I’m no fool, 
                        Captain, and neither are you.  
                        Invaluable holds little use to me.    

           Now it’s Lockyer who smiles -- he’s enjoying this game.  
                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        In addition, the Crown is willing 
                        to pay a generous bounty of thirty 
                        thousand British pounds, half 
                        before and half after taking the 
                        city.  That should be more than 
                        ample for a man such as yourself. 

           And for the first time, Lafitte’s facade cracks -- if only a 
           little.  He quickly regains his composure --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        What kind of man is that? 

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        A pirate, Monsieur Lafitte.  One of 
                        the most wanted men in the world.  
                        Consequently if you do not accept 
                        our offer, we will have no choice 
                        but to end your existence on this 
                        island and hold you and your men 
                        accountable in Her Majesty’s courts 
                        for all prior improprieties. 
                             (beat)
                        Your table or mine, the deal is a 
                        fair one.  I suggest you take it.    

           EXT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - BALCONY - DAY

           Late afternoon.  Lockyer and his officers smoke CIGARS on the 
           balcony overlooking Barataria Bay, waiting...

           INT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           As Lafitte discusses his options with Pierre and Dominique.  
           Dominique spits tobacco into a spittoon. 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Bastards, all of ‘em.  I don’t 
                        trust ‘em one bit.   

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        It’s not a matter of trust.  Thirty 
                        thousand is too large a sum to --

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        I ain’t saying turn it away.  Take 
                        half and sail, better that than 
                        nothing.  The rest is shit. 

           But Pierre is clearly in favor of taking the deal. 
                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        They will defeat the Americans with 
                        or without us.  Then where will we 
                        be with them hunting us down?   

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        The men will go where Jean tells 
                        ‘em to go and if you don’t think we 
                        can out-sail those cock-suckers --

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        The Americans have shown us no 
                        allegiance whatsoever.  How long 
                        before they roost us from this 
                        nest?  We take the deal absolutely.

           A moment of silence.  Lafitte is deep in thought.   

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        What do you consider, mon frere?

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        There is a third option. 

           EXT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - BALCONY - DAY

           Lockyer notices the growing crowd of BARATARIANS surrounding 
           the house.  Lafitte opens the door behind him. 

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                             (re: the crowd)
                        Like moths to the flame.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        They don’t trust you to be with me.

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        I offer sanctuary, Monsieur.  You 
                        will be British citizens.  You will 
                        finally have a place to call home.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Some of my men are American.  They 
                        will not take kindly to treachery.  

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        The money will help with that.

           Lafitte studies Lockyer for a beat, then looks over the bay. 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You were wrong before, Captain.  We 
                        are not pirates.  We are 
                        privateers.

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        Is there a difference?

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Yes.  And it is everything.
                             (beat)
                        A fortnight.  To convince them.  
                        After that, my men and I will be 
                        entirely at your disposal.  

           Lockyer extends his hand.  As Lafitte takes it in his own -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        Governor Claiborne --

           EXT. GRAND TERRE ISLAND - BEACH - DUSK

           The BARATARIANS watch as Lockyer and his officers return to 
           the HMS Sophie.  Lafitte and his brothers stand to the side.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        As I am sure my correspondence will 
                        come as a galloping shock, I begin 
                        by professing I am a stray sheep 
                        returning to the fold. 

           And as Lockyer’s LONGBOAT disappears in the distance --

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        So it begins. 

           INT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           By candlelight.  Lafitte finishes writing a letter.  He puts 
           the letter in a LEATHER FOLDER with several other DOCUMENTS.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        I have recently been approached by 
                        one Captain Nicholas Lockyer of Her 
                        Majesty’s Royal Navy and was 
                        informed of an immediate plan for 
                        the British to attack New Orleans -- 

           Behind him a sumptuous RED-HEAD enters.  She’s ready for bed.  
           EXT. SWAMP - DAY

           Dominique You and a few of his LIEUTENANTS trek through the 
           marsh and bog.  Dominique carries Lafitte’s LEATHER FOLDER.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        -- the details of which are  
                        enclosed within.  Fortunately I 
                        have managed to gain a fortnight 
                        for us to consider them.

           The men move with confidence.  They come to a fork in the 
           water and take a seemingly harder path over an easier one.

           EXT. SWAMP - THE TEMPLE - DAY

           The half-way point between Grand Terre and New Orleans.  This 
           raised piece of land has been turned into a makeshift BAZAAR.

           Several BARATARIANS have set up shop selling smuggled goods 
           to members of NEW ORLEANS HIGH SOCIETY.  BARATARIAN WOMEN 
           snuggle up to LAWYERS and DOCTORS as their HOUSEWIVES watch 
           burly PIRATES move purchased wares.  It feels like a party.  

           While the United States government may not shine to the 
           Baratarians, it’s clear the people are far more accepting.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        I have been offered a healthy bribe 
                        to assist in this attack, but I 
                        assure you that my men and I pledge 
                        allegiance only to our home, these 
                        United States of America.

           Dominique You arrives.  He hands the LEATHER FOLDER to 
           pragmatic lawyer and Lafitte ally EDWARD LIVINGSTON (50).   

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - DAY 

           Livingston rides on his horse into the FRENCH QUARTER.  The 
           Quarter is alive with activity, a multicultural MELTING POT.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        As to any prior discrepancies, I 
                        would be more than willing to 
                        overlook our differences in order 
                        to save the city we both do love.
           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tempestuous and dramatic GOVERNOR WILLIAM CLAIBORNE (40) 
           finishes reading the letter to his inner-circle of ADVISORS.

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        “You may speak to Edward Livingston 
                        as my representative on this matter 
                        as I stay in Barataria and await 
                        your orders.  With humbleness, Jean 
                        Lafitte.”  That utter scoundrel!

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Sir, as Monsieur Lafitte’s council, 
                        I urge you to consider his offer -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        From that man?!  Never!  I should 
                        have you disbarred, Livingston, for 
                        even speaking with him.   

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        If the British do plan to attack, 
                        Lafitte can provide intelligence.  
                        His men know the swamps, they --

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        They are wanted by the United 
                        States government and it is 
                        improper for the Governor of this 
                        great state to even enter 
                        correspondence with such a man!

           Claiborne holds the DOCUMENTS Lafitte received from Lockyer.

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE (CONT’D)
                        And these “British” letters -- at 
                        best forgeries!  Lafitte is trying 
                        to weasel his way out from justice. 

           A sycophant LAWYER looks them over as well. 

                                 LAWYER
                        A pirate’s trick, obviously.  He 
                        may be with the British already.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        I assure you he is not.  You and 
                        Lafitte have had your battles --

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        He put a bounty on my head!  
                        Commodore Patterson, this here is 
                        your impetus.  Clear the island. 
           COMMODORE PATTERSON (32), the local NAVAL COMMANDER, nods in 
           the affirmative.  Livingston can’t believe what he’s hearing.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Governor, you’re making a mistake.  
                        Please reconsider -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        If the British are indeed coming as 
                        you say, we will not have a snake 
                        in our own house.  I want Lafitte 
                        delivered to me here now. 

           INT. LAFITTE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Lafitte looks out on a cloudy morning.  He hasn’t had much 
           sleep.  A WOMAN comes up behind him -- this one a BRUNETTE. 

                                 BRUNETTE
                             (in French; subtitled)
                        Come back to bed, my sweet.

           But Lafitte’s distracted.  Suddenly there’s a knock on the 
           door.  Lafitte opens it revealing Pierre and Dominique.   

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Someone est ici. 

           EXT. GRAND TERRE ISLAND - BEACH - MORNING

           Lafitte looks through a SPYGLASS.  There are ten large SHIPS 
           OF WAR closing quickly on the horizon.    

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        Is it the Americans? 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Is it the British?

           Lafitte can’t tell.  The Baratarians stand loyally behind 
           Lafitte on the beach, awaiting orders.  Finally --    

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        We must leave this place.  Everyone 
                        grab what they can, quickly.  
                        Dominique, you and your hundred 
                        best will stay to defend the fort.

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        What are your orders? 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        If it’s a Union Jack, they have 
                        heard of my letter to Claiborne.  
                        Fire on them with all hell, fire 
                        and brimstone and destroy anything 
                        of value left behind on the island.  

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        And if it’s the Americans?

           Lafitte has to make a decision -- it’s a big one. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Do not fire on any American ship.

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                             (incredulous)
                        They will take the island, Jean -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Do not fire.  That is an order.  
                        Surrender peacefully and I will see 
                        to it you are released.  Everyone 
                        else, to the swamps. 

           EXT. GRAND TERRE ISLAND - FORT - MORNING

           Dominique and his hundred best have manned their HEAVY 
           ARTILLERY, ready to fire.  The encroaching ships sail closer. 

           Dominique watches intently.  Finally, he sees their FLAG. 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Aye.  Stand down.  

           EXT. GRAND TERRE ISLAND - BEACH - MORNING

           A WHITE FLAG has been planted in the sand.  Dominique stands  
           with his men as Patterson and his TROOPS storm the beach. 

           Patterson was ready for a fight.  He approaches Dominique. 

                                 COMMODORE PATTERSON
                        A white flag of surrender.  As 
                        spineless a pirate I have known.
                             (to his troops)
                        This island is now property of the 
                        United States government.  Raid the 
                        fort of all artillery, guns and 
                        worthwhile personal property.  

           And as Patterson’s men move onto the island -- 
                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Why do you do this?  We try to help 
                        you.  Why won’t you believe us?

                                 COMMODORE PATTERSON
                        We will never trust a pirate. 

           EXT. ISLAND HILLTOP - MORNING

           Across the BAY.  Lafitte and Pierre look on as Patterson’s 
           men raid the fort and set FIRE to the surrounding buildings.   

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        They will never trust a pirate. 

           Lafitte has no response.  He watches his paradise burn.  And 
           as we hear the sound of incongruous HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE --

           EXT. SPANISH GARRISON - DAY

           Jackson’s artillery BOMBARDS the SPANISH GARRISON in 
           Pensacola.  The BRITISH and SPANISH FLAGS still fly overhead.    

           These are just the opening salvos but the Americans have been 
           met with little resistance.  Jackson commands with authority 
           riding behind the line, pressing his men with commands.      

           Jackson makes his way to John Coffee and the waiting CAVALRY. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        General, where are the British?

           INT. SPANISH GARRISON - COURTYARD - DAY

           SPANISH SOLDIERS run around like chickens with their heads 
           cut off.  A few uniformed RED CREEK INDIANS do the same.  

           COMANDANTE GARCIA frantically approaches a SPANISH CAPTAIN as  
           EXPLOSIONS rock the garrison.  The captain has bad news...

                                 COMANDANTE GARCIA
                             (in Spanish; subtitled)
                        Tell me!  Where is he?!   

                                 SPANISH CAPTAIN
                        Captain Nicholls.  He has sailed.

           EXT. SPANISH GARRISON - DUSK

           Quiet now.  The SPANISH FLAG flies alone over the garrison.  
           Jackson, Coffee and a few others discuss terms with Garcia 
           and his high-command under another WHITE FLAG in a large 
           field outside the walls.  Garcia is a blabbering fool.

                                 COMANDANTE GARCIA
                        I was left no choice, General.  
                        None!  The British, they meant to 
                        march straight to New Orleans, but 
                        word of your arrival --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Where will they attack next?  

                                 COMANDANTE GARCIA
                        Nowhere!  Their plans have changed!

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You’re lying.  They will move over 
                        land to encroach on the city --

                                 COMANDANTE GARCIA
                        I promise you -- Nicholls and his 
                        men sailed south.  All of them.  
                             (conspiratorially)
                        The armada, it is here, General.  
                        Quicker than they thought possible.  
                        With your advance, they will not 
                        risk a march to New Orleans.    

           Jackson and Coffee share a look -- this was Jackson’s plan...   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Very well.  Captain Baines, take 
                        the Comandante into custody --

                                 COMANDANTE GARCIA
                             (grabs Jackson’s hand)
                        Please, General.  We were tricked!  
                        We were bamboozled!  We never meant 
                        to assist the British -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You housed them in your walls. 

                                 COMANDANTE GARCIA
                        They took us by force!  Let us keep 
                        the garrison.  It is our duty!   

           Jackson studies the groveling Garcia a moment.  And then --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I wouldn’t want to be impertinent.
           EXT. SPANISH GARRISON - DAY

           And now an AMERICAN FLAG flies over the garrison.  It’s the 
           next morning.  A small LEGION of Jackson’s men hold the fort 
           as Garcia and his command are kept prisoner in the courtyard.  

           Jackson and the rest of his troops are already drudging back 
           to New Orleans.  Again, the men don’t look terribly pleased.  

           Coffee rides up next to Jackson. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        “To the sea they shall return and 
                        we will meet them on the banks of 
                        the River.”  You’ve gotten exactly 
                        what you hoped for, General.    

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then let it not be the death of us. 

           EXT. JAMAICA - DUSK - ESTABLISHING  

           The awe-inspiring BRITISH ARMADA anchors just off-shore in 
           the calm, azure waters of the Caribbean.  

           TITLE:  NEGRIL BAY, JAMAICA 

           More than sixty vessels total.  From eighty-gun BATTLE SHIPS 
           to FRIGATES to ARMED TROOP TRANSPORTS, the ships packed so 
           close you could seemingly walk from one deck to the other.  

           It is quite simply the greatest naval force ever assembled. 

           Local JAMAICANS stand on the beaches greeting boarding 
           parties with various items for purchase.  BRITISH OFFICERS 
           have pitched tents to relax for a night on the sand.  

           MUSIC draws us toward the grandest ship in the fleet --

           EXT. HMS TONNANT - DUSK

           Where a REGIMENTAL BALL is in progress.  OFFICER’S WIVES 
           dance with their husbands, a STRING QUARTET playing on deck.  
           Colorful lanterns swing from the shrouds and other rigging. 

           It’s clear the British don’t think much of the war or the men 
           they’ve come to fight.  A confidence gained over many years. 

           We follow a young DECKHAND hustling with several bottles of 
           BRANDY through the bowels of the ship and into --
           INT. HMS TONNANT - COCHRANE’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           The STATE ROOM.  NAVAL ADMIRAL SIR ALEXANDER COCHRANE (56) 
           has just finished a festive meal with his high command. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Good Christ, son.  You have to swim 
                        back to England for that? 

           Cochrane is rather pompous and slovenly, a man who relishes 
           the power and forced respect his position provides.  

                                 DECKHAND
                        Apologies, Admiral.  We’ve run dry 
                        six casks already. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                             (to the others)
                        Bloody drunkards, the lot of you!

           Laughter fills the room.  The brandy is poured as Cochrane 
           moves to his position at the head of the table.  There are 
           several maps and charts of lower LOUISIANA spread about.

           MAJOR GENERAL JOHN KEANE (31), despite his age and boyish 
           looks, is in command of the BRITISH ARMY.  He’s in discussion 
           with COLONEL EDWARD NICHOLLS from the Spanish garrison.   

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        They will have but two small forts 
                        in opposition.  Shouldn’t require 
                        more than a fortnight really.

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        That right, ya’ young buck?  No 
                        more than a fortnight to sail up 
                        the mighty Mississip.  And how many 
                        of my ships will get over the bar 
                        at the River’s mouth?  How long 
                        will we waste plodding upstream?  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Admiral, I was only saying --

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                             (dismissive)
                        Yes, yes.  You’re in charge of the 
                        boys on the ground, Keane -- with 
                        no help from your father I’m sure -- 
                        but let a man who knows say first. 

                                 COLONEL NICHOLLS
                        Which route do you prefer, Admiral?
           Cochrane points to a large LAKE directly east of New Orleans.

                                 COLONEL NICHOLLS (CONT’D)
                        Lake Borgne?

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Aye.  She’s the one.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        But these charts -- the lake is far 
                        too shallow!  My men will have to 
                        row a hundred kilometers or more --

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        We are British.  If we must row, we 
                        will row.  Besides haven’t got much 
                        of a choice now, do we?  Not with 
                        your tottering gambit for Lafitte 
                        up in smoke and any march ruined by 
                        that ill-conceived debacle in 
                        Pensacola.  We shall anchor here --  

           Cochrane points to an area near southern Mississippi. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE (CONT’D)
                        -- row the length of Lake Borgne, 
                        drop ourselves down the canals into 
                        the river below the city and she 
                        shall be ours.  Now do either of 
                        you foresee a problem with that? 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                             (cowed)
                        No, sir.

           Cochrane slaps them both on their backs.

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Then tilt your glasses back, boys.  
                        Beauty and booty as they say -- the 
                        riches that await us, we shall be 
                        in New Orleans by Christmastime.

           And as Cochrane slams his empty glass down onto the map --

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - DAY

           A SHOP OWNER finishes hammering nails into a board covering 
           his shop window.  All through the Quarter there’s a sense of 
           uneasiness as preparations are made for the coming invasion. 

           A PAPER BOY sells the last of his supply and hustles through 
           the muddy streets straight past -- 
           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Where Claiborne has again gathered his inner-circle.  There’s 
           a copy of today’s NEWSPAPER on his desk with the headline 
           “BRITISH SAIL PAST CUBA HEADED FOR THE CITY”.  

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        How do they -- how does this 
                        newspaper -- know more than the 
                        Governor of Louisiana?!  And why do 
                        they see it fit to tell the people? 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Jean Lafitte --

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        Not that name again, Livingston!  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Jean Lafitte has many spies on the 
                        shores of Havana.  This information 
                        was offered but you so declined.   

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        So he took it to the paper?!  There 
                        will be panic in the streets!

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Governor, our citizens have a right 
                        to prepare themselves for battle. 

           The same sycophant lawyer from before finishes the article. 

                                 LAWYER
                        If this is correct and they will be 
                        here by the end of the month then 
                        we must consider unconditional 
                        surrender of the city.

           Livingston can’t believe what he’s hearing. 

                                 LAWYER (CONT’D)
                        They burned Washington to the 
                        ground.  I do not wish to see the 
                        same happen to our hallowed walls.   

           More than a few agree with him.  Livingston turns to MAJOR 
           GENERAL JACQUES VILLERE (54), head of the Louisiana militia. 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Major General Villere, will your 
                        militia be ready to fight? 
                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        Aye.  But without conscription our 
                        numbers have waned.  We’ve also 
                        asked this legislature many times 
                        to properly provide munitions --

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        You’ve received all that we have!  
                        A defense against an army of this 
                        magnitude is simply not feasible. 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        And is that what you will tell 
                        General Jackson when he arrives?  

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        I am in command of this city --

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                             (rising)
                        They have yet to raise a rifle and 
                        already we raise the flag!  The 
                        people deserve to be lead.

           A fat-cat BUSINESSMAN comes to Claiborne’s defense --

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Jackson is a scoundrel and from 
                        Tennessee at that.  He was only 
                        given command after all else in 
                        uniform refused his men.  If he’s 
                        the help the government sends, at 
                        least the British would be civil.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Do you not remember past atrocities 
                        suffered at their hand?  Jackson is 
                        a general in the United States Army 
                        and we are under attack!   

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        And his assistance, unlike 
                        Lafitte’s, will be appreciated.  
                        But Jackson comes to bear the 
                        burden of our surrender and nothing 
                        more.  It was his superiors, Mr. 
                        Madison especially, who started 
                        this cursed war and he will be the 
                        one to finish it.  For now we focus 
                        solely on our self-preservation.
           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - DAY

           The day is cold and damp.  Jackson and his men approach the 
           outskirts of the Quarter after another arduous journey.   

           TITLE:  DECEMBER 1, 1814

           The troops are covered in mud.  Even the uniformed soldiers 
           look like backwoods castaways.  Jackson himself is tired and 
           weak.  Lieutenant Adler comments to another officer nearby -- 

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        Heard he’s shit blood for a week. 

           Jackson turns on to ROYAL STREET and is surprised to see 
           hundreds of faces looking in his direction.  The PEOPLE OF 
           NEW ORLEANS are here to witness his arrival... 

           But it’s far from a hero’s welcome.  The diverse crowd -- 
           from French and Spanish Creole to African to transplanted 
           northerners -- ranges from curious to scared to indifferent.  

           A concerned HOUSEWIFE turns to her friend -- 

                                 HOUSEWIFE
                        They’re just so -- dirty. 

           Jackson ignores the crowd and heads for Claiborne’s office. 

           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Claiborne is dressed for the occasion.  He introduces Jackson 
           to several of his advisors who have formed a greeting line.   

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        -- Edwin Tolliver, Bank of New 
                        Orleans.  Morris Van Percy, 3rd 
                        Ward.  Dr. Julien Bouchard --  

                                 DOCTOR BOUCHARD
                        General, you seem pale.  If you 
                        wish to stop by my office -- 

           But Jackson has no time for formalities.  He sees Livingston 
           relegated with Major General Villere across the way.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Edward Livingston, as I do breathe. 

           Jackson steps away from the line.  They’re old acquaintances. 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        General, thank you for coming.  
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        A soldier goes where he is needed.

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        The sentiment has never meant more.  
                        This is Major General Villere, head 
                        of the Louisiana militia.  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        A true honor, sir.  My men and I 
                        are at your service.     

           Jackson and Villere shake hands.  Claiborne is quick to guide 
           Jackson back toward the rest of the room --

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        As are we all, General.  You will 
                        witness we are doing our absolute 
                        best during these terrible times --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Is that why my men found nary a 
                        defense as we approached the city? 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        Our resources have been utilized in 
                        the most efficient manner possible.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then perhaps we have differing 
                        definitions of efficiency. 

           Jackson isn’t exactly making friends here.  He walks to the 
           window.  There’s quite a CROWD gathered under the balcony. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Have you told them our intent? 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        General, please -- we are a diverse 
                        population.  I felt it best to wait 
                        for your arrival before making any 
                        considerations.  Now perhaps you 
                        would like to rinse the dirt from --

           But before Claiborne can finish, Jackson steps out onto --

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - BALCONY - DAY

           Where a few hundred people murmur at the sight.  Jackson 
           raises his hand for silence.  A pregnant pause, and then --  
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Citizens of New Orleans.  I am 
                        Major General Andrew Jackson and I 
                        am humbled to be in your presence.  
                        I wish the circumstances different, 
                        for the task before us is great, 
                        but I pledge to you now this -- I 
                        have come to protect your fair city 
                        and will drive the vile and 
                        reprehensible British into the sea 
                        or I will perish in the effort.  

           Jackson speaks with a commanding voice.  The crowd is in awe. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        You are a people of many origins, 
                        but know that we are not bound by 
                        geography in this battle, but by 
                        loyalty to our Fore Fathers and the 
                        disparagement of tyranny.  It is 
                        time to cease all differences and 
                        unite to save not only this city, 
                        but the country at large.  And for 
                        those unwilling to sacrifice, I 
                        give fair warning -- if you are not 
                        with us, you are against, and 
                        whether you sit at the head of the 
                        table or the foot, you will be 
                        dealt with as such.  New Orleans 
                        must not and will not fall.   

           A long beat.  And then a CHEER rises from the back of the 
           crowd.  Slowly at first, starting with the poor and working 
           class, but then it overtakes the city.  “Jackson has come!” 

           At last, the people have found their leader.  And as a 
           worrisome PIERRE LAFITTE watches the scene from afar -- 

           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Claiborne and his advisors are dumbstruck.    

                                 LAWYER
                        What have we wrought? 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        A storm. 

           Jackson finally enters from the balcony --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Make no mistake, Governor -- our 
                        only consideration is to fight.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT'D)
                             (to the room)
                        Where shall we begin?     

           EXT. SWAMP - DAY

           The next day.  A CROCODILE swims past in the water.  Jean 
           Lafitte meets with his brother Pierre and a few lieutenants.   

           The lieutenants have brought Lafitte a TRUNK with a sampling 
           of fine MENSWEAR -- bright whites and beiges, very plantation 
           chic.  Lafitte dresses using a mirror hung from a tree. 

           Pierre has, as always, a slightly nervous energy about him. 

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        It was a sight, mon frere.  Jackson 
                        will surely come for us now.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        But we are not against him, Pierre.  
                        In fact we are the opposite.  

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                             (that’s not the point)
                        Claiborne was a gnat to be toyed 
                        with, Jackson is decidedly not.  
                        The marshals have surely doubled 
                        their efforts in our pursuit. 

           Lafitte tries on a hat.  He isn’t taking this as serious as 
           Pierre would like.  Pierre tries another tactic --   

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        These stories of Jackson -- he’s a 
                        hard man, a swindler.  Said to be 
                        the best shot in all Tennessee --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And if I believed half the stories 
                        told about me? 

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        Most are true!  And even if they 
                        weren’t, Jackson is one man against 
                        20,000.  There is still time, Jean.  
                        The bounty is gone, yes, but the 
                        British would listen to reason --     

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        They would hang us from their 
                        gallows.  Our path has been struck. 
                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        And look where it has led us!  You 
                        in hiding wearing that ridiculous 
                        costume, the rest of us to follow.  
                        Dominique, he still sits in 
                        shackles!  Our people will follow 
                        you to their death, Jean.  You must 
                        bear that responsibility. 
                             (softens)
                        These men, this society -- they 
                        will buy our goods and drink our 
                        wine but they will never invite us 
                        into their homes.  No matter what 
                        we may offer.  We are who we are. 

           Jean finishes dressing -- now the perfect SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        We are who we are and Jackson is 
                        who he is.  There are many ways 
                        through this storm, Pierre.  
                        Claiborne was blinded by pettiness, 
                        but with Jackson we hold a distinct 
                        advantage. 

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        What’s that?

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        We know what he has to fight with.

           EXT. PLACE D’ARMES - COURTYARD - DAY

           And what he has isn’t much.  Jackson and his high-command get 
           their first look at the men who will defend the city. 

           It’s a sorry lot.  Roughly 3,000 troops stand in formation 
           around the courtyard.  Jackson and Coffee ride through as 
           Major General Villere handles introductions.  Livingston is 
           there, but Claiborne and his cronies are noticeably absent.         

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        This battalion was raised just this 
                        past month.  Local businessmen and 
                        the like, planters and their sons.

           The WORKER BATTALION wears brightly colored but mismatched 
           uniforms.  Their eagerness betrays their experience. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You’ve known the British to be 
                        ascending and these are your only 
                        recruited numbers?  250 at best?      
                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        Most men are unwilling to fight or 
                        have been told they need not to.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        By unpatriotic morons.  It is now 
                        our duty to compel them.  And what 
                        of these regiments here -- they 
                        seem better equipped to plow 
                        through crops than fight an army.    

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                             (swallows his pride)
                        They are mine, sir.  Louisiana 
                        State Militia at your command. 

           While in greater numbers than the worker battalion, the 
           unkempt MILITIA inspires only slightly more confidence. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Fowling pieces.  Muskets.  I’ve 
                        seen better arms in a bar fight.  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        I have personally sent a request to 
                        Secretary Monroe.  A shipment of 
                        munitions is purportedly on its way 
                        from Pittsburgh but so far -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We have been left to fight by hand.  
                        And who commands this unit? 

           Jackson has stopped in front of a group of FREE MEN OF COLOR.  
           Mostly Haitians, the 200 men are the most ill-equipped yet.  

                                 JEAN DAQUIN
                        I do, sir. 

           JEAN DAQUIN (54) is a proud man, a former plantation worker. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You have formal military training?

                                 JEAN DAQUIN
                        I do not, sir.  I’m a baker. 

           Villere whispers into Jackson’s ear -- 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        The Governor thought it a placating 
                        gesture to have a colored unit but 
                        felt it unnecessary to give them 
                        arms or actual paid wages. 
           Jackson doesn’t have time for this.  Back to Daquin --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Are your men willing to fight for 
                        the freedom of this country? 

                                 JEAN DAQUIN
                        Absolutely, General.  We are.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        General Coffee, distribute to them 
                        proper weapons -- wherever you may 
                        scrounge to find them -- and see to 
                        it the legislature pays these men 
                        an equal wage through and through.  

           This brings a smile to a few of the Haitian faces.  Jackson 
           quickly puts them in their place --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        This is not a time for giddiness.  
                        1,800 of my volunteers from 
                        Tennessee.  The 7th and 44th 
                        regiment of the United States Army 
                        loyally under my command.  And the 
                        rest of you.  With no money for 
                        pay, no weapons for arms and no 
                        experience to lead.  General 
                        Coffee, our final numbers?

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Just under 3,000.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Against 20,000 or more.  And what 
                        of our requested reinforcements?

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        1,400 from Kentucky but we have 
                        heard nary a word. 

           Jackson speaks to everyone in the square now, firm --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You men are all there is.  With 
                        only days to prepare.  In those 
                        days, you will be trained within an 
                        inch of your life.  If we are to 
                        have any hope, you must provide it, 
                        and by God, if I must crack the 
                        whip myself I will see to it that 
                        you do.  Begin the drills.  
           Those smiles have quickly disappeared.  And as Coffee and his 
           lieutenants shout forceful orders through the square  --

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        General, may I have a word? 

           EXT. PLACE D’ARMES - DAY

           Livingston has pulled Jackson aside.  Jackson is incredulous. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The pirate Jean Lafitte?  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Yes, sir.  He has much to offer in 
                        way of men, knowledge, munitions --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Do you see what I have to work with 
                        now, Livingston?  As inept a force 
                        as I’ve been put in charge of.  I 
                        only have so much trust and to 
                        trust these men is enough.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        A simple meeting is all I ask --  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        A man never allies with someone who 
                        would shoot him in the back.  We 
                        work with what we have. 

           And as Jackson turns back to the task at hand, Lafitte’s 
           offer for help through Livingston once again denied --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.) 
                        My fairest Rachel --

           EXT. PLACE D’ARMES - COURTYARD - DAY

           Coffee and his men put the troops through their paces.  The 
           weather is cold and wet, the men undisciplined.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        It has been far too long since you 
                        lay by my side, and that is what I 
                        dream, but first I must write with 
                        tails of misfortune from the city. 

           Coffee yells at the men to hold a line.  To march in time.  
           Lieutenant Adler shakes his head at Coffee’s efforts.
           EXT. PLANTATION FIELD - DAY

           The FREE MEN OF COLOR and WORKER BATTALION are being 
           instructed on how to fire and reload a rifle.  An OFFICER 
           demonstrates, then passes the rifle to the next man over. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        The men are no more soldiers than I 
                        a socialite.  At times fifty train 
                        upon a single rifle.  If given a 
                        year we would still not be ready. 

           EXT. SWAMPS - DAY

           Soldiers use HATCHETS to cut down trees around the bayou.  
           They lay the felled trees across any exposed WATERWAYS.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        The city itself is indefensible.  
                        With as many streams, inlets and 
                        canals we have resigned ourselves 
                        to covering all routes badly.  

           Two STATE MILITIA stand guard at each major waterway as the 
           rest of the soldiers move on to the next inlet. 

           EXT. FORT ST. PHILLIPS - DAY

           A rundown FORT on the Mississippi.  Jackson takes a tour with 
           COMMODORE PATTERSON, the commander who raided Barataria.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        Even key forts on the Mississippi 
                        have been left to rot by this 
                        insipid legislature.   

           Jackson is not impressed.  He notices a few of Patterson’s 
           men off-loading HEAVY ARTILLERY CANNONS from a river barge.  

                                 COMMODORE PATTERSON
                             (proudly)
                        Captured from Lafitte. 

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

           A row of MANSIONS in residential HIGH SOCIETY.  SERVANTS 
           supervise the loading of LUGGAGE onto waiting CARRIAGES.    
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        Additionally the very men who sent 
                        for my services do not seem fit for 
                        the task at hand.  They have spent 
                        more time packing their houses and 
                        sending their wives to the country 
                        than leading their own city.

           A few of Claiborne’s advisors say goodbye to their FAMILIES.  
           Claiborne kisses his prim and proper wife SUZETTE (38).   

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        I shall join as quickly as I can. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN (O.S.)
                        We’re sure that you will. 

           That was said with mild derision from Suzette’s cousin MARY-
           ANNE DERN (26).  Suzette shushes Mary-Anne with a look.  

           INT. URSULINE CONVENT - DAY

           A group of elderly NUNS have turned their convent into a 
           MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL.  They prepare bandages and setup beds.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        Thankfully those that remember our 
                        bloody history with the British 
                        have shown much more character then 
                        their elected officials.

           The same HOUSEWIFE who commented on Jackson’s “dirty” troops 
           sits with a few others sewing and cleaning UNIFORMS. 

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - BOURBON STREET - DAY

           Three OLDER MEN walk the streets as a recruited POLICE FORCE.  
           One of them uses a CANE.  A BAR FIGHT spills out of a TAVERN.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        Now only if I were granted the 
                        power to conscript those that have 
                        forgotten to do the same. 

           WALKING CANE fires his PISTOL into the air.  The fighting 
           drunks startle to a stop -- the old guy means business.

           INT. JACKSON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jackson finishes a bottle of whiskey while studying maps of 
           the bayou.  He’s clearly been at it for awhile.
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        Regardless, the battle comes 
                        quickly, and until their true path 
                        of attack is known, I am left 
                        simply to wait and wallow.

           Jackson takes a BREATH -- a moment alone to be exhausted.

           EXT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - DAY

           The carriages carrying SUZETTE CLAIBORNE and MARY-ANNE DERN 
           arrive at a picturesque PLANTATION in the countryside.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        But know as I do, my thoughts often 
                        drift to you and your warm embrace.  
                        I will see you again, my dear.  I 
                        must.  With love, Andrew. 

           The women are greeted by affable owner MILES ELMWOOD (63).

                                 MILES ELMWOOD
                        Mrs. Claiborne, it’s an honor. 

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        You’re too kind, Mr. Elmwood.  Your 
                        hospitality is appreciated. 

                                 MILES ELMWOOD
                        I do have to confess, my wife 
                        insisted on housing another guest 
                        as well at this time.  I hope it 
                        won’t be much an inconvenience. 

           A MAN emerges from the house and heads down the front steps.  

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        Surely it won’t.

                                 MILES ELMWOOD
                        Mrs. Claiborne, may I introduce 
                        Monsieur Jacques Clement.

           And as Suzette offers her hand to this man --

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        Monsieur Clement, my pleasure.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (O.S.)
                        The pleasure is indeed mine. 

           We reveal JEAN LAFITTE wearing the same plantation clothes we 
           saw him choosing in the swamp.  Lafitte smiles mischievously.
           It’s clear Suzette has no idea who he is.  And as Lafitte’s 
           lips touch her skin, MARY-ANNE watching with a curious look --

           EXT. LAKE BORGNE - MORNING

           Five AMERICAN GUNBOATS sail off the coast of Mississippi.  

           TITLE:  DECEMBER 10, 1814 - THE BATTLE ON THE LAKE

           CAPTAIN THOMAS JONES (37) uses a SPYGLASS to scan the horizon 
           to the east.  There’s nothing out of the ordinary, until --

                                 CAPTAIN THOMAS JONES
                        Great hell.    

           A row of never-ending WHITE SAILS emerges in the distance.  

                                 SAILOR
                        Is that -- sir, is that --

                                 CAPTAIN THOMAS JONES
                        The British.  They are here. 

           EXT. HMS TONNANT - MORNING

           Thirty miles to the east.  The armada drops ANCHOR along a 
           line of marshy ISLANDS that form a passageway into the lake.

           Admiral Cochrane is on deck with his high-command including 
           Colonel Nicholls and Major General Keane.  They have yet to 
           be made aware of the American presence across the way...    

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        We shall make anchorage and 
                        reconnoiter quickly the far side of 
                        the lake.  End of the line for the 
                        ships, the rest we’ll row by hand.  
                        Reds’ll be ready, yeah, Keaney-boy?    

           There’s still no love lost between Cochrane and diminutive 
           Keane.  A CAPTAIN hustles over with a SPYGLASS.

                                 BRITISH CAPTAIN
                        Sir.  Five American gunboats, fifty 
                        kilometers dead ahead. 

           He hands the glass to Nicholls who reconfirms the assessment. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Bastard Jackson knew we’re coming? 
                                 COLONEL NICHOLLS
                        Our spies say no.  These boat are 
                        simply lucky scouting the Gulf. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Or unlucky as the case may be.  
                        There’s a pheasant in our path, 
                        lads.  Clear the lakes. 

           EXT. AMERICAN GUNBOAT - MORNING

           Jones notices MOVEMENT on the decks of the British ships.   

                                 CAPTAIN THOMAS JONES
                        We must retreat hastily to warn 
                        Jackson and the others.  

           But there’s a problem on his own deck --

                                 SAILOR
                        Captain.  

           The SAILOR motions upward -- not a lick of wind in the sails. 

                                 SAILOR (CONT’D)
                        Worse yet, we always meant to sail 
                        in to the Gulf.  The current pushes 
                        us out now squarely to the east.

           East meaning toward the armada.  This is not good news.  

                                 DECKHAND
                             (naively)
                        Perhaps they won’t see us. 

           But Jones uses the spyglass to witness the first of many 
           BRITISH BARGES being lowered from the ships into the water.

                                 CAPTAIN THOMAS JONES
                        They see us.  We’re left no choice.  
                        Drop anchor and prepare for battle.

           EXT. LAKE BORGNE - DAY

           A few hours later.  FORTY-FIVE BRITISH BARGES race toward the 
           American boats.  The barges carry almost 1,500 troops and 
           form a line half a mile wide.  CAPTAIN NICHOLS LOCKYER, last 
           seen negotiating with Lafitte, is in the lead position.   

           The American boats have spread into a defensive formation, 
           but it’s fairly clear they don’t have much of a chance.  
           EXT. AMERICAN GUNBOAT - DAY

           The sailors watch with varying degrees of helplessness.  The 
           men arm their RIFLES and cover the boats with BOARDING NETS.  

           Suddenly the WATCHMAN sees something through his spyglass --

                                 WATCHMAN
                        Sir, they’ve stopped! 

           Dispositions perk up.  But then Jones looks himself --

                                 CAPTAIN THOMAS JONES
                        Yes.  To eat lunch.  They’ve 
                        stopped to eat lunch.  

           Oh.  Indeed they have -- right in the middle of the lake.  
           And the deafening sound of CANNON FIRE brings us to --

           EXT. LAKE BORGNE - DAY 

           The opening conflict in THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS.  Jones’ 
           men fight bravely at the outset, managing to SINK two of the 
           barges with their long-range CANNON fire...

           But the Americans are simply overmatched.  The British barges 
           quickly break-off and PLOW FULL-SPEED into Jones’ boat.  The 
           men fight hand-to-hand as the British cut through the NETS 
           and climb onto the deck.  Lockyer leads the bloody charge. 

           It’s only a matter of time now.  Captain Jones fires on 
           Lockyer, but Lockyer SHOOTS Jones in the belly.  Jones falls.  
           The redcoats turn the boat’s cannons on the other Americans, 
           creating chaos, allowing those boats to be boarded. 

           And as a handful of American SAILORS jump into the cold 
           waters of the lake, a BRITISH VICTORY easily in hand --

           INT. JACKSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Jackson receives word from Coffee on the state of their troop 
           preparations.  Coffee is unenthusiastic to say the least. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        As little progress as we’ve made, 
                        the harder we push, I fear the men 
                        may break before any actual battle.

           Jackson works at his desk, undeterred --
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Broken is not an option, John.  We 
                        must make them soldiers.  

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Even our men -- those that marched 
                        from Mobile to Pensacola to here -- 
                        their spirits have waned.  No one 
                        believes we can win.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Their only belief should be in 
                        killing the miscreant British 
                        standing in front of them. 

           Suddenly there’s a RAUCOUS coming from the street below --

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - ROYAL STREET - DAY

           Where two of the AMERICAN SAILORS have trudged their way back 
           to the city.  A CROWD gathers to hear their report --   

                                 TALL SAILOR
                        Aye, it was a bloodbath!  Ships as 
                        far as the eye could see! 

                                 SHORT SAILOR
                        They swarmed us like locusts, the 
                        barges did.  Captain Jones shot 
                        straight through the belly -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (O.S.)
                        What of our gunboats?   

           The crowd parts for Jackson and Coffee.  The sailors try to 
           stand a little straighter --

                                 SHORT SAILOR
                        Gone, sir.  Captured.  All five.

                                 TALL SAILOR
                        They come from the east, General.  
                        Lake Borgne.  With as many troops 
                        as you could count.  We were 
                        slaughtered.  It was a slaughter.  

           The crowd murmurs in panic.  They look to Jackson for words 
           of comfort.  A long beat, and then --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        At least we know now from which way 
                        they will attack the city.
           The people protest even louder.  Jackson is losing them.  And 
           that’s right when GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE arrives -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE 
                        What the hell has happened?!  

           It’s a stand-off between Claiborne and Jackson.  And as 
           Claiborne waits for an explanation -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE (V.O.)
                        You are stubborn as a mule!

           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           The discussion has moved indoors.  Claiborne is furious. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        Did you not hear their reports?!  
                        We are less than two weeks from our 
                        demise and you fail to acknowledge 
                        the obvious -- we do not want to 
                        fight!  You want to fight!

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        This was our first skirmish, and 
                        while unfortunate, more than an 
                        acceptable loss -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        There is no acceptable loss!  Again 
                        the men who started this war, they 
                        do not represent us!  They are not 
                        French or Spanish or --  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We are Americans first and always!

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        In theory, yes.  Not in practice.  
                        And not here.  I was elected to 
                        represent my people and as a body 
                        we are shaken to the core!   

           And whether Jackson agrees or not, he knows he’s not winning 
           this argument.  Claiborne moves in for the kill -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE (CONT’D)
                        This remains my jurisdiction, 
                        General.  And while your motivation 
                        may be just, I must insist we end 
                        this charade.  You have lost the 
                        people.  And without them -- the 
                        British have already won. 
           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - ROYAL STREET - DAY

           As harried as we’ve seen it.  The loss on Lake Borgne has 
           sent the people into a frenzy.  Many abandon the city.

           Jackson is UNSETTLED.  He walks through the crowd, unsure if -
           - or even how -- he can continue.  Jackson watches as the 
           elderly POLICE FORCE struggles to maintain order...

           And in that struggle, an IDEA.  Jackson smiles wryly.  

           INT. LIVINGSTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nicer than either Claiborne or Jackson’s office.  Livingston 
           pours himself a whiskey as Jackson enters --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I need a lawyer and a drink. 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        You’ve come to the right place.

           EXT. THE CABILDO - DUSK - ESTABLISHING  

           The grand building that houses the LOUISIANA LEGISLATURE.  

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE (V.O.)
                        The terms of our conditional 
                        surrender are thus -- 

           INT. THE CABILDO - ASSEMBLY ROOM - DUSK

           Claiborne and his advisors draft a letter to the British.  

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        -- that state and local officials 
                        shall remain in power and serve as 
                        your loyal servants during 
                        occupation while every effort is 
                        made to maintain our city walls --

           Claiborne is interrupted by the sound of HEAVY DOORS opening.  
           Jackson stands in the doorway with Livingston and Coffee. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE (CONT’D)
                        General, as I said before, if your 
                        assistance is required I shall -- 

           But Livingston walks over and hands Claiborne a DOCUMENT.
                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Governor Claiborne, as a 
                        representative of the second 
                        district court I hereby serve 
                        notice to you and this legislature 
                        a declaration to institute martial 
                        law within these city limits. 

           A bombshell.  Claiborne and his advisors are flabbergasted. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                             (to Jackson)
                        Son of a bitch, you have no right!

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        As the highest ranking military 
                        official in the city, the 
                        Constitution is his right.  Writ of 
                        habeas corpus shall be suspended as 
                        well as curfew established and 
                        conscription of all men to enlist --

           But Jackson cuts straight to the heart of the matter --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We are forcing the men to fight, 
                        Governor.  It’s no longer a matter 
                        of what they want.  It’s only a 
                        matter of what I want. 

           Claiborne stares at Jackson, his eyes cold --  

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        You are a soulless bastard. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Yes.  But I am yours. 

           INT. BOURBON STREET TAVERN - DAY

           The same DRUNKS that were fighting in the street are now 
           carousing at the bar.  The elderly POLICE FORCE enter -- 

                                 WALKING CANE
                        All men currently of age not 
                        enlisted or without excuse must 
                        report to the Place d’Armes 
                        tomorrow morning at dawn. 

                                 DRUNKARD
                        Who will make us, old man?  You? 

           Ten fully-uniformed ENLISTED MEN enter behind the police.  
                                 WALKING CANE
                        I believe I shall, yes.  

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING  

           A GHOST TOWN after curfew.  There’s not a single civilian on 
           the streets.  SOLDIERS on horseback patrol the city.  

           EXT. JACKSON’S OFFICE - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Jackson enjoys the silence and a drink with Livingston and 
           Coffee.  Livingston and Coffee are still in disbelief.      

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        If I did not bear witness -- 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        I would not believe.  Governor 
                        William Claiborne removed from 
                        power in his own state house.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Temporarily.  

           Jackson can’t help but smile -- he can’t believe it himself. 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        You are aware, General, your legal 
                        basis is shaky at best.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Throw me in shackles when the 
                        British have been sent packing.  I 
                        did what was necessary -- if those 
                        elected shall not lead then I will. 
                             (finishes his drink)
                        Our enemy sits on Lake Borgne, 
                        gentlemen, and there are still many 
                        ways to the gate.  Tonight we rest.  
                        Tomorrow we rise.  And then we 
                        continue the impossible. 

           EXT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - MORNING - ESTABLISHING  

           The sun rises on a new day. 
           INT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - MORNING

           MILES ELMWOOD and his wife ELEANOR have breakfast with their 
           guests -- Suzette Claiborne, Mary-Anne Dern and Jean Lafitte.  
           Lafitte is still incognito as Jacques Clement...

           But right now the focus is on Suzette.  She’s in a tizzy over 
           a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE she’s just finished reading -- 

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        This is -- I’m so sorry -- this is 
                        just unsettling news!  William will 
                        be so displeased.  Martial law!

                                 MILES ELMWOOD
                        Unconscionable.  Truly.  

                                 ELEANOR ELMWOOD
                        That man Jackson is a beast.     

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        He is!  He just -- my husband is 
                        the governor and this man has no 
                        right!  It’s just awful.  Awful. 

           Everyone at the table is in agreement -- everyone except Mary-
           Anne, who rolls her eyes.  Even Lafitte gets into the act -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You have my sympathy, Suzette.  
                        Your husband is a treasure to the 
                        great state of Louisiana and this 
                        is the worst news I’ve heard.  

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        Why thank you, Monsieur Clement.  
                        You are too kind for saying so. 

           But Lafitte barely keeps a straight face.  Mary-Anne notices.

           INT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - MORNING

           After breakfast.  The dishes are being cleared.  Lafitte 
           pours himself a coffee.  Mary-Anne leans in to his ear --

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Next time you should try harder to 
                        hide your joy at the suffering of a 
                        bitter rival, Monsieur Lafitte.  

           Mary-Anne walks away coquettishly.  She has his attention. 
           EXT. LAKE BORGNE - FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

           No more than a few STILTED FISHING HUTS on the marsh.  A 
           dozen SPANISH FISHERMAN are finishing up work for the day. 

           Two BRITISH REDCOAT SPIES suddenly appear from around the 
           bend.  The head FISHERMAN quickly grabs a KNIFE, but the 
           spies hold up their hands -- we mean you no harm.  

                                 SPANISH FISHERMAN
                             (in Spanish; subtitled)
                        British, yes?  
                             (the spies nod)
                        We’ve got no problem with that.

                                 BRITISH SPY
                        We need a route into the city. 

                                 SPANISH FISHERMAN
                        They’ve all been blocked by felled 
                        trees.  Makes fishing impossible.
                             (spits)
                        Of course, a few of them aren’t.  

           A beat.  Then one of the spies takes out his COIN PURSE.  

           EXT. PLACE D’ARMES - COURTYARD - DAY

           It’s mid-morning and already a LINE OF UNHAPPY MEN stretches 
           into the Quarter waiting for time at the ENLISTMENT TABLE.   

           Jackson has an extra spring in his step.  He walks through 
           with his high-command -- Coffee, Livingston, Major General 
           Villere, Commodore Patterson...

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We’ve made sure all pathways from 
                        Lake Borgne are covered?

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        As sure as we can be. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Commodore Patterson, the heavy 
                        artillery at Fort Phillips -- with 
                        the British encampment to the east 
                        we should move them up river. 

                                 COMMODORE PATTERSON
                        Yes.  Unfortunately, General -- 
                        regarding the cannons -- while in 
                        working order, we’ve found we have 
                        little to fire them with.   
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Of course not.  Because heaven 
                        forbid anything goes right for long 
                        in this damned city.  What of our 
                        munitions shipment from Pittsburgh?

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        We’ve sent scouts.  Still no word. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The bastards in Washington are as 
                        unreliable as Claiborne says. 

           Jackson stops for a moment to think.  And then -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        These artillery -- you captured 
                        them from Lafitte, yes?  Were there 
                        no munitions on Barataria?  

           Patterson shakes his head -- not that we found.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        A pirate would never leave himself 
                        a gun without a bullet.    

           Livingston sees another opportunity -- 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        General, if you wish to speak to 
                        Lafitte directly, I can --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I will not beg, Livingston.  Not 
                        now.  Besides, there may be another 
                        option for us to consider.     

           INT. CITY JAIL - CELL - DAY

           DOMINIQUE YOU and a few LIEUTENANTS sit in a cramped, dark 
           cell.  They’ve been here since the day they were captured.  

           Dominique hears footsteps.  Jackson and Livingston approach.

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Well lookee here -- if it ain’t the 
                        new man in charge.  I don’t believe 
                        we’ve met -- je suis Dominique You.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Major General Andrew Jackson. 
                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        The pleasurest of pleasures.

           Dominique offers his hand through the bars.  Jackson refuses.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Mr. You, I am here regarding your 
                        artillery munitions.  Your brother 
                        must have known an attack was 
                        eminent and squirreled them away.  
                        I want to know where.    

           Dominique studies Jackson a moment, then starts to LAUGH -- 
           loud and boisterous, until finally --

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        I see it now, coming from you!  
                        Martial law!  If there was ever a 
                        move made by a pirate il est que! 

           Dominique continues.  Jackson seethes.  Livingston steps in --

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Dominique, please -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You and I are not the same. 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        I wouldn’t be so sure, Général.  I 
                        wouldn’t be so sure at all. 
                             (regains his composure)
                        Regardless, we tried to help you 
                        once -- no one would listen.  

           Jackson steps closer to the bars -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Circumstances have changed.  If you 
                        ever wish to see outside this cell 
                        you will be more than forthcoming.

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        And if you ever wish to see those 
                        munitions, speak to my brother!  
                        You think these bars scare me?  
                        Remember -- I was the one who 
                        surrendered pour vous!  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Your brother is a fugitive.  
                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        It’s his deal to make.  I had my 
                        way, you pignuts would get shit and 
                        be quite happy about it.  Now tell 
                        the guard I’m ready for my lunch. 

           EXT. CITY JAIL - DAY

           Jackson and Livingston exit.  Livingston looks at Jackson -- 
           do you want me to speak to Lafitte?  A beat, then simply --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        No.  

           And as Jackson walks back toward the Place d’Armes -- 

           EXT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - GARDENS - NIGHT

           Mary-Anne reads by candlelight in the well-manicured garden.  
           Jean Lafitte approaches.  Mary-Anne looks up from her book. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Well hello, Monsieur Clement.  Or 
                        should I say -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        How did you know? 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Magic.  
                             (and then)
                        I’ve seen you before.  At one of 
                        your soirees in the city. 

           INT. FRENCH QUARTER MANSION - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A decadent affair.  New Orleans HIGH SOCIETY revels at one of 
           Lafitte’s famous parties.  Mary-Anne mingles in the crowd as 
           JEAN LAFITTE, handsome in a tuxedo, walks down the stairs. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN (V.O.)
                        With as many suitors who bat their 
                        eyes and flip their skirts, I’m 
                        sure you wouldn’t remember me.

           Indeed, all female eyes are seemingly on Lafitte --

           EXT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - GARDENS - NIGHT

           Leaving Lafitte to smile knowingly at Mary-Anne’s assumption.
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        The parties -- they are wondrous.

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        And yet here you sit -- stashed 
                        away as Monsieur Clement, wanted by 
                        your government as well as others, 
                        smuggler of the high seas.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Such is the life.

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        I’m sure.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (beat)
                        You don’t believe me? 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        You say “such is the life” as if it 
                        wasn’t your choice.  As if you 
                        didn’t decide at some point in your 
                        past to actually become a pirate.  
                        I would think hiding in shadows 
                        came with the territory. 

           Lafitte’s not used to being talked to like this.  He smiles -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Privateer.  There is a difference.

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        And is that what you whisper to all 
                        those girls to make them swoon? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        A man whispers many things -- as 
                        I’m sure you know.     

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        You’re making assumptions now. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        If you can, my dear, so can I.

           Touche.  A charged beat, then Mary-Anne regroups --    

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Then perhaps we’ve both misjudged, 
                        Monsieur.  I’m here only because my 
                        esteemed father thinks I need 
                        “seasoning” to find a husband.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY-ANNE DERN (CONT'D)
                        I’d rather be anywhere but high 
                        society, I assure you.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And why is that exactly?   

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Shall I make a list or is our 
                        riveting breakfast conversation 
                        enough?  They’re idiots, mostly.  
                        My cousin and her husband --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Our intrepid Governor.  

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Is he still?  Or is it former 
                        governor.  I’m not familiar with 
                        the intricacies of martial law.    

           It’s only taken a minute, but Lafitte is clearly intrigued by 
           this girl.  Mary-Anne moves on in conversation -- 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN (CONT’D)
                        So tell me, Monsieur Lafitte, why 
                        are you here? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Elmwood is an old friend.  Or his 
                        wife is, I should say -- he doesn’t 
                        even know who I am.  But until 
                        Jackson wants my help, I’m lost.

           Mary-Anne shakes her head -- she finds something ridiculous.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        You think he would really ask?  A 
                        man with ego enough to remove the 
                        governor from power?  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I’ve offered my services --

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Let me guess -- you offered to be 
                        the white knight coming to save the 
                        city, your sail full of wind --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (incredulous)
                        So now I’m the one with ego? 
                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        You sleep fifteen feet from the 
                        Governor’s wife!  Your ego is as 
                        grand as his.  And tell me -- do 
                        you often accept the help of others 
                        in your moment of possible triumph?

           Mary-Anne has him and Lafitte knows it.  He’s amazed --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Who are you? 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Mary-Anne Dern, a simple girl from 
                        St. Louis...

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You’re far from simple. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        And yet still a girl.
                             (beat)
                        So why do it?  Why pledge your 
                        help?  I’ve seen the handbills.  Is 
                        it simply to buy your freedom? 

           Lafitte thinks for a moment.  And then -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You said I had a choice earlier, to 
                        become a pirate.  There was no such 
                        choice.  My brothers and I, born 
                        into poverty in Port au Prince.  
                        Our father killed over a debt for 
                        bread.  We lived through a tyranny 
                        of another kind.  This way of life 
                        was the only way of life.      
                             (beat)
                        We may be wanted men in America, 
                        but it’s by our choice.  I don’t 
                        want to buy our freedom, I want to 
                        protect that which we already have.  
                        So now tell me, knowing that -- if 
                        I offered you my help -- would you 
                        ever trust a pirate?   

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Only if I kissed him first.  And 
                        only if he’s earned it. 

           Both flirtatious and true.  Lafitte considers her a moment --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Perhaps yours is the help I need. 
           INT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - MORNING

           The next morning.  Everyone has gathered except Lafitte.  

                                 MILES ELMWOOD
                        Shall we wait?

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        I saw Monsieur Clement earlier.  He 
                        received word of an urgent business 
                        matter and apologized he would be 
                        gone several days.

                                 ELEANOR ELMWOOD
                        Well then, lets begin.

           They sit.  Suzette turns to Mary-Anne --

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        You know, Mary-Anne -- Monsieur 
                        Clement is the most interesting 
                        fellow.  You should hope to marry 
                        someone from such good stock.    

           And as Mary-Anne struggles to hide her smile --

           EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING

           Jackson sits on the shore of the river, conflicted.  He 
           fingers the same COLONIAL COIN we saw him with in Mobile.  

           Again, this coin means something to him.  Jackson finally 
           makes a decision.  He stands.  

           EXT. LIVINGSTON’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Jackson knocks on the FRONT DOOR.  Livingston answers in his 
           bed clothes.  Two young CHILDREN play at Livingston’s feet.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Is there a problem, General? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I want to meet Lafitte. 

           A beat, then Livingston steps to the side.  Lafitte is there.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        The feeling is mutual.  
           EXT. ROYAL STREET TAVERN - MORNING - ESTABLISHING  

           Coffee and two ENLISTED MEN stand guard at the door. 

           INT. ROYAL STREET TAVERN - MORNING

           The bar is empty.  Jackson and Lafitte sit across from each 
           other at a table.  Livingston is there to mediate.  

           There’s a long, awkward silence.  Finally --    

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Shall I begin --

           But Jackson jumps in full bore -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        This is what I shall require, 
                        Monsieur Lafitte -- all munitions, 
                        all weapons, all able-bodied men to 
                        be delivered to my command no later 
                        than the day after next. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Require?  For what exactly? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Compliance. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Delivered to your command. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I’m the one in charge am I not?  

           That was definitive.  Lafitte considers Jackson a moment -- 
           he’s heard the stories, but to face Old Hickory himself...   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        No. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I beg your pardon.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (congenial)
                        I do not accept your requirements. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You don’t have much of a choice. 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        But see, I do.  This “delivery” 
                        isn’t why I’ve come to the table.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then I shall have you arrested.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Is that really the proper use of 
                        your resources as the British 
                        breathe down your neck?  I’m here 
                        to offer you partnership.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The government of the United States 
                        does not partner with a pirate.  
                        The city is under martial law and 
                        whatever I want, I shall have. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        By all means!  Of course, there’s a 
                        reason you found yourself knocking 
                        on Livingston’s door this morning.  
                        But if you know where the munitions 
                        are, who am I to stop you? 

           This isn’t off to a great start.  Livingston nervously sips 
           his whiskey.  And now it’s Jackson who studies Lafitte...

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I have no time for cleverness.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I wasn’t trying to be.  Tell me, 
                        General -- why won’t you trust me?  
                        I’ve given you no reason not to.  
                        My letter to Claiborne.  We didn’t 
                        fire on a single American ship.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You were taken by force --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You know as well as I we would 
                        never go down without a fight.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        It’s what I’ve heard about you.  
                        Your history.  You’re a thief.  You 
                        have no code. 

           Lafitte leans forward here --
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And you think I haven’t heard the 
                        same about you?  A scoundrel.  A 
                        man who will duel at the first 
                        false word.  The Benton Brothers?  
                        The fact is, General, I shouldn’t 
                        be sitting with you. 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Gentleman, please -- let us return 
                        to the matter at hand --

           But Jackson isn’t going to let that last accusation stand --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON 
                        I have no shame.  Have I shot many 
                        men?  Yes.  All of whom deserved 
                        their fate.  All of whom agreed to 
                        the battle before them.  I do not 
                        hide in the shadows.  I have honor. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        As do I.  But for all that we’ve 
                        acquired and by all the means which 
                        we’ve acquired it, we both know who 
                        we are when we sleep at night. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                             (scoffs)
                        A pirate. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        A man who gets what he wants.  And 
                        what I want is to send the British 
                        back to their tea and crumpets.  
                        What is it you want, General?   
                             (Jackson doesn’t answer)
                        You think we’re so different, 
                        perhaps that’s the case.  But this 
                        city -- we are Creole, we are 
                        Spaniard, we are northerners.  You 
                        want to save the country?  We are 
                        this country.  This table here.  We 
                        may fight when we are at peace, but 
                        because we are allowed to is why we 
                        must come together during war.

           Jackson doesn’t have an argument for that.  Finally --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        What comes with this partnership? 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I will stand by your side and 
                        defend this country that I love.  
                        And I will earn your trust as long 
                        as you earn mine.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        You will earn my trust or I will 
                        shoot you were you stand.  Do not 
                        think for an instant this makes up 
                        for any past transgressions.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I wouldn’t have it any other way.

           INT. CITY JAIL - CELL - DAY 

           Dominique You is taking a nap.  Suddenly, the cell door 
           swings open.  Jackson and Lafitte are there. 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Mon frere.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Send word.  It’s time to fight. 

           Lafitte helps Dominique to his feet.  Dominique brushes past 
           Jackson as they head for the exit --

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                             (with a smile)
                        Wasn’t so hard now was it, Général?  

           And as Jackson wonders what he’s gotten himself in to -- 

           EXT. PLACE D’ARMES - COURTYARD - MORNING

           It’s two days later and the courtyard has been overrun by 
           over three hundred PIRATES.  They take great joy in being let 
           out of exile and greet each other with hugs, wine and cigars.  

           The rest of Jackson’s troops look on with destain.  Even the 
           WORKER BATTALION and FREE MEN OF COLOR, with their limited 
           training, think they’re better than this disorganized lot. 

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        For Christ’s sake on a cross... 

           Jackson and Coffee observe from across the way.  A few of the 
           ENLISTED MEN trade words with the BARATARIANS.  A FIGHT soon 
           breaks out.  The officers struggle to maintain order.
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We were hardly making progress to 
                        begin with.  

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        You did what was necessary.  Rest 
                        assured, they will be watched.     

           As if on cue, Dominique You oversees the unloading of several 
           WOODEN CRATES.  The crates are covered in dirt.  Dominique 
           opens one of the crates and reveals a stash of RIFLES.   

           But the MUNITIONS aren’t what amazes Jackson the most --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I had to invoke martial law to 
                        raise an army -- Lafitte had simply 
                        to whisper to the wind.

           Lafitte greets a few more of his men near the gate.  Suddenly 
           his brother PIERRE is there.  The brothers share an embrace.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I know you had your doubts, Pierre.  
                        But we are here on equal ground.  I 
                        need you by my side. 

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        Then that is where I will be.  

           But the moment Lafitte turns away, Pierre’s face FALLS.  He’s 
           still clearly skeptical about siding with the Americans.  

           Lafitte approaches Jackson and Jackson’s high command --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        How’s this for “delivery”, General? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Your men need to be disciplined.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And they will be.  The fight will 
                        bring it out of them. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Our scouts have the British across 
                        Lake Borgne in barges.  Their 
                        entire army has made camp. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Are they into the canals? 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                             (re: their troops)
                        For our sake let us hope not.   

           EXT. MARSH - MORNING

           Unfortunately, that’s exactly where they are.  The SPANISH 
           FISHERMAN leads a legion of REDCOATS through the bog.  

           They pass an unblocked CANAL and find themselves standing --

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - MORNING

           On the edge of a magnificent plantation ORANGE GROVE. 

           TITLE:  VILLERE PLANTATION - 8 MILES SOUTH OF NEW ORLEANS

           The redcoats move quickly toward the MAIN HOUSE.

           EXT. VILLERE HOUSE - VERANDA - MORNING

           Two of General Villere’s sons, GABRIEL and CELESTINE (both 
           late teens), are on the porch cleaning fowling pieces.  
           Celestine munches on an APPLE...    

           Suddenly Gabriel sees a flash of RED in the orange groves.  

                                 GABRIEL VILLERE
                             (in French; subtitled)
                        Did you see that?  

           Another flash.  The REDCOATS move through the trees.  Gabriel 
           turns to his younger brother --   

                                 GABRIEL VILLERE (CONT’D)
                        Run.  Tell Father. 

                                 CELESTINE VILLERE
                             (scared)
                        What will you do? 

                                 GABRIEL VILLERE
                        All that I can to stop them.  

           EXT. VILLERE HOUSE - MORNING

           The redcoats approach the front of the house with arms at the 
           ready.  Suddenly the door opens and Gabriel and the HOUSE 
           STAFF step out with their hands raised...
           COLONEL WILL THORNTON (32) motions his men to take the house.  
           As they do they don’t notice CELESTINE sneaking out the back. 

           But just as Celestine reaches the swamp TREE LINE -- 

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        What was that?  Back there.  

           Four REDCOATS move toward the trees.  Gabriel tenses.

           EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

           Celestine has a little bit of a head start.  He approaches a 
           massive LIVE OAK tree.  He looks up into the branches and 
           finds the perfect spot.  But just as he starts to climb --

           He hears a WHIMPER.  The family SETTER has followed him into 
           the swamp.  The setter wags its tail with a low BARK. 

           The redcoats turn.  Celestine doesn’t know what to do. 

           EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

           The REDCOATS approach the LIVE OAK.  They pass under the 
           tree’s criss-crossing branches, searching... 

           Only they never look up.  For if they did, they would see 
           Celestine sitting on a branch feeding the dog his APPLE.

           Celestine holds his breath.  The redcoats finally move away.   

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - DAY 

           It’s a few hours later and the British have made CAMP.  Over 
           1,600 TROOPS with many more presently trudging through the 
           canal onto the grounds... 

           After the hard journey through the swamps, the plantation is 
           a refuge.  Many have never seen such a place, the MISSISSIPPI 
           RIVER running wide along the western border of the property.  

           The UNION JACK flies high from a tree branch.  MAJOR GENERAL 
           KEANE finally arrives.  He’s approached by COLONEL THORNTON --

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        Sir, there’s news. 
           INT. VILLERE HOUSE - STUDY - DAY

           The house study has been turned into a WAR ROOM.  Keane and 
           Thornton are there with the two BRITISH SPIES --

                                 BRITISH SPY
                        The Americans are surely blind, 
                        General.  The grounds lead straight 
                        to the Quarter with little defense.  
                        The canals were a godsend. 

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        It will take days to move the rest 
                        of the army to meet us here, but we 
                        could be in the city by nightfall.

           This is an unexpected development, but Keane waivers...

                                 COLONEL THORNTON (CONT’D)
                        Sir, pardon my forwardness -- I 
                        know Admiral Cochrane was clear in 
                        his orders to wait but --

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        The numbers are our strength, 
                        Colonel.  We haven’t waded through 
                        this bog to move carelessly now. 

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        I don’t believe this careless.

           Keane still isn’t convinced.  But then he notices a PAINTING 
           on the wall of MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE in full uniform.  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        I want to speak with the prisoner.

           INT. VILLERE HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           GABRIEL VILLERE is tied to a chair.  Keane paces in front of 
           him.  Keane’s imposing -- or at least trying to be...

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        To believe we sailed the Atlantic, 
                        we sludged through your treacherous 
                        swamps, all to wind up here -- in 
                        the house of the head of the 
                        Louisiana State Militia!    

                                 GABRIEL VILLERE
                        Please, Major General -- I will 
                        assist in any way possible -- do 
                        not harm the staff of the house --
           Gabriel is groveling a bit.  Keane is emboldened.

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        You are a disgrace to the family 
                        name, Gabriel!  But I am not 
                        surprised.  There is a saying, 
                        heard first in your own capital --
                        militia don’t attack.  They run.   

           Gabriel fights back tears.  It’s rather dramatic.  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE (CONT’D)
                        You want to protect those in the 
                        house, tell me now -- how many men 
                        has Jackson assembled in the city? 

           Gabriel looks pained.  He doesn’t want to say.  Finally --

                                 GABRIEL VILLERE
                        17,000.

           That’s when we realize -- Gabriel’s been putting on a show. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Our spies say no more than five. 

                                 GABRIEL VILLERE
                        Jackson sent for reinforcements.  
                        Enlisted men from Kentucky and 
                        Tennessee.  They have come. 

           EXT. VILLERE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Keane exits, his mind racing.  Thornton is there.  Finally -- 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        I will not risk our position.  We 
                        wait for Admiral Cochrane. 

           And as Keane heads down the hall, Gabriel’s plan a success --

           EXT. DOCKYARD - DAY

           Jackson and Patterson oversee the loading of the ninety-nine 
           foot schooner LOUISIANA with Baratarian HEAVY ARTILLERY. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        How many of Lafitte’s men do you 
                        need to set sail? 

                                 COMMODORE PATTERSON
                        As many as you can spare. 
           Just then MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE and his son CELESTINE arrive 
           on horseback.  Both are nearly out of breath --

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        General!  The British are eight 
                        miles hence without a fort, a gun 
                        or a man between here and the city! 

           INT. JACKSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Things are rather disorganized from the news.  Jackson is 
           with his high-command, but there’s a lot of cross talk --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        If it’s true -- why haven’t they 
                        marched all the way to our walls?

           Major General Villere gives Celestine a look -- speak up. 

                                 CELESTINE VILLERE
                        My brother -- he had idea to 
                        misinform them of our numbers --

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        He may have saved us all.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        He very well may have, but the 
                        British shall not sleep on our 
                        soil.  We fight them tonight!

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Sir, we’re not prepared to --

           Jackson SLAMS his fist on the table.  Everyone quiets.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We’ve prepared for weeks.  If 
                        Celestine is indeed correct -- if 
                        these men are only the advance 
                        guard -- now is the time to strike.  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        It will be dark within the hour. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        They wish to fight to the beat of 
                        the drum, we must dictate our own 
                        terms.  Commodore Patterson, enlist 
                        the men you need and send the 
                        Louisiana down to their position.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT'D)
                        When they have been sufficiently 
                        bombarded, light the sky and we 
                        shall answer your call. 

           Patterson is hesitant.  So are the rest.  Jackson sees this --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Do I have none of your support?  

           A long beat of silence.  But then LAFITTE steps forward -- he 
           crosses to a nearby desk, making himself a DRINK --  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You have mine.  If only because all 
                        else here would so decline.  The 
                        British will never expect it.

           That support, from Lafitte no less, is all Jackson needs -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We disembark as soon as we can.  
                        The British may indeed dine for 
                        Christmas in the city, but I shall 
                        be seated at the head of the table. 

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - DUSK

           Jackson’s ARMY has been assembled.  There’s a nervous energy 
           as the men march through the city.  From the ENLISTED MEN and 
           MILITIA, confident and trained, to the WORKER BATTALION and 
           FREE MEN OF COLOR, excited but scared for their first combat.

           And then there are the BARATARIANS, not so much marching in 
           line as walking with swagger to the battlefield, the ENLISTED 
           MEN casting them the occasional sideways glance.  WOMEN and 
           CHILDREN line the streets waving HANDKERCHIEFS, the BELLS of 
           the nearby CATHEDRAL echoing in time...  

           Jackson rides at the front, high on his horse in FULL DRESS 
           UNIFORM.  Lafitte is next to him.  Lafitte leans over --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        It’s clever.  Our first battle and 
                        no need for the men to hold a line.  
                        They may fight as savages.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We are who we are. 

           And as the army leaves the gates of the city, the ELDERLY 
           POLICE FORCE left to SALUTE and guard the CITY WALLS -- 
           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - NIGHT

           The BRITISH relax on the plantation.  CAMPFIRES dot the 
           landscape.  The men feast on wares taken from nearby farms.   

           TITLE:  DECEMBER 23, 1814 - THE NIGHT BATTLE 

           A group of REDCOATS sits around the fire drinking near the 
           river.  One of them wraps the SORES on his hands --  

                                 SORE HANDS
                        Never shall I row again. 

                                 PIPE SMOKER
                        Aye, until we’ve gotta go back!

           Laughter around the circle.  But then --

                                 SORE HANDS
                        What the hell is that? 

           A SHIP floats down the river in the darkness.  The men move 
           to get a better look, but it’s hard to see through the FOG.     

                                 PIPE SMOKER
                        Cochrane sent a schooner to guard 
                        our flank?   

                                 SORE HANDS
                        That or a merchantman surely.  She 
                        looks like a ghost. 

           Indeed she does.  There’s the sound of her ANCHOR splashing 
           in the water.  The ship is only a few hundred yards away.  

                                 PIPE SMOKER
                        We need to raise her.

           A few of the soldiers FIRE their rifles, trying to get the 
           ship’s attention, but the ship sits silently unlighted... 

           And then, several small FLICKERS OF FLAME on her deck.

                                 SORE HANDS
                        Are those firing matches? 

           But the words are barely out of his mouth before the GUNPORTS 
           are snapped open and a voice bellows from the darkness --

                                 AMERICAN SAILOR
                        For the honor of America!

           And then the LOUISIANA OPENS FIRE WITH A HAIL OF GRAPE SHOT.  
           The redcoats dive for cover anywhere they can find it.  The 
           shot tears through the campfire circles, the plantation now 
           under relentless barrage from the Louisiana’s port-side guns.

           As the ARTILLERY fires, the flames light up the faces of the 
           men manning the cannons -- many of Lafitte’s top LIEUTENANTS.

           INT. VILLERE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Major General Keane and his high-command are eating dinner as 
           the shots rain down.  Keane rushes to the window --

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        What kind of fighting is this!? 

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        The American kind.

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - NIGHT

           The BOMBARDMENT has lasted almost an hour.  The British hide 
           in ditches and behind trees.  CASUALTIES litter the field.

           Suddenly, the firing comes to a halt.  And then --  

                                 SORE HANDS
                        What could possibly happen now? 

           THREE ROCKETS light up the sky -- one RED, one WHITE, and one 
           BLUE.  Jackson’s signal from the Louisiana.

           And then all hell is unleashed.  

           Jackson’s men OPEN FIRE from the darkness just north of the 
           plantation.  They boldly CHARGE onto the field where they 
           meet the weary and bloody British forces.  The BATTLE is on.      

           It’s unlike any the British have ever seen.  No drums, no 
           marching lines.  Jackson’s ENLISTED MEN lead the charge, but 
           soon the MILITIA and WORKER BATTALION join.  The FREE MEN OF 
           COLOR attack near the swamps, cutting free British horses. 

           Through this Jackson leads with Lafitte not far from his 
           side.  They are impressive.  And as the battle continues --

           EXT. VILLERE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Major General Keane is outside the main house trying to find 
           some semblance of order in the chaos. 
                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        How many men!? 

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        Impossible to tell through the 
                        smoke and fog! 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Form a line as best we can and send 
                        word into the swamps -- all other 
                        legions, get them here now!

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - NIGHT

           The battle has broken into vicious little FIGHTS all over the 
           field.  A BRITISH MAJOR slays a member of Villere’s MILITIA, 
           then turns to a sound in the smoke and darkness -- 

                                 BRITISH MAJOR
                        Are you the Ninety-third? 

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Aye, that’s right!

           The major is relieved.  He walks forward only to have a hand 
           slap down on his shoulder.  It’s one of Jackson’s ENLISTED --

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Apologies, Major.  I was mistaken.  
                        And now you’re my prisoner.  

           Across the way the BARATARIANS battle with a legion of 
           REDCOATS.  The pirates fight with anything available -- 
           RIFLES, BAYONETS, KNIVES, HATCHETS, SABERS, FISTS.  A few of 
           Jackson’s ENLISTED MEN are impressed by the show.

           One of the WORKER BATTALION hears footsteps in the dark.  He 
           turns and fires, only to find he’s killed one of his own.

           Across the way Jackson reconvenes with Coffee and Lafitte.  
           As the battle drags, it’s becoming harder to tell who’s 
           winning and where.  Casualties mount on both sides.  

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        There are two six-pounders coming 
                        up from the rear! 

           But Jackson sees more and more BRITISH REINFORCEMENTS coming 
           through the canal, meeting up with MAJOR GENERAL KEANE... 

           And in a moment of battlefield clarity -- 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Save the guns, General!  With their 
                        reinforcements, the tide can only 
                        shift in their favor.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        A retreat? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Hardly.  We shall camp to the north 
                        and see what daylight brings.  Our 
                        message has been duly received. 

           And as Jackson leads them back through the plantation, the 
           SCREAMS of those injured or dying shouting into the night --

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - MORNING

           The sun rises on a dreary and horrific scene.  Over 500 
           casualties from both sides, over 70 men killed in action, but 
           the British have clearly gotten the worst of it. 

           Many bodies lay were they fell.  Bayonets protrude, bones are 
           broken, limbs torn apart with shot.  War from this time is 
           not kind to the men who must fight it... 

           Keane and Thornton walk the grounds.  Keane is aghast --

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Never in all my years... 

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        It seems the Americans have found a 
                        new sense of boldness.  

           The LOUISIANA is still up river just out of musket range.  
           She’s been joined by another American schooner, the CAROLINA.  
           The boats trade off firing GRAPE SHOT onto the front lines.    

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Yes.  And his name is Jackson. 

           Suddenly ADMIRAL COCHRANE arrives through the canal with his 
           travelling party.  Cochrane takes one look around -- 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Oh, good Christ, Keaney.  What the 
                        hell have you done? 

           INT. VILLERE HOUSE - STUDY - MORNING

           Cochrane and Keane now in the study.  Cochrane is livid. 
                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        And this is the position you’ve 
                        left us in -- on this godforsaken 
                        farm with the river to one side, 
                        the swamps on the other!

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        The Americans -- they attacked out 
                        of the darkness --

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        I don’t care if they attacked out 
                        your ass, Keane.  You should have 
                        marched your way to the city!

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        You instructed me to wait here!

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        You’re a fool.  A daddy’s boy with 
                        a silver spoon.  And now I’m left 
                        to clean up your mess! 

           Keane hangs his head.  Cochrane takes a breath, and then -- 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE (CONT’D)
                        To maintain decency, you must give 
                        the orders.  But for as long as it 
                        takes, we shall bring forth all of 
                        her Queen’s fury and unleash.   

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING - ESTABLISHING  

           Jackson’s men have made camp a few plantations north.  
           Makeshift HOSPITALS house the wounded.  Several BARATARIANS 
           self-medicate with pulls from a bottle of whiskey.    

           From the ground the Americans can hear the guns of the 
           Louisiana but the camps are out of sight with the naked eye -- 

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Not so from here.  Jackson and his advisors have setup a WAR 
           ROOM on the third floor of the MACARTY HOUSE.  Jackson uses 
           an ASTRONOMER’S TELESCOPE to spy on the British down river.

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Dare I say -- none of them slept. 
                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        Even with casualties the men are 
                        invigorated.  Shall we prepare to 
                        strike again at nightfall?  

           But Jackson ignores Villere.  There’s something on his mind.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        At the widest point the plantations 
                        are a mile from the swamp to the 
                        river.  But from their current 
                        position, as they move north --

           Lafitte figures out where Jackson is going with this --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        The river bends.  They are squeezed 
                        into a size half that with no other 
                        recourse.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        What are you saying, General? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        To get to the city, the British 
                        must now come through us. 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - MORNING

           Moments later.  The meeting has moved onto the RODRIGUEZ 
           CANAL -- a ten-foot wide DRY CANAL that runs the length of 
           the MACARTY PLANTATION from the river to the swamp.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        With their numbers and our lack of 
                        cover another attack carries too 
                        great a risk.  So we shall build a 
                        line and guard our flanks.  Here, 
                        along this canal.  With every man, 
                        woman and child, every piece of 
                        barn and tree, the entire city 
                        behind it.  They can’t move through 
                        the River.  They can’t move through 
                        the swamp.  They can’t move through 
                        us.  What we build here will be our 
                        last hope to save a nation.

           And as Jackson’s advisors share looks of skepticism over the 
           task at hand, PIERRE LAFITTE the most skeptical of all -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        My fairest Mary-Anne -- 
           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - DAY

           The weather has turned rainy and cold.  In the hours since 
           Jackson’s orders his ARMY has become a CONSTRUCTION CREW. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        I write to you now with your sage 
                        advice taken, and as such I find 
                        myself covered in mire and filth on 
                        this dreary Christmas Eve.

           Men literally DIG a DITCH in the canal.  SLAVES work side by 
           side with SHOP OWNERS as the ditch keeps filling with water.  
           BATTALIONS tear down nearby BARNS for usable wood.  There’s a 
           line of HORSES and OXEN carrying in supplies from the city. 

           It’s a truly back-breaking operation.  Jackson supervises 
           from the mud, barking orders.  Lafitte watches down the line. 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - DAY

           A few hours later.  BALES OF COTTON are being laid the length 
           of the canal as foundation for an eight-foot high BREASTWORK.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        You were astoundingly correct in 
                        your assessment of Jackson as I 
                        have never met a man as determined 
                        as he.  No one wishes to build the 
                        wall we are to build, but no one 
                        dares face his wrath if we don’t. 

           Men switch out in shifts, too tired to move very far to find 
           a place to lay.  A group of BARATARIANS share steaming coffee 
           with a few of Jackson’s ENLISTED MEN.  A BOND is formed. 

           Jackson surveys the progress from the middle of the canal --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        General Coffee, we need a flag. 

           EXT. LAKE BORGNE - DAY

           And as the Americans work, so do the BRITISH.  BARGES as far 
           as the eye can see are rowed carrying a seemingly endless 
           supply a SOLDIERS and MUNITIONS.  The rain is relentless.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        Fortunately the British must deal 
                        with the same unbearable conditions 
                        as they prepare to meet us here.  
           The men are miserable.  But then we find a barge carrying a 
           different kind of soldier.  VETERAN TROOPS hardened by 
           battle.  And riding in the lead with a STEADFAST glare --

           GENERAL SIR EDWARD PACKENHAM.  The man who burned DC to the 
           ground.  The man who’s come to New Orleans to do the same.   

           INT. THE CABILDO - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

           GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE and his advisors eat CHRISTMAS EVE DINNER. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        And as the city dines under the 
                        burden of what is to come, I think 
                        often of our time together.

           A MESSENGER enters.  He heads straight for Claiborne --

                                 MESSENGER
                        Governor.  From Washington. 

           INT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mary-Anne reads Lafitte’s LETTER in a quiet corner.  Suzette 
           Claiborne and the rest dance the night away behind her. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        I have never met a woman who so 
                        quickly was able to find the heart 
                        of the matter.  I hope one day to 
                        earn the trust of which you spoke --

           EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

           Near the plantation front lines.  CAPTAIN NICHOLAS LOCKYER 
           and a few REDCOATS wait in the darkness... 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (V.O.)
                        -- because what has become clear to 
                        me now is that trust allows us to 
                        move mountains.  I shall see you 
                        soon.  Yours loyally, Jean.    

           There’s a rustling in the trees.  And then -- 

           PIERRE LAFITTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS.  

           Lockyer smiles a knowing smile -- he’s been expecting him.  
           And as Pierre’s true ALLEGIANCE is revealed --
           INT. MACARTY PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jackson and his high-command, still dirty from a day’s work, 
           sit at the table.  A SERVANT delivers a TURKEY to eat.  

           Lafitte is at the window.  The men outside continue to build 
           the BREASTWORK by moonlight.  The servant passes close by -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Whatever you can -- make sure every 
                        man has something to eat tonight. 

           Jackson takes note of this.  Lafitte comes to the table.  
           Jackson raises a glass for a toast -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        To America.  Happy Christmas. 

           INT. MACARTY PLANTATION - STUDY - NIGHT

           The men have broken into small groups for drinks.  Jackson is 
           again alone with a bottle of WHISKEY.  He’s had quite a few.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (O.S.)
                        May I join you? 

           Lafitte has come up behind him.  Jackson considers Lafitte a 
           moment, then waves at a nearby chair -- if you must.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                             (re: the whiskey)
                        And partake? 

           Again Jackson nods curtly -- not the warmest of invitations.  
           Lafitte is left to pour a glass himself.  He drinks.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        Ah!  I think now I understand the 
                        fire in your belly.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Kentucky mash.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        For a man from Tennessee.  Is that 
                        even allowable? 

           Lafitte is joking but Jackson’s clearly not in the mood. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        Come now, General.  Where’s your 
                        holiday spirit?  Dinner with twelve 
                        of your closest military advisors --  
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        There is much to be done.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And we are doing it, I believe.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        As are the British.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Something tells me they’re not 
                        quite as cheerful.

           Another joke.  Jackson studies Lafitte for a moment.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I’m not a scoundrel. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I don’t believe I called you one.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        In our meeting at the bar.  A man 
                        who duels at the first false word. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        It’s what I’d heard about you.  It 
                        wasn’t what I said. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Yes but your meaning was the same.   

           Jackson finishes his drink, then pours himself another.  He’s 
           drunk.  Lafitte realizes he must tread carefully --  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Then I must apologize, General.  No 
                        offense intended.  Though I’m sure 
                        if I spent my days at the bottom of 
                        a bottle of Kentucky mash I would 
                        find myself a duelist as well. 

           Jackson takes a moment, seemingly sizing Lafitte up --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Have you ever been married, 
                        Monsieur Lafitte? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Many have tried.  

           Jackson drinks again, then begins a story he normally 
           wouldn’t, but with the circumstances as such --
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        My wife, she was born in Kentucky 
                        actually.  Her father married her 
                        to a man twice her age when she was 
                        only sixteen.  He was a lout.  A 
                        scab.  And when he left her after a 
                        year and a half of hell he was to 
                        file their papers with the court 
                        only he put them in his pocket and 
                        forgot them there forever.   
                             (drinks again)
                        She’s the love of my life, she is.  
                        But after our vows were said, 
                        rumors spread of her infidelity.  
                        She was called a bigamist.  She was 
                        called a whore.  She was called 
                        much worse.  And as you say, when 
                        such happens in moments of ill-
                        clarity at the bottom of the bottle 
                        my wife’s name had to be defended. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Your first duel was for her honor.
                             (realizes)
                        General, are you a romantic? 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        What was said was patently untrue.  
                        I had to correct them.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        By shooting them with your pistol. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        By settling our discrepancies 
                        honorably.  And as the safety of a 
                        duelist is based on his reputation -
                        - once I was, I continued to be.  

           Lafitte has been amazed by this entire exchange.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I want to see how you do it. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        It’s not for show. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        But it can be.  I just hope I’m not 
                        on the receiving end. 

           And is that a smile from Jackson?  If it is, it’s a small 
           one.  But it’s a start.  Jackson changes gears --   
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The food.  For the men earlier.  I 
                        would never think to do as you did.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Show the men love and they will 
                        love you in return. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        A leader of men isn’t always 
                        afforded that luxury.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You’re saying I’m not?

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        This war has been fought because 
                        the men who stood up to be counted 
                        sat down when it did.  I have many 
                        burdens above my own popularity.

           Lafitte leans forward here -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I think you’re worried they won’t 
                        love you back.  I think fear is 
                        easier.  But I promise you this, 
                        General -- if you walk with the men 
                        on that line you won’t have to 
                        stand to be counted.  They will 
                        hold you on their shoulders.   

           Jackson stares at Lafitte.  And then --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I never knew a pirate to talk as 
                        such.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (with a smile)
                        I’m a privateer. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Either way, to have everyone’s 
                        acceptance or no one’s is the same.  
                        When I close my eyes at night 
                        there’s only one name that matters.  
                        I recommend you find that yourself. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (beat)
                        You are a romantic. 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        And a scoundrel, apparently.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        We are who we are.  

           Lafitte finishes his drink.  He reaches to pour another but 
           Jackson GRABS the bottle.  And in a meaningful gesture --

           Jackson POURS Lafitte a fresh glass.  An act of FRIENDSHIP.  
           And as these two men drink into the Christmas Eve night -- 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           The sun rises on CHRISTMAS MORNING.  Jackson checks on the 
           line’s progress.  Dominique You approaches holding a PACKAGE. 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Joyeux Noël, Général. 

           Jackson unwraps the gift.  It’s a large AMERICAN FLAG.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        How was this procured? 

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                             (with a wink)
                        Old family heirloom. 

           Meaning -- I stole it from somewhere.  And then --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We shall raise it to the heavens. 

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - MORNING

           The BRITISH ARMY reconvenes five miles south.  The troops 
           have been supplemented with men and artillery, but the north 
           end of the grounds are still under constant BOMBARDMENT from 
           the LOUISIANA and CAROLINA.  Cochrane and Keane walk through.

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        We may not arrive for Christmas but 
                        by God we will not be out-gunned by 
                        those lily-skinned --

           Cochrane stops mid-sentence.  He’s amazed to see his LEGIONS 
           OF REDCOATS suddenly STANDING at attention --   

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s sacred name -- 
           Cochrane turns.  GENERAL PACKENHAM and his VETERAN TROOPS 
           have just arrived at the plantation.  The REDCOATS stand now 
           like statues, saluting their commanding officer.  

           Cochrane’s face falls.  He knows what this arrival means. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        Admiral Cochrane.  Major General 
                        Keane.  Happy Christmas. 

           INT. VILLERE HOUSE - STUDY - MORNING

           Packenham has immediately taken control.  The WAR ROOM is 
           being completely rearranged by Packenham’s ASSISTANTS to meet 
           Packenham’s exacting specifications...  

           Packenham sits at a desk studying a large MAP of the area.  
           Cochrane and Keane wait for their orders.  And wait.  And 
           wait.  Packenham is very deliberate.  And then, simply --

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        I have never seen such a disaster. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        General, I was not made aware of 
                        your arrival -- if I had known --

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        You would have magically changed 
                        our position in the field?  You 
                        would have rowed back to the ships 
                        and conceived an actual sound plan 
                        of attack?  This is a failure at 
                        every conceivable instance.

           Cochrane might not be in charge at this stage, but he has too 
           much pride to go down without having his say --

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        I was left to work with what we 
                        had.  If Major General Keane had 
                        marched to New Orleans --

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        I’ve read the log, Admiral.  Your 
                        orders were to wait for you here.  
                        Our place now is directly a result 
                        of your utter incompetency.   

           Keane can’t help but smile at this turn of events.  The house 
           SHAKES from a GRAPE SHOT landing nearby.  Cochrane regroups --
                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        I apologize, General.  But my 
                        sailors will gladly continue 
                        forward if your men are not up to 
                        task.  I’m sure the Crown will 
                        understand why you turned back a 
                        mere stone’s throw from glory.

           Packenham seethes.  He goes to the window.  He obviously 
           doesn’t like the hand he’s been dealt but to reshuffle now...   

           The house SHAKES again as another grape shot lands close by. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        If we are to do anything, we must 
                        first end this despicable racket.  
                        Major Keane, bring up the guns. 

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - LEVEE - NIGHT

           That night.  A legion of REDCOATS painstakingly move four 
           heavy CANNONS to a position near the American ships.

           A FIELD FURNACE burns red in the night, warming up shot. 

           EXT. LOUISIANA - NIGHT

           Two BARATARIANS stumble on deck after a few too many drinks.  
           They relieve themselves over the rail and into the river --

           And that’s when one of them notices the GLOW of the furnace.

                                 BARATARIAN
                        Holy shit. 

           The men race back below deck, YELLING to wake the others --

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - LEVEE - NIGHT

           The REDCOATS hear the raucous onboard.  They rush to get the 
           shots ready as OARS from the Louisiana hit the water --

           The Louisiana manages to retreat, but the men on the Carolina 
           are just starting to get their bearings.  As they do --  

           The REDCOATS fire rounds of glowing HOT SHOT toward the deck. 
           EXT. CAROLINA - NIGHT

           The ship doesn’t stand a chance.  The SHOT tears through the 
           deck and shatters the MAST.  One of the shots lodges itself 
           just below the steering cables and ignites a terrible FIRE.  

           The deck is rapidly ENGULFED.  SAILORS jump into the water.  
           The fire spreads toward the MUNITIONS HOLD... 

           INT. LOUISIANA - ROW DECK - NIGHT

           The BARATARIANS row quickly, making their escape.  They hear 
           the cheers of the REDCOATS behind them and then -- 

           THE CAROLINA EXPLODES ON THE WATER.  It’s deafening.  

           EXT. MACARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

           The EXPLOSION can been heard loud and clear at the American 
           camp.  The FIRE from the Carolina rises above the trees. 

           Jackson and his high-command rush out of the house -- 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        One of ours?   

           But no one needs to answer.  Suddenly JEAN DAQUIN, the leader 
           of the FREE MEN OF COLOR, approaches out of breath --

                                 JEAN DAQUIN
                        General!  My men were on patrol.  A 
                        new British commander has arrived.  

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        Did you hear his name?

                                 JEAN DAQUIN
                        Packenham, sir.  It was Packenham.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        The man who burned Washington.

           A dark pall washes over the plantation.  Everyone knows what 
           this means, especially Jackson.  Finally --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Our stakes have been confirmed.  
                        Spread word to the men -- we are to 
                        be tested.     

           And as Jackson stares at the FLAMES growing in the distance --
           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - NIGHT

           Packenham does the same.  A die has been cast between them. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        They fight for their freedom.  We 
                        fight for something greater.  If we 
                        are to break Jackson’s line, we 
                        must start with the obvious. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        What’s that, sir? 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        To find out what he’s made of. 

           And the RAT-TAT-TAT of BRITISH WAR DRUMS bring us to --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           Where two mighty COLUMNS OF REDCOATS march through the 
           morning FOG heading steadily toward the AMERICAN LINE.  

           TITLE:  DECEMBER 28, 1814 - THE GREAT RECONNAISSANCE 

           Eighty men across, almost thirty deep, each column is an 
           incredible sight.  Packenham leads, taking pride in the show 
           he is providing.  These are the greatest soldiers alive.  

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - MORNING

           While these men are not.  At least by way of organization and 
           uniform.  There’s an impending feeling of doom as JACKSON’S 
           ARMY waits for the British to come out of the fog...

           And then, across the plantation, the REDCOATS appear. 

                                 DANIEL ADLER
                        God Almighty.

           The men haven’t seen anything like it.  The BREASTWORK they 
           stand behind is impressive but incomplete.  The eight-foot 
           high wall stretches from the river to the swamp fronted by a 
           MOAT, but there are still stretches waiting to be reinforced. 

           The British are out of rifle range, so the men can only stand 
           and wait.  Jackson rides behind the line --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Hold position!  They mean only to 
                        test our courage! 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I would hate to see a test of 
                        anything else.  

           The redcoats close.  The drumming gets louder.  A few of the 
           WORKER BATTALION vomit in anticipation.  Jean Daquin moves 
           behind the FREE MEN OF COLOR, imploring them to stand firm. 

           Dominique You and his men man FIVE HEAVY ARTILLERY CANNONS 
           spread throughout the line.  Dominique spits, unimpressed.

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Bring it, ya’ bastards.

           The British fire several CONGREVE ROCKETS toward the line.  
           More like FIREWORKS than anything, the rockets scream through 
           the air and EXPLODE loudly over the Americans’ heads.  A few 
           of the men jump at the sound, none more than PIERRE LAFITTE.     

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Hold!  Hold! 

           Dominique You is tired of waiting.  He FIRES his cannon -- 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           But the shot falls SHORT of its mark.  Packenham is amused. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        I’m surprised they haven’t run. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        They will. 

           And as Packenham leads his men now double-time toward the 
           line, both sides opening FIRE with a hail of bullets --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIQUEZ CANAL - MORNING

           We’re several hours into the BATTLE.  The British encroach 
           and trade rifle and cannon fire with the American line... 

           It’s not going well for the Americans.  In full daylight they 
           have far less success against the British war machine, and 
           despite their superior position, the men are failing. 

           Even Jackson’s ENLISTED, who have seen this kind of fighting 
           before, are being bested by Packenham’s SHARPSHOOTERS.  

           Several BRITISH SHOTS land near the BREASTWORK scattering 
           men, mud and wall.  Jackson rides behind the line, shouting 
           for his men to hold form.  More than a handful turn and run. 
           John Coffee quickly assesses the situation --

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        The artillery are our only defense!

           Meaning Dominique You and the five BATTERIES the Baratarians 
           man along the line as well as bombardment from the LOUISIANA 
           stationed on the river.  Dominique You fires and takes out an 
           entire row of REDCOATS, Lafitte shouting orders behind him.  

           But as Jackson struggles with his men to hold the line --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           Packenham calmly observes from the battlefield.  He notes the 
           position of the ARTILLERY and the LOUISIANA on the River... 

           And then he spots JACKSON.  And while Packenham can’t see 
           behind the wall, he knows the Americans are struggling.  

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        Stress the center line!

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - MORNING

           And stress it they do.  The REDCOATS pepper the American wall 
           with cannon fire.  CASUALTIES mount as several sections of 
           the wall BREAK apart with no structural reinforcements...

           A team of BARATARIANS, MILITIA and ENLISTED is forced to hold 
           the patchwork breastwork together with their hands.    

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        It won’t hold much longer!

           The British columns close.  If the breastwork were to fall 
           now, leaving the Americans fully exposed...

           Jackson needs a plan and fast.  He peers over the wall, 
           finding PACKENHAM still observing from high on his horse -- 

           And through the smoke-filled chaos there’s a MOMENT between 
           these two men.  Jackson’s eyes narrow.  And then, an idea --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Long rifles and artillery!  On the 
                        officers’ heads!  Stand tall now, 
                        men!  Stand tall!    

           It’s literally a long shot, but a group of Villere’s MILITIA 
           fire their LONG RIFLES at the BRITISH OFFICERS -- 
           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           Just as the officers move toward the American line.  Two of 
           the officers are immediately SHOT through the head and fall. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Down!  Down!

           Packenham and the others take cover as the American ARTILLERY 
           follows suit.  The officers are covered by dirt and grime.  

           Keane shouts to Packenham over the sound of the cannons -- 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        The center of the line is failing!  
                        Shall we continue?! 

           But Packenham eyes Jackson and he knows -- the Americans are 
           prepared to cut the head off the snake to spite the body.   

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        I have seen what we need!  They are 
                        five guns and one man.  Leave the 
                        cannons to fire and fall back!  

           Admiral Cochrane shoots Packenham a questioning look -- 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM (CONT’D)
                        Patience, Admiral.  All is well.  
                        We know now how to end them.  

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - DUSK

           The sun sets.  The AMERICANS have been beaten soundly.  
           TRIAGE has been setup in one of the barns while the DEAD are 
           loaded onto horse carts to be brought back to the city.   

           Jackson and his high-command somberly walk the line.  The 
           wall is held together in places by a single nail or board. 

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        To think this was only for show.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Our artillery held well.  If I were 
                        to assume, the British will bring 
                        forth more guns to match us.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And how do we suppose to stop them? 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        With all the men we can afford.  
                        Pull in the flanks from across the 
                        river and send word to our legions 
                        at the forts or other batteries.  
                        We must hold this line at all cost.   

           This is a HAIL MARY play.  PIERRE LAFITTE keenly takes note.  
           Unbeknownst to Pierre, JOHN COFFEE does as well...   

                                 MAJOR GENERAL VILLERE
                        We shall be exposed, General.  If 
                        the British send even a single 
                        battalion across the river --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We’re left no choice.  They have 
                        weakened us here and Packenham will 
                        take great pride in trying to 
                        finish the job.  Monsieur Lafitte, 
                        you and Dominique shall procure all 
                        possible artillery reserves.  I 
                        trust you implicitly to provide the 
                        cover our men will need.    

           This vote of confidence is not lost on Lafitte or the others.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        We shall not let you down, General.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        There is comfort in this defeat, 
                        gentlemen.  The next time we face 
                        them, it shall be our last.   

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The officers sit for another HOLIDAY DINNER but the mood is 
           far from festive.  Lafitte and his brothers are absent.  

           A SERVANT brings in the TURKEY.  The men wait for Jackson to 
           make a toast, but instead Jackson wordlessly starts to eat.  

           And so it goes.  Until suddenly the DOOR opens.  To the shock 
           of everyone in the room GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE is there --    

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        Happy New Year, General. 
           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

           After dinner.  Claiborne holds court for Jackson’s officers.  
           Jackson listens halfheartedly across the room.  

           And while Claiborne’s clearly tempered, he knows what’s 
           happening here and he has a carrot he’s excited to dangle... 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        The cannon fire shook the windows, 
                        the women and children prayed their 
                        hardest.  I know the outcome wasn’t 
                        what you hoped, but we were behind 
                        you men.  The entire city was.  

           Jackson doesn’t have time for platitudes --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Why have you come, Governor? 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        I’ve come about peace. 

           That gets the room’s attention.  Jackson’s not buying it -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The only peace will be when the 
                        British leave our shores. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        There’s word from Washington.  We 
                        have sent a commission to Belgium.   

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        A treaty? 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        Discussions.  But I have it on good 
                        authority all land and boundaries 
                        will likely be restored to where 
                        they stood before the war.  

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        Status quo ante bellum. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        A strategic surrender now, with 
                        provisions not to burn the city, 
                        may be our wisest option.   

           Normally most of these men would never consider such a thing, 
           but after the beating they just took...
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                             (skeptical)
                        Discussions. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        In Belgium, yes.  If you wish me to 
                        speak with the British --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I wish you to go back to your 
                        office in the city and leave the 
                        men to do what needs to be done. 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        General --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Words mean nothing.  Discussions 
                        mean nothing.  There are men five 
                        hundred yards from where we stand 
                        meaning to murder each and every 
                        last one of us.  We will hold this 
                        line now or we will die. 

           And as Jackson leaves the room, his position made clear --

           EXT. ELMWOOD PLANTATION - FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lafitte has snuck away from preparations to meet with Mary-
           Anne on the outskirts of the plantation.

           They sit together huddled by a camp fire.  It’s romantic. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Who would have believed the man now 
                        most responsible for our acceptance 
                        is the one who hated us the most?  

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        I believe it was I who actually 
                        said you weren’t so different.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Yet another in a line of sterling 
                        observation.    

           Mary-Anne smiles.  They have a growing comfortability. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        So will you finally end the mystery 
                        and tell me why you wanted this 
                        secret meeting in the night?    
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You are the reason.   

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        Just another of your “whispers”...  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Perhaps.  Or perhaps the sight of 
                        ten thousand British soldiers 
                        marching straight for you leads to 
                        a readjustment of one’s priorities.  

           Lafitte’s being honest here.  A somber moment -- 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        What will happen? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I have no idea.  But I promise you 
                        this, whatever the outcome, I shall 
                        find you again.  I will take you 
                        from this place and we will run. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                             (quietly)
                        But what if you are --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I won’t be.  Trust me. 

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        You know my requirements for that.  

           They finally KISS.  And from the FLICKERING of that fire --

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - NIGHT

           To the flickering of the FIRE at the British camp.  Packenham 
           waits patiently with Cochrane and a few others...

           NICHOLAS LOCKYER and four REDCOATS arrive escorting PIERRE 
           LAFITTE.  Pierre is clearly nervous to be in such company.    

           A long beat, then Pierre fills the silence --

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        Jackson has pulled all support from 
                        his flank across the river.  If you 
                        were to cross there, your men could 
                        come up behind Jackson’s line, take 
                        out his artillery and destroy him.  

           Packenham studies Pierre for a moment.  And then -- 
                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        Why should I believe you?   

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        I stand for our survival.  My 
                        brother stands for something else.   

           EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

           Pierre rushes back toward the American camp.  He moves 
           carefully through the swamp, covering his tracks... 

           He doesn’t see JOHN COFFEE watching him from the shadows. 

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lafitte returns from his dalliance with Mary-Anne in good 
           spirits.  He steps into his bedroom at the end of the hall -- 

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           And is promptly AMBUSHED by a pair of burly ENLISTED MEN --  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        What the hell are you --

           But before he can finish Lafitte’s met with a STRAIGHT RIGHT 
           from Jackson and falls to the floor.  Coffee is also there. 

           The men hold Lafitte as Jackson PUTS A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I should never have trusted you, 
                        you lying, no good, son of a whore! 

           Jackson is furious.  Lafitte has no idea what’s happening. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        General -- please -- stop -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I shall spit on your grave for what 
                        you’ve done. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        What have I done?!  What?!  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        What I knew you were capable of the 
                        moment I heard your cursed name -- 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about -- please, tell me --  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Your brother.  Pierre.  We caught 
                        him scurrying away from the British 
                        lines.  I was to hang him for 
                        treason if not for your arrival.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Treason?!  I promise you, General -- 
                        we have been firmly on your side --

           Jackson presses the pistol to Lafitte’s head.  HARD.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        No more lies!  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        I’m not lying!  What was said in 
                        his defense, what did he --     

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        There is no defense for treachery.  
                        Goodbye, Monsieur Lafitte.   

           Jackson actually looks like he’s going to pull the trigger.  
           Coffee and the enlisted men turn their heads -- 

           But Lafitte says the one thing he thinks might save his life.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You’re a man of honor!

           Jackson hesitates.  It’s a window, and Lafitte jumps through. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        You said so yourself, General.  A 
                        man of honor would hear a defense.  
                        Please.  Let us go and listen to 
                        what Pierre has to say.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Why should I believe anything that 
                        comes from either of your lips? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Because you have seen how we fight.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                             (rising)
                        You fight only for the empty virtue 
                        you hope to receive from it! 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        And why do you?!  Why do you build 
                        this line?!  Why are you standing 
                        with a pistol to my head?!  
                             (pleading)
                        You have honor, General.  But you 
                        know as well as I there is no way 
                        you can win the battle without us.  
                        If you do this, I swear to you, my 
                        men will walk.  There must be an 
                        explanation.  Let us hear it.     

           This is Lafitte’s last stand.  It’s on Jackson to decide.  A 
           long beat.  Finally, Jackson lowers the pistol. 

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

           Pierre Lafitte sits on the cold floor of the CELLAR.  Two 
           GUARDS stand at the door.  Pierre has been roughed up a bit. 

           The door opens and Jackson, Coffee and Lafitte enter.  
           Lafitte stares daggers at Pierre.  Pierre has to look away.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        If you wish to speak, do it now.

           Pierre struggles to hold back tears.  And then --

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        I don’t know what I was thinking.  
                        I meant not to be a spy.  I was 
                        simply trying to protect our best 
                        interest if we lost. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        By being a traitor.

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        I gave them nothing, I swear it.  
                        Not at first.  I had a relationship 
                        with Lockyer.  I gained his trust 
                        with bread crumbs.  But they 
                        brought me to Packenham.  They told 
                        me I had to earn my keep or they 
                        would...  I was scared.  I broke.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Broke how?

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        I told them of your plan to call in 
                        your flank during the next assault.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PIERRE LAFITTE (CONT'D)
                        I swear to you -- no one else knew.  
                        I did this all by my own hand.    

           Jackson can barely contain his anger.  To Lafitte --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Your brother is a traitor.

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                             (begging now)
                        I’m not!  Please, I made a mistake! 
                        Tell him, Jean -- make this right --   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Arrêtez. 

           Lafitte’s as mad as Jackson.  A long beat, and then --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        Do what you must, General.  The 
                        only thing I ask is to spare my 
                        men.  They clearly had no part.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        So you admit it then? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (pointedly to Pierre)
                        I admit only he is my brother. 

           Pierre is CRUSHED.  Jackson finally turns to Coffee -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I need a moment. 

           Jackson and Coffee exit.  It’s just Lafitte and Pierre. 

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        Je suis désolé.  I’m sorry, Jean. 

           Lafitte simply STARES at him.  And then from out of nowhere -- 

           Lafitte GRABS Pierre by the neck.  The guards immediately 
           intervene but Lafitte is able to pull Pierre’s ear close -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                             (with vitriol)
                        Blood is thicker than water, 
                        Pierre, but it still runs out.  If 
                        you wish to live you will do 
                        exactly as I say or I will shoot 
                        you myself.  Mon frere. 

           Lafitte KISSES his cheek, then leaves.  Pierre is stunned.
           EXT. MACARTY HOUSE - VERANDA - DAWN

           The sun rises.  Jackson sits on the steps holding the same 
           COLONIAL COIN he had before.  He takes a pull from his FLASK.   

           Across the way Jackson can hear sounds of the British 
           starting to bombard the line with GRAPE SHOT.  It’s not the 
           main attack, more something to annoy Jackson and his men...   

           Lafitte comes out and stands behind him.  Finally --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        My brother was only three years 
                        older.  When I was 13 we both 
                        volunteered with a battalion on the 
                        Carolina line, but the Revolution, 
                        it had turned.  Soldiers were shown 
                        no quarter on either side.  The 
                        brutality we saw...  My brother and 
                        I were captured on patrol.  When I 
                        refused to clean a British 
                        officer’s boots I was struck with 
                        his saber across my face and my 
                        brother beaten to the ground.  
                             (drinks)
                        We were held in a filthy, bedless 
                        prison cell and given bread and 
                        water.  I cried often.  My brother 
                        had smuggled this coin in his 
                        pocket and we prayed over it.  When 
                        our release came, Robert was so 
                        weak he was strapped to a horse as 
                        I walked shoeless next to him the 
                        forty miles home.  And then he died 
                        all in the name of British tyranny.  
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know if there’s a way for 
                        me to trust you again. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Hang him then. 

           Jackson can’t believe Lafitte said the words...

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        We have given too much, you and I.  
                        I have stood by your side and I 
                        will continue to do so if you’ll 
                        have me, but this isn’t about our 
                        brothers anymore.  There might not 
                        be another two people in the entire 
                        world who think we can win and that 
                        is what we must do now.  
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        Hang him or let him earn his 
                        freedom. 

           For the first time, Jackson turns back to Lafitte -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        How? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        By giving you the chance to put 
                        your men where they’re needed.

           And as the sound of EXPLOSIONS bleeds from the front lines --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        My fondest Rachel --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - DAY

           Jackson’s men rebuild the BREASTWORK.  Jackson supervises on 
           his horse as the line is constantly pestered by GRAPE SHOT.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        This will be my last correspondence 
                        before the finale of this battle, 
                        and only then will I know if it has 
                        been worth while or I am the fool. 

           Jackson pays particular close attention to the BARATARIANS 
           reinforcing the ARTILLERY STANDS -- can he trust them?

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - DAY

           As Jackson supervises, so does Packenham.  Soldiers push huge 
           ARTILLERY CANNONS through the mud and muck.  It’s awful work. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        The man against us now is the man 
                        who burned Washington.  It is 
                        thusly my duty to make sure he pays 
                        for those reprehensible sins.  

           Over 3,000 REINFORCEMENTS have arrived including 500 SCOTTISH 
           HIGHLANDERS.  The Highlanders wear KILTS with their uniform. 

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - LEVEE - DAY

           Packenham watches as BRITISH ENGINEERS fashion a makeshift 
           DAM on one of the CANALS that runs down to the MISSISSIPPI.  
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        As such, I must put my faith in a 
                        man who does not deserve it.  But 
                        with the storm that is to come, I 
                        find that the least of my concerns. 

           As the dam is struck, the WATER rises in the canal.  REDCOATS 
           carry in BARGES that will move the men across the RIVER.  

           With enough water, the barges FLOAT.  Packenham approves. 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        The west bank shall be ours. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        And with it, we will burn this 
                        country to the ground. 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - NIGHT

           Jackson’s men continue to work through the night -- finishing 
           the wall, strapping KNIVES to RIFLES to make BAYONETS.  And 
           as they do, we notice a strange occurrence happening -- 

           The men no longer stick to their own.  BARATARIANS work 
           alongside ENLISTED work alongside the WORKERS and FREE MEN. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        I must confess, as a whole, I am 
                        more than pleased with the effort 
                        of our men.  We are an army now, 
                        even more so with the addition of 
                        much needed reinforcements.

           2,500 KENTUCKY MILITIA arrive on the line with COONSKIN CAPS 
           and HUNTING RIFLES.  They’ve never seen anything like it.   

                                 JOHN COFFEE
                        My God -- you actually came.  

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - ROYAL STREET - DAY

           The city itself makes its final preparations for the possible 
           invasion.  Businesses have been boarded up.  A few have hung 
           SIGNS welcoming the British and asking not to be burned.

           A member of the ELDERLY POLICE FORCE walks through and tears 
           the signs down.  A group of MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN have 
           gathered at the end of ROYAL STREET with makeshift weapons.

           It’s a sight, these CITIZENS compelled to duty.  If the men 
           fall on the line, those here won’t go down without a fight. 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        Through it all, I have not 
                        forgotten that it isn’t just a city 
                        we endeavor to save.  It is all of 
                        America -- a place where anything 
                        is possible.  We are the proof. 

           GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE watches from his balcony.  He’s surprised 
           to see a few of his ADVISORS standing with the men below. 

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

           Jackson and Lafitte have just informed Pierre Lafitte what he 
           needs to do to earn his freedom.  They wait for his response.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (V.O.)
                        And now as daylight comes, it is on 
                        each of us to see what we may do.  
                        This is not goodbye, my sweet.  I 
                        shall hold you again, either now or 
                        in eternity.  With love, Andrew.

           It’s clearly a daunting task.  Pierre hesitates...   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You’re the only one who knows the 
                        British lines, Pierre, and every 
                        man we have will be needed to hold 
                        the wall.  It has to be you. 

           A long beat.  Then Pierre finally looks up --

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        I shall not let you down. 

           Whether Jackson believes him or not, he has no choice. 

           INT. VILLERE HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

           The night before battle.  Packenham meets with his high-
           command to go over their final preparations. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        The west bank shall be our key.  
                        Colonel Thornton, you will float 
                        the boats in the canal across the 
                        river before sun rise.  Your 1,500 
                        men will march to a place beyond 
                        the wall, await our signal, then 
                        fire on Jackson as we begin our 
                        forward attack.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM (CONT'D)
                        General Keane, to breach the 
                        breastwork, your men will be 
                        responsible for bringing the 
                        scaling ladders to these points 
                        here weakened by our last offense. 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        It will be my pleasure, sir. 

           Keane takes pride in being asked.  Cochrane rolls his eyes.  

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        As for Jackson, if at all possible, 
                        I will take the honor of laying him 
                        down myself, if only as punishment 
                        for delaying our inevitable 
                        victory.  The city shall be ours, 
                        gentlemen.  And so the country.  We 
                        will welcome our wayward brothers 
                        home with open arms.  

           And the sound of AMERICAN WAR DRUMS brings us to --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - NIGHT

           It’s a few hours before daybreak and the Americans are taking 
           their final positions behind the wall.

           The BREASTWORK is complete and it is massive.  Over eight 
           feet tall and twenty feet wide in places, almost a MILE LONG 
           stretching from the River to the swamp.  Giant LOGS reinforce 
           its structure while sharpened SPEARS line the top. 

           Jackson rides on his HORSE next to his high-command.  The men 
           are four deep for much of the wall, and most are taking a 
           quiet moment to themselves -- readying RIFLES and POWDER 
           BAGS, stacking SHOTS and CANNONBALLS.  A few PRAY.  Others 
           write LETTERS.  It’s almost calming, their demeanor.  

           And as Jackson watches them, these men who have already done 
           the impossible, something compels him to stop.  Right there 
           in the middle of the line, Jackson gets down off his horse --   

           AND THE GENERAL STARTS TO WALK AMONGST HIS TROOPS.    

           It’s a sight.  The men greet Jackson with friendly nods and 
           hellos.  Jackson reaches out to shake hands.  Thanking the 
           men, slapping them on the shoulder.  This is the first time 
           we’ve seen him as such, not just a general but a true leader.

           Lafitte watches from across the way.  He has a sense of pride 
           almost, to see Jackson like this.  And then Jackson stops -- 
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        What’s the meaning of this?

           There’s a line of ENLISTED MEN standing in front of DOMINIQUE 
           YOU and his lieutenants.  Dominique is brewing COFFEE and 
           frying BEIGNETS under the AMERICAN FLAG.  Dominique smiles --   

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Can’t fight the damn Reddies 
                        without a proper breakfast.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Smells better than what we get in 
                        the officer’s tent.

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Parce que ce est, le Général.

           Dominique offers it to Jackson.  Jackson drinks.  And that’s 
           when he notices the CROWD that has gathered around him... 

           They wait for Jackson to say something, but for the first 
           time, Jackson is SPEECHLESS.  And then, simply and honestly --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I have never been prouder than this 
                        moment.  To see you here.  To see 
                        what we’ve built.  I raise my glass 
                        in your honor, and all that I ask, 
                        no matter what is to come, is that 
                        you stand and fight for the man 
                        beside you.  If we do that, we 
                        cannot lose.  Take time now boys, 
                        the battle begins at daybreak.    

           For all the blustery speeches Jackson has given, this means 
           more to the men than all of them.  The love is there.

           And as Jackson finds himself standing next to Lafitte --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You’re wrong, General.  The battle 
                        has already begun.  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then God save us all. 

           EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

           Pierre Lafitte treks through the swamp near the BRITISH 
           LINES.  He carries a SATCHEL full of TOOLS on his back.    
           Pierre hides in the bog.  He looks through the trees toward 
           the CANAL on the VILLERE PLANTATION.  COLONEL THORNTON is 
           there with his men waiting to row down into the RIVER.  

           And as the first BRITISH BARGES are launched, Pierre moves. 

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - LEVEE - NIGHT

           Pierre sneaks down to a point next to the makeshift DAM near 
           the end of the canal.  He lowers himself into the water.  

           It’s FREEZING.  And there are REDCOATS everywhere.  Pierre 
           shivers in the cold.  He eyes the dam thirty yards away --

           But in these conditions, behind enemy lines, it might as well 
           be thirty miles.  Pierre tries to summon the courage...

           And it looks like Pierre will move, it does.  But then Pierre 
           sees the line of BARGES floating down the canal toward him.  

           Pierre hesitates.  And then he hesitates again.  And then --

           HE JUST CAN’T DO IT. 

           Pierre starts back toward the swamp, defeated.  But then he 
           STOPS as a CROCODILE swims past not far in front of him. 

           There’s something about that animal.  Pierre’s eyes NARROW. 

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - CANAL - NIGHT

           The next BARGE is launched.  Thornton turns to a MESSENGER --  

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        Tell General Packenham we are 
                        proceeding according to schedule.

           But then there’s SHOUTING from down near the river.  The 
           water level in the canal suddenly DROPS --

                                 BRITISH CAPTAIN
                        Sir!  Something’s wrong! 

           EXT. VILLERE PLANTATION - LEVEE - NIGHT

           Thornton arrives to find the DAM destroyed.  The water from 
           the canal RUSHES into the surrounding fields as the BARGES 
           bottom out short of the river.  Thornton is furious.  

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        How many made it to the river?
                                 BRITISH CAPTAIN
                        Only three, sir.  

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        We must carry the rest of the 
                        barges to the shoreline.  

                                 BRITISH CAPTAIN
                        We’ll never make it in time for the 
                        first assault. 

           Thornton knows it’s the truth.  His frustration boils over --

                                 COLONEL THORNTON
                        Find whoever did this now!

           EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

           But Pierre has already DISAPPEARED, moving back through the 
           darkness.  And in the moonlight, we see Pierre SMILE.

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - DAWN

           Daylight comes quickly now.  The men are in their positions, 
           nervous but not scared.  A SCOUT approaches Jackson --

                                 SCOUT
                        The British have yet to make land 
                        on the west bank, sir. 

           Jackson and Lafitte share a look -- Pierre did his job. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Then they shall be too late.  Tell 
                        the Major to bring the rest of the 
                        men here to the front line. 

           Lafitte tries not to show it but it’s clear -- through it 
           all, he’s proud of his brother.  And then three BRITISH 
           CONGREVE ROCKETS shoot into the sky, exploding...  

           Jackson takes a BREATH.  The battle is about to begin. 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - DAWN

           The entirety of the BRITISH ARMY moves toward the American 
           line.  They march in three MAJOR COLUMNS, twice as many men 
           as the last assault.  It’s a truly breathtaking sight.

           TITLE:  JANUARY 8, 1815 - THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS
           Packenham and his command advance steadily to the beat of the 
           DRUMS.  Packenham turns to Admiral Cochrane --

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        No word from Thornton on the bank? 

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Nothing.  And we should have 
                        already heard of his attack. 

           Packenham knows -- this day is not off to a great start.

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        This is why we never trust a 
                        pirate.  We shall wait no longer.  
                        On my mark!  God Save the Queen!

           Packenham gives the signal and another ROCKET fires in to the 
           air.  The drumming speeds up, the men march faster.  The 
           Americans wait, putting the British in their sights.  The 
           tension builds and builds until finally --

           The BRITISH open FIRE.  Then so do the AMERICANS. 

           The cacophony is DEAFENING.  It’s a CONFRONTATION almost a 
           mile long, with more MEN, more GUNS and more ARTILLERY in the 
           largest, loudest spectacle of war you have ever seen.  

           And as the mayhem of the FINAL BATTLE begins here --

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - MORNING

           It’s a quiet SUNDAY MORNING in the Quarter.  The ELDERLY 
           POLICE FORCE stands at attention, waiting with the others 
           that have gathered to protect the city.  The sound of CANNON 
           FIRE mixes with nearby CHURCH BELLS.  The fight is on. 

           And then from down the street, GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE approaches.

           There are furtive glances amongst the group.  CLAIBORNE’S 
           ADVISORS look away, not wanting to meet the Governor’s stare. 

           Claiborne stops in front of them.  A beat, then Claiborne 
           pulls an antique PISTOL out of his pocket -- 

                                 GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE
                        I’m here to serve. 

           The men consider Claiborne, then nod.  Claiborne joins them.
           INT. CITY CATHEDRAL - MORNING

           The rest of the WOMEN and CHILDREN have gathered to pray.  
           There are the HOUSEWIVES who knitted uniforms and the NUNS 
           who manned the hospital.  We find a WOMAN dressed in rags -- 

           She has a VOODOO DOLL of a BRITISH SOLDIER in her lap.  The 
           woman sticks the doll with needles.  An ELDERLY NUN approves. 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - MORNING

           The BRITISH REDCOATS stand tall through the hail of bullets, 
           continuing their advance.  Jackson shouts behind the line -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Give them everything!  Now! 

           The Americans switch out on the front line so the rifle fire 
           is constant.  One man fires, two men reload.  The ARTILLERY 
           is a force, Dominique You smiling and smoking his cigar. 

           The firepower builds into a concentrated effort.  After a 
           loud volley, the morning light is blocked out by thick SMOKE.  

           Almost all at once, the Americans take a BREATH.  They can’t 
           see anything past their line.  Even Jackson looks ahead 
           hopefully, waiting for the smoke to clear...

           It’s silent.  Have the British been defeated?  But then a 
           member of Villere’s MILITIA is shot through the head.  And 
           then ANOTHER and ANOTHER and as the haze rises they see --

           THE BRITISH ARE STILL THERE, FIRING THROUGH THE FOG.    

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Prepare your bayonets!  

           Dominique You spies Keane and his men carrying LADDERS in a 
           nearby SUGARCANE FIELD.  Dominique motions toward them --

                                 DOMINIQUE YOU
                        Take ‘em out, boys! 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           Packenham and his men advance despite taking heavy 
           casualties.  It’s clear with as many bodies that litter the 
           field, Packenham is content to simply outman his opponent.  

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        Ready the charge! 
           But one of his LIEUTENANTS notices something ahead -- 

                                 BRITISH LIEUTENANT
                        General, where are the ladders?!

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - SUGARCANE FIELD - MORNING

           MAJOR GENERAL KEANE and his men are PINNED DOWN by DOMINIQUE 
           YOU.  A group of REDCOATS tries to rush the wall but they’re 
           TORN APART by cannon fire.  Keane is in a bad spot.  

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Hold here!  Hold the ladders!

           Some of his men simply drop their ladders and run for safer 
           ground.  Keane shouts after them through the artillery fire --

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE (CONT’D)
                        Colonel Mullins!  Pick up your --

           But Keane is drowned out.  The BARATARIANS are making any 
           advance an impossibility.  Keane doesn’t know what to do.  

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           And with the constant barrage from the Americans, Packenham 
           can’t wait any longer.  He turns to his men -- 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        We shall do it ourselves!  

                                 BRITISH LIEUTENANT
                        Sir, shouldn’t we wait for --

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        We are Her Majesty’s Royal Army!  
                        We have brought down Napoleon!  We 
                        shall not lose to these ingrates!  
                        We shall liberate them!  Onward, 
                        men!  Onward to victory!   

           Unlike with Keane, Packenham’s men heed the call.  A SHOUT 
           rises as THOUSANDS OF BRITISH REDCOATS CHARGE THE LINE. 

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - MORNING

           Jackson’s men prepare for the onslaught.  MAJOR GENERAL 
           VILLERE and GENERAL COFFEE take up positions with their men 
           on the wall, BRACING themselves -- 

           AND THEN THE BRITISH ARE THERE.  
           It’s a tremendous CLASH.  What was once a fight across a 
           great field has become much more intimate as the British try 
           to break through Jackson’s BREASTWORK.  

           A REDCOAT makes it to the top of the wall only to be blown 
           away by rifle fire.  American MILITIA are grabbed by the 
           SCOTTISH HIGHLANDERS and summarily PULLED over the line. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Hold!  Hold!

           But the British are STRONG.  And with the fighting too close 
           for the American artillery, the tide turns. 

           The British TOPPLE an American ARTILLERY STAND.  More and 
           more REDCOATS scale the wall and fight on the American side.  
           Behind the charge, BRITISH CANNONS pepper the line.  Several 
           SUPPORT LOGS start to STRESS and CRACK from the impact.

           Across the way, JEAN LAFITTE valiantly leads a group of 
           BARATARIANS fighting to hold back the British.  Lafitte uses 
           a SABER to show off his SWASHBUCKLING skills, slaying a pair 
           of BRITISH OFFICERS when suddenly he’s TACKLED from behind --  

           It’s NICHOLAS LOCKYER.  Lockyer takes pleasure fighting the 
           man who lied to his face.  Lockyer gains an advantage -- 

                                 NICHOLAS LOCKYER
                        You should have taken our deal, 
                        Monsieur!  Now you shall die!

           Lockyer SLICES Lafitte’s arm with a BAYONET.  Lafitte drops 
           his SABER allowing Lockyer to KICK out Lafitte’s leg.  
           Lafitte crumples, Lockyer ready to deliver the DEATH BLOW -- 

           BUT THEN LOCKYER’S CHEST EXPLODES IN RED.  

           Lockyer falls, revealing PIERRE LAFITTE with a pistol behind 
           him.  Lafitte can’t believe it.  Pierre pulls Lafitte up --  

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        Mon frere.  

           The reunion is short-lived.  Lafitte shrugs off his injury, 
           and as he picks up his saber to continue the fight --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - SUGARCANE FIELD - DAY

           The REDCOATS have been emboldened by their progress at the 
           wall.  Several of Keane’s men CHARGE ahead --

           But Keane can only watch.  The carnage of bodies, the smell 
           of blood.  Keane buries his head as the battle rages.  
           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - RODRIGUEZ CANAL - DAY

           The British fight desperately now on the other side of the 
           line.  The BREASTWORK starts to give way as JOHN COFFEE and 
           JEAN DAQUIN race to keep the wall standing.

           Jackson fights through the melee when suddenly two SUPPORT 
           LOGS crack under the pressure of BRITISH ARTILLERY FIRE.  The 
           REDCOATS push their way through that section of the wall --

           AND IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS, THE BREASTWORK HAS BEEN BREACHED. 

           It’s a small GAP in the fence, maybe big enough for three men 
           to come forward at a time, but it’s all the British need. 

           REDCOATS stream through, fighting Jackson’s men hand-to-hand.  
           Jackson knows he has to plug that gap.  He CHARGES on his 
           horse, ready to push the British back whence they came --

           WHEN SUDDENLY PACKENHAM IS THERE.  Packenham slices Jackson’s 
           horse with his SABRE.  Jackson and his horse TUMBLE into the 
           dirt.  Jackson barely has time to gain his bearings before 
           Packenham ATTACKS.  Jackson tries to defend himself --

           But Packenham is an ANIMAL.  He lands blow after blow, and as 
           the BATTLE continues around them, these two giants are at the 
           center.  The Americans have failed to stop the British at the 
           breach, more and more REDCOATS coming through the wall...     

           It’s only a matter of time now.  And as we see the faces of 
           our heroes -- DOMINIQUE YOU with his cannon, VILLERE and 
           COFFEE with their men, JEAN DAQUIN fighting bravely -- there 
           is a sadness there.  Goliath was simply too strong... 

           Even JEAN LAFITTE, wielding his sabre through the pain, can 
           only bare witness as Jackson is simply PUMMELED.  Packenham 
           beats Jackson with his fists, throwing Jackson to the dirt.  

           Jackson is done.  And as Packenham leans down into his ear --

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                        One man cannot win a war, General.

           Packenham SPITS into Jackson’s face.  Jackson is ENRAGED.  He 
           manages to push Packenham away, but as he stands to attack --   

           JACKSON IS OVERRUN BY THE BRITISH.  

           The REDCOATS are moving now toward the MACARTY HOUSE and the 
           city beyond.  Packenham leads the charge, and as he looks 
           back, Jackson swallowed by the fight, they both know --
           It’s over.  Packenham almost smiles, turning away.  And as 
           much as he struggles, there’s nothing Jackson can do.  But 
           then from out of nowhere, a SHOT SOUNDS IN THE DISTANCE. 

           And it’s like time stops.  A single BULLET tears through 
           Packenham’s SHOULDER.  Jackson turns and sees JEAN DAQUIN of 
           the FREE MEN OF COLOR standing across the way with his rifle.  

           But before Daquin can get off another shot, another BULLET 
           tears through Packenham’s LEG, this time fired from one of 
           Villere’s MILITIA.  And then another BULLET plunges into 
           Packenham’s horse, knocking Packenham to the ground. 

           Then there’s another bullet and another.  The men have not 
           given up hope.  The sight of Packenham on the ground pulls 
           Jackson to his feet, and with all he can muster --  

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Give it to them, boys!  We finish 
                        this business today!  For America! 

           It’s the call to arms the men need.  The BRITISH are suddenly 
           disorganized by the sight of their commanding officer down, 
           while the Americans are inspired by Jackson’s lead. 

           JEAN LAFITTE and a group of BARATARIANS arrive to stop the 
           flood of REDCOATS through the gap.  JOHN COFFEE and his men 
           work to reinforce the wall.  It takes only a matter of 
           moments, but suddenly the British are on the defensive.   

           Through the chaos, Jackson heads to Packenham.  Packenham 
           lies prone, his eyes closed.  Jackson stands a few feet away, 
           wanting to make sure he’s dead, when suddenly --

           PACKENHAM DRAWS A PISTOL FROM HIS BELT.  

           Jackson DRAWS quicker, but it’s all for naught.  Packenham is 
           too weak.  The pistol simply falls from Packenham’s hand.  
           And as Packenham struggles for breath, Jackson leaning down --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Luckily, we’re much more than one. 

           That they are.  The American have now risen from the brink, 
           fighting the British back.  And as Jackson returns to battle, 
           a group of BRITISH SOLDIERS dragging Packenham’s body away --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - MORNING

           Keane watches from afar.  More soldiers are coming back over 
           the wall than the opposite.  A frazzled CAPTAIN finds him --
                                 BRITISH CAPTAIN
                        Packenham is dead!  Lambert is 
                        dead!  They fight like savages.  
                        This isn’t war, this is --

           But the captain is SHOT straight through the head and killed.  
           Blood splatters onto Keane.  That’s all Keane can handle --

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        Retreat!  Retreat!  

           And as they do, we see the absolute terribleness of this war.  
           The field is RED with fallen British soldiers.  The 
           casualties on both sides have climbed into the thousands...

           Keane retreats back past a GIANT OAK TREE in the field.  He 
           doesn’t notice that the soldiers from earlier have left 
           GENERAL PACKENHAM to sit alone under the tree... 

           Mortally wounded, there’s nothing Packenham can do but watch 
           as the British flee the battlefield.  He’s DISGUSTED. 

                                 GENERAL PACKENHAM
                             (his last breath)
                        Shame.  Shame.  We are British.  

           Packenham finally DIES.  And as the AMERICAN FLAG flies, the 
           lone, sad song of a BRITISH BUGLER brings us --

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - DAY

           The BUGLER stands with a BRITISH LIEUTENANT under a WHITE 
           FLAG.  EDWARD LIVINGSTON rides out to meet them.

           The lieutenant hands Livingston a LETTER.

           INT. MACARTY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Jackson and his high-command.  Jackson reads the LETTER over.  
           A long beat, then Jackson NODS to Livingston -- 

                                 EDWARD LIVINGSTON
                        The city has been saved. 

           A CHEER goes up in the room.  The men are relieved, sharing 
           hugs and handshakes.  Lafitte and Dominique You are there.     

           But as happy as the occasion is, Jackson is still Jackson --
                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        It is now our responsibility to 
                        make sure the British make good on 
                        their word and leave our shores.   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        We will, General.  I assure you.  

           EXT. MACARTY PLANTATION - DAY

           The next day.  Both sides are in process of burying their 
           dead.  It’s a sorrowful and enormous task. 

           Men from both sides collect PERSONAL ITEMS from the fallen.  
           Many soldiers break down in tears over their comrades.  A 
           MASS GRAVE has been dug in one of the fields.    

           Andrew Jackson solemnly watches body after body deposited 
           there.  Jackson holds his brother’s COLONIAL COIN...

           Finally, Jackson throws the coin in.  It’s covered in DIRT.

           EXT. LAKE BORGNE - DAY - ESTABLISHING  

           The British are in the midst of a terrible RETREAT.  For all 
           the hardship they endured to get here, they must do the same 
           to go back.  Drudging through canals, rowing across the lake.

           EXT. HMS TONNANT - MAIN DECK - DAY

           Keane, still dirty from battle, climbs on board after the 
           journey.  He finds a line of GRIEVING WIDOWS wearing black, 
           no longer dancing, hoping for their husbands’ safe return.

           Keane feels awful.  And to make matters worse --

                                 ADMIRAL COCHRANE
                        Pick it up, Keany-boy.  Your knight 
                        in shining armor may be dead, but 
                        we still have some fight, yah?  

           It’s ADMIRAL COCHRANE, smugly back in charge.  But before 
           Keane can even muster a response -- 

                                 BRITISH SAILOR
                        Sir. 

           The SAILOR hands Cochrane a looking glass.  On the horizon 
           six of Lafitte’s PIRATE SHIPS have arrived.  They fly both an 
           AMERICAN and PIRATE FLAG and are ready to engage if need be. 
           Keane sees the ships as well.  He’s had enough -- 

                                 MAJOR GENERAL KEANE
                        It’s over, Admiral.  We’ve lost.   

           EXT. PIRATE SHIP - DECK - DAY

           The BARATARIANS watch the armada from afar.  The British 
           finally raise their anchors and sail away.    

           And the sound of hundreds of people CHEERING brings us to --

           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - DAY

           Where a glorious VICTORY PARADE winds through the streets of 
           the FRENCH QUARTER.  The city is alive again.  Jackson and 
           his army, now clean from battle, are the guests of honor... 

           Even the BARATARIANS are feted with flower petals thrown from 
           BALCONIES.  BANDS play through the streets, a celebratory 
           CANNONADE firing from the shores into the MISSISSIPPI.  

           Jackson is next to Lafitte and the rest of his high-command -- 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        This is what it’s like to be loved. 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        No, General.  This is something 
                        else entirely. 

           They pass GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE applauding with his wife SUZETTE 
           and MARY-ANNE DERN.  Lafitte immediately walks over and, to 
           the dismay of Claiborne, KISSES Mary-Anne.  

           Mary-Anne swoons.  Lafitte shakes Claiborne’s hand --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE (CONT’D)
                        Governor.  Mrs. Claiborne.  

           Lafitte heads back and rejoins the parade.  Suzette Claiborne 
           is confused.  She turns to Mary-Anne and her husband -- 

                                 SUZETTE CLAIBORNE
                        Why is Monsieur Clement marching in 
                        the victor’s parade?  

           Jackson is lead into what will be known as JACKSON SQUARE.  A 
           row of girls in WHITE DRESSES hold up an ARCHWAY OF FLOWERS.    

           The city cheers as Jackson walks through, their savior. 
           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           The party has spilled over into the night.  CROWDS fill the 
           streets.  Jackson and his high-command congregate outside a 
           grand BANQUET HALL in the middle of the Quarter.  

           The DOORS to the hall are thrown open and Claiborne and the 
           legislature form a GREETING LINE for the men.  First Jackson, 
           then Coffee and Villere.  Livingston, Patterson and Daquin.   

           Finally, JEAN LAFITTE and his BARATARIANS are alone outside.  
           Claiborne GESTURES them to enter.  Pierre turns to Lafitte --

                                 PIERRE LAFITTE
                        I was wrong, mon frere. 

           And as Lafitte leads his men through the welcoming doors -- 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 

           After dinner.  A JAZZ QUARTET plays.  Jackson walks through 
           the crowd, pouring shots of whiskey for his troops.  ENLISTED 
           MEN, MILITIA, the FREE MEN OF COLOR, a group of BARATARIANS.  
           Even Lieutenant Adler gets into the act... 

           Lafitte walks over to Mary-Anne Dern at Claiborne’s table --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        May I have this dance? 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           A few minutes later.  Lafitte and Mary-Anne DANCE in the 
           middle of the room.  Jackson shares a shot with Dominique 
           You.  Dominique watches his brother with pride.

           Lafitte and Mary-Anne notice all eyes are on them --

                                 MARY-ANNE DERN
                        I’ve never felt so many stares. 

           And as Lafitte looks around at those faces, HIGH SOCIETY now 
           seemingly at his beck and call, something clicks...   

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Come with me.  

           Lafitte takes her hand.  And as the song continues, Lafitte 
           leads Mary-Anne back out the doors and into the night.   

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY - ESTABLISHING  

           The city is slowly being rebuilt from the British invasion.  

           A PAPER BOY stands in front of the WHITE HOUSE selling papers 
           with triumphant headlines about the victory in NEW ORLEANS. 

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           PRESIDENT JAMES MADISON (63) and his staff are moving back in 
           to the WHITE HOUSE.  His wife DOLLEY is there directing the 
           same SERVANTS that helped her save the wares of the house --

                                 DOLLEY MADISON
                        The color in here was always so 
                        drab.  Perhaps we should try 
                        something bluer. 

           WAR SECRETARY JAMES MONROE (56) appears in the doorway with a 
           MESSENGER.  Monroe can barely contain his excitement --  

                                 SECRETARY MONROE 
                        Mr. President.  Word from Belgium. 

           EXT. THE TEMPLE - DAY

           Jackson and Lafitte meet in the swamp.  Lafitte finishes 
           reading a LETTER.  He shakes his head -- 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        It was all for naught.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Nonsense.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        The commissioners signed a peace 
                        treaty on Christmas Eve!  The war 
                        had been over for two weeks!

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        A piece of paper only stops the war 
                        if the men stop fighting it.  Had 
                        we not fought that day, Packenham 
                        takes the city.  With the city, who 
                        can say what land would have fallen 
                        north of the River.  And at that 
                        point, with those conditions, a 
                        treaty is as worthless as if it had 
                        never been signed.     
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        You saved the country. 

           And in a moment of honesty and friendship --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        We both did.  I could not have done 
                        this without you or your men.  

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Or a declaration of martial law. 

           Jackson smiles contemplatively --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        I’ve learned there are times that 
                        call for bold decisions, Monsieur.  
                        That was the right one.  One day it 
                        might not be the case.      
                             (beat)
                        You and your men haven’t been seen 
                        much in the city after our victory.

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Nothing’s changed.  The legislature 
                        lauded us for days, then I went to 
                        reclaim what was stolen from Grand 
                        Terre and they wouldn’t give it.  
                        Claiborne has already accused us of 
                        war profiteering and there’s a 
                        marshal on my tail as we speak.
                             (beat)
                        I’m a pirate, General.  And so I 
                        shall always be. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        And so I shall be as well.

           The men sit in silence for a moment.  And then --

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        Show it to me.  Please.

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        What? 

                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        How you duel.  I’ve heard the 
                        stories -- the Benton Brothers --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The Benton Brothers were fools. 
                                 JEAN LAFITTE
                        It’s all I ask.   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        All right. 

           EXT. THE TEMPLE - DAY

           Jackson and Lafitte stand back to back.  They begin pacing an 
           equal distance apart.  And as they do --   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        The key to a duel isn’t always to 
                        fire first, but fire best.  Thomas 
                        Benton had challenged me after his 
                        brother Jesse was embarrassed by 
                        one of my junior officers outside 
                        of Nashville.  After much goading, 
                        I arrived at the designated 
                        location but Thomas had acquired a 
                        bit of cold feet.  Not taking 
                        kindly to that ungentlemanly like 
                        behavior, I told a local reporter 
                        the next time I saw Thomas Benton, 
                        I would whip him like him a mule.  

           Lafitte smiles -- he loves that he’s hearing this story --

                                 ANDREW JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Ten more paces.  Don’t be nervous 
                        in the turn -- the key is to be 
                        level and fire straight.  One night 
                        I received word Benton was in the 
                        hotel next door.  So I retrieved my 
                        whip and headed over.  He begged my 
                        forgiveness, but seeing as how a 
                        whipping was better than a 
                        shooting, I was ready to commence.  
                        Only the original brother was there 
                        hiding in a coat closet.  He drew 
                        on me, and as I dispatched of him, 
                        Thomas Benton ran through the 
                        streets blathering for his mother.  
                        It was said he could be heard for 
                        blocks in every direction.  And now 
                        we’re here, and then we turn --

           But when Jackson does, Lafitte is GONE.  He’s disappeared 
           into the swamp.  Jackson knows he will never see him again.  
           EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - BOURBON STREET - DAY

           Jackson rides back into the QUARTER at sunset.  He sees 
           someone waiting for him by his office...  

           Jackson can’t believe it.  He gets down off his horse and 
           runs into her arms.  It’s RACHEL JACKSON (48).   

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        Rachel.  My love. 

                                 RACHEL JACKSON
                        I am here. 

                                 ANDREW JACKSON
                        And so am I. 

           And as they finally KISS in the middle of the city he saved --

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           ANDREW JACKSON WAS LAUDED AS A HERO ACROSS THE NATION.  HE 
           WAS SWORN IN AS THE SEVENTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON 
           MARCH 4, 1829.   

           JEAN LAFITTE AND THE BARATARIANS WERE EVENTUALLY FORCED OUT 
           OF LOUISIANA BY GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.  AFTER RELOCATING TO 
           GALVESTON, LAFITTE WAS AGAIN PURSUED BY THE FEDERAL 
           GOVERNMENT. 

           LAFITTE MARRIED MARY-ANNE AND THEY LEFT TEXAS TO SETTLE IN 
           THE MIDWEST.  HE CHANGED HIS NAME AND LIVED OUT THE REST OF 
           HIS DAYS THERE, A MAN NO LONGER A PIRATE.   

                                                              FADE OUT.
