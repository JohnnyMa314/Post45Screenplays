           AN OIL WELL - AFTERNOON

           A tall wooden OIL DERRICK reaches up into the sky. Stones 
           bounce off the surface of it. WE PAN DOWN TO REVEAL the 
           source. Three young boys using it for target practice. Two 
           brothers MIKE and PAUL WALLACE, 11 and 9, and another more 
           delicate-looking boy about the same age: WILL TARBELL (10). 
           Finally, they pick up their school bags and move on.

           Title: Pennsylvania. 1868

           EXT. FOOT BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

           We follow the three boys as they walk home from school. They 
           cross a rickety wooden bridge that spans a small stream.   

           All three are sucking on red “jawbreakers” as they go.

                                 MIKE
                        Our pop says oil is the future, and 
                        everyone in Titusville is gonna be rich cos 
                        now we have it.

                                 PAUL
                        I hope we’re gonna be rich. Cos when I’m 
                        rich, I know exactly what I’m gonna buy.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you gonna buy?

                                 PAUL
                             (big red grin)
                        Sixteen gazillion Cherry Bombs. 

           Will and Paul share a look. Laugh.

                                 MIKE
                        My brother. Genius.

           As the boys reach the far side of the bridge, they are 
           intercepted by another group of boys. Their leader is CHUCKIE 
           PEARL, a husky and freckled 12-year old menace to society.

                                 WILL 
                             (face darkening)
                        Oh no, Chuckie Pearl. Keep walking.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                             (calling out)
                        Hey girls! Where ya’ll headed?

                                 WILL
                        Nowhere.
                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        Whatcha eating there, Tar Barrel?

                                 WILL
                        Nothing.

           Chuckie rifles his pockets. Finds the red jawbreakers.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        Hoo-whee! Cherry Bombs! Looks like you boys 
                        been holding out on us again.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, come on. Give those back. My dad gave 
                        those to me.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        And now you’ve given them to me. New bridge 
                        toll.

                                 MIKE
                        Give ‘em back, Chuckie. Those aren’t yours!

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        And who’s gonna make me, you?

           The three boys just stand there frozen, until--

                                 YOUNG IDA (O.S.)
                        Me.

           REVEAL: 12 year-old IDA TARBELL. A tall, gawky, string bean 
           of a girl, carrying a big bag of books.

           Chuckie and his minions bust out laughing.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        Well, well, well, if it isn’t little Miss 
                        Titty Barrel! Boy, for a second there I 
                        thought we were in trouble.

           Will Shakes his head at his sister, “Please don’t.”

                                 YOUNG IDA
                        They don’t belong to you. Now give ‘em 
                        back.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        Or what?

                                 YOUNG IDA
                        Or I’ll make you do it.

           Something about the tone, or the fierce set of her jaw, but 
           we know that she means business. And Chuckie knows it too.
                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        Why don’t you run along home to your momma. 
                        I’m sure she’s missing ya.

                                 YOUNG IDA
                        I said: Give. Them. Back.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                        Make me.

                                 YOUNG IDA
                             (a sigh)
                        Have it your way.

           Ida steps forward, and in one swift motion, she slaps his 
           face, twists his ears and kicks him in the shins. Chuckie 
           becomes enraged. He lunges at her. But Ida just holds her 
           ground, and then pops him right on the nose.

           Chuckie goes down like the coward he is. The others laugh.

                                 CHUCKIE PEARL
                             (bawling)
                        Owww! My nose! She done busted my nose! I’m 
                        getting my dad. Help!!!

           Chuckie stumbles off with his bloodied nose. His cronies soon 
           tuck tail and lope away also.

                                 YOUNG IDA
                        That’s right. Run along home to your momma. 
                        “I’m sure she’s missing ya.”

           A beat. Will stares at his sister in disbelief.

                                 WILL
                        You just punched Chuckie Pearl in the nose!

                                 YOUNG IDA
                        And do you know why I did that?
                             (Will shakes his head)
                        Cos he’s a bully, Will. And once a bully 
                        knows you’re not afraid of him, he can’t 
                        bully you anymore.

                                 WILL
                        Weren’t you afraid of him?

                                 YOUNG IDA
                        Course I was. But he didn’t know that, did 
                        he? Come on, I’ll race ya home.

                                                                CUT TO:

                               Ida Tarbell
           INT. MOVING TRAIN - DAY - 1901

           IDA TARBELL, career woman, 43, rides on a train to New York. 
           She watches a SMALL BOY sitting directly opposite her, his 
           cheeks stuffed to capacity with RED CHERRY BOMBS.

           Ida smiles at him. Remembering. Maybe he smiles back at her.

           Then, a train conductor marches down the aisle, shouting...

                                 CONDUCTOR 
                        New York! Next and last stop, New York!

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - SOME TIME LATER

           Ida walks down a crowded Lexington Avenue wearing her Sunday 
           best clothes. Her wholesome, buttoned up appearance belies a 
           range of passions and a fiercely determined will.  

           She finds the address she is looking for, enters.

           INT. OFFICES OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Ida walks through a busy office, the place blue with 
           cigarette smoke. Clacking typewriters, whooshing pneumatic 
           tubes, and all the usual paraphernalia of publishing.

           Title: McClure’s Magazine, 1901

           She approaches a young staffer (LOWRY, 32), busy typing.

                                 IDA
                        Hello, I’m looking for Mr. McClure. Is he 
                        available?

                                 LOWRY
                        I doubt it. Mr. McClure is a very busy man.

                                 IDA
                        No, I have an appointment to see him. I’m 
                        here about a job.

                                 LOWRY
                        Too late, I’m afraid. All the secretarial 
                        positions have been filled. But if you want 
                        to fill out an application--

           He hands Ida a job application form. Continues typing.

                                 IDA
                             (irritated)
                        I’m not a secretary, I’m a writer. Mr. 
                        McClure requested to meet with me.
           Just then, another man appears, hands some copy to Lowry. 
           This is PHILLIPS (50, grumpy). Ida turns to him instead.

                                 IDA
                        Are you Mr. McClure?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        No. Phillips.

                                 IDA
                        Where can I find him, please?

                                 PHILLIPS
                             (points)
                        End of the hallway, on the right.

           Ida turns to go, but not before having a little dig at Lowry.

                                 IDA
                        You might want to check your spelling. 
                        “Parallel” is two l’s, one r. Even a 
                        secretary knows that. 

           She walks off. Lowry stares at his text, frowns. She’s right.

           HALLWAY -- FOLLOWING

           A stencilled sign on a glass door reads: S.S. McClure. 
           Publisher. Ida approaches, gives a timid knock.

                                 SAM MCCLURE (O.S.)
                        Not now, Phillips!

           Ida knocks again, a little louder this time. Finally, a head 
           pokes out. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Oh, for Christ’s sake, what is it now? 

           SAM MCCLURE is a compact ball of energy in his early 40’s. Of 
           Scots-Irish descent, with the red hair and fiery temperament 
           to match. He is impeccably well-dressed for a publisher. He 
           looks like what he is: a cyclone in a frock coat. 

                                 IDA
                        Mr. McClure? I’m Ida Tarbell. We had an 
                        appointment? 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (totally forgot)
                        Ah, Miss Tarbell! Of course! Welcome. 
                        Please, come in. 

           She enters McClure’s office.
           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The place is a chaos of books, magazines, unread manuscripts. 
           He deftly sweeps a bottle of Scotch under a coat.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You must pardon our appearance, I’m afraid 
                        we’re still moving in. Thank you for 
                        coming, please have a seat. I trust you had 
                        a pleasant journey from...

                                 IDA
                        Titusville. Pennsylvania.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Pennsylvania? Good Baptist folk down there, 
                        are they?

                                 IDA
                        Some of them. We’re Methodist. 
                             (drily)
                        Less singing. More penance.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (finding a file)
                        I read your CV, it’s very impressive. First 
                        woman to graduate from Allegheny College. 
                        Editor of the Chautauquan. Masters in 
                        French literature from the Sorbonne.

                                 IDA
                        Pending...

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I see you’ve written well-reviewed bios on 
                        Madame Roland, Napoleon and Abe Lincoln. 
                        You’re quite ambitious, aren’t you?

                                 IDA
                        You mean “for a woman”?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I meant...for a writer.

           A beat. Ida takes the compliment as intended.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I read your piece in Scribner’s on Parisian 
                        cobblestones, I thought it was brilliant. 
                        Do you know why?

                                 IDA
                             (smiles)
                        You have a thing for French limestone?
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I couldn’t care less about limestone. But 
                        you made me care. And I’m still not sure 
                        how you did it.

                                 IDA
                        Well, sometimes you just have to find the 
                        right angle. The right way in.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Exactly. But not everyone can do that. 
                        Smoke?

                                 IDA
                        No, thank you.

           McClure lights up a cheroot. Puffing furiously on it as he 
           paces around the room.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        We’re small, but we’re growing fast. Our 
                        circulation right now is around 175,000. I 
                        think we can get up to 250 by next year. 
                        Have you read our magazine?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. I have.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        And..?

                                 IDA
                        You want my opinion of your magazine?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        That’s what I’m asking you.

                                 IDA
                        May I speak frankly, Mr. McClure?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Of course. I want you to.

                                 IDA
                             (thumbing the magazine)
                        Well, it’s a little thing I know, but the 
                        print is too small. I had to squint just to 
                        read it, and my eyesight is pretty good. 
                        And this paper...it feels cheap to me.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (proudly)
                        That’s because it is cheap.
                                 IDA
                        Is that how you want your readers to feel? 
                        Cheap? There are too many advertisements, 
                        it’s distracting to the eye. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        That’s what pays our rent.

                                 IDA
                        If you get more readers, maybe you can have 
                        fewer advertisers, but charge them more.

           A long pause as McClure studies Ida. Intrigued.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Go on.

                                 IDA
                        Well, the stories...forgive me, but they’re 
                        a little obvious, don’t you think?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Obvious?

                                 IDA
                        Now don’t get me wrong, it’s interesting, 
                        but it’s the low hanging fruit, isn’t it?
                        “The man who captured John Wilkes Booth” 
                        “The fat lady who sat on a burglar.” Hearst 
                        is already doing that, and frankly, he’s 
                        doing it a lot better. 
                             (a beat)
                        The reader needs to feel that you care 
                        about your subject. I don’t get that sense 
                        from reading your magazine.

           A long beat as McClure digests this stinging critique.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        And how do you propose we do that?

                                 IDA
                        By showing faith in the intelligence of 
                        your readers. By involving them, engaging 
                        them. Provoking them if necessary. By 
                        telling great stories about great 
                        personalities.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Great personalities shape history, they do 
                        not sell magazines.

                                 IDA
                        I disagree. I mean, why can’t a magazine be 
                        edifying as well as entertaining? That’s 
                        what I want when I read one. And I don’t 
                        think I’m alone in that.
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        All right, I’ll bite, Ms. Tarbell. Why do 
                        you want to work for McClure’s?

                                 IDA
                        I don’t want to write “Postcards from 
                        Paris” any more than you wish to read them. 
                        I want my work to matter. With a smaller 
                        publication, I might have more creative 
                        freedom to choose my own subjects. I think 
                        we both know that McClures is capable of so 
                        much more. And so am I.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (considers)
                        You’re passionate, and I admire that. You 
                        speak your mind freely. And it’s obvious 
                        that you care very much about writing.

                                 IDA
                        It’s the only thing I’ve ever cared about. 
                        Do you write, Mr. McClure?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I write well enough. It’s the “sitting 
                        still” part that I have trouble with.

                                 IDA
                        There is usually a price for everything.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Indeed. And the question I’m asking myself 
                        right now is, how much is yours?

                                 IDA
                             (without missing a beat)
                        Fifty dollars a week, my own byline, I 
                        don’t care about title. Contributing editor 
                        is fine.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (laughs out loud)
                        You don’t want much, do you? Fifty dollars 
                        is simply out of the question! I’ve never 
                        paid a writer that much before.

                                 IDA
                        You paid Lincoln Steffens fifty dollars a 
                        week when he worked here.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Who told you that?

                                 IDA
                        I’m a journalist, Mr. McClure. I believe in 
                        doing my research. So should you.
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Lincoln Steffens is one of the most 
                        respected writers in New York.

                                 IDA
                        Yes, and lucky for him he’s also a man. But 
                        if a woman does the same work as a man, 
                        shouldn’t she be paid the same as him?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        All right, 45 dollars then. But I’m afraid 
                        that’s the best I can do.

           Ida drops her head, then slowly stands.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you for your offer, Mr. McClure. But 
                        I need fifty dollars a week. There are 
                        plenty of other magazines in New York 
                        willing to pay for my services.

           As Ida goes to leave...

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        All right, all right, Jesus Christ! Fifty 
                        dollars then. Will that stop you from 
                        haranguing me?

                                 IDA
                             (firm)
                        Do we have an agreement, Mr. McClure?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Yes! Praise the Lord! We have an agreement!

           They shake hands on it, Ida too moved almost to speak.

                                 IDA
                             (simply)
                        Thank you.

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           JOHN PHILLIPS, the grouchy editor we met earlier is showing 
           Ida around the office. He is 50 but looks 60. 

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I read your series on Lincoln. Good 
                        writing. Lively...

                                 IDA
                        Thank you.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Something of a history buff myself.
                             (indicating)
                                 PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
                        What we do here is file all manuscripts, 
                        alphabetical by author’s name. The deadline 
                        for filing stories is 5pm on Wednesday.

                                 IDA
                        Do you know who is to be my editor?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I’m afraid you’re looking at him.
                             (pointing)
                        That’s my little fiefdom over there.

           They come to an old broken down desk. Looks more like a 
           collection of “spare parts” than a writing desk.

                                 PHILLIPS
                             (apologetic)
                        And this...this is your desk. Apparently, 
                        it belonged to Rudyard Kipling when he 
                        lived in New York. Wrote Gunga Din on here.

                                 IDA
                             (amused)
                        And without a chair it seems. Impressive.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        We have to supply our own. Here on the S.S 
                        McClure, chairs are considered an 
                        “optional” accessory.

           They continue on down the hall.

                                 IDA
                        Does Mr. McClure have a lot of ideas for 
                        new stories?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Like a dog has fleas. He has 300 new ideas 
                        every minute. That’s his job.

                                 IDA
                        Then what’s yours?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        Figuring out which one’s don’t stink.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It is small and simple. A third-floor walk-up located in 
           Greenwich Village. Ida is unpacking groceries in the kitchen 
           when there is a KNOCK at the door. She goes to answer.

           At the door stands MRS. HAMMOND, a middle-aged LANDLADY 
           holding a broom in one hand. She hands Ida a telegram.
                                 LANDLADY
                        This came for you earlier.

           Ida opens the telegram, reads it in an instant. 

                                 LANDLADY
                             (nosy)
                        Letter from home?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. You could say that.

                                 LANDLADY
                        Good news, I take it?

                                 IDA
                             (smiles)
                        Thank you, Mrs. Hammond. Good night.

           Ida closes the door on her. Looks again at the telegram.

           It reads: “FATHER SICK. COME SOON. LOVE, WILL.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TARBELL HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           A simple farmhouse located on the edge of town. The Tarbell 
           family homestead. Title: Titusville, Pennsylvania. 

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Good to see you, brother. I got here as 
                        soon as I could.

           INT. TARBELL HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Ida enters, is greeted by her brother WILL TARBELL. He’s now 
           fortyish, bespectacled and balding. Prematurely middle-aged. 

                                 WILL 
                        Good to see you too. 

                                 IDA
                        Is he really dying? 

                                 WILL
                        He’s been dying for 10 years. I think it’s 
                        just his way of getting us to visit.

                                 IDA
                        Where is he?

                                 WILL
                        Upstairs, torturing his doctor. Go on up, 
                        see for yourself.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An old man lies sleeping in a darkened room: FRANKLIN TARBELL 
           (78). Ida stands watching him from afar. Finally, the old man 
           stirs, reaching instinctively for his rusty old rifle.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Who goes there?

           Ida steps out of the shadows, hands raised. 

                                 IDA
                        Don’t shoot. It’s your only daughter.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                             (a weak smile)
                        Ida Belle. Come closer. Let me see you.

           Ida pulls up a chair next to his bed.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Now there’s a sight for tired eyes.

                                 IDA
                        What did the doctor say?

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                             (dismissive)
                        Doctors, what do they know? One says eat 
                        all you can, another says take nothing but 
                        milk and honey. So I do the opposite, and 
                        drink only whiskey.

           Ida smiles. A nice moment between them. He reaches over, 
           taking down a folder containing all of her clippings.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I’ve kept all of your articles. They’re 
                        very good, Ida. Very good!

                                 IDA
                        You’re my father. You have to say that.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I say it because it’s true. 
                             (beat)
                        What happened with that job in New York?

                                 IDA
                        I got it. Mr. McClure hired me. 

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        A very wise man. What do you say to a 
                        little jigger of rye to celebrate? 
                             (a wink)
                        I won’t tell if you don’t.
           TIMECUT -- LATER 

           Ida and her father quietly sipping whiskey together.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Remember when you used to come to work with 
                        me at the shop? I’d give you the reins, 
                        you’d sit up on my lap. You always wanted 
                        to drive the wagon, didn’t you? Even then.
                             (Ida smiles)
                        Ida, there’s something else I need you to 
                        do for me now.

           Ida looks at him. Worried. 

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I want to make sure your mother is taken 
                        care of after I’m gone.

                                 IDA
                        Father, please--

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I’m dying, Ida. And when a man knows that, 
                        he wants to see that his family is secure. 
                        You and your brother must sell the farm. 
                        Get a good price for it.

                                 IDA
                             (shocked)
                        Sell the farm?! But you said you’d never do 
                        that.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Things change. Times change.

                                 IDA
                        What about the business?

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        The business is gone. We sold it to cover 
                        some of our debts. 

                                 IDA
                        Sold it to whom?

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        The South Improvement Company. For thirty 
                        years, I slaved away in that place, morning 
                        noon and night. All to make sure this would 
                        never happen. And now it has. 

           A beat as Ida tries to process all of this. 
                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Promise me that you will take of your 
                        mother. She doesn’t have to know all the 
                        details.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Late night. Ida and Will together. Voices hushed.

                                 IDA
                        When did you know about this? 

                                 WILL
                        Six months ago.

                                 IDA
                             (annoyed)
                        Six months ago? And nobody thought to tell 
                        me about it before now?

                                 WILL
                             (shrugs)
                        You were in Paris. What could you do?

           Ida looks over a letter in her hand.

                                 IDA
                        What is the South Improvement Company?

           Will hefts a box of files onto the kitchen table.

                                 WILL
                        This is the South Improvement Company.
                        If the cancer doesn’t bury him, then all 
                        the paperwork probably will.

           A VOICE offscreen yells out.

                                 GLORIA (O.S.)
                        Will! Come to bed!

                                 WILL
                        Gloria. Light sleeper. I’ll see you in the 
                        morning. Don’t stay up too late.

           Will goes, leaving Ida alone with the box of paperwork. She 
           pulls out a file at random, stares at it.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER STILL

           The wee hours of the morning, and Ida is still at the kitchen 
           table, examining the contents of the box spread before her. 
           She reads a letter from the South Improvement company to 
           Franklin Tarbell. We see the phrases “...purchase of your 
           business” and “assessed at fair market value...”
           CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT

           More words and phrases “...for a settlement payable in cash, 
           or if you choose, in stock of The Standard Oil Company...”

           CLOSE ON ANOTHER FILE

           It’s a company prospectus. Towards the end of the file are 
           two columns of names listing the company’s board of 
           directors, none of which mean anything to us. 

           Except for one name that is crossed out. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.

           Replaced by another name: PETER WATSON. Ida stares at it, 
           confused.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Franklin is sitting up eating breakfast, Ida beside him.

                                 IDA
                        ...but you said the company wasn’t listed 
                        for sale?

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        It wasn’t. Three men came in one day and 
                        said: “Mr. Tarbell, we wish to purchase 
                        your company as a going concern.” They said 
                        they could pay us in cash or in Standard 
                        Oil Stock. We took the cash.

                                 IDA
                        How much did you get?

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Four thousand six hundred and eighty two 
                        dollars. 

                                 IDA
                             (stunned)
                        Four thousand dollars, for 30 years in 
                        business?! That’s not right.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Right or wrong, we had no choice. The South 
                        Improvement Company owns the railroad, they 
                        own the refineries, they own the oil creek. 
                        Hell, they probably even own this bed. 

           Ida looks over some of the documents, troubled. 

                                 IDA
                        The thing that confuses me is: if you were 
                        bought out by the South Improvement 
                        Company, then why were they offering you 
                        stock in The Standard Oil Company?
                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I don’t know. But I wish now we’d taken it. 
                        Might actually be worth something.

                                 IDA
                        Do you mind if I bring these back to New 
                        York? I want to have a closer look at this.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                             (shakes his head)
                        Don’t waste your time on that, Ida. It’s 
                        ancient history now. Nobody wins against 
                        the Standard. 

                                 IDA
                        I have to go now or I’ll miss my train. 

           Ida leans over, kisses him on the forehead.

                                 IDA
                        I’ll bring these back in two weeks, 
                        promise.

           And with that, Ida is gone. The old man sighs.

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Back in New York - an editorial meeting in progress. Present 
           are Sam McClure, Phillips, JACCACI (30’s, art director), and 
           two other junior staff writers PIERCE and LOWRY (20’s)

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        So...front cover, what have we got?

                                 PHILLIPS
                        I like the Yuba Gold Fields story. Life of 
                        the miners and the growth of Yuba City. 
                        It’s a solid piece of American writing.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Digging. Why is it always about digging? 
                        What else have we got, above ground?

           Ida sweeps into the room with her notes, finds an open seat 
           next to Phillips. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (sarcastic)
                        Ah, Miss Tarbell, good of you to join us!

                                 IDA
                        Sorry I’m late. Please continue.
                                 JACCACI
                        The Wright Brothers latest triumph. How the 
                        brothers flew an unmanned glider in Kitty 
                        Hawk last summer with the new box kite 
                        design. We even have diagrams of it. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Okay, but it’s not front cover, is it?
                             (beat)
                        Mr. Lowry? Any interesting new essays?

                                 LOWRY
                        Um, “Lions, Tigers and Other Great Cats” by 
                        Samuel J. Hopkins. People love to read 
                        about animals. Apparently.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Yes, if they’re under twelve. What about 
                        for the adults?

                                 PIERCE
                        “Dewey at Manila” - with the American fleet 
                        in the Philippines, by Howard Marks.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        All right, give him 3000 words. It’s 
                        patriotic, I like it. What else?

                                 PIERCE
                        “Off the rails” - adventures of a steam 
                        train driver. Older piece by Mark Twain.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Fine, but we’re not paying him any more 
                        royalties. He should be paying us at this 
                        stage.
                             (then)
                        Miss Tarbell? Anything you wish to discuss 
                        with us today?

           All eyes in the room turn expectantly to Ida. A beat, then:

                                 IDA
                        What about the trusts?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        What about them?

                                 IDA
                        Well, nobody’s writing about that, and yet 
                        when you leave the city, it’s all anyone 
                        talks about. The oil industry, sugar, beef. 
                        That’s what we should be writing about.
                                 PHILLIPS
                             (nodding in agreement)
                        She’s right. Nobody’s doing it. And it’s 
                        all Teddy Roosevelt talks about these days. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Nobody’s writing about it because nobody 
                        wants to read about it. People don’t want 
                        anti-trust legislation. They want human 
                        interest: captains, kings and pirates.
                             (a beat)
                        What else?

           CLOSE ON IDA - feeling shot down, suddenly small. The meeting 
           continues on around her.

           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - SOME TIME LATER

           McClure is packing up his briefcase when there is a soft 
           KNOCK at the door. Ida enters, looking a little unsure.

                                 IDA
                        Mr. McClure, I’ve been thinking, and well, 
                        I have an idea for a story. Human interest.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Can it wait till after lunch? I’m late for 
                        my wife. She gets terribly vexed when I am 
                        late. Which according to her, is often.

                                 IDA
                        This’ll just take a minute.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (checking his watch)
                        You’ve got exactly two.

                                 IDA
                        Well, this is a story about a man. A man of 
                        giant ambition who built a kingdom out of 
                        nothing and changed the world we live in.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Alexander the Great. Did it last year.

           McClure grabs his coat and hat, heads out. Ida trails him:

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 IDA
                        No, this is an American, living. A man who 
                        seized control of a new industry that 
                        shaped the modern American economy.
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Vanderbilt, the railroads?

                                 IDA
                             (shakes her head)
                        What company controls 90% of all the oil 
                        produced in this country?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Standard Oil.

                                 IDA
                        And who is the head of Standard Oil?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (realizing)
                        Oh no...

           He steps into an old gurney elevator, Ida follows him in: 

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

                                 IDA
                        All this time I’ve been looking for a story 
                        to come to me, and it’s been sitting there 
                        right under my nose.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You want to profile John D. Rockefeller?

                                 IDA
                        Not just a profile. Tell the entire history 
                        of the Standard Oil Company and how it 
                        became the world’s biggest monopoly.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        And how do you propose doing that..?

                                 IDA
                        By telling the story of John D. 
                        Rockefeller. They are one and the same.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Rockefeller’s one man, the Standard Oil 
                        Company is huge.

                                 IDA
                        “An institution is but the lengthened 
                        shadow of one man.” Emerson said that.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        “Absolutely not.” Sam McClure said that.
           INT. LOBBY - FOLLOWING

           The doors open, and they step out. Ida still pitching him:

                                 IDA
                        He’s nothing but a wolf in sheep’s 
                        clothing. And I can prove it.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Isn’t he retired now?

                                 IDA
                        Well, effectively, yes. But he still sits 
                        on the board of directors, and he is the 
                        majority shareholder. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’m sorry, the answer is no.

                                 IDA
                             (with rising passion)
                        What do people want? They want captains and 
                        kings and pirates. You said so yourself. 
                        Rockefeller is a captain, a king and a 
                        pirate. He is the Napoleon of businessmen.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        And he could crush you and me like a bug! 
                        Do you know how many lawyers a man like 
                        Rockefeller has working for him? 

                                 IDA
                        Lots, I imagine. So he shouldn’t have 
                        anything to worry about.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Very funny! 

                                 IDA
                        This is a man who has never, and I mean 
                        never, had to account for a single thing 
                        that Standard Oil has done. He doesn’t play 
                        by the same rules as you and me, Mr. 
                        McClure. And he never has.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        That’s because men like Rockefeller don’t 
                        have to. They make the bloody rules! 
                        Besides, you’ll never get near him. He’s 
                        too private. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           McClure exits onto the street, Ida still trailing him...
                                 IDA
                        He’s a public figure, and public figures 
                        are public property. He can’t stop us.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm, I 
                        really do. But let’s learn to walk before 
                        we try to run.

                                 IDA
                        You’re scared of him, aren’t you?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (stops; spins on her)
                        He’s the richest most powerful man in the 
                        world. Hell yes, I’m scared of him! And you 
                        would be too, if you had any sense. Find 
                        another story. 

                                 IDA
                        This is the one I want to do. This is a 
                        public issue of national interest which our 
                        readers need to know about.

           A TRAM comes hurtling along, McClure pulls Ida from its path.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Please, watch yourself, Miss Tarbell! 
                        You’ll get yourself killed.

           Ida just stands there, that same fierce determination we saw 
           in her as a girl. McClure is totally exasperated by her.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Look, you could write about anything, or 
                        anyone. Why Rockefeller?

                                 IDA
                             (simply)
                        Because he’s a bully, and I can’t stand 
                        bullies.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You really think this is a story?

                                 IDA
                        I know it’s a story, and now is the time to 
                        tell it. Let me do this, and if I’m wrong, 
                        I’ll pay you 50 dollars a week.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (weighing it)
                        All right. Fine. 5000 words. But be careful 
                        how you write it. Lawyers are very 
                        expensive, and I am very cheap.
           McClure looks down, sees he has just stepped in a steaming 
           pile of horse manure.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Ah, shit. now look what you made me do!

           Off Ida’s smile, we CUT TO --

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - ANOTHER DAY

           JOHN SIDDAL, the new office intern, up to his ears in paper 
           files which he has been tasked with filing.

           Siddal is a refined young man of 21, short and squat, with a 
           somewhat nervous disposition. Patrician manners in a too-
           tight Brooks Brothers suit.

           He loads up a batch of files, and as he turns to go...

           He crashes right into...Ida. 

           The files land everywhere. He is woefully embarrassed. 

           He stands there a moment. Despondent.

                                 SIDDAL
                        Oh God, I am so sorry.

                                 IDA
                        No, that was entirely my fault. I should 
                        learn to look where I’m going. Here, let me 
                        help you.

           Ida helps him gather up the files. After a moment:

                                 IDA
                        I’m Ida Tarbell.

                                 SIDDAL
                        Yes, I know. I read your “Life of Lincoln.” 
                        In fact, I brought it to our book club at 
                        Harvard last year.

                                 IDA
                        And you are...?

                                 SIDDAL
                             (extending a hand)
                        Sorry. John Siddal. Pleased to meet you.

                                 IDA
                        What do you do here, John?

                                 SIDDAL
                        Research assistant, file clerk, general 
                        factotum...
           The files slip once again. Fall around his feet.

                                 IDA
                             (wry)
                        Not a very good file clerk, are you John?

                                 SIDDAL
                        No, I’m afraid not. I’m terrible, in fact.

           Ida smiles. Charmed. Then, an idea...

                                 IDA
                        I wonder. How are you at research?

           And we launch into - IDA AND SIDDAL BEGINNING RESEARCH

           INT. HALL OF RECORDS - NEW YORK - DAY

           Ida and Siddal make their way inside the County Clerk’s 
           Business Bureau in Lower Manhattan. Over this, we hear:

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        Where do we begin?

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        At the beginning. With the South 
                        Improvement Company. 

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        What are we looking for?

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Everything and anything. Tax records, 
                        mentions in the press, public reports, 
                        lawsuits prior and pending. I want to know 
                        who they are and where they came from. 

           A YOUNG CLERK leads Ida and Siddal into a vast filing room. 

                                 CLERK
                        You want every report since when?

                                 IDA
                        About 1870. Give or take a few years.

                                 CLERK
                        I’m not sure we got ‘em. But if we did, 
                        this is where they’d be.

           They stare in awe at a tower of stacked boxes. Literally a 
           “mountain” of paperwork. Their task is staggering.

           CUT TO LATER -- 
           We see Ida and Siddal seated at a table, the boxes of files 
           before them as they slowly, methodically begin to sift 
           through the paperwork looking for clues to the SIC. 

           Hours pass. The light changes. They grow tired. Until:

                                 IDA
                        What have you got?

                                 SIDDAL
                        Nothing. It’s like it never existed. If 
                        there were any files in here, they’re not 
                        here now. Couple of newspaper articles.

           Siddal hands one such article to Ida. She reads it. 

           CLOSE ON: a faded press release for a book entitled “The Rise 
           and Fall of The South Improvement Company.”

                                 IDA
                        Says it was published in 1873. 

                                 SIDDAL
                        Think maybe we could get a copy?

                                 IDA
                        Only one way to find out.

           INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Ida and Siddal wait patiently at the check out desk. Finally 
           a librarian returns with a piece of paper in hand.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Are you the ones looking for this?
                             (Ida and Siddal nod)
                        I’m sorry, we don’t have it.

           Ida and Siddal turn to go, deflated, when...

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        We had a copy. Just one, mind you. Says 
                        here it was checked out over ten years ago. 
                        But it was never returned. 

                                 IDA
                        Any idea who checked it out?

           The librarian slides a paper stub at them. On it, a name and 
           address: Henry Demarest Lloyd, Sag Harbor, Long Island.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you.
           EXT. SAG HARBOR - DAY

           Middle of winter on Long Island, and it’s not pleasant. A 
           horse-drawn carriage deposits Ida and Siddal on the main 
           street of an old whaling village. 

           We see them canvassing people in the town. Talking with 
           neighbors, merchants. Most shake their heads, walk on. 

           Finally, they come to...

           EXT. LLOYDS’S HOUSE - DAY

           A crooked old fishing shack on the edge of town. Ida and 
           Siddal approach the front door, give a tentative knock.

           The door opens revealing a light-skinned black woman (MISS 
           ROSE). She stares at them, suspicious.

                                 IDA
                        Hello, I’m Ida Tarbell. This is John 
                        Siddal. We work for McClure’s Magazine in 
                        New York. Does Mr. Lloyd live here?

                                 MISS ROSE
                        He don’t give interviews anymore. Mr. Lloyd 
                        is retired now.

           A VOICE calls from inside the house.

                                 LLOYD (V.O.)
                        Who is it? Rose, who’s there?

                                 IDA
                        Please, may we speak to him? This’ll only 
                        take a few minutes.

                                 MISS ROSE
                        What’s all this about?

                                 IDA
                             (smiles)
                        Late fees. 

           INT. LLOYDS’S HOUSE - DAY

           HENRY LLOYD (76) is a grizzled old salt, retired muckraker. 
           His shock of white hair shows all the signs of a man recently 
           roused from sleep. He takes down a book, hands it to Ida.

                                 LLOYD
                        There are no copies left because Standard 
                        Oil bought them all and destroyed them. 
                        I’ll need that back.
                                 IDA
                        What does Standard Oil have to do with the 
                        South Improvement Company?

                                 LLOYD
                        Everything and nothing. But you’ll never 
                        connect it back to Rockefeller. He’s too 
                        smart for that.

                                 IDA
                        Why does he even need it?

           Lloyd tosses some logs into a wood stove, before settling 
           comfortably into his armchair. 

                                 LLOYD
                        Jackals prefer to operate under the cover 
                        of darkness. So does Rockefeller.

                                 IDA
                        So it’s a shield?

                                 LLOYD
                        That’s one word for it. “License to 
                        plunder” is probably more accurate. It 
                        gives signatories collective bargaining 
                        power against the railroads. Transportation 
                        is the key to the oil industry. Whoever 
                        controls the “flow” of oil, controls the 
                        industry.

                                 SIDDAL
                        The name “South Improvement Company” - what 
                        does it mean? 

                                 LLOYD
                        Absolutely nothing. It says nothing, and it 
                        means nothing. That’s the whole point.  

                                 IDA
                        You’ve met Mr. Rockefeller. Tell me, what 
                        kind of man is he?

           A long beat as Lloyd looks at them both. Then...

                                 LLOYD
                        Let me tell you a little story. 
                             (pause)
                        So it's 1878, and there's a young man named 
                        Fred Backus, worked as a bookkeeper for 
                        Rockefeller. He saves a little stake and 
                        with the money buys a small lubricating 
                        plant. He slaves over that thing for eight 
                        years, turns it into a big success. Two 
                        years later, he dies of consumption leaving 
                        behind a wife and four kids. 
                                 LLOYD (CONT'D)
                        So Rockefeller goes to meet the Widow 
                        Backus to see if she'd be interested in 
                        selling to him. Rockefeller, nice guy that 
                        he is, says he'll take it off her hands for 
                        60,000 dollars. She balks, telling him it's 
                        worth ten times that. He suggests they get 
                        down on their knees and “pray for a sign” 
                        from God, which they do. Two days later, 
                        the widow's house burns to the ground. 
                        Widow and four kids are suddenly homeless. 
                        But nobody knows how it started. There's no 
                        inquest, no police investigation. So what 
                        happens? She goes back to Rockefeller 
                        begging him to buy the company off her, 
                        which he does, for the low low price of 
                        30,000 dollars. 
                             (beat)
                        That should tell you a lot about what 
                        “kind” of man he is.

           EXT. LLOYDS’S HOUSE - LATER

           Ida and Lloyd stand outside the house, saying their goodbye. 
           Siddal moves in and out, carting away boxes of files.

                                 IDA
                        Do you think he’d meet with me?

                                 LLOYD
                             (a laugh)
                        Rockefeller, give an interview? He’d sooner 
                        shake hands with the devil. You might have 
                        a shot with Rogers, though. He loves to 
                        talk. Especially when the subject is 
                        himself.

                                 IDA
                        Rogers..?

                                 LLOYD
                        Henry “Hellhound” Rogers. As fine a pirate 
                        as ever flew a flag on Wall Street. He’s 
                        the gatekeeper, Rockefeller’s right hand. 
                        Until Junior wises up.
                             (beat)
                        Please don’t take this the wrong way, Miss 
                        Tarbell. But I believe you’re wasting your 
                        time.

                                 IDA
                        What makes you say that?

                                 LLOYD
                        No man can take on John D. Rockefeller, and 
                        certainly no woman. Believe me, I know.
           Ida swallows this one. With some difficulty.

                                 IDA
                        Maybe you underestimate me, Mr. Lloyd, and 
                        that’s okay. I’m hoping that others will 
                        too. 

           As Ida goes to leave -- 

                                 LLOYD
                        You really have no idea what you’re up 
                        against, do you?

           Ida stops. Turns and walks back to him.

                                 IDA
                             (very controlled)
                        Maybe I don’t. But I know the difference 
                        between right and wrong. My father was an 
                        oil man, Mr Lloyd. He worked all his life 
                        to build his own business, only to see it 
                        stolen from him by a gang of corporate 
                        thugs answerable to no one, and I want to 
                        know why. And as you correctly point out, I 
                        am a woman in a man’s job, which means I 
                        have to be twice as good as you to earn 
                        even half the credit you get for free. 
                             (beat)
                        Thanks for the book. Good day, Mr. Lloyd.

           Lloyd smiles to himself. Admires her spunk.

                                 LLOYD
                        Good. That’s the spirit! Now use that, 
                        Tarbell. Cherish your contempt. Nurture it. 
                        Because in the end, it’s all you keep.

           Ida walks away from this prickly old rooster.

           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ida is debriefing McClure after her jaunt out to Long Island. 

                                 IDA
                        It’s a Trojan horse. The other refiners are 
                        forced to join in, or they quickly get 
                        squeezed out. Once he had a monopoly over 
                        Cleveland, he marched on to Pittsburgh, 
                        Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Yes, but how do you prove it?

                                 IDA
                        I don’t know. But I’m going to need a full-
                        time research assistant.
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’m afraid we don’t have one.

                                 IDA
                        Then I’ll take John Siddal. From now on, he 
                        works for me.

           Sam looks at her. Amused.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Oh. Anything else?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. I need you to print this in the next 
                        issue. Not too big, not too small. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        What is it?

                                 IDA
                             (smiles)
                        Bait.

           CLOSE ON A SMALL ADVERTISEMENT: 

           “Have you worked for The Standard Oil Company? Do you have a 
           story to tell? Please contact: Ida M. Tarbell.” 

           And as we PULL BACK, we are now in --

           INT. 26 BROADWAY - OFFICES OF STANDARD OIL - DAY

           A company secretary (MISS HARRISON, 29) opens up the latest 
           issue of McClure’s Magazine, and flipping through the pages, 
           spots Ida’s small advertisement. 

           She rises immediately from her desk and walks the magazine 
           down the hallway to a large ornate wooden door. She knocks. 

                                 MISS HARRISON
                        Mr. Rogers?

           A VOICE booms from the other side.

                                 ROGERS
                        Come in!

           She enters the office. The door closes softly behind her.

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Ida types at her desk. A mail clerk drops off some letters 
           for her. One letter catches her attention, the return address 
           reads “26 Broadway”. She rips it open. Reads:
                                 MISS HARRISON (V.O.)
                        “Dear Miss Tarbell, Mr. Rogers is available 
                        to meet with you on September 27th at 
                        2.00pm. Please make your way to our offices 
                        located at 26 Broadway, and come to the 
                        12th floor. When you get there, you will 
                        ask for Miss Harrison...”

           Ida rises from her desk, taking the letter down the hall to 
           McClure’s office. Anxious to share the good news with him. 

           As she steps into his office unannounced, she finds him in an 
           amorous embrace with a woman, clearly not his wife.

                                 IDA
                             (surprised)
                        Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know...

           They break apart just as Ida barges in. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        No, it’s all right. Come in. I was 
                        just...talking to Miss Wilkinson. She is 
                        one of our featured poets this month.
                             (introducing)
                        Florence Wilkinson, Ida Tarbell.

           Wilkinson (39) is a glamorous-looking lady, and she gives Ida 
           a quick once over. Smiles a phony smile.

                                 FLORENCE WILKINSON
                        Ida Tarbell, the writer?

                                 IDA
                        I’m sure there are others.

                                 FLORENCE WILKINSON
                        Well now. I’ve heard a lot about you!

           An awkward beat. Sam is dreadfully embarrassed. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Yes, Miss Tarbell?

           Ida smiles, trying to shrug off her momentary unease.

                                 IDA
                             (holding up the letter)
                        It worked. I’m in!

           EXT. 26 BROADWAY - DAY

           Ida enters the very imposing-looking granite building. 
           Corporate HQ of The Standard Oil Company in New York.  
           INT. 26 BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the feel is Spartan and purposeful. Gleaming floors, 
           polished brass. Ida is directed to an elevator by a security 
           guard, and whooshed upwards to the 12th floor...

                                 ROGERS (V.O.)
                        The Good Lord has prospered us, I don’t 
                        deny it. But it took a lot of work too...

           INT. ROGERS’ OFFICE - DAY

           HENRY “HELLHOUND” ROGERS stands looking out the window, king 
           of all he surveys. He is 62, tall, fit and good-looking. A 
           charming and loquacious character in a handlebar moustache.

                                 ROGERS
                        When we came to the business, it was a 
                        jungle. Total chaos. What we did was create 
                        order out of that chaos. A way of doing 
                        things that was streamlined, efficient and 
                        above all, safe. We took a second-rate, 
                        inefficient petroleum market and created 
                        this...the gold standard. 

           Miss Harrison enters carrying a tray of tea. Places it neatly 
           on a table between them, disappears again.

                                 ROGERS
                        Tea, Miss Tarbell?

                                 IDA
                        No thank you.

           He pours himself some tea, continues on:

                                 ROGERS
                        I knew your father back in Titusville.

           This surprises Ida. The reason she was invited here, she now 
           realizes. 

                                 ROGERS
                        We were both wildcatters in the early days. 
                        Before he got into the barrel business. How 
                        is your father by the way?

                                 IDA
                        Not very well, to say the least. 

                                 ROGERS
                        I’m sorry to hear that.
                             (beat)
                        So, what can I do for you?
                                 IDA
                        Well, I’m writing a story about Standard 
                        Oil for our magazine --

                                 ROGERS
                             (patronizing smile)
                        A story, eh? Well now, you’ve come to the 
                        right place for stories!

                                 IDA
                             (playing along)
                        Yes, I suppose I have.

                                 ROGERS
                        And what kind of story is it that you want 
                        to write for your magazine?

                                 IDA
                        Well, this would be a...portrait. A 
                        portrait of a great American company.

                                 ROGERS
                        I like it already! So, how can I help you?

                                 IDA
                        I’m trying to gather a little history on 
                        the company, and I want to make sure I get 
                        all of my facts straight.

                                 ROGERS
                        Yes, of course. We want the facts to be 
                        correct, don’t we?
                             (thinks)
                        Come with me. I have an idea.

           INT. LIBRARY - 26 BROADWAY - DAY

           Rogers leads Ida inside a beautifully ornate library. 

                                 ROGERS
                        It’s not quite finished yet, but this is 
                        going to be our new company library. You’ll 
                        find a lot of our history housed in here.

                                 IDA
                        Do you mind if I take a look?

                                 ROGERS
                        Not at all. Miss Harrison can help you find 
                        whatever it is you need. 
                             (checks his pocket watch)
                        Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m afraid I have 
                        another meeting to attend. 

                                 IDA
                        Thank you, Mr. Rogers. 
                                 ROGERS
                        My pleasure, Miss Tarbell. You let me know 
                        if there’s anything else you need.

           Rogers exits. Leaving Ida momentarily alone in the library. 

           As he breezes out, he stops by Miss Harrison’s desk.

                                 ROGERS
                             (whispers)
                        No harm in letting her have a look around. 
                        We are a friendly company, after all. But 
                        keep an eye on her. I don’t want her left 
                        alone in there. 

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        The key to it all is facts, John. 

           And we launch into...

           MONTAGE -- IDA AND SIDDAL DEVELOPING THEIR STORY

           Images of feverish activity as they begin piecing together 
           the first article. CROSSCUT as we see --

           A) IDA’S APARTMENT:

           She paces furiously around the room, pinning notes to a wall: 
           names, letters, dates, questions. Pieces of a puzzle. She 
           fires off a series of notes and memos to Siddal...

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        If we can present the facts correctly, the 
                        reader will supply his own outrage. But we 
                        must present our story plainly, simply. 
                        Tell nothing that cannot be proven.

           B) STATE COURTHOUSE IN CLEVELAND:

           Siddal is shown into a massive vault of ancient looking files 
           by a Court Clerk, he looks around, bewildered.

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Begin with State Congressional hearings in 
                        Cleveland. I want transcripts of all 
                        investigations. They are public record. 

           Siddal digs and digs through mountains of transcripts...

           C) 26 BROADWAY, STANDARD OIL LIBRARY:

           Ida works in the library at 26 Broadway, carefully supervised 
           by Miss Harrison. She appears to looking over a photographic 
           periodical. Inside, we see another file labeled “Interstate 
           Commerce Commission.”
                                 IDA
                        Find out who the presiding judges were. I 
                        want names, dates and addresses. Pay close 
                        attention to testimony by Henry Rogers and 
                        John Rockefeller, where it appears. 

           D) A PUBLIC PARK IN CLEVELAND:

           Retired Judge Martin Knapp (78), is out walking his dog when 
           young Siddal approaches. Asks him a question. 

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Let’s look at banking records. We should 
                        also contact Martin Knapp, former Chairman 
                        of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Find 
                        out what he knows. Is he even alive..?

           Frightened, the old man hurries off. 

           E) THE WIDOW BACKUS’ HOUSE:

           Siddal knocks on a shanty house. The Widow Backus (68) opens 
           the door, listens to his pitch. She nods. Letting him inside.  

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Can we locate the Widow Backus, corroborate 
                        her story with the Henry Lloyd version?

           F) IDA’S APARTMENT:

           The walls are now covered with A CHART OF STANDARD OIL 
           OPERATIONS. A history, a timeline, an investigation...

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Questions we want answered: 1) How and when 
                        did Standard Oil acquire the charter to the 
                        South Improvement Company?
                             (another note)
                        2) If they did, then why is Mr. Rockefeller 
                        not listed among its board of directors?
                             (another note)
                        3) If the companies acquired by the scheme 
                        are not owned by Standard, then why were 
                        they issued stock in Standard Oil?

           Ida takes a step back, gazing up at her shrine.

                                 IDA
                        Well, Mr. Rockefeller, care to comment?

                                 DR. BIGGAR (V.O.)
                        God damn and blast it!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           EXT. KYKUIT - PRIVATE GOLF COURSE - DAY

           DR. BIGGAR (65), a portly and ruddy-faced gentleman, has just 
           shanked his golf ball into the woods. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You’re pivoting your left foot again! You 
                        must keep it nailed firmly to the ground. 
                        Or I shall have to nail it there for you.

           Welcome to Kykuit, the Rockefeller country estate located in 
           beautiful Hudson Valley, upstate New York.

           Set upon 3000 acres of pristine wilderness with sweeping 
           views of the Catskills and the Hudson River, this is one of 
           the most magnificent landscapes in North America.

           JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER is 61 years old, and cuts a lean athletic 
           figure in a knickerbocker suit and straw hat. Ruthless and 
           efficient in everything he does, he is one of the greatest 
           tycoons of the 20th Century; the unrivaled titan of American 
           industry, and also its very first billionaire. 

           Rockefeller lines up his shot. Swings. It sails straight up 
           the middle of the fairway. He watches it land, pleased.

           The doctor pulls out a small hip flask, takes a quick nip of 
           brandy from it. Rockefeller frowns with disapproval. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I have only three rules on my golf course, 
                        Dr. Biggar. One, no business discussion. 
                        Two, no drinking allowed. And three, no 
                        taking of the Lord’s name in vain.
                             (beat)
                        One more strike and you’re out.

           Rockefeller strides briskly after his ball, handing off his 
           club to an eager young CADDY (22).

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Which one are you again?

                                 CADDY
                        I’m Tucker, sir.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        How long have you worked here, Tucker?

                                 CADDY
                        About 3 months.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Not a drinker are you?

                                 CADDY
                        No, sir. 
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Stay that way. Alcohol only dulls the wits, 
                        weakens the will. Can you believe that he’s 
                        the doctor and I’m the patient?  

           Rockefeller arrives at his ball. Lines up another shot. 
           Swings. It lands just on the edge of the green.

           He turns to look back at Dr. Biggar, hacking away. Divots 
           flying. Curses streaming.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        He’s been playing golf all his life. I 
                        taught myself how to play in only six 
                        months. Do you know how I did it?

                                 CADDY
                        No, sir.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        With discipline, focus and practice. With 
                        those three things you can accomplish 
                        anything. If you remember nothing else from 
                        your time here, remember that young man.

           The doctor catches up to them, red-faced and puffing.

                                 DR. BIGGAR
                        Hope we’re not keeping score. It’s my 
                        damned sciatica, playing havoc with my 
                        swing.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Of course we’re keeping score, Dr. Biggar! 
                        You should know me well enough by now - I 
                        only play to win. Why else play the game?
                             (to the caddy)
                        Get him some water before he passes out.

           Rockefeller locates his ball near the green. And when he 
           thinks nobody is looking, he gently kicks his ball onto the 
           green. A small cheat, but a cheat nonetheless.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        The bible says you must look after your 
                        body, Dr. Biggar. It is our religious duty, 
                        for which the good lord rewards us in 
                        health. 

           He lines up and putts. It rolls sweetly into the hole. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        What do you think about that, doctor?

                                 DR. BIGGAR
                        I think he’s rewarded you very well.
           The doctor takes his putt. Misses.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (delighted)
                        Noble effort. Call that one in, shall we?

           Sound of a spoon tinkling a glass takes us to...

           INT. KYKUIT - DINING ROOM - EVENING

           A long candlelit table, exquisitely set. Twenty or so well-
           dressed dinner guests. Dr. Biggar introducing their host...

                                 DR. BIGGAR (V.O.)
                        ...he has given so much to our city, our 
                        country and our beloved hospital that we 
                        may never fully repay his generosity. 
                        All that we can do is bask in his reflected 
                        glory, and say “Thank You” Mr. Carnegie - I 
                        mean Mr. Rockefeller...

           Raucous laughter. Rockefeller stands to address his guests, a 
           man confident in his years and elevated social position.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Thank you, doctor. Nothing ruins a good 
                        speech like a great introduction..

           Sitting beside Rockefeller is his wife, CETTIE (60). Though 
           petite in stature, she is a fearsome woman.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        We are gathered today in celebration of 
                        Thanksgiving, and we have much to be 
                        thankful for. For my own retirement which 
                        has brought my wife so much pleasure. She 
                        now has double the husband and half the 
                        income.

           Polite laughter. Cettie smiles dutifully.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        And of course, the wonderful news of our 
                        son’s engagement to the lovely Abigail 
                        Greene, which he has just shared with us.

           ANGLE ON: JOHN ROCKEFELLER “JUNIOR” (24), son and heir to the 
           Rockefeller family fortune. He is a serious and sensitive 
           young man. At his side, his pretty fiancée, ABBY (25). 

           Opposite them sit Abby’s parents. Stiff and uncomfortable.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        John, having you as my son has been one of 
                        my life’s greatest joys. 
                                 ROCKEFELLER (CONT'D)
                        And today, that joy is doubled, as we 
                        welcome Abigail to our extended family. Her 
                        parents’ loss will be our gain, and I for 
                        one, am delighted.

                                 OTHER VOICES
                        Just so! Hear hear! Bravo!

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Remember son, all good decisions are the 
                        result of proper discussion between you and 
                        your wife. You would do well to listen to 
                        her. Of course, a fine pair of handcuffs 
                        and leg-irons may also come in handy.

           Some guffaws from the men. Abby’s parents look slightly 
           alarmed. Cettie grins with great forbearance.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Here’s to your joy, and ours, from this day 
                        forward. Please raise your glasses now...
                             (toasting)
                        ...to John and Abigail!

                                 ALL 
                        John & Abigail.

           Sound of knocking on a door, as we CUT TO --

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The knocking becomes more insistent. Ida rises from bed, 
           pulling on a cardigan. Open the door to reveal --

                                 SIDDAL
                        I think I may have found something.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

           Siddal flips through his notes, excited to share the findings 
           of his recent field trip to Cleveland...

                                 SIDDAL
                        Listen to this. Testimony of James 
                        Alexander before State Congressional 
                        investigators. When asked if he had sold 
                        his refinery to the South Improvement 
                        Company, he replies: “To one of its 
                        members, Peter Watson. He is a director of 
                        that company. But it was sold in name to 
                        Standard Oil, with my understanding that it 
                        was to be put into the scheme...”

                                 IDA
                        That’s on the record?
                                 SIDDAL
                        On the record. Right here. He makes no 
                        distinction between the two companies. 

                                 IDA
                        Can we talk to him?

                                 SIDDAL
                        Small problem there. He’s dead.

                                 IDA
                        What about the company charter, do we know 
                        where that came from?

           INT. AUCTION HOUSE - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

           A well-dressed MAN (obscured) places a silent bid at an  
           estate auction.

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        I checked with the mayor’s office, and the 
                        charter to the South Improvement Company 
                        was purchased for 25 dollars at an estate 
                        sale in 1871. Sold to one Peter Watson.

                                 AUCTIONEER
                        I have twenty-five dollars, do I hear 
                        thirty? Going once, going twice, sold! To 
                        the gentleman at the back.

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        It granted Watson exclusive rights to drill 
                        in the state of Pennsylvania, own any 
                        drilling lease or transfer any property.

                                 IDA
                        But the State legislature would surely have 
                        a record of that. All businesses must be 
                        registered.

                                 SIDDAL
                        Yes, but here’s where it gets interesting. 

           INT. PRIVATE MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK) 

           Ten men are gathered around a conference table. A clandestine 
           meeting of early oil prospectors. We don’t see their faces.

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        The Pennsylvania legislature never 
                        published the charter, never disclosed who 
                        proposed it, or who recorded its vote. 
                                 CHAIRMAN
                        All those in favor, raise your right hand.

           Ten hands go up.

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        It’s as if overnight, the company simply 
                        appeared. 

           INT. LAW OFFICES - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

           A JUDGE signs and seals the charter into law, presided over 
           by two BUSINESSMEN (faces obscured).

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        The charter was signed into law by newly 
                        minted 35 year-old Judge, Martin Knapp.

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Wonder how he became Chairman of the ICC?

           Handshakes and smiles all round. Very discreetly, Judge Knapp 
           takes delivery of a large bag of cash.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                 IDA
                        What about banking records?

                                 SIDDAL
                        None available. But curiously, six months 
                        after the charter was signed into law, the 
                        National Bank of Pennsylvania was sold. 
                        Guess who bought it? A new company calling 
                        itself the Standard Oil Company of Ohio. 

                                 IDA
                        That’s some coincidence.

                                 SIDDAL
                        I thought so.

           INT. BANK - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

           The door opens. Polished shoes walk up to the counter.

                                 BANK TELLER
                        May I help you?

           Tilt up to reveal: a young John D. Rockefeller.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Yes. My name is Peter Watson. I’d like to 
                        see about opening up an account.
                                 BANK TELLER
                        Certainly, sir. I’ll just need you fill out 
                        some paperwork. 

                                 SIDDAL (V.O.)
                        But wait - it gets even better.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                 SIDDAL
                        According to the Oil City Derrick, the very 
                        same Peter Watson, “director of the South 
                        Improvement Company” was killed in a mining 
                        accident in 1872, three months before he 
                        somehow managed to open up a bank account.

                                 IDA
                        So. A company worth 25 dollars, owned by a 
                        dead man, that only exists on paper - 
                        somehow managed to acquire 90% of all the 
                        oil refineries in the United States? 
                             (beat)
                        That’s some trick, wouldn’t you say?

                                 SIDDAL
                        Magic.

                                 IDA
                        Good work, John. I’ll see you tomorrow.

           The clatter of an old typewriter takes us to...

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Ida’s fingers flying over the keys of an old Underwood. These 
           words appearing: “The History of the Standard Oil Company.” 
           This is the beginning of what will become her landmark work.

           Sam McClure stops by her desk, holding a manuscript.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Miss Tarbell, a word please?

           INT. SAM’S OFFICE - FOLLOWING

           Ida and Siddal watch nervously as McClure finishes reading 
           her manuscript. John Phillips is also present.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (reading aloud)
                        “It was to be the most gigantic and daring 
                        conspiracy a free country has ever seen, 
                        wrought by the long shadow of one man...” 
           McClure sets down the last page. Looks at Ida. 

                                 IDA
                        Too much? 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        How much of this is actually true?

                                 IDA
                        Every single word. 

                                 SIDDAL
                             (helpfully)
                        Alexander’s testimony was given under oath 
                        to congressional investigators.

           McClure looks to Phillips, who nods.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        We have an independent witness 
                        authenticating the court transcripts.

                                 IDA
                        I have a theory on Standard Oil--

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’m not interested in theory, Miss Tarbell. 
                        I’m interested in what we know.

                                 IDA
                        The Standard Oil company is founded upon a 
                        lie. The lie that it is any different from 
                        the South Improvement Scheme. It’s not.

                                 PHILLIPS
                        This isn’t exactly new ground. Henry Lloyd 
                        was hinting at this for years.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        This is different. You’re going after the 
                        man himself. You want me to publicly accuse 
                        the world’s greatest tycoon of being the 
                        linchpin of an illegal ring, whose tactics 
                        he has secretly transferred to the Standard 
                        Oil Company?

                                 IDA
                        He’s also a liar and a tax cheat, but I’d 
                        need more time for that.

           A beat.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Is there more?

                                 IDA
                        Tons. This is only the beginning.
                                 PHILLIPS
                             (nervously)
                        You’re talking about one very big gorilla 
                        here. One that doesn’t like publicity very 
                        much.

                                 IDA
                        My story is accurate. Whether he “likes” it 
                        or not. 

           Silence. The clock ticks by. McClure, slowly:

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (to Phillips)
                        Let’s hold our cover story on Madame Curie 
                        for next month. I think some of our readers 
                        might be interested in this.
                             (Ida smiles, relieved)
                        Let’s just hope you’re right, Miss Tarbell. 
                        Because if you’re not, it’s my nuts in his 
                        vise.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           The printing presses roll, spitting out copies of McClure’s 
           Magazine. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: November 1902.

           On the cover, the title of Ida’s story: “UNHOLY ALLIANCE”. 
           And the sub head: WHO IS THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY?

           All around the country we see people - on buses, trains, in 
           offices - reading Ida’s article. And it’s a bombshell.

           Henry Lloyd, reads with particular interest.

           Franklin Tarbell, in his sick bed, reads with interest. 

           Teddy Roosevelt, in the Oval Office, reading with admiration.

           Henry Rogers, reading at 26 Broadway. A dark scowl on his 
           face. 

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY 

           We follow SACKS OF MAIL as they are wheeled into the office. 
           VOICES OF READERS writing in from around the country.

                        one to write letters to magazines, I feel 
                        you are to be congratulated on your

           Ida at her desk, reading some of her fan mail. Pleased by the 
           response. Her article has perfectly captured the zeitgeist.

                                 READER # 3 (V.O.)
                        “...I have not the least doubt as to the

                        Pennsylvanians, I want to thank you for 
                        giving us a voice which all too often has 
                        been shouted down or drowned out by these 
                        greedy oil men in our region. 

           A smile appears on Ida’s face as she recognizes the voice...

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL (V.O.)
                        “I feel positively invigorated when I 
                        imagine the look of surprise on Mr. 
                        Rockefeller’s face as he reads your fine 
                        article. Glad to see you didn’t listen to 
                        my advice. Now give ‘em hell, Ida Belle, 
                        give ‘em hell... 

           BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST TAKES US TO...

           EXT. KYKUIT - SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

           ROCKEFELLER - shooting clay pigeons on the lawn. Seeing HENRY 
           ROGERS arrive, he hands off his gun, goes over to meet him. 

           They repair to a quiet spot where they can discuss business 
           in private. Rogers pulls some legal documents from his 
           briefcase for Rockefeller to sign.

                                 ROGERS
                        Sign here and here.

           Rockefeller lends his signature to a couple of documents.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Anything else?

           Rogers then pulls out a copy of McClure’s Magazine, handing 
           it to Rockefeller.

                                 ROGERS
                        You might want to have a look at this. 
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        What is it?

                                 ROGERS
                        A female journalist named Ida Tarbell. She 
                        writes about Standard Oil in this month’s 
                        McClures Magazine. She came to see me a 
                        couple of months ago, asking for my help. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        And did you?

                                 ROGERS
                             (caught)
                        Ah, no. I mean, yes, I did meet with her 
                        very briefly, but only out of courtesy. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        What is she writing about?

                                 ROGERS
                        It’s the South Improvement Scheme. Since 
                        the Sherman Act, there’s a whole bunch of 
                        them come crawling out of the woodwork.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I don’t see how that concerns us.

                                 ROGERS
                        Yes sir, I know but...it seems to me the 
                        climate in Washington has changed somewhat 
                        since President McKinley was shot. Teddy 
                        Roosevelt has been sounding off in public 
                        about the trusts. I fear he’s gotten some 
                        people riled up, and we don’t yet know what 
                        his politics are.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Presidents come and go, Mr. Rogers. We do 
                        not.

                                 ROGERS
                        How would you like me to handle this?

           Rockefeller’s attention is suddenly drawn to a huge earthworm 
           squirming at his feet. He reaches down and picks it up.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You see this worm, Mr. Rogers? If I pick 
                        this up and show it to you, what do you 
                        think about that? 

                                 ROGERS
                             (confused)
                        Nothing. It’s just a worm.
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Exactly. If I crush it, I only draw 
                        attention to it. But if I ignore it...
                             (tosses the worm aside)
                        ...it will burrow a hole and disappear. The 
                        world is full of worms, Mr. Rogers. 

                                 ROGERS
                        Worms?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Anarchists, socialists, malcontents. They 
                        hate us because we have been successful, 
                        and they have not. And you know what I say, 
                        Mr. Rogers? “Let the great world wag.”

                                 ROGERS
                             (forcing a smile)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Very well then. What’s next on the agenda?

           Rockefeller hands him back the magazine without so much as 
           even a glance.

           INT. 26 BROADWAY - ELEVATOR - DAY

           Ida is whooshed upwards in the elevator. She smooths her hair 
           and skirt before exiting on the 12th floor. She’s visibly 
           nervous, as well she might be.

                                 ROGERS (V.O.)
                        You are to be congratulated, Miss Tarbell, 
                        on a marvelous work of fiction.

           INT. 26 BROADWAY - ROGERS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Rogers stares out the window, his back turned to Ida.

           He turns slowly to face her. No pretense of friendliness or 
           bonhomie today. Just a very grudging kind of respect.

                                 IDA
                        Then show me where I was wrong?

                                 ROGERS
                             (angrily)
                        I don’t have to show you anything. The fact 
                        is, you misrepresented yourself to me.

                                 IDA
                        Did I, or did you?
                                 ROGERS
                        Don’t play games with me. You deliberately 
                        misled me about your intention. Now either 
                        you’re very smart or you’re incredibly 
                        stupid, I cannot decide which.

           A beat. He fixes her with a cold hard stare.

                                 ROGERS
                        Miss Tarbell, before you go off on some 
                        kind of crusade here, let me remind you who 
                        it is you’re dealing with. Standard Oil is 
                        a legitimate multinational company, the 
                        largest in the world. It employs more 
                        people than the whole United States Army. 
                        Do you really mean to go into battle with 
                        men who have spent the better part of their 
                        lives engaged in making war?

                                 IDA
                        I mean to tell the truth.

                                 ROGERS
                             (temper)
                        But you’re not being practical!!

           He pounds the desk with his fist. Papers go flying. Rogers 
           quickly composes himself. Smooths back his hair.

                                 ROGERS
                        You and Mr. McClure are playing a very 
                        dangerous game here. And I refuse - I 
                        simply refuse - to take any further part in 
                        it. Do I make myself clear?

                                 IDA
                        Perfectly. Now let me be clear, Mr. Rogers.
                        I’m not asking for your permission here. I 
                        am going to write my articles with or 
                        without your help. But...I think it will go 
                        a lot better for you personally, should you 
                        wish to cooperate with me. How would Mr. 
                        Rockefeller feel, knowing that you invited 
                        me a second time to your office? Or that 
                        you granted me full access to his “private” 
                        company library? 

           Rogers is rendered speechless.

                                 IDA
                        Here’s how it will go: you will share with 
                        me all the information that I request, when 
                        I request it. In return, you will get to 
                        read my drafts before they are published: 
                        confirm, deny, clarify any point you feel 
                        is necessary. Beyond that, you will have no 
                        editorial control.
           Rogers looks like he has just swallowed a cup of boric acid.

                                 IDA
                        Can I talk to Mr. Rockefeller?

                                 ROGERS
                             (grim)
                        You are talking to him.

           INT. 26 BROADWAY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens and Ida hurries down the corridor to the 
           elevator. And reaching for the button, we see that her hands 
           are shaking. Adrenaline pumping. Her entire body trembling 
           from the effort of appearing “calm” in front of Rogers.

           As Ida leaves, PULL BACK TO REVEAL: MISS HARRISON - tapping 
           out a message on a private telegraph machine. 

           - At KYKUIT, an OPERATOR takes down the incoming cable, hands 
           it off to a porter...

           - Who whisks it away down a hallway -

           - Where it lands on the private desk of JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER. 

           He reads the message: “Ida Tarbell not cooperative. Highly 
           recommend taking action.” 

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Ida is working at her desk, when her attention is drawn to 
           John Siddal on the other side of a glass window. He is 
           talking to a MAN IN HIS MID-60’S. His name is HARLAN WHITNEY. 
           More scary looking than actually dangerous.

           He walks past Siddal, and right up to Ida at her desk.

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        Are you Ida Tarbell?

                                 SIDDAL
                        I’m sorry, he just barged right in here.

                                 IDA
                        Yes. Who are you?

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        My name’s Harlan Whitney. I’m a railroad 
                        engineer. Or at least I used to be. Worked 
                        on the Erie Line, up near Buffalo.

           He says this like Ida should know what he means.
                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        After it got taken over by the South 
                        Improvement Company?

           TIMECUT: LATER --

           Ida and Siddal sitting with the man, listening to his story.

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        South Improvement scheme was s’posed to 
                        make life better for all refiners.

                                 IDA
                        How?

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        Lower shipping rates. That’s how they got 
                        others to join in. They got sweetheart 
                        deals with all the railroads. Pennsylvania, 
                        New York, New Haven, even The Central. 

                                 IDA
                        Do you know how these deals were made?

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                             (nods)
                        Any business they got from Standard, the 
                        railroad had to kick back to the company. 
                        Usually ten cents on every barrel shipped.

                                 IDA
                        What you’re talking about here are rebates?

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        Yeah, rebates. But for them that didn’t 
                        want to play in the game, they could sure 
                        make things hard.

           INT. RAILWAY OFFICE - DAY - (FLASHBACK) 

           WHITNEY, ten years younger, is holed up in his office when 
           two Standard Oil THUGS enter. He looks up from his paper.

                                 THUG # 1
                        The 4:15 from Buffalo?

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        On time.

                                 THUG # 2
                        Take a hike.

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        But I have to switch signals.

           Thug # 2 pulls back his coat, revealing a revolver.
                                 THUG # 2
                        I said, take a hike!

           Fearing for his life, Whitney quickly disappears.

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY (V.O.)
                        More than once, I sent a train down the 
                        wrong tracks. Accidentally on purpose.

           EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

           A train signal is switched, and an approaching FREIGHT TRAIN  
           screeches to a halt. A group of OIL MEN, their faces hidden 
           by handkerchiefs, approach with pickaxes in hand. 

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY (V.O.)
                        Knowing what they was gonna do to it, it 
                        never sat well with me. But I had a wife 
                        and four kids to feed. I needed that job.

           They pull back a tarp to reveal: Union Oil, not Standard Oil. 
           Their leader nods, giving the signal.

           And thuk, thuk, thuk! The pickaxes fly into barrels of oil, 
           spilling it onto the ground.

           BACK TO SCENE --

           Harlan Whitney hangs his head, fingering a worn out cap.

                                 HARLAN WHITNEY
                        When I read your article and seen how John 
                        Rockefeller was behind the South 
                        Improvement Scheme, I just figured you 
                        might like to know...

           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ida paces in McClure’s office. Sam sits opposite her, his 
           feet up on the desk.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        This guy Whitney, he just waltzed in here 
                        off the street?

                                 IDA
                        Right off the street. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Christ, we’d need to watch that. I’ll talk 
                        to security downstairs.
                             (beat)
                        How’d it go with Rogers?
                                 IDA
                        Fraught, to say the least. But he didn’t 
                        deny any of it.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        When do you think we’ll have the next one? 

                                 IDA
                        Soon. I’m working on it.
                             (thinking)
                        We need to reshape the public perception of 
                        who Rockefeller is. I think people are so 
                        dazzled by his “business success”, they 
                        don’t want to believe that he could be 
                        corrupt. So we need to unmask him. Take 
                        away the silk hat and the leather gloves, 
                        and they’ll soon begin to see him for what 
                        he really is: a petty thug.

           A thought suddenly stops Ida in her tracks.

                                 IDA
                        Have you ever wondered what he looks like?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Who, Rogers?

                                 IDA
                        No! Rockefeller.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (shrugs)
                        I don’t know. I’ve read some descriptions, 
                        but has anyone actually seen him in person?

                                 IDA
                        Maybe it’s time we put a face on the devil. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        How? We can’t exactly ask him to sit for a 
                        portrait, now can we?

                                 IDA
                        He still goes out in public, doesn’t he?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Do you know where?

                                 IDA
                             (nods)
                        The First Congregation Baptist Church on 
                        Euclid Avenue. Every Sunday. Just like 
                        clockwork.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           Siddal sits nervously in a pew. Directly in front of him is 
           John D. Rockefeller, in a prayer cap and shawl. The 
           congregation sings, and Siddal tries gamely to sing along.

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        We send Siddal, with a photographer. Only 
                        they pretend not to know each other. 

           Across the aisle is another man, THE PHOTOGRAPHER. Siddal 
           looks over at him. Their eyes briefly meet.

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        After the ceremony, Siddal engages him for 
                        a brief second or two. Just long enough for 
                        the photographer to swoop in.

           EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           The service over, Rockefeller and Cettie greet well wishers 
           outside the church. Standing off to one side, and looking 
           conspicuously out of place, are two armed PINKERTON GUARDS 
           (Rockefeller’s private security detail).

           Siddal falls in line behind some others who wish to shake the 
           great man’s hand.  

           As his turn comes, Siddal steps up to meet Rockefeller.

                                 SIDDAL
                        Mr. Rockefeller? I’m Henry Stephens, I’m a 
                        cousin of your great Aunt Betty.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (thrown)
                        Oh. How is she? 

                                 SIDDAL
                        Very well, sir. She sends her kind regards 
                        to you and all the family.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Thank you.

           Suddenly they are interrupted by...

                                 THE PHOTOGRPAHER
                        Gentlemen, can you hold still please?

           And now Siddal purposely leans out of the way as the 
           photographer isolates Rockefeller. All done in an instant.

           And Poof! A magnesium flash explodes.
           And almost before the smoke has cleared, they’re gone. 
           Leaving Rockefeller slightly dazed and confused.

                                 CETTIE
                        Who was that man, dear?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (irritated)
                        I’ve no idea. Some cousin or other.

           Sensing trouble, Rockefeller nods to his GUARDS. One leads 
           Cettie away while the other gives chase to Siddal.

                                 PINKERTON GUARD
                        Mrs. Rockefeller, step this way please.

           Siddal and the photog quietly disappear into the crowd. The 
           GUARD gives chase, but there are too many bodies in the way.

           In the distance, he sees: a motorcar starting up. Siddal 
           climbs aboard and the car peels away. Mission accomplished.

           INT. DARK ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH DEVELOPING in a chemical bath. PULL 
           BACK TO REVEAL: McClure and JACCACI (Art Director) gazing at 
           it, waiting for an image to appear.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I don’t see anything. It’s not working.

                                 JACCACI
                        Just wait. Give it a minute.

           They both stare at it. Waiting. And then slowly, a ghostly 
           image of Rockefeller begins to appear.

                                 JACCACI
                        See? There he is.

           CLOSE ON: Rockefeller’s frozen expression. The dark scowl 
           making him look even more crabby and miserly.

           McClure stares at his face, fascinated.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        There you are you old goat. Good to finally 
                        see you.

           Jaccaci pulls it dripping from the tray, hangs it on a line.

                                 JACCACI
                        What do you want me to do with it?
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Bring it down to the printers when you’re 
                        ready. We’re going to pin and mount him. 
                        Like a butterfly.

           As we CUT TO a series of unhappy RAILROAD EXECUTIVES --

           INT. “ERIE LINE” CORPORATE HEAD OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: the stony face of JIM TEAGLE, CEO of the ERIE 
           Railway line. Ida sitting opposite him, notebook in hand.

                                 IDA
                        Mr. Teagle, your company paid out over $3 
                        million in “service fees” to Standard Oil 
                        over the last five years you’ve been in 
                        business with them.

           Ida hands him a document. He looks at it, impassive.

                                 JIM TEAGLE
                        Yes?

                                 IDA
                        Would that be a part of the special 
                        “rebates” that you were forced to give them 
                        in exchange for their business?

                                 JIM TEAGLE
                             (a tight smile)
                        All I’ll say is this: we are happy to have 
                        Standard Oil as our client, Miss Tarbell. 
                        Anything else, I’m afraid you will have to 
                        discuss with them.

           EXT. “NEW YORK RAILWAYS” CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

           Ida approaches another man, THOMAS FOWLER, as he tries to 
           exit the building without being seen.

                                 IDA
                        Mr. Fowler? Good Afternoon, sir.

                                 THOMAS FOWLER
                             (caught)
                        Afternoon, Miss Tarbell. 

                                 IDA
                        Is now a good time? 

                                 THOMAS FOWLER
                        I’m afraid not.

           He tries to get around her. Ida follows.
                                 IDA
                        I was just wondering if you’d like to make 
                        any comment about the rebates paid to 
                        Standard Oil by your company?

                                 THOMAS FOWLER
                             (stops; turns on her)
                        There were no rebates paid to Standard Oil, 
                        or anyone else. And I resent the 
                        implication. Good day, Miss Tarbell.

                        we are proud to do business with Standard 
                        Oil. But there were no rebates paid to them

                             (beat)
                        Word of advice, Miss Tarbell. Stick to 
                        writing about dead presidents. You’re good 
                        at that.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

           Ida approaches another man as he exits a building. Retired 
           Judge WILLIE HARKNESS (76), out for a walk with his dog.

                                 IDA
                        Judge Harkness? I’m Ida Tarbell, I work for 
                        McClure’s Magazine. I’m sorry to bother 
                        you, but I wonder if I could have a quick 
                        word with you.

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        What about?

                                 IDA
                        You wrote a report on shipping rates for 
                        the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1898.

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                             (surprised)
                        You read that?

                                 IDA
                        I read everything.
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER - DAY

           Ida walks through the park with the retired judge.

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        That report was commissioned by Martin 
                        Knapp, then Chairman of the ICC. Done to 
                        appease certain new political appointees.

                                 IDA
                        Was anything done with it?

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        No, of course not. Martin Knapp and John 
                        Rockefeller are old friends. 

           They come to a bench by the great lawn. Sit.

                                 IDA
                        The railway’s a public servant. Aren’t the 
                        shipping rates the same for everyone?

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        That’s what you would think. But Standard 
                        Oil demands lower shipping rates than the 
                        competition, or that railway loses their 
                        business. The independents can’t compete. 
                        They either join up or get squeezed out.

                                 IDA
                        Isn’t that illegal?

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        Of course it’s illegal. But you’ll never be 
                        able to prove it.

                                 IDA
                        But if there are different rates for 
                        different suppliers, surely there must be 
                        records of that somewhere?

                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        Standard Oil destroys all of their shipping 
                        records, very carefully. You don’t think 
                        that Johnny D would be associated with 
                        anything so unsavory, now do you? 
                             (beat)
                        The rebates are an open secret in the oil 
                        business. The railways don’t want to lose 
                        his business, and he knows that. So he cuts 
                        the rates so low it kills the competition. 
                        And you know why he gets away with it?

                                 IDA
                        Because he can?
                                 WILLIE HARKNESS
                        You’re not allowed to quote me.

           INT. 26 BROADWAY - ROGERS’ OFFICE - DAY

           A sour-looking Henry Rogers tosses Ida’s manuscript across 
           the desk at her. The mood is tense, confrontational. 

                                 ROGERS
                        You can’t print this because it’s not true. 
                        There were no “rebates” paid to the 
                        railroads or anyone else.

           Ida hands him another document.

                                 IDA
                        This is a report published by the ICC five 
                        years ago. It noted several payments by The 
                        New York Railways back to Standard Oil. 
                        What would you call those?

                                 ROGERS
                             (reflexively)
                        That was an accounting mistake, those 
                        payments were refunded once the mistake was 
                        discovered.

                                 IDA
                        Yes, but when I checked the court records, 
                        I discovered that it was you who had 
                        authorized those payments only two days 
                        before the state supreme court was to look 
                        into the case. I just thought the timing of 
                        it was rather curious, that’s all. 

           A beat. Rogers is growing tense, hot under the collar.

                                 ROGERS
                        And what are you suggesting?

                                 IDA
                        Nothing. Except that bribery of a public 
                        official and obstruction of justice are 
                        criminal offences in the eyes of the law.

                                 ROGERS
                             (a dark smile)
                        The way that Mr. Rockefeller and I do 
                        business is very different, I can assure 
                        you of that. 

                                 IDA
                        But you’ve been his partner for 45 years.
                                 ROGERS
                        And he would do me out of a dollar any day 
                        of the week! 
                             (hot, defensive)
                        Look, our company was built the way it was 
                        built because that’s what the times and the 
                        industry demanded. We didn’t do anything 
                        that others weren’t doing at the same time.

                                 IDA
                             (fishing)
                        Like blowing up the Buffalo Oil refinery?

           A long beat. Rogers is caught momentarily off guard.

                                 ROGERS
                        Where did you get that?

                                 IDA
                        Oh, I don’t know. Just a rumor I heard.

                                 ROGERS
                        And that’s all it is: a rumor. We never 
                        owned the Buffalo plant, and even if we 
                        did, why would we blow up our own plant? 

                                 IDA
                        I don’t know. But suppose you were only 
                        interested in the patent on their cooling 
                        technology. And that once you had acquired 
                        it, the plant had no further strategic use 
                        for you in the northeast. Boom! Insurance 
                        pays out, not your problem anymore.
                             (showing him a document)
                        This is your testimony before the 
                        Industrial Commerce Commission, denying any 
                        involvement in the Buffalo plant explosion.

                                 ROGERS
                        That’s right. Because we never owned it.

           Ida then calmly presents him with another document.

                                 IDA
                        And yet, here you are listed on a “Bill of 
                        Sale” - along with John Archbold and 
                        Ambrose MacGregor - acting as “agents of 
                        the Standard Oil Company” in purchasing the 
                        Buffalo Oil Refinery. That is your 
                        signature on there, isn’t it?

           Rogers examines the document. His entire face darkens.

                                 ROGERS
                             (coldly)
                        Where the hell did you get this?
                                 IDA
                        It’s a bookkeeping record. I found it. 
                             (beat)
                        Lying to me in your office is one thing, 
                        Mr. Rogers. Lying under oath to the ICC is 
                        another. 
                             (beat)
                        Of course, I don’t have to write about the 
                        Buffalo plant explosion. If you let me see 
                        the company shipping records.

           Rogers doesn’t move a muscle. A silent rage building inside 
           him.

                                 ROGERS
                        How dare you come in here and call me a 
                        liar. You’re trying to blackmail me.

                                 IDA
                        I’m trying to help you.

                                 ROGERS
                        You help me! Oh, that’s rich. From the 
                        first moment you walked in here, you have 
                        wanted to condemn me, and destroy this 
                        company. That’s not journalism, that’s 
                        anarchy. And it stops right here. Get out 
                        of my office.

                                 IDA
                        If I could just ask one more thing...

                                 ROGERS
                             (explodes)
                        Get out. Get out! GET OUT!!

                                 IDA
                             (crisply)
                        Thank you for your time, Mr. Rogers. I’ll 
                        be in touch.

           Ida leaves. Rogers slams the door on her, seething.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE PRINTING PRESSES ROLLING --

           Ida’s latest story coming out. We see the headline:

           “CUTTING TO KILL: STANDARD OIL CONTEMPT OF LAW”

           SUPERIMPOSE: February 1903.
           INT. KYKUIT - KITCHEN - DAY

           Cettie Rockefeller comes into the kitchen, surprising two 
           KITCHEN MAIDS who are reading McClure’s Magazine.

           She approaches silently, catching them both off guard.

                                 CETTIE
                        What are you reading?

           The maid lowers the magazine, casts her eyes downward.

                                 MAID
                        I’m sorry, m’am.  It was sitting right 
                        there. 

                                 CETTIE
                        Haven’t you got work to be doing?

                                 MAID
                        Yes, m’am.

                                 CETTIE
                        Then I suggest you get to it.

           The two maids scuttle away. Cettie picks up the magazine. 
           Looks at it. And seeing her husband’s face on the cover, a 
           look of horror washes over her...

           INT. KYKUIT - MASTER SUITE - DAY

           Rockefeller is putting on his shoes, getting dressed for the 
           day. A lazy Irish Wolfhound lounges at his feet. Cettie 
           enters, holding the magazine. Her face drained of color.

                                 CETTIE
                        Have you read this?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (not looking up)
                        No.

                                 CETTIE
                        Well, your entire staff has. Thought you 
                        might like to read it too.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Why should I?

                                 CETTIE
                        Perhaps you might learn something about 
                        yourself.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        People are free to write whatever they want 
                        about me. It doesn’t change anything.
                                 CETTIE
                             (sharply)
                        Except...public perception!

           Rockefeller stands to his full height. Adjusts his braces.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        As long as I’ve been in business, people 
                        have sought to destroy me. But they never 
                        could. So some journalist wants to have a 
                        go at me, get in line. Half the world wants 
                        to lynch me just for being successful, the 
                        other half wants a loan. And I say, to hell 
                        with them all!

           He goes into the bathroom. Cettie looms in the doorway, 
           watching him. Her face and tone softens a little.

                                 CETTIE
                        I know how hard you’ve worked to build the 
                        company, and I know how hard you’ve tried 
                        to protect me from understanding it. But I 
                        know this much: the times are changing, 
                        John. You lose the public trust, and you 
                        may not be able to get it back. 
                             (re: the magazine)
                        This...this is only the beginning.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (bitterly)
                        Nobody complained when I brought light into 
                        their homes, or provided thousands of men 
                        with jobs. Oil is what this country runs 
                        on, Cettie, and I gave it to them. I have 
                        nobody to answer to but my creator.

                                 CETTIE
                             (quietly)
                        And...Ida Tarbell.

           Rockefeller slowly raises one hand to silence her.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I don’t want to hear that woman’s name 
                        mentioned in this house again. 

           He sweeps past her, pulling on his jacket. Cettie looks at 
           him, something she desperately needs to ask him.

                                 CETTIE
                        Is it true, John?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Is what true?

                                 CETTIE
                        All of this.
           His silence fills the room, giving her the answer.

                                 CETTIE
                             (pained)
                        It’s not just your reputation, you know. 
                        It’s our reputation. Your son’s reputation. 
                        I don’t want this going on. I want it 
                        stopped, John. I want it stopped.

           She nods and leaves the room. We hold on Rockefeller’s face, 
           his expression dark and dangerous.

           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - DAY

           McClure is sitting opposite two conservative-looking 
           EXECUTIVES, both of them looking very unhappy.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I don’t understand, why the sudden change 
                        of heart?

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Have you seen the New York Times today?

           He slides the newspaper across the table at Sam. 

           INSERT CARTOON: It shows Ida wielding a huge bow and arrow 
           (in the shape of a pen) trained right at Rockefeller’s Heart. 

           McClure smiles, pretends like he hasn’t seen it.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Isn’t that something!

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        I’ll be honest with you, Mr. McClure, we 
                        just don’t like the direction this is going.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (cheery, upbeat)
                        Well, I’m sorry that you feel that way, but 
                        obviously, I think you’re making a big 
                        mistake. Our sales are booming. Circulation 
                        is up 50% in the last month alone.

           The execs are unmoved. Their body language says it all.

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        Look Sam, we sell sheet metal. Standard Oil 
                        is our biggest customer. Now what would we 
                        do if they were to boycott us?

           Sam taps a pencil on his desk. But he has no answer.
           INT. OFFICES OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Elsewhere in the office, PIERCE and LOWRY, (the two junior 
           writers) are reading aloud some of their notices...

                                 LOWRY
                        Listen to this: “...as racy as any novel, 
                        with more romance than the usual business 
                        profile, Miss Tarbell has once again beaten 
                        upon facts, rather than a gong...” 

                                 PIERCE
                        The New York Times: “Is the Pen mightier 
                        than the Moneybag? Ida Tarbell of McClures 
                        Magazine seems to think so...”

           As if on cue, Ida wanders past, just arriving at the office.

                                 LOWRY
                        Hey Ida. Congratulations, you’re famous! 
                        Even got your own cartoon.

           But before she can even answer, MCCLURE pokes his head out of 
           his door. He doesn’t look happy.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Miss Tarbell! In my office.

           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ida enters, sees: five large sacks of mail on the floor.

                                 IDA
                        What’s all this?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        They’re for you. And there’s three more of 
                        ‘em down in basement. The porter refuses to 
                        carry any more up here.

           A beat. Sam rubs his neck, stressed.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’ve lost three advertisers already this 
                        month, another one just now. All of them 
                        scared of offending the big tycoon.

                                 IDA
                        So what? We’ll find others.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Oh, will we now? Just like that? Like 
                        pulling apples off a tree.
                             (beat)
                        Listen. I have personally invested 
                        everything I own into this magazine. 
                                 IDA
                        And you think I haven’t? 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’m talking about business here. Profit and 
                        loss. Even Robin Hood had to pay his merry 
                        men. What the hell do you even know about 
                        publishing anyway? You’re just a writer!

           The irony of this comment strikes Ida as funny. She laughs.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’m glad you’re so amused. Maybe you’ll 
                        also find these funny.

           He hands Ida a bunch of threatening letters he has received. 
           Ida briefly scans them, totally unfazed.

                                 IDA
                             (joking)
                        He can’t even spell the word “strangle.” 
                        How dangerous could he really be?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (serious)
                        They’re a huge corporation, Ida. I’m just a 
                        little guy, trying to sell a few extra 
                        magazine subscriptions. 

           Ida points to the sacks of reader mail filling the office.

                                 IDA
                        And who do you think they are? They’re the 
                        little guy, just like you. And they’ve had 
                        to fight and scrap and starve for every 
                        morsel that they get. But they’re also 
                        tired of being pushed around by these 
                        Robber Barons. They’re tired of playing 
                        with a loaded dice in a rigged game that 
                        they can never win.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (pause)
                        This is insane. I can’t believe you ever 
                        talked me into this.

                                 IDA
                        You’re the one who hired me!

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Jesus Christ. I didn’t want to start a 
                        revolution. Just a better seat in a 
                        restaurant and a couple of extra bucks.

                                 IDA
                             (calmly)
                        And we’ll get it, I promise you. 
                                 IDA (CONT'D)
                        We can bring these people to their knees. 
                        And then you can own the restaurant.
                             (beat)
                        You’re doing the right thing here, Mr. 
                        McClure.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Great. Remind me of that when I’m filing 
                        for bankruptcy, will you?
                             (beat)
                        Haven’t you got some work to do?

           He shoos her away like a fly. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (re: sacks of mail)
                        And take those bloody things with you!
                             (calling off)
                        PHILLIPS!

           EXT. KYKUIT - DAY

           A HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE pulls up at the front door of Kykuit. 
           A PORTER stands, waiting to receive HENRY ROGERS as he climbs 
           briskly out with his briefcase. 

           INT. KYKUIT - PRIVATE DEN - FOLLOWING

           Rogers stands before Rockefeller. Weekly briefing session.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You’re late.

                                 ROGERS
                        Driver lost a wheel on the way up here. 
                        Couldn’t be helped, I’m afraid.

           A beat.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        How many times have you met with that 
                        woman, Miss Tar-barrel?

                                 ROGERS
                             (quickly)
                        We never discussed anything --

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        That wasn’t the question. How many times 
                        did you meet with her?

                                 ROGERS
                        A few times. I knew her father back in 
                        Titusville. She wanted to learn about our 
                        history, so I...humored her a little.
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I’m told that on three separate occasions, 
                        she came to see you at your office. What 
                        did you discuss?

                                 ROGERS
                        This and that. Nothing very important.
                        Look, she was going to write about us 
                        anyway, so I thought maybe I could help 
                        steer the conversation a little.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        In order to steer, Mr. Rogers, one first 
                        needs to be able to drive. The trouble with 
                        you is, you’re much better at talking.

                                 ROGERS
                        I can assure you, I won’t be meeting with 
                        her again.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You know why I’m successful, Mr. Rogers? 
                        Because I keep a low profile. I don’t seek 
                        out attention, and I certainly don’t go 
                        blowing my own trumpet in front of a 
                        journalist just to make myself feel more 
                        important.   

           ON ROGERS, embarrassed.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        This whole business with McClure’s, it’s 
                        upsetting to my wife. 

                                 ROGERS
                        Yes, sir. I understand.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        What would you do if someone was upsetting 
                        your wife?

                                 ROGERS
                        Well, I...I’d want it stopped.

           A beat.

                                 ROCKEFELLER 
                        Then do it.

           EXT. THE CENTURY CLUB - NIGHT

           A discreet BRASS SIGN lit by two gaslights is all that 
           identifies the entrance to this elite all-male SOCIAL CLUB.
           INT. THE CENTURY CLUB - SMOKING ROOM - NIGHT

           DISCOVER SAM MCCLURE - at a table, playing poker with a half-
           dozen or so other young New York hotshots. He is looking 
           slightly the worse for drink and a poor run of cards.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’ll see your twenty, and I’ll raise you 
                        fifty. 

                                 PLAYER #1
                             (uneasy)
                        Sam, come on, we’re playing for sport.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Sport or not, if I’m going to be fleeced by 
                        a bandit, I’d rather I see his face.

           REVEAL: three other gentlemen at another table paying very 
           close attention to the game. They are watching McClure.

           The cards are dealt, and Sam takes his in hand. It’s a losing 
           hand, but still he bets more. Tension rising. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Fifty.

           Sam pushes out his chips, all in. Of the remaining three 
           players, all but one folds. Just him and Sam head to head. 

                                 DEALER
                        Gentlemen, cards?

           Sam reveals his hand: a weak two pairs. The other guy lays 
           down a house. Smiles. He reaches out to claim his winnings.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (drunken smile)
                        Well, there we are then. If luck be a lady, 
                        she can also be a vengeful whore.
                             (rising)
                        Gentlemen, if you’ll excuse me...

           McClure rises, staggers off in the direction of the toilets. 
           After a moment, we see the other men get up and follow.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           McClure is at the urinal when three other “gentlemen” enter 
           the bathroom. One of them discreetly locks the door. 

           McClure zips up, goes to leave. Two men block his path. 

                                 GENTLEMAN #1
                        Where do you think you’re going?
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Home. Excuse me.

                                 GENTLEMAN #2
                        Not so fast, McClure.

           In an instant, they’re upon him, pinning him roughly up 
           against the wall. The third man approaches, and grabs him 
           violently by the testicles. Squeezing.

                                 GENTLEMAN #3
                        Think you’re a big man now, do you? Well, 
                        you don’t seem so big to me.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (terrified)
                        Hey! What is this? Get offa me! I pay my 
                        debts. 

                                 GENTLEMAN #3
                        Yeah, but you’re not so good at minding 
                        your own business, are you? You and that 
                        nosy little bitch would want to be a bit 
                        more careful. Telling lies about people can 
                        get you into a whole lot of trouble. 

           Suddenly, he is sucker punched in the gut. Another glancing 
           blow to the head, and he’s down on the floor.

                                 GENTLEMAN #1
                        Stay away from Standard Oil, McClure. Or 
                        the next time we might not be so friendly. 

           Before they go, one of them kicks him in the stomach for good 
           measure. 

                                 GENTLEMAN #1
                        That one’s for Ida.

           EXT. CENTURY CLUB - NIGHT

           Two beefy SECURITY GUARDS bodily carry McClure out the front 
           door of the club. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Hey! I am a member of this club! I know my 
                        rights!

           And toss him unceremoniously into a fountain... 

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - THAT SAME NIGHT

           Ida stands in the stairwell of her third floor walk-up, 
           paying the LANDLADY her weekly rent. 
                                 IDA
                        The tap in my bathroom is leaking again.

                                 LANDLADY
                        I’ll send George up to have a look. 
                        Probably just needs another washer.

           The landlady turns to go, then stops, remembering something.

                                 LANDLADY
                        Oh. There was a gentleman called here for 
                        you the other day. 

                                 IDA
                        Did he leave a name?

                                 LANDLADY
                        No. No name. Tall fellow, skinny. I told 
                        him you were at work.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you, Mrs. Hammond. If he shows up 
                        here again, please let me know. 
                             (beat)
                        Also, I specifically asked you not to put 
                        my name on the mailbox outside. Please can 
                        you take it down.

                                 LANDLADY
                             (not remotely interested)
                        Whatever you say. Good night, Miss Tarbell.

                                 IDA
                        Goodnight, Mrs. Hammond.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - FOLLOWING

           Ida closes the door, double locking it. She stands there a 
           moment, as a vague unease settles over her.

           Whatever the feeling, she quickly shakes off.

           ANGLE - LATER

           We see where Ida has set up an office in her spare bedroom. 
           Crammed floor to ceiling with her books and typewriter. She 
           is typing up her notes, a cat curled at her feet.

           When suddenly, there is a tremendous CRASH!!

           Followed by glass spraying across the floor. 

           The cat darts for cover, and Ida dives onto the floor. 

           We hear a RUMBLE OF BOOTS in the alleyway outside.
           Looking up, she sees a large rock, with a note tied to it.

           ON THE NOTE: “STOP NOW BITCH. OR ELSE.”

           EXT. GATES OF KYKUIT - DAY

           A group of JOURNALISTS are camped outside the gates of 
           Kykuit. A MOTORCAR approaches, heading into the estate. The 
           men all clamor towards it, hoping for a sighting or a quote. 

                                 VOICES (AD-LIB)
                        Mr. Rockefeller, how do you respond to the 
                        allegations in McClure’s Magazine...any 
                        comment about the secret kickbacks from the 
                        railroads...Mr. Rockefeller...?

           As the car sweeps past, we see it’s not Rockefeller in the 
           back, but his son JOHN JUNIOR and his wife ABBY.

           EXT. KYKUIT - FRONT DOOR - DAY

           The car pulls up and the young couple climb out. 

           They are greeted by JOE DEVEREUX (50’s), the father’s 
           personal secretary. He is a pinched-looking Irishman, loyal 
           servant to the old man.

                                 DEVEREUX
                        Welcome home, Mr. Rockefeller. How was the 
                        honeymoon, sir?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Fine, thanks Joe. Is my father here?

                                 DEVEREUX
                        Yes, but he’s in conference with Mr. 
                        Rogers. He doesn’t wish to be disturbed.

                                 JUNIOR
                        And my mother?

                                 DEVEREUX
                        Upstairs. In the library.

                                 JUNIOR
                             (re: suitcases)
                        Take these up to the carriage house, will 
                        you Joe?
                             (to Abby)
                        I’ll be up in a few minutes.

           Junior strides inside the house.
           INT. KYKUIT - LIBRARY - DAY

           Junior paces around the room like a caged animal. Deeply 
           upset. His mother stands before him, trying to placate him.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Just let me talk to him.

                                 CETTIE
                        You’re upset. I understand that. But 
                        please, try to calm yourself.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why won’t he answer these...these lies! 
                        That’s what they are. And by saying 
                        nothing, it just makes him look worse.

                                 CETTIE
                        He will answer. But in his own way, and his 
                        own time. Your father will not be told how 
                        to conduct his business.

           A knock at the door, Devereux entering...

                                 DEVEREUX
                        Mr. Rockefeller, sir, your wife is asking--

                                 JUNIOR
                             (abrupt)
                        Not now, Joe!

                                 CETTIE
                        Just give us a moment. Thanks Joseph.

           Catching a whiff, Devereux beats a hasty exit.

                                 JUNIOR
                        It’s an assassination, that’s what it is. 
                        My God, they’re trying to ruin him. And us!

                                 CETTIE
                        Nobody is going to ruin us. If we stand 
                        together.

                                 JUNIOR
                             (a dark laugh)
                        Boy, she really nailed him, didn’t she? The 
                        money mad old fool and his fading empire. 
                        Duping widows out of their fortunes, 
                        bulldozing the railroads into the ground.

                                 CETTIE
                        Stop it.

                                 JUNIOR
                        But I’m the one who has to show his face on 
                        Wall Street Monday morning. 
                                 JUNIOR (CONT'D)
                        It wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t share his 
                        name. Christ, whose idea of a sick joke was 
                        that?

           Suddenly, she slaps him across the face. Hard.

           It shocks them both.

                                 CETTIE
                        Stop it. Stop this nonsense! You will not 
                        speak that way about my husband.
                             (fierce)
                        Your father is the king of kings. And you, 
                        are the son of the king of kings. And you 
                        must never do or say anything that would 
                        tarnish that crown, do you understand me?

           Silence. He just nods.

                                 CETTIE
                        Now go and look after your wife, and I will 
                        look after my husband.

                                 JUNIOR
                             (contrite)
                        I’m sorry. I spoke out of turn.

                                 CETTIE
                        Yes you did. You most certainly did.

           He leaves the room. HOLD on Cettie, fighting back tears.

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Ida follows Sam McClure through the main office floor. 

           REVEAL: Sam has a BLACKENED EYE. 

                                 IDA
                        It’s a free press and a free country!

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Like hell it is. That shitheel could have 
                        us both killed in the morning and the world 
                        would simply shrug. That was just a warning 
                        shot.

                                 IDA
                        So what, you’re going to just give up now? 
                        What kind of a man does that make you?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        A very sensible one! 

           Sam enters his office; Ida follows him in. Some other faces 
           in the office lean back in their chairs, watching.
           INT. MCCLURE’S OFFICE - FOLLOWING

                                 IDA
                        Mr. McClure, we have a responsibility--

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (angrily)
                        And I have a responsibility! To my 
                        investors. To my wife. To the fourteen 
                        people out there who depend on me for their 
                        livelihood. I’m talking about jobs here, 
                        food on the table. This is not a game!

           A beat, then:

                                 IDA
                        Why do you think those men attacked you? 
                        Why do you think I have not been sued for 
                        libel, or kidnapped or even worse? 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Don’t hold your breath...

                                 IDA
                        We’ve got him. And he knows it. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Oh, really? What have we got? So he’s a 
                        rich guy and he likes to win. That still 
                        doesn’t make him a criminal.

                                 IDA
                        What about the price fixing, the secret 
                        kickbacks from the railroads, the sabotage. 
                        That’s not illegal?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Show me the documents that prove it.

           She doesn’t have them, and she knows it.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Look, I don’t like him any more than you 
                        do. But let’s be reasonable here. If we 
                        keep on publishing like this, it starts to 
                        look like personal vendetta. Next thing you 
                        know, you’ve got people feeling sorry for 
                        him, while we’re out of business! You’ve 
                        made your point, now let’s move on.

                                 IDA
                        Move on? He is a liar, a cheat and a 
                        hypocrite! Going to church on Sunday just 
                        so he can destroy his enemies with impunity 
                        on Monday. 
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Why are you making this personal? It’s not.

                                 IDA
                        It’s always personal...to somebody!

           McClure goes to a drinks cabinet, pours himself a stiff one. 
           Ida is silent for a moment, ruminating. And then:

                                 IDA
                        “Sic Semper Tyrannis.”

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        What?

                                 IDA
                        Sic Semper Tyrannis. Death to all tyrants. 
                        That’s what John Wilkes Booth said when he 
                        shot Lincoln. But that never sat well with 
                        me, because Lincoln was never a tyrant. He 
                        was a liberator.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Oh, so now you’re Abe Lincoln?!

                                 IDA
                             (deeply)
                        No, I’m not that smart or that able. But 
                        thanks to you, I now have a voice. And I 
                        think I speak for a lot of people who are 
                        sick and tired of being pushed around by a 
                        gang of nameless faceless corporate 
                        bullies. Not only does Rockefeller want to 
                        win, but he wants everyone else to lose. 
                        That’s what I call tyranny.

           McClure looks at her.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You’re not going to stop this, are you?

                                 IDA
                        Not when we’re this close. We’ve got him on 
                        the run, now let’s finish him.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        How?

                                 IDA
                             (thinks)
                        Rockefeller controls the oil industry 
                        because he bullies the railroads into 
                        giving him cheaper shipping rates. Rates 
                        that allow him to crush the competition. 
                        Now let’s assume for a second that 
                        somewhere there’s a record of those 
                        shipping rates. 
                                 IDA (CONT'D)
                        Then all we need to do is find them. 
                        There’s your direct link to criminal 
                        activity. And nobody is above the law, 
                        including John D. Rockefeller.

           A beat, then:

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Two more months. Then I’m done with 
                        Rockefeller, and so are you. In the 
                        meantime, we are beefing up security around 
                        here. No more random “visitors.”

           Ida nods. Then she hands McClure her latest article.

                                 IDA
                        I have a train to catch. Print this, if you 
                        want to punch back.

           Ida heads out.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Where the hell are you going?

                                 IDA
                        Cleveland, to look for proof. And I’m 
                        taking Siddal with me.

           She’s out the door. He knocks back his Scotch, before 
           anxiously looking at Ida’s next article. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE 
                             (quietly, to himself)
                        Sic Semper Tyrannis.

           INT. MOVING TRAIN - DAY

           Ida and Siddal ride on a train to Cleveland. Ida is staring 
           absently out the window, Siddal sitting opposite reading the 
           newspaper. After a moment, another PASSENGER approaches. 

                                 PASSENGER
                        I’m sorry to disturb...but are you Ida 
                        Tarbell?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. I am.

                                 PASSENGER
                        Would you mind? It’s for my wife, she’s a 
                        big fan of yours. We both are.

           He hands her a copy of McClure’s to sign. Ida is surprised to 
           be recognized in public like this. Uncomfortable with the 
           attention. Nevertheless, she signs, hands back the magazine.
           Siddal watches all of this with wry amusement. 

                                 IDA
                        What?

                                 SIDDAL
                        Nothing.
                             (then, teasing)
                        “Miss Tarbell, I am such a big fan of yours. 
                        Would you mind signing my newspaper?” 

                                 IDA
                        Why, certainly sir.

           Ida takes his newspaper and playfully whacks him over the 
           head with it. A beat, then:

                                 IDA
                        John, I want to thank you.

                                 SIDDAL
                        What for?

                                 IDA
                        For being a good friend to me. I couldn’t 
                        do any of this without you. You know that, 
                        don’t you?

                                 SIDDAL
                             (smiles)
                        I know.

           Together, they ride in silence.

           INT. 320 LEXINGTON - LOBBY OF MCCLURES - DAY

           A MAN in a shabby raincoat (we will later come to know him as 
           BEN LUDLOW) enters the building. He looks haggard, unkempt. 
           And in this moment, he is also quite obviously intoxicated. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Can I help you?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        Does Ida Tarbell work here? 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Who?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        Ida Tarbell, she writes for McClure’s 
                        magazine. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                             (suspicious)
                        I’m sorry, you must have the wrong address.
                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        I just want to talk to her.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Well, she ain’t here. Now go on...
                             (nods to the door)
                        Get outta here! Before I call the cops.

           Ludlow lurches off. The security guard shakes his head.

           INT. KYKUIT - PRIVATE DEN - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: THE COVER OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE. And the headline:

                      “THE BUFFALO CASE” by Ida M. Tarbell

                               September 1904.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL...Rockefeller alone in his den, reading. 
           His expression is blank, no emotion readable on his face.

           When he is finished reading, he rises from his chair and 
           tosses the magazine into the fire. He watches as it burns, 
           the flame casting an eerie yellow glow over his face.

           INT. KYKUIT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Rockefeller stands at the head of a long mahogany table. 
           Seated around the table is a collection of his minions, 
           including Rogers, Junior, and a new man MR. GATES (50’s). 

           The room is cloaked in semi-darkness, reflecting the Oil 
           Baron’s blackened mood and somber tone.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I will not allow the tedious ramblings of 
                        an hysterical petticoat to change the way 
                        that we do business at Standard Oil.

                                 JUNIOR
                        The stockholders in New York are getting 
                        very nervous. If we don’t put out a 
                        statement right now--

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (sharply)
                        There won’t be any statement. We do not 
                        comment on the salacious gossip of a third-
                        rate no-name magazine. By engaging with 
                        them, we only legitimize them. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        You’re wrong. 

           A beat. All heads turn to the younger Rockefeller.
                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m sorry, but this is different. We need 
                        to fight back. We need to do something.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I said...I will handle this.

                                 MR. GATES
                             (nervously)
                        Mr. Rockefeller, if I may. A carefully 
                        worded press release, or perhaps an op-ed 
                        piece in The Times might allay people’s 
                        fears. If we can’t stop the discussion, we 
                        can at least try to “manage” its direction.

           Rockefeller gazes imperiously at this puny little man.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Who are you, sir?

                                 MR. GATES
                        Frederick Gates. Of the Gates-Harriman 
                        Public Relations firm in New York.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I invited him here, for his expertise. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (a sneer)
                        Since when did one need to have “relations” 
                        with the public? I’ve been in business for 
                        over 40 years without the need for public 
                        relations. Forty years! And now these sewer 
                        dwellers...these vultures...these 
                        PARASITES...want to pick over every detail 
                        of my business. How dare they!

           Absolute silence. Nobody looks at Rockefeller.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Everyone please leave. 

           One by one, the men get up and file solemnly out of the room.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Not you, John.

           Now it’s just father and son. Alone together. Finally:

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Don’t ever contradict me in public again.

                                 JUNIOR
                             (anguished)
                        Why won’t you say something? That woman is 
                        turning you into a monster, and you just 
                        sit there and do nothing! 
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I don’t see how this concerns you.

                                 JUNIOR
                             (incredulous)
                        Does not concern me?! Yesterday, I had a 
                        man come up to me in the street because he 
                        overhead my name being called by a driver. 
                        And do you know what he did? He spat in my 
                        face, with hatred. That’s what people think 
                        of your name. And mine.

           Rockefeller gazes at his son, baffled by the raw emotion.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You have a secure job, an executive title, 
                        you have money, and still you’re not happy.

                                 JUNIOR
                             (tortured)
                        Because it’s your money, it’s your name! I 
                        never asked for any of it, and I didn’t 
                        earn it. Do you know what I do all day long 
                        on Wall Street? I devise clever ways in 
                        which to hide money from the government. 
                        Your money. And you know what, there’s so 
                        goddamn much of it, that I can’t keep up.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Don’t use that language with me, boy. You 
                        know I can’t stand that language.

                                 JUNIOR
                        How much is enough? What good is all the 
                        money in the world, if people hate us just 
                        for having it?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        And what would you have me do instead? Just 
                        give it all away? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Yes! Exactly! Give it away. We don’t need 
                        it. Why not let somebody else have the use 
                        of it for a change?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You’re my son, and when I’m gone, it will 
                        all be yours. And when you’re gone, it will 
                        be the turn of your children, and their 
                        children’s children. 

           Rockefeller goes to embrace Junior, but Junior shrugs him 
           off, and walks past him towards the door. Stops, turns.
                                 JUNIOR
                        But that’s just it. I don’t want it! I’m 
                        not you. And I don’t want to be like you.

           Junior storms out. Rockefeller watches as he goes, a touch of 
           sadness behind the cold eyes. For the very first time, he 
           appears hurt. Personally affected.

           EXT. CLEVELAND - DAY

           Ida & Siddal are on foot, going door to door in residential 
           neighborhoods.

           Door #1: A stately townhouse. Ida knocks, and Judge Martin 
           Knapp answers. (We recognize him from an earlier snatch.)

                                 IDA
                        Mr. Knapp?

                                 KNAPP
                        Yes?

                                 IDA
                        Judge Martin Knapp?

                                 KNAPP
                        I’m retired now. Who are you?

                                 IDA
                        Hello sir, I’m Ida Tarbell. This is John 
                        Siddal. We work for McClure’s magazine in 
                        New York.

           Knapp stares back at them. Not happy.

                                 IDA
                        I just wanted to ask you some questions 
                        about your role as Chairman of the ICC. 
                        When I spoke with Willie Harkness in New 
                        York, he said that you had --

                                 KNAPP
                        You’ve got some nerve coming here. You 
                        people ought to be ashamed of yourselves, 
                        destroying a good man’s reputation like 
                        that. You think you’re so smart, but you 
                        don’t know a goddamn thing about anything.

                                 IDA
                        Judge Knapp, if I could just ask you about 
                        this report you had commissioned --

                                 KNAPP
                        You're invading my privacy, and the privacy 
                        of my family. 
                                 KNAPP (CONT'D)
                        If you don’t leave, I’ll sue you and that 
                        gossip rag of a magazine you work for.
                             (beat)
                        Get off my property. 

           SLAM! Ida and Siddal just stand there. Share a look.

           Door #2: Ida knocks. A sweet old lady peers out at them.

                                 IDA
                        Mrs. Peterson?

                                 OLD LADY
                        Yes?

                                 IDA
                        Hello, I’m Ida Tarbell, this is John 
                        Siddal. We’re from McClure’s Magazine in 
                        New York. I hate to bother you at home, but 
                        is your husband here? Mr. Arnold Peterson?

                                 OLD LADY
                        My husband is dead. He died five years ago.

                                 IDA
                             (oops)
                        I’m terribly sorry.

           Slam!

           Door #3: A tired middle-aged woman. Angry barking dog.

                                 IDA
                        Miss Wilkinson?

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                        Yes?

                                 IDA
                        We’re from McClure’s magazine, and we’re 
                        doing a story on Standard Oil. I wonder if 
                        we could speak to you for just a minute.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                             (yanking the dog)
                        Buster, no! 
                             (to Ida)
                        I know who you are, and I know what you’re 
                        doing. But that doesn’t mean I’ll talk to 
                        you. Round here, people have to actually 
                        work for a living, and jobs are hard to 
                        come by. Standard Oil employs a whole lot 
                        of people in Cleveland, and most of them 
                        would rather not starve.
                                 IDA
                        You worked in the accounting department, is 
                        that correct?

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                        I’m sorry. Can’t help you.

           CUT TO:  A WHOLE SERIES OF FACES NOW

           In quick succession, standing in doorways. Current or former 
           employees of Standard Oil. Nothing in common but their fear.

           All shake their heads “no.” Not willing to talk on or even 
           off the record about Standard Oil.

           Feeling dejected, Ida and Siddal turn to go.

                                 SIDDAL
                        I never knew that being a writer could make 
                        you so scary.

                                 IDA
                        But it’s not us they’re afraid of, is it?

                                 SIDDAL
                        So what do we do now?

                                 IDA
                        I have no idea.

           INT. RESTAURANT - ST. DENIS HOTEL - NEW YORK - DAY

           Sam McClure sits in a private booth, anxiously checking his 
           watch. Finally, Ida plops down opposite, looking exhausted.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You’re late. How was Cleveland?

                                 IDA
                        Terrible. A mysterious epidemic of amnesia 
                        has broken out. “I don’t remember, I can’t 
                        recall, it was a long time ago...”

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Getting tired of it?

           A waiter glides in, smiles warmly at Ida (thinking she’s one 
           of Sam’s mistresses). This is not lost on Ida.

                                 WAITER
                        Something to drink for the lady?

                                 IDA
                        I’ll have whatever he’s having.
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Scotch and soda. Easy on the soda. 

           The waiter disappears. McClure slides a folder across the 
           table at Ida.

                                 SAM MCCLURE (CONT’D)
                        Well, this ought to cheer you up.

           As Ida flicks through the file.

                                 SAM MCCLURE (CONT’D)
                        We received an anonymous “tip” of a William 
                        Avery Rockefeller, 93 years of age, living 
                        on a chicken farm in Sioux Falls North 
                        Dakota. A reporter at the Plain Dealer 
                        checked it out. It’s the real deal. 

                                 IDA
                        His father? But I thought he was dead?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Alive and kicking. Only out there he’s 
                        known as “Doctor” William Livingston, and 
                        guess what? 

                                 IDA
                        He’s not a doctor.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (nods)
                        It seems Rockefeller Père is a snake-oil 
                        salesman, with a criminal record as long as 
                        my arm. Guns, liquor, whores. He even 
                        killed an Indian. Now how would that go 
                        over at the Church picnic, do you think? 

           Ida thinks on it a second, then closes the file.

                                 IDA
                        That’s great. But we can’t use it.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Why not?

                                 IDA
                        Because it’s gossip. Print that and we’d 
                        lose all credibility. The story I’m writing 
                        is called a “History of the Standard Oil 
                        Company.” Not some crazy chicken farmer!

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Your call. I was only trying to help.

           The waiter returns with their drinks. A beat, then:
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You know, my wife thinks we’re having an 
                        affair.

           It hangs there for a moment, like a question mark.

                                 IDA
                             (arch)
                        What ever gave her that idea, I wonder. I’m 
                        not a poet. Or is it a “poetess”?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You’re referring to Miss Wilkinson I’m 
                        sure, but we’re not involved any more.

                                 IDA
                             (mock surprise)
                        Oh? And whose turn is it this month?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (chastened)
                        You don’t approve, do you Miss Tarbell. I 
                        can feel your reproachful gaze upon me like 
                        a cold wind in August.

                                 IDA
                        I respect a man’s wedding vows, even if he 
                        does not.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Are you always this hard on men? I’m 
                        beginning to think that you don’t like us 
                        very much.

                                 IDA
                             (smiles)
                        On the contrary. I happen to love men. I 
                        prefer their company over women.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Oh? Why’s that?

                                 IDA
                        Maybe it’s because they always appear to 
                        have more fun than we do.

           A pause. McClure pulls out a letter from his inside pocket, 
           hands it to Ida.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Well, try this for fun. I received a letter 
                        from the Attorney General’s Office in 
                        Washington D.C. Reminding us of our 
                        obligation to the privacy protection act. 
                                 IDA
                        I guess a lot of money will buy you a lot 
                        friends.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You’ve got one more month to make your case 
                        on Rockefeller. Frankly, I’m amazed that he 
                        hasn’t sued us already. Do you think he’s 
                        even reading?

                                 IDA
                        I don’t know. But I can tell you who is.

           Ida pulls out a letter of her own, hands it to McClure. Waits 
           for his reaction. He looks up at her, absolutely stunned.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You’re joking me?
                             (Ida shakes her head)
                        When?

                                 IDA
                        This Friday.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Does he mention me in here at all?
                        It is my name on the cover after all...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           TEDDY ROOSEVELT, striding towards us, big smile. At only 46 
           years of age, the 26th President of the United States is a 
           vigorous young man, exuding an air of rugged masculinity.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Miss Tarbell, welcome! What an absolute 
                        pleasure it is to meet you. 

           He pumps Ida’s hand vigorously, a little too vigorously.

                                 IDA
                        Mr. President. The pleasure is mine.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Please, call me Colonel, or Theodore. We 
                        don’t get too hung up on titles around 
                        here. Come on in...
                             (to his butler)
                        George, have them set up lunch now.

           He ushers her inside the Oval Office.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        So, how do you like my little office?
                                 IDA
                             (awed)
                        It’s...it’s beautiful.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        And it’s even got a view. Not too bad, eh? 
                        For a lowly Governor of New York.

           Ida’s eyes are drawn to the huge portrait of Lincoln on the 
           wall (her idol). She stands in awe before it. 

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        How would you like that face looking over 
                        your shoulder every day? It’s no wonder I 
                        have indigestion. Please, have a seat...

           Ida sits on the edge of a sofa. She’s nervous, but hides it 
           very well. No idea why she’s been summoned here.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Thank you for coming today. I just thought 
                        we should have a chance to meet in private. 
                        Before you became too famous, that is. You 
                        know, you’re the first woman I’ve met with 
                        as president.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you, I’m greatly honored.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        I’ve been following your series on 
                        Rockefeller with great interest. I must 
                        confess, I never thought I would live to 
                        see the day when a journalist could become 
                        more powerful than the richest man in the 
                        world. A woman with a typewriter is a very 
                        dangerous thing.

                                 IDA
                             (a smile)
                        Imagine what we could do with a vote.

           Roosevelt laughs politely. Unsure how to take this.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        I have written a few books myself, you 
                        know, though I don’t have your command of 
                        the English language. Here, I wanted you to 
                        have this. A little souvenir of your visit.

           He offers her a signed copy of one of his naval books.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you, Colonel. I will treasure it.
                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Don’t worry, I don’t expect you to read it. 
                        Nobody else has. 

           A knock at the door, the butler entering--

                                 BUTLER
                        Mr. President, lunch is served.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                             (standing)
                        Come on, let’s have a bite, shall we?

           He leads Ida into the presidential dining room, where lunch 
           for two is set up. As “informal” as lunch can be when one is 
           dining alone with the president. A waiter removes the silver 
           domes on their plates, revealing some dark looking meat. 

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Wild venison. Shot it myself over Christmas 
                        in Vermont. Do you like venison?

                                 IDA
                             (lying)
                        Love it, thanks.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        So...you’ve been coming down pretty hard on 
                        old Rockefeller.

                                 IDA
                        Not unfairly, I hope. I try to present the 
                        facts as I find them. I want the reader to 
                        make up his own mind.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        And he has. Emphatically.

           A waiter silently pours Ida some water.

                                 IDA
                        Thank you.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        As you probably know, Miss Tarbell, this is 
                        a very important year for me. I’m up for re-
                        election in eight months, and if I get a 
                        second term, I want to set up a new 
                        Department of Labor And Commerce. It will 
                        give us broader powers to investigate the 
                        trusts. But before I do that, I need to get 
                        this Elkins bill through congress. Are you 
                        familiar with the bill?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. The anti-trust legislation.
                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        It’s not an easy sell, given that many of 
                        my supporters are on Wall Street. But I 
                        believe this is a very important piece of 
                        legislation. And it will give the average 
                        American worker a good square deal: more 
                        stability, more prosperity, more growth for 
                        everybody.

           A beat. Ida looks at him.

                                 IDA
                        And you want my help with that?

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        The better people can understand the bill, 
                        the more likely they are to support it. You 
                        have a particular talent for explaining 
                        that which is difficult to understand.

           At last. The reason for her summons.

                                 IDA
                        You want me to publicly endorse the Elkins 
                        Bill in our magazine?

           Roosevelt smiles, a little embarrassed by the asking.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Well, it doesn’t have to be anything 
                        explicit. Sometimes a little push is all 
                        that’s required.

           Ida stops eating, looks at the president.

                                 IDA
                        I’m sure it’s a fine piece of legislation, 
                        but I’m afraid I can’t do that.

           The droopy moustache twitches with annoyance. This is a man 
           not used to hearing the word “no.” Especially from a woman.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Oh. I see.

                                 IDA
                        I’m a journalist, Mr. President. Not a 
                        lobbyist. 

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                             (peeved)
                        Yes. Yes, of course, I understand.

           When his little gambit fails, he tries switching back to more 
           “neutral” topics.
                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        And do you enjoy writing, Miss Tarbell?

                                 IDA
                        I enjoy the process of writing, more than I 
                        enjoy the end result.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        And how do you uncover these things that 
                        nobody else can seem to uncover?

                                 IDA
                             (a shrug)
                        I don’t know. I suppose I look where other 
                        people do not. I’m something of a plodder.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        I imagine it must give one a tremendous 
                        sense of power to shake up an organization 
                        like Standard Oil.

                                 IDA
                        That’s the result, over which I have no 
                        control. 

           A beat. Roosevelt smiles darkly.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        The important thing to remember about 
                        power, Miss Tarbell, is that it is very  
                        fleeting. And just when you think you have 
                        it...poof! It’s gone. 

                                 IDA
                        I’ll try to remember that.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Do.

           A tense unresolved beat as they stare at each other.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           Ida approaches the front desk of the hotel for her messages. 
           Among them, she finds this unwelcome telegram:

                “FATHER FADING. DAYS NOT WEEKS. COME QUICK. WILL” 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TARBELL HOUSE - DAY 

           In the parlor, the Tarbell family has gathered. WILL, GLORIA, 
           the kids, ESTHER and various cousins, standing or sitting.
           A somber death vigil for Franklin.

           Neighbors carry food from the kitchen to the dining room.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           A hollowed-out FRANKLIN TARBELL lies staring up at the 
           ceiling, on the brink of death. His breathing is labored.

           A DOCTOR administers another shot of morphine, offering some 
           small relief, then quietly leaves the room. 

           Ida stands off to one side, watching. A beat, then:

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Who goes there?

                                 IDA
                             (a ritual, this)
                        Don’t shoot. It’s your only daughter.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        Ida Belle. Come closer. Sit.

           Ida seats herself next to the bed.

                                 IDA
                        Hello Franklin. I came to see you.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                             (a smile)
                        You came to say goodbye. How was your 
                        journey?

                                 IDA
                        Long, uncomfortable. I was in Washington. I 
                        met with President Roosevelt this week.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I hope you told him to give up that silly 
                        coonskin hat. Man looking like that belongs 
                        in the circus, not the White House.
                             (growing serious now)
                        Ida, I want you to know...that you’ve made 
                        an old man very happy. And proud. Cos when 
                        I meet my maker, he’ll say to me “What have 
                        you done, Franklin?” And I’ll tell him...

           He coughs. An awful wheezing death rattle.

                                 IDA
                        Sssh. Rest now. Don’t talk.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        I’ll tell him: “I’m the father of Ida 
                        Tarbell.” 
           Ida just nods, too grief-stricken to speak.

                                 FRANKLIN TARBELL
                        We had fun though, didn’t we? You and me?
                        You make me very happy, Ida Belle. Very 
                        happy...

           He slowly drifts off as the morphine kicks in. Ida is weeping 
           now. Silently. Fiercely. 

           And slowly we PULL BACK from this intimate tableaux to...

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - TITUSVILLE - DAY

           A GROUP OF MOURNERS stand together by an open grave as a pine 
           box is lowered into the ground. Franklin Tarbell, returned to 
           the soil he spent his life digging.

           A MINISTER intones a few prayers over the nondescript grave.

           ANGLE - LATER

           Ida and her brother walk a short distance away from the rest 
           of the mourners. Ida looks pale and drawn. Worn out.

                                 WILL
                        Good of you to come. I’m glad you made it 
                        on time.

                                 IDA
                        Me too. Not much of a resting place though, 
                        is it?

                                 WILL
                        It’s where he’d want to be.

           They arrive by the river’s edge, staring out together. We 
           watch Ida’s face. Clouded. Sad. Deep in thought.

                                 WILL
                        You were always his favorite, you know. I 
                        could never compete.

                                 IDA
                        That’s not true!

                                 WILL
                        Yes it is. You were the son he always 
                        wanted. Easier on me in a way. Not much was 
                        expected. He was very proud of you, Ida.

                                 IDA
                        Then why do I feel like I’ve failed him?
                                 WILL
                        Nonsense. You haven’t failed anybody. Far 
                        from it.
                             (beat)
                        Look, why don’t you come out to Kansas and  
                        visit with us for a little while. You know 
                        you’re a celebrity out there. I’ve been 
                        trading on your name for months now, just 
                        so you know. The kids would love to see 
                        you. And I would too.

                                 IDA
                        Soon. I promise. 
                             (beat)
                        He deserved so much better than this, Will.

                                 WILL
                        I know. Hardly seems to matter now though, 
                        does it?

           Ida gazes out. A steely resolve behind her grief. 

                                 IDA
                        Now is when it matters the most.

           INT. THE MCCLURE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           TWO POLICE INSPECTORS approach a door, giving a loud knock. 
           There’s some movement from inside. Motion at the keyhole.

           And then the door opens to reveal: HATTIE MCCLURE, an 
           attractive woman in her 50’s (Sam’s wife, older than he is).

                                 INSPECTOR TUNNEY
                        Mrs. McClure? Hattie McClure?

                                 HATTIE MCCLURE
                        Yes?

                                 INSPECTOR TUNNEY
                             (flashing a badge)
                        I’m Inspector Tunney, this is Inspector 
                        Egan. Might we have a moment of your time?

                                 HATTIE MCCLURE
                             (alarmed)
                        What’s this about?

                                 INSPECTOR TUNNEY
                        I’m afraid it’s about your husband, Sam 
                        McClure. May we come in?
           INT. THE MCCLURE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           CLOSE ON A SERIES OF GRAINY PHOTOGRAPHS - detailing lewd sex 
           acts between men and women. Anonymous, explicit, shocking.  
           Sam McClure visible in some of them.

           PULL BACK TO - Hattie flicking through them, impassive. 

           The two cops sit opposite, watching for her reaction.

           Hattie hands back the photos, rises unsteadily to her feet. 
           She goes to a drinks cabinet, pouring herself a stiff drink.

           A beat, then:

                                 HATTIE MCCLURE
                        Why are you showing me these?

                                 INSPECTOR TUNNEY
                        We just need to ah,...correctly identify 
                        your husband.

                                 HATTIE MCCLURE
                        It looks to me like you already have.
                             (beat)
                        Get out of my house. Both of you.

                                 INSPECTOR TUNNEY
                        Thank you for your time, Mrs. McClure. I’m 
                        awful sorry for your trouble.

                                 HATTIE MCCLURE
                        Oh, I’m sure you are. Get out! 

           The two cops share a look, leave. Hattie slams the door after 
           them. Lowers her head in shame. 

           INT. OFFICE OF MCCLURE’S MAGAZINE - DAY

           Ida enters, notices some papers strewn across the floor.

           REVEAL: The office has been totally ransacked.

           Desks upended, drawers, files, books scattered everywhere.

           McClure is talking with TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS. One of 
           them hands him a statement for him to sign. 

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        Sign here and here.

           Ida approaches, taking it all in:

                                 IDA
                        What’s all this? What’s going on?
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        What’s it look like. Somebody broke in last 
                        night, stole all our files.

                                 POLICEMAN # 2
                        “Allegedly.”

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        So what’s the new theory? That I burgled 
                        myself?

                                 POLICEMAN # 2
                             (cryptic)
                        Stranger things have happened. 

                                 POLICEMAN # 1
                        We’ll look into it, Mr. McClure. We find 
                        anything, we’ll let you know.

           The two cops head out. Ida and McClure stand together in the 
           midst of this wreckage. Some of the other staff (PIERCE, 
           LOWRY, JACCACI) are visible in the b.g., whispering.

           A long tense beat.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (bitterly)
                        I told you this was going to happen, didn’t 
                        I? But you wouldn’t listen.

                                 IDA
                        I’ll talk to the Police Commissioner, we’ll 
                        find out--

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        The Police Commissioner?! Who do you think 
                        ordered this? Who do you think owns the 
                        Police Department in New York City? 

                                 IDA
                             (weakly)
                        We can publish an article--

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        It’s too late for that, okay. We’re dead in 
                        the water. We’re sunk.

                                 IDA
                        What do you mean, we’re sunk?

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I’m sorry to be the one to inform you, but 
                        while you’ve been gone, they just slapped a 
                        gag order on us. They’re shutting us down.

                                 IDA
                        What..?! They can’t do that!
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        They can and they did. An injunction, 
                        signed by the Attorney General himself. 
                             (hands it to her)
                        It’s over, Ida. McClure’s is done. And so 
                        are you. 
                             (re: the others)
                        Now are you going to be the one to tell 
                        them they have no jobs, or will I?

           A beat as the reality of this sinks in.

                                 IDA
                        It’s your magazine, aren’t you even going 
                        to fight for it?

           McClure slumps against the wall, slides down to the floor. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        I did. We lost. 

           Ida goes to say something, probably something hurtful, but 
           thinks better of it, knowing she is complicit. The silence 
           between them grows. Until finally, she turns and leaves.

           INT. SIDDAL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Ida comes to the door of a crummy-looking apartment in the 
           Bowery. She KNOCKS, waits for an answer.

           SIDDAL answers. He looks extremely tense, upset.

                                 IDA
                        John, I need to speak to you--

                                 SIDDAL
                        Now is not a very good time.

           REVEAL: someone sitting inside the apartment with him.

                                 IDA
                        Who is it? Who’s there with you?

                                 SIDDAL
                        It’s my father.

                                 IDA
                        Oh, lovely! Can I say hello?

                                 SIDDAL
                        I don’t think that’s a very good idea.

           Suddenly, Mr. SIDDAL (56) is standing right there, John’s 
           unsmiling and very authoritarian father.
                                 IDA
                             (offering a hand)
                        Hello, I’m Ida Tarbell.

           He doesn’t shake it, nor does he offer a name in return.

                                 MR. SIDDAL
                        John is coming back to Boston with me this 
                        evening. He’s going to resume his Law 
                        studies at Harvard. I’m afraid he won’t be 
                        working for you or Mr. McClure any more.

                                 IDA
                        That’s great. I’m sure he’ll do very well 
                        there.
                             (beat)
                        But, I’m sure you’ll agree that John’s work 
                        here in New York is also very important...

                                 MR. SIDDAL
                        I think John has given more than enough to 
                        McClure’s Magazine, don’t you?
                             (to his son)
                        Say goodbye. We’ve a train to catch.

           Siddal is absolutely dying. Tries desperately to explain...

                                 SIDDAL
                        It’s my father’s law firm. Standard Oil is 
                        one of their biggest corporate clients. I 
                        never told anybody what I was doing here, I 
                        knew he wouldn’t approve. But somebody 
                        found out. Now my father could lose his 
                        job, his entire career, everything...
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, Ida. I’m really sorry...

           He slowly closes the door. HOLD ON Ida. Looking suddenly very 
           lost, and very alone.

           INT. KYKUIT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           At the conference table sit JUNIOR, MR. GATES (PR executive), 
           and a new face we have not seen before, MR. SELZ (60s).

           Rockefeller stands with his back to all of them, gazing out 
           the window.

           SELZ is a very distinguished-looking lawyer from New York. He 
           looks over several legal documents spread before them. 

                                 SELZ
                        The holding company we will move to New 
                        Jersey, which we incorporate under a 
                        different name. Better tax laws, better 
                        protection from the courts. 
                                 SELZ (CONT'D)
                        Once that’s in place, we will name John 
                        Junior as the “new” acting chairman of 
                        Standard Oil.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (quietly, not turning)
                        That’s very convenient.

                                 SELZ
                        Meanwhile, you will become the chairman of 
                        a new private enterprise, which we will 
                        call the “Rockefeller Foundation.” Now the 
                        Foundation affords you very significant tax 
                        advantages...

                                 MR. GATES
                        Not to mention, some good publicity. For a 
                        change!

           Selz silences this idiot with a glance.

                                 SELZ
                        You control all philanthropic activities as 
                        you see fit. You can choose your interests 
                        for charitable or educational purposes.

           A long pause. Rockefeller finally turns around to face them.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You want to banish me from my own company, 
                        put me out to pasture. The company I spent 
                        40 years of my life building.

                                 SELZ
                             (pause)
                        It’s a minor bit of restructuring, that’s 
                        all. But it will protect you personally, 
                        protect the family’s assets, and hopefully, 
                        ensure the continuation of your good name.

           Rockefeller looks accusingly at his son. Junior meets his 
           father’s gaze confidently this time. We sense a “shift” in 
           the balance of power between father and son.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Is this what you wanted, John?

                                 JUNIOR
                        I think it’s best for everyone. Yes.

                                 SELZ
                        Of course, this is entirely your decision, 
                        Mr. Rockefeller.

           Rockefeller looks contemptuously at the lawyer. 
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Is it?

           Rockefeller glances briefly over the legal documents spread 
           before him. Then he picks up a pen, quickly signs his name. 

           He leaves the room without saying another word. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Ida hurries along the street to her apartment. Approaching 
           the mailbox, she notices her name still pasted on there. This 
           annoys her. She rips it off.

           ANGLE TO REVEAL: A man (his face obscured) watching her.

           Ida is being followed. As she goes to open up the front door, 
           the man looms behind her.

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        You’re Ida Tarbell, aren’t you?

           She looks around at him. We recognize him as the man in the 
           shabby raincoat ejected earlier from McClure’s lobby.

                                 IDA
                             (frightened)
                        I don’t think so.

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        Sure you are. You’re the one writes all 
                        them articles about Standard Oil.

           Ida fumbles for her keys, tries to unlock the door.

                                 IDA
                        I think you have the wrong person.

           Ida hurries inside, slamming the door abruptly on him. She 
           leans inside the door, breathing heavily. Heart racing.

                                 BEN LUDLOW (O.C.)
                        Would it interest you to know that I spent 
                        14 years working at the Standard Oil plant 
                        in Toledo? You can even check it with my 
                        supervisor. He’s the one showed me your ad 
                        in the magazine.
                             (beat)
                        I’d sure be glad to talk to you about it 
                        sometime, if you’re not too busy. 

           A long moment passes between them. He begins to walk away. 
                                 IDA
                        Wait!
                             (opening the door)
                        What did you say your name was?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        My name is Ben. Ben Ludlow. 

                                 IDA
                        How did you find me here?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        I followed you off the tram. I went to your 
                        office but they wouldn’t let me up.
                             (apologetic)
                        I’m awful sorry if I scared you. 

           Ida looks at him again, weighing it carefully...

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They sit together at the kitchen table. Ida taking notes, 
           Ludlow sipping from a hot cup of tea. 

           Ludlow has a long hangdog look, and a flat mid-western 
           accent. He avoids looking directly at Ida as he speaks.

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        I worked in the boiler room, near the 
                        incinerator. End of every month, we’d get 
                        us a big shipment of boxes come in from the 
                        Cleveland plant. Documents and such. We 
                        didn’t know what they were, we were just 
                        told to get rid of ‘em. High priority.

                                 IDA
                        And you put them in the incinerator?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                             (nods)
                        I didn’t think nothing of it. Until one 
                        day, I look inside and I seen my brother-in-
                        law’s name all over some of them documents.

                                 IDA
                        Your brother-in-law?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        Yes, m’am. He worked as a railway clerk on 
                        the Erie Line, up near Meadville. Anyhow, 
                        when I looked, I seen they had his whole 
                        shipping schedule in there, shipping rates 
                        for all the other refineries. Hell, they 
                        even knew what he ate for breakfast. I 
                        couldn’t believe it.
           A beat. Ida is stunned.

                                 IDA
                        And you destroyed all of these documents? 
                        For Standard Oil?

                                 BEN LUDLOW
                        Well, not all of ‘em. When they let me go, 
                        I decided I might need some type of 
                        insurance for my claim. Right about now, 
                        there’s a whole bunch of ‘em sitting in the 
                        basement of my sister’s place in Queens. 

           If he weren’t so damn ugly, she might just kiss him.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           TWO DELIVERYMEN enter carrying boxes of dusty files, which 
           they deposit in the living room. Ida pays them off.

           JUMP CUTS -- OVER SEVERAL DAYS

           The clatter of her typewriter is heard as we see Ida at work. 
           She’s been at it for days now. Her face set in concentration.  

           She crosses out sections of her manuscript, tosses away 
           entire pages...

           The typewriter continues to clack as day turns to night, and 
           back again.

           Finally, she pulls out the last page, stares at it. 

           EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

           Ida walks down the street, checking for an address against a 
           scrap of paper in her hand. She finds the one she wants. 
           Enters a tall apartment building.

           INT. THE MCCLURE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Ida knocks at the door. After a moment, McClure peers out. 

           He appears unshaven and red-eyed, like he’s been on a bender 
           for a week. And he’s not thrilled to see Ida.

                                 IDA
                        Can I come in?

           After a moment’s hesitation, he relents. Leaving the door 
           open for her.
           INT. MCCLURE’S STUDY - SOME TIME LATER

           Sam pours himself another drink. Ida stands.

                                 IDA
                        I know how they were doing it.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Doing what?

                                 IDA
                        The price fixing. The preferential shipping 
                        rates. It’s all in there.

           Ida places a manuscript on his desk. He doesn’t look at it.

                                 IDA
                        There’s a whole army of spies at every 
                        level of the organization feeding 
                        information directly to Cleveland. They 
                        control everything because they know 
                        everything. The Standard Oil Company is 
                        actually 49 corporations, all operating 
                        independently of each other. The holding 
                        company is run by 9 trustees of which 
                        Rockefeller is one. But he owns 90% of the 
                        stock. It’s the perfect trust.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Where did you get all this?

                                 IDA
                        Doesn’t matter where. The point is, we now 
                        have proof that what they were doing is 
                        illegal. John Rockefeller belongs in jail.

           A pause. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        My wife is leaving me.

                                 IDA
                        Oh Sam...

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (a sad smile)
                        Can’t say I blame her. I’m a delinquent 
                        father, a lousy husband and a miserable 
                        drunk. I’m also broke, as it turns out. It 
                        wasn’t even my money to begin with. It was 
                        my wife’s money. And now that’s gone.

                                 IDA
                        I’m so sorry.
                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Don’t be. I did this to myself. My father 
                        was a drunk and a gambler too. Funny how 
                        history has a habit of repeating itself.  

           Silence. Then:

                                 IDA
                        We can take down John D. Rockefeller.

           He looks at her.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You don’t quit, do you?

                                 IDA
                        He wants to silence his critics and 
                        bend the nation to his will. And the only 
                        way he can do that is if people like you 
                        and me allow him to.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (growing upset)
                        I have had my life threatened. My office 
                        ransacked. My wife is leaving me. And every 
                        single penny I own is tied up in that 
                        magazine. What do you want me to do?!

                                 IDA
                        Help me print this. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Tell me you’re not actually serious? 
                             (sees that she is)
                        Do you have any idea what you’re asking me 
                        to do?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. I do.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        And did you ever think for a minute that 
                        you might have some responsibility for what 
                        you’re doing? You are ruining a man’s life 
                        after all.

                                 IDA
                             (eyes blazing)
                        And how many lives has he ruined, and it 
                        didn’t even cost him a night’s sleep.

           A beat. This hits home for Sam.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        You know damn well that if I print this, 
                        nobody is going to win.
                                 IDA
                        If you don’t print this, everybody loses.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        And what do you think it’s going to change?

                                 IDA
                        Probably nothing. But at least we’ll go 
                        down swinging.

           A long beat. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        How? There’s a gag order on us. We could go 
                        to jail.

                                 IDA
                             (thinks)
                        I think I know somebody who might be able 
                        to help us.

           INT. IDA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Ida types a letter to President Roosevelt.

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        “Dear Mr. President, with regard to your 
                        Elkins Bill, I have now discussed the 
                        matter with my publisher, Mr. McClure. And 
                        while we cannot publicly endorse any 
                        legislation in our magazine, we feel it 
                        might best be served... 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Teddy Roosevelt, in the Oval Office, is being briefed by his 
           PRESS SECRETARY and his CHIEF OF STAFF.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                             (reading aloud)
                        “...by means of a high profile example to 
                        illustrate why it is even necessary...”

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                             (cutting in)
                        She wants you to come out against 
                        Rockefeller. You do that now, you risk 
                        alienating all of his supporters on Wall 
                        Street, and he still has plenty. Too risky 
                        in a year of election, if you ask me.

           ROOSEVELT stands, looking out the window.
                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                             (ponders)
                        Maybe. But on the other hand...if people 
                        understood what the bill could do for them, 
                        then we wouldn’t need to sell it in the 
                        first place, would we? People always prefer 
                        a tool when they can see it in action.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Sir, even if Elkins did pass, we cannot 
                        ensure that the ICC would even uphold it.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                             (angry)
                        And I can’t ensure a damn thing until this 
                        bill passes through congress!

           The two presidential advisors are silenced.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        What does she want from us?

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                             (skimming the letter)
                        She wants you to veto an order by the 
                        Attorney General, and um...the one time use 
                        of our printing press.

           Roosevelt smiles to himself. Impressed by the nerve.

                                 TEDDY ROOSEVELT
                        Well, if they don’t like the carrot, then 
                        maybe it’s time we show them the stick.
                             (nods)
                        Do it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE PRINTING PRESSES ROLLING --

           The final edition of McClure’s Magazine goes to print, Ida’s 
           story on the front page. 

                       “THE SHAME OF CLEVELAND” By Ida M. Tarbell.

                                  February 1905.

           EXT. NEWSSTAND - NEW YORK - DAY

           The magazine is now displayed at a newsstand. Beside it, the 
           New York Dailies trumpet their own catchy headlines:  

           “NEW EVIDENCE TIES ROCKEFELLER TO SECRET PRICE FIXING”

           “NEW TROUBLE FOR ROCKEFELLER” 
           “THE TRUST IS BUST!”

           Ida approaches, buys a copy of McClure’s magazine. She holds 
           it in her hand, marveling at it. Three full years of toil, 
           sacrifice and dogged investigative work have all led up to 
           this. For Ida, a PRIVATE MOMENT of great personal triumph.  

           She tucks the magazine under arm, walks off smiling. 

           INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

           A satirical sketch in a vaudeville show. A man in drag (Ida 
           Tarbell) whacks a cartoon plutocrat (Rockefeller) over the 
           head with her handbag, chasing him across the stage. The 
           audience ROARS with laughter.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: HENRY ROGERS sitting in the audience 
           with his wife, the only person not laughing.

           EXT. 26 BROADWAY - DAY

           A GROUP OF JOURNALISTS jostle outside the entrance to 
           Standard Oil, some of them holding up copies of McClure’s 
           Magazine. Mr. Gates caught in the crossfire.

                                 MR. GATES
                        For the record, let me just state: this 
                        story is totally without merit or any basis 
                        in fact, and we aim to prove that. John 
                        Rockefeller is one of the greatest public 
                        servants this country has ever seen. All 
                        else is a bunch of lies. Thank you.

           He pushes past the journalists’ shouted questions, refusing 
           to answer any of them.

           EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           We see where HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE have gathered outside the 
           church to catch a glimpse of Rockefeller. A dozen PINKERTON 
           GUARDS loiter. Beefed up security for the Rockefeller family.

           INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           Sunday service on Euclid avenue. A PREACHER is at the lectern 
           reading aloud from the gospel of Mark, 8:36.

                                 PREACHER
                        “For whosoever will save his life shall 
                        lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life 
                        for my sake and the gospel's, the same 
                        shall save it.”
           REVEAL: Rockefeller and Cettie, in their usual pew, looking 
           very pious. Directly behind them sit Junior and Abby.

                                 PREACHER
                        “For what shall it profit a man if he shall 
                        gain the whole world, and lose his own 
                        soul?”

           CLOSE ON ROCKEFELLER: squirming in his seat. Is the preacher 
           speaking directly to him? Sure feels that way.

           INT. KYKUIT - LIBRARY - DAY

           Rockefeller sits, petting his Wolfhound. He seems oddly 
           detached from what follows. Opposite him are Junior and Mr. 
           Selz (the lawyer), in full-on crisis management mode.

                                 SELZ
                        For your own comfort and safety, I would 
                        recommend leaving New York immediately. Get 
                        as far away from here as possible. Florida, 
                        Key West, California. Doesn’t matter where.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (playing with the dog)
                        Look at these teeth. Can you believe he’s 
                        still a puppy?

                                 JUNIOR
                        It’s only for a short while, until all this 
                        blows over.

                                 SELZ
                        You’ll want to avoid any public places, be 
                        on the lookout for process servers. You 
                        could easily get a subpoena. But if they 
                        can’t find you, they can’t serve you.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        How much am I paying you, Mr. Selz?

           A beat.

                                 SELZ
                        Sir?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I pay you a not insubstantial amount of 
                        money to be my legal counsel, do I not?

                                 SELZ
                        Yes sir. I’m adequately paid.
                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        And your job is to protect me from the very 
                        situation that I now find myself in, is it 
                        not? 

                                 SELZ
                        Yes.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        So if you cannot adequately provide this 
                        service, then why are you here?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Father, I--

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (lethally)
                        Be quiet.

                                 SELZ
                        With respect Mr. Rockefeller, I am retained 
                        by your son.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        And he is retained by me. Which means that 
                        technically you work for me. But since you 
                        have failed in your primary duties, I see 
                        no reason to retain your services any 
                        longer. You are relieved as of today. 

           A beat.

                                 JUNIOR
                        No. He stays, or I go. I’m the Chairman of 
                        Standard Oil now. Only I get to decide who 
                        stays and who goes. Mr. Selz is staying.

           The two men just stare at each other. Neither one blinks. 

           OFF SELZ, caught in the middle.

           INT. KYKUIT - MASTER SUITE - NIGHT

           Rockefeller is quietly packing a shaving kit by his dresser. 
           Cettie paces back and forth across the room. Pale with rage.

                                 CETTIE
                        You expect me to just pack my bags and 
                        leave in the middle of the night for God-
                        knows-where until God-knows-when? Just walk 
                        out and leave the house that we built and  
                        have lived in for twenty five years? Why?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (tightly)
                        I’m afraid we have no other choice. 
                                 ROCKEFELLER (CONT'D)
                        If I stay here, men will come and they will 
                        try to arrest me. The only question is 
                        when.

                                 CETTIE
                        If you’ve done nothing wrong, then what do 
                        you have to run from?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I will not defend my life to you, or anyone 
                        else. 

                                 CETTIE
                        Oh no, of course not. But you expect me to 
                        defend it for you, don’t you? Never 
                        question, never ask, never doubt. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I don’t expect anything of you, but it 
                        would be nice to have your support.

                                 CETTIE
                        My support? All I’ve done for the last 40 
                        years is support you and your ambition. 
                        Never once did you ask me about mine.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You are becoming shrill and hysterical.

                                 CETTIE
                        You broke the law, John! There, I’ve said 
                        it. That’s the truth, isn’t it? The truth 
                        that nobody has the courage to tell you. No 
                        one but Ida Tarbell.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (darkly)
                        I said never to mention that woman’s name 
                        in this house. That woman is trying to 
                        destroy me--

                                 CETTIE
                        But that’s just it. Nobody is trying to 
                        destroy you! You imagine that everyone is 
                        out to destroy you. And you want to bury 
                        them all in the ground, don’t you?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I won’t have this in my house.

                                 CETTIE
                        I’ve read Ida Tarbell. And I’d swear to God, 
                        she knows my husband better than I do.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Not another word about that poisonous 
                        misguided woman.
                                 CETTIE
                             (scornfully)
                        How galling it must be to have your 
                        authority questioned in public like that. 
                        The great John D. Rockefeller, finally 
                        brought to task. And by a woman, if you 
                        don’t mind. A woman!

           A beat.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I see how it is. You want to stand in 
                        judgement of me, just like everyone else. 
                        Well go ahead, throw your stones at me.

                                 CETTIE
                        I don’t want to judge you, I want to 
                        understand. How could you do this to us? 
                        How could you not know that this day would 
                        eventually come?

           A beat. He stops, turns to face her. Contrite for once.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (quietly)
                        I’m sorry, Cettie. I am sorry if I have let 
                        you down. God knows, I’ve made my share of 
                        mistakes. But I have tried, so help me God, 
                        I tried to be a good husband and a decent 
                        father. And if I have failed in that, then 
                        I would ask your forgiveness.

                                 CETTIE
                             (shaking her head)
                        I’m not leaving here, John. Not like this. 
                        Kykuit is my home.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        It’s late now. Let’s sleep on it. Maybe 
                        you’ll feel differently in the morning.

                                 CETTIE
                        I won’t.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Then you’ve already made your decision.

                                 CETTIE
                        Yes, I have. I won’t live my life like a 
                        fugitive. I won’t do it.

           A long beat.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Then don’t.

           He takes his bag and leaves. We HOLD ON Cettie’s grief.
           EXT. OPEN ROAD - DAWN

           Rockefeller’s car shoots past on an open road. Where he’s 
           going we don’t know, nor does it matter. The point is this: 
           The richest man in the world is now a fugitive of the law.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - KANSAS - DAY 

           Under clear blue skies, Ida steps off a train in Kansas. She 
           is greeted by her brother Will who wraps her up in a big hug. 

                                 WILL
                        There she is. Welcome to Kansas! I can’t 
                        believe you actually came.

                                 IDA
                        Well of course I came. I said I would, 
                        didn’t I?

           Will hands her a copy of the local newspaper. Headlines 
           trumpet “IDA TOPPLES TYCOON” and “ROCKEFELLER ON THE RUN”

                                 WILL
                        Congratulations, you’re more famous than 
                        Rockefeller. If you need a good press 
                        agent, I’m available. For a small fee, 
                        naturally.

                                 IDA
                             (amused)
                        Honestly, who writes this stuff?!

                                 WILL
                        Come on, let me show you the future of the 
                        oil business.

           He picks up her suitcase, and together they head off.

           EXT. OIL FIELDS - DAY

           Ida and Will travel in an open-topped car, taking in the vast 
           expanse of the new “Indian Territory” Oil fields in Kansas. 
           The latest frontier in the great American quest for oil. 

           To say it is “breathtaking” does not even begin to do it 
           justice. Vast stretches of wide open fields, dry flat plains, 
           and small rolling hills. Ida drinks it all in. They continue 
           to drive, on and on, eventually arriving at...

           EXT. FRANKLIN OIL REFINERY - DAY

           A crude collection of wooden buildings that make up the 
           offices of “Franklin Oil” where Will Tarbell is now CEO. 
           The car comes to a stop and Will hops out, gallantly squiring 
           his sister around the new facility. As they walk:

                                 WILL
                        The new well is flowing at 3000 barrels a 
                        day. I’ve just secured the lease for three 
                        others up near Osage County. We hope to 
                        begin drilling there first of next month.

           Some OIL WORKERS pass by and all nod and tip their hats to 
           him. Out here, he is an important man.

                                 WORKER
                        Mr. Tarbell...

                                 WILL
                        Hello Jim. 
                             (introducing)
                        This is my sister from back East. Ida 
                        Tarbell. You may have heard of her.

                                 WORKER
                             (smiles, shakes her hand)
                        Miss Tarbell, it’s an honor.

                                 IDA
                        Same here.

           They continue on, Will leading her up some rickety stairs to 
           where his office is located on the second floor.

                                 IDA
                        You’ve done well, little brother. I have to 
                        say, I’m very impressed.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t be. I haven’t made a nickel yet. But 
                        soon, I hope.

           He leads her inside his office.

           ANGLE -- SOME TIME LATER

           News of the famous visitor has spread throughout the oil 
           fields, and now a group of OIL WORKERS has gathered outside 
           Will’s office. All hoping for a glimpse of Ida Tarbell.

           When the door reopens and Ida emerges, a spontaneous CHEER 
           goes up. APPLAUSE and WOLF WHISTLES. Ida is caught totally 
           off guard by this. 

           She looks at Will. He just shrugs. Nothing to do with me!

           Cries of “Speech! Speech!” 

           Ida stands before the assembled group, totally unprepared for 
           this or any other speech.
           The crowd is hushed. Ida speaks to them very simply:

                                 IDA
                        Thank you. I'm delighted to be back in oil 
                        country. Six weeks ago, my father Franklin 
                        Tarbell was buried near the Drake oil well 
                        in Pennsylvania where he spent all his life 
                        working. The company that he built was 
                        bought out by Standard Oil, and it was a 
                        shoddy deal. But my father accepted it 
                        because he was afraid of what would happen 
                        if he didn't. 

           PANNING THE FACES OF OIL WORKERS IN THE CROWD - 

                                 IDA (CONT’D)
                        I'm not against anyone making money. I want 
                        all of you to be millionaires. Including my 
                        brother here. But we must be better than 
                        Standard Oil. As clever, as ambitious, as 
                        ingenious, but do it fairly. 
                             (pause)
                        I am only one voice, but you have a voice 
                        too, and I encourage you to use it. This is 
                        your industry, and only you will decide how 
                        it is to be run. Not the railroad thugs, 
                        not the South Improvement Scheme, not John 
                        D. Rockefeller. 

           Rousing applause and cheering. 

           Then, a lone male VOICE starts singing: a jaunty song to the 
           tune of “Bedalia” that he cleverly changes the lyrics to...

                                 OIL WORKER # 1
                        “There’s a charming young lady with an 
                        awful winning way, who has my heart a 
                        thumpin’ night and day...”

                                 OIL WORKER # 2
                        “She’s a flower of Pennsylvania with an 
                        apple in her cheek, she’s the very best 
                        thing that ever flowed from this creek...”

           The other men all join in on the chorus. Ida is now being 
           serenaded by thirty or forty oily roughnecks. 

                                 OIL WORKERS
                        “Oh oh Ida, I wanna save ya,
                         Oh oh Ida, I wanna be ya,
                         Oh oh Ida, I love you soooo...”

           She is moved to tears by this spontaneous outpouring of 
           affection for her. As she looks out, she sees the sign that 
           bears her father’s name: “Franklin Oil Co.”
                                 IDA
                             (whispering, to herself)
                        I love you too.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - FLORIDA - DAY

           ROCKEFELLER is now living in Florida under an assumed name. 
           We find him finishing up his daily round of golf.

           Title: Florida, Six Months Later

           As he turns to go, he notices two men on the golf course who 
           clearly look out of place: PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE DETECTIVES.

           He collects his ball, hurries off toward the clubhouse.

           INT. GOLF CLUBHOUSE - LATER

           Rockefeller is changing in the men’s locker room. 

           REVEAL: Somebody watching him. A young man of about 25, 
           wearing the club uniform of white shirt and trousers. Could 
           be a caddy, pool attendant, waiter. Could be anybody.

           As Rockefeller closes up his locker, the YOUNG MAN approaches 
           him. Big friendly smile.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Mr. Stevens?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Yes.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Forgot your scorecard.

           The man hands him an envelope, and instinctively Rockefeller 
           reaches out to take it. Big mistake.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Mr. Rockefeller, you’ve just been served.

           The haunted look behind Rockefeller’s eyes tells us he has 
           been dreading this moment for some time.

           The process server turns and walks away. 

           HOLD ON ROCKEFELLER -- His invincible power and aura is gone. 
           And there’s something unexpectedly touching about it. 
           INT. RESTAURANT - ST. DENIS HOTEL - NEW YORK - DAY

           Ida and McClure sit together in their favorite booth at the 
           St. Denis, sharing a drink. The mood is quiet, intimate.

           McClure slides a copy of The Times across the table. The 
           headline reads: “ROCKEFELLER ISSUED SUBPOENA IN FLORIDA”

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        We got him, didn’t we?

                                 IDA
                        Yes, we did. 
                             (beat)
                        Look Sam, I’m sorry if I--

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Forget it. Actually, I kind of enjoyed it. 
                        So tell me, was it worth it?

                                 IDA
                        I don’t know. I thought I’d feel 
                        differently. To be fair to him, he did 
                        build an amazing company. He also 
                        revolutionized an entire industry. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        Too bad he was also a crook. Minor 
                        character flaw.
                             (beat)
                        So, what are you going to do now?

                                 IDA
                        I don’t know. Thought I might move to the 
                        country for a little while. 

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                             (horrified)
                        The country?! What are you going to do 
                        there?

                                 IDA
                        I was thinking I might write a book.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        A toast then. To Ida Tarbell, muckraker 
                        extraordinaire.

                                 IDA
                        I prefer “writer.” Muckraker always sounds 
                        so dirty to me.

                                 SAM MCCLURE
                        All right. To Ida Tarbell, the writer. 
                             (toasting)
                        Sic semper tyrannis!
                                 IDA
                        Sic semper tyrannis!

           Together, they drink. They are battle weary, they are 
           friends, they are triumphant. 

           Whatever else they might be remains left alone and unspoken.

           INT. ST. DENIS HOTEL - DAY

           Ida hurries toward the elevator just as the doors are about 
           to close. She squeezes in at the last second, punches a 
           button to get downstairs.

           And looking around, she sees the elevator is deserted, except 
           for one other person: John D. Rockefeller.

           She recognizes him instantly. As the elevator descends, he 
           looks over at her. Something about her looks familiar too.

           A very long pause as we watch their faces: hunter and quarry 
           thrown unexpectedly together for the very first time.

           Finally:

                                 IDA
                        Mr. Rockefeller. We haven’t met before, but 
                        my name is Ida Tarbell.

           Rockefeller turns slowly to inspect her. He looks away again. 
           Totally impassive.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I see you’re rather plainer than your 
                        prose. 

                                 IDA
                        I’m afraid we all disappoint in person.

           Then, Rockefeller reaches over and presses the “Stop” button 
           on the elevator. The elevator stops. He turns to face her.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (coldly)
                        I wonder. Do you have any idea of the 
                        damage that you have done?

                                 IDA
                        Do you?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You want to condemn me, don’t you. Be my 
                        judge, jury and executioner. But only God 
                        will be my judge.
                                 IDA
                        Let’s just hope he’s forgiving.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        You people call it monopoly, but I call it 
                        enterprise. Unlike you, I still believe in 
                        a country where a man can rise above his 
                        station to make something better of 
                        himself.

                                 IDA
                        Except it’s very hard to “rise” when that 
                        man’s boot heel is at your neck. 

           A pause. Rockefeller pushes the stop button again, and the 
           elevator continues to move.

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                             (imperious)
                        Some of us are destined to make history. 
                        And then there are others, like you, who 
                        can only write about it. A hundred years 
                        from now, people will still know my name 
                        because of what I built. Tell me, who will 
                        remember yours?

           The doors open on the lobby, and Rockefeller steps out. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Good day, Miss Tarbell.

           Ida watches as he walks calmly off. Head held high.

                                 IDA
                             (quietly, to herself)
                        You will.

           INT. SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK - DAY

           TRACKING WITH POLISHED SHOES along the corridors of justice.

           A defiant JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER walks into court, flanked on 
           either side by the most expensive team of lawyers in the 
           country, and his son John Junior.

           Giant oak doors are flung open as he sweeps into the 
           courtroom. The public gallery is packed with over 200 people, 
           all straining for a look at the fallen titan. Ida Tarbell is 
           not among them.

           Title: The Standard Oil Company v The United States, 

                                  November 1906                    

           Rockefeller takes the stand in his own defense. The courtroom 
           is hushed as he is sworn in by the COURT BAILIFF.
                                 BAILIFF
                        Please raise your right hand. Do you swear 
                        to tell the truth, the whole truth and 
                        nothing but the truth, so help you God?

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        Yes. I do.

                                 JUDGE
                        Can you please state your name for the 
                        record. 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        John Davison Rockefeller.

                                 JUDGE
                        Mr. Rockefeller, you are here because you 
                        are charged with conspiracy against the 
                        United States. Do you understand these 
                        charges against you? 

                                 ROCKEFELLER
                        I do, your honor.

                                 JUDGE
                             (to the prosecution)
                        Very well. You may proceed.

           And so begins the “Trial of the Century” with John D. 
           Rockefeller as the chief protagonist. The age of monopoly is 
           now on trial. But that’s another story.

           The familiar clacking of a typewriter takes us to...

           INT. FARMHOUSE - RURAL CONNECTICUT - DAY

           Where we find Ida at work in her study. A KNOCKING at the 
           door pulls her out of her reverie. She goes to answer it. 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           REVEAL: a shy young woman of about 20, clutching a notebook 
           and pen. She smiles nervously up at Ida. Awed.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hello. Are you Ida Tarbell?

                                 IDA
                        Yes. Who are you?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                             (extending a hand)
                        Sorry. My name is Penny Miller, from 
                        Meadville. I’m studying journalism at 
                        Allegheny College. 
                                 YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        I was hoping maybe I could interview you 
                        for the school magazine.

                                 IDA
                        Penny Miller from Meadville?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Yes, m’am.

           Ida smiles fondly at her. She could be looking at the younger 
           version of herself. 

                                 IDA
                        Right. Well, I suppose you’d better come in 
                        then.

           Ida opens the door, and the girl steps inside.

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        So you want to be a journalist?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Yes, I‘d like to be. I read your series in 
                        McClures, and I was greatly inspired by it. 

                                 IDA (V.O.)
                        Really? Tell me more about that.

           We float through the house now, as the years fall away in an 
           instant. Visitors long gone. As we hear...

                                 OLD IDA (V.O.)
                        Here then, is the record of my day’s work, 
                        still unfinished at 86 years of age. 

           The walls become more crowded with her books and manuscripts. 
           Framed photographs, magazine covers, awards taking over every 
           inch of space. The collected treasures of a writing life.

           We continue floating to where we find Ida... 

           Now an old woman of 86, hunched over a typewriter. Working on 
           her memoirs. 

           CLOSE ON: A pair of knobbly hands. Less nimble than before. 
           Still pecking away at the keys...

                                 OLD IDA (V.O.)
                        No one is more surprised than I am to find 
                        that I am still here, still able to work. 
                        This despite mutinous fingers, tremulous 
                        hands and my ever dimming eyesight.

           Ida continues to type...
                                 OLD IDA (V.O.)
                        But there are small satisfactions too, and 
                        I find it a surprising joy to be still at 
                        my desk every day, with everything I ever 
                        needed: a room to write in, something to 
                        write about, and all day to do it. 

           CAMERA PULLS UP AND BACK 

           Ida framed at her writing desk, still clacking away.

           And there she remains. Working. Content. Indomitable.

                                                              FADE OUT:

                                 THE END

           TITLE: In 1911, the Supreme Court of The United States ruled 
           that The Standard Oil Company was an illegal monopoly. It was 
           subsequently broken up into 34 new companies, including 
           Exxon, Mobil and Conoco-Phillips.

           TITLE: John D. Rockefeller gradually withdrew from business, 
           devoting himself to philanthropy and The Rockefeller 
           Foundation. He died in 1937, two months shy of his 98th 
           birthday. He never spoke in public about Ida Tarbell.  

           TITLE: “The History of the Standard Oil Company” would be 
           hailed as a landmark work in the history of investigative 
           journalism. It is ranked No.5 in the Top 100 greatest works 
           of 20th Century American journalism.

           TITLE: Ida Tarbell continued writing and publishing up until 
           her death in 1944. She lived to be 86 years of age.
