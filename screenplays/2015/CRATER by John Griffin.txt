           SURFACE OF THE MOON - ESTABLISHING

           ANGLE ON : A LUNAR CRATER. CRACKED, RUGGED, LIFELESS. SILENT.

           As we gaze deeper into the ragged cracks of the crater, like
           scars upon the lunar surface, the deep silence of space is
           interrupted by -

           - the hushed voices and clattering sounds of A GROUP OF
           TEENAGERS struggling with something mechanical.

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                        You got it?

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (straining)
                        Almost.  If I can just -
                            (CLANG!)
                        Dammit!

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                            (nervous)
                        You guys okay?

                                 DYLAN
                        We're fine.  

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                        What's wrong?

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                        The gear's stuck.

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                            (worried)
                        Aw man --  

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                        Is that supposed to be blinking?

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                        Wow, you guys are a buncha geniuses
                        aren't you?

           INT.  LUNAR MINING COLONY, SUB-GARAGE

           We're inside a sub-basement garage.  Concrete floors.  Harsh
           florescent lighting.  Sterile.

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                        Did you try the big wrench?

           Several LONG RANGE LUNAR ROVERS parked side by side, somewhat
           resembling hi-tech armored trailers.
           Though futuristic-looking to us, their wear and tear suggests
           an older model, perhaps vehicles taken out of service and re-
           purposed for less sophisticated, less demanding tasks.

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (dry)
                        Yeah, try the big wrench. 

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                        You could help, you know.

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                        Hey, I got us in here.  My part's done.

           ANGLE ON : A BLINKING LIGHT ON AN EXPOSED CIRCUIT BOARD.

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                        No guys seriously -

           A reverse angle reveals CALEB O'CONNELL (14), introspective
           and intelligent, there's a sadness about him, a heavy weight
           on his shoulders.  Like the other boys we're about to meet,
           he's rough around the edges, blue collar, a miner's son. 
           Right now he's standing at an open panel on the side of one
           of the Rovers, staring at the blinking light with mild concern.

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        Why is that blinking?

           ADDISON PLATH (14 going on 15), a bookish tomgirl wearing
           VERY UNIQUE GLASSES - like a cross between horn-rimmed reading
           glasses and swimmer's goggles - peers over Caleb's shoulder
           at the blinking light.  Though she's got plenty of attitude,
           she lacks the blue collar rough edges the boys possess. 

                                 ADDISON
                        Probably 'cause we're stealing it.

           A commotion from "under the hood" of the Rover as DYLAN THOMAS
           (14), devilishly handsome, savvy and rebellious, pops his
           head up from the exposed control boards. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Gee, why don't you say that a little
                        louder in case the microphones didn't
                        quite pick it up?

                                 ADDISON
                            (rolls her eyes)
                        Don't be ridiculous.  They don't
                        have microphones down here.
                            (to Borney)
                        Seriously, you don't have to wear that. 
           BORNEY (13), undersized, earnest and prone to fits of
           stressful imagination, is carrying supply bags into the Rover. 
           He's wearing an ill-fitting burlap sack over his head with
           poorly cut eye holes. 

                                 BORNEY
                        Says you.  They probably have facial
                        ID scans.

                                 CALEB
                        Borney, it's a garage, not a food vault.

                                 DYLAN
                        And you look like an idiot.

                                 BORNEY
                        I heard one kid got caught messing
                        around down here and they put him in a
                        holding cell out by the terra complex
                        and left him there for sixty years.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                            (unnerved)
                        Really?

           MARCUS TOLLEFSON (16) appears from inside the Rover, a worried
           look on his face.  Marcus is the gentle giant of the group; a
           big slow-witted kid with a heart like a mountain.  Fiercely
           loyal.  He's the oldest by almost a year, but you get the
           sense he'd be lost without the friendship of the three younger
           boys.  

                                 CALEB
                            (to Marcus)
                        No.
                            (to Borney)
                        Borney, knock it off, you're not
                        helping.

                                 ADDISON
                            (to Dylan)
                        Why is this taking so long?  

                                 DYLAN
                            (head in the control
                             panel)
                        I told you, the older models aren't
                        wired directly to the main system. 
                        There's a manual ignition switch
                        that overrides the auto-pilot.  As
                        long as I can -
                            (straining)
                        Get the damn - gear to -
           Whatever Dylan's been pulling at finally gives way and the
           Rover's engines roar to life.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Boom!  How do you like that, huh?

           Dylan throws his hands up in celebration just as -

           An ALARM on the Rover goes off.  A really loud alarm.  The
           kids freeze.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                            (to Addison)
                        You said there wouldn't be any alarms!

                                 ADDISON
                            (gesturing to the
                             garage doors)
                        Yeah, on the doors!  

                                 BORNEY
                        You see?!  I told you!  Nobody listens
                        to me!  We're gonna spend the rest
                        of our lives in a tiny cell.

                                 DYLAN
                            (to Addison)
                        Do something!  Turn it off!

                                 ADDISON
                        Oh yeah, let me get right on that for
                        you.  I don't know how to turn it off!!

                                 BORNEY
                        We are so screwed.

           ANGLE ON : CALEB

           Caleb watches, stoic and crestfallen, as the other kids
           scramble to locate the "off" switch.  His quest is failing
           before it even has a chance to begin.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Caleb?  Caleb O'Connell?

           INT.  LUNAR MINING COLONY, SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM

           Caleb sits in the waiting room.  Sparse.  Sterile, but not
           harsh.  The artificial lighting has a coolness to it, tinged
           slightly blue.    

           Caleb looks numb.  Drained.    
           He's staring across the room with vacant eyes at a 3D
           advertisement, set into the wall, for a place called OMEGA,
           an idyllic civilization, vibrant and alive in a far away
           place.  That place is not this place.  This place sucks.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Caleb O'Connell?

           The voice belongs to a RECEPTIONIST calling from the reception
           window that looks out onto the room.  Her crisp, cream colored
           outfit is in sharp contrast to Caleb's shabby, workmanlike
           coveralls.

           Caleb turns his head towards the Receptionist.  He's the
           only other person in the room.  She smiles a receptionist-y
           smile.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Are you Caleb O'Connell?

           Ridiculous as the question seems, Caleb's well versed in
           this type of protocol.  It's the way things are here.  But
           it seems even more pointless than usual today.

                                 CALEB
                        Yes.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Ms. Slater will see you now.  

                                 CALEB
                        Okay.

           Caleb takes a final look at the Omega display before dragging
           himself out of the chair and towards the door.

           INT. SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE

           MARIA SLATER (40s) is watering her plants with a hand held
           mister.  The plants are the only sign of life or warmth in
           the sparse and sterile office.  A light knocking at the door
           as it opens.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Come in.  

           Maria turns, sees Caleb standing in the doorway, peering
           into the office with trepidation.

                                 MARIA SLATER (CONT'D)
                            (smiles)
                        You must be Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        Yes ma'am.
                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Please, sit down.

           Maria gestures to a chair on the other side of her desk. 
           She sits in the chair opposite.  

                                 MARIA SLATER (CONT'D)
                        My name is Maria Slater.  I'm one of
                        the Omega Project Supervisors.

                                 CALEB
                        Yes ma'am.  I know who you are.

           Maria smiles.  She may be a corporate mouthpiece, but there's
           also a genuine warmth, a sense of empathy about her.  She
           reaches into one of the desk drawers and pulls out a generic
           looking chocolate bar.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Would you like some chocolate?  It's
                        real.  We just got a cargo shuttle
                        from Earth.

           Caleb looks at the chocolate.  It barely registers.  Maria
           sets it down on the desk.

                                 MARIA SLATER (CONT'D)
                        Well, I'll just leave it right here.

                                 CALEB
                        Do you know if they burned my dad's
                        body yet?

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        I - believe the cremation is scheduled
                        to take place this afternoon.

                                 CALEB
                        You think I could get some of his
                        ashes?

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Of course.  I'll make sure they're
                        brought up to you.

                                 CALEB
                        I don't need a lot.  Just a little.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Of course.
                            (switching gears)
                        Caleb, are you aware of the death
                        benefits included in your father's
                        contract?
                                 CALEB
                        Yes ma'am.  It said that if he died
                        working in the mines then any
                        immediate family he had here with
                        him would get to go to Omega.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        That's right.  Caleb, I can only
                        imagine how devastating this must
                        be.  I looked at your file.  I
                        understand you lost your mother a
                        few years back.

                                 CALEB
                        Yes ma'am.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Everyone at Omega wants you to know
                        how much we appreciate your father's
                        service and that we are doing everything
                        in our power to ensure that the type
                        of accident that happened last week
                        never, ever happens again.

                                 CALEB
                        Do I have to go?

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Sorry?

                                 CALEB
                        To Omega.  Do I have to go?

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Caleb, going to Omega, that's why your
                        father brought you here.  I understand
                        you'll probably miss your friends -

                                 CALEB
                        I'll never see them again.  You're
                        gonna put me to sleep for seventy-
                        five years and by time I wake up
                        they'll be old or dead.  Can't I
                        just stay here?

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        I'm afraid that's not an option. 
                        Your father sacrificed a great deal
                        in the hopes that one day you'd have
                        this opportunity.  People who work
                        in the mines, they spend years fueling
                        the transports to Omega, all so that
                        one day their own families, their
                        own children, can be on them.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIA SLATER (CONT'D)
                        It's an honor to your dad, to his
                        memory, that you get to go now.

           He still doesn't want to go.  He knows it's pointless to
           argue.

                                 CALEB
                        Yes ma'am.

           Maria sighs.  There's not much more she can do to help.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        I'm sure you've heard we'll be going
                        on lockdown tonight.  We're estimating
                        the storm warning will last about
                        seventy-two hours.  Once it's lifted,
                        we'll have you on the transport ship
                        and on your way.

           Caleb looks up - a panicked look in his eyes.  

                                 CALEB
                        I thought the next transport didn't
                        leave for another two months.

                                 MARIA SLATER
                        Scheduling is always a - fluid thing.
                            (puts a hand on his
                             shoulder)
                        I know it doesn't seem like it right
                        now, but this really is the start of
                        something very special for you Caleb. 
                        It's what your father would have wanted.
                            (smiles)
                        I'm sure you'll make a lot of new
                        friends on Omega.  

           Caleb just stares.  Everything's falling apart.

           INT. LUNAR COLONY

           Caleb walks through "the dome" - the enormous structure that
           houses the colony of miners and their families, along with
           the science and research teams and Omega Project offices.

           It's a mishmash of organized chaos - a lunar city of industry
           where life is boiled down to the essentials and productivity
           is of the highest priority.  This is not a place where
           children stay children very long.

           The infrastructure is a phalanx of girders and scaffolding
           that support the clear dome above.  Caleb's eyes drift to
           one particular section of scaffolding that leads up to one
           of the highest points in the dome.
                                 MAN'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Come on, buddy, you can do it.  Don't
                        be scared.

           INT. DOME, SCAFFOLDING TOWER - FLASHBACK

           We see a Younger Caleb, maybe seven years old, tentatively
           climbing that very same section of scaffolding for the first
           time.  His dad, MICHAEL O'CONNELL is above him, looking down,
           encouraging him. 

                                 YOUNG CALEB
                        What if I fall?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well jeez, that'd be pretty messy
                        wouldn't it?  You don't think that's
                        gonna happen, do you?

           Michael smiles.  It eases Caleb's nerves.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        Hey, we can go back down if you want. 
                        We don't have to do this.  But if we
                        do, you have to do it on your own. 
                        You understand why?

                                 YOUNG CALEB
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You wanna go down?

           Young Caleb thinks for a moment.  Makes a firm decision.

                                 YOUNG CALEB
                        No.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good man.  Come on.

           Michael turns and resumes his climb.  Young Caleb follows
           with a renewed sense of determination.

           INT. DOME, CATWALK

           Back in the present, Caleb reaches the catwalk at the top of
           the scaffolding tower and pulls himself up over the side. 
           He stands at his full height on the catwalk, as close to the
           top of the dome as one can get - all the activity and
           commotion of the colony below left behind.

           From this vantage point, we get our first look at the world
           outside the colony.
           The dome, we see, is built into the floor of an ENORMOUS
           CRATER.  There are sloping access paths carved into the walls
           of the crater, allowing vehicles access to and from the unseen
           surface above.

           Caleb stares out at the world beyond the dome, the walls of
           the crater, the deep void of space, lit by a blanket of stars.

                                 MICHAEL'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        See, you were born here, raised here. 
                        It's the only world you've ever known. 
                        Probably doesn't seem much like it
                        to you -

           INT. CATWALK, SCAFFOLDING TOWER - FLASHBACK

           CALEB'S POV - Michael is sitting beside him.  But this is a
           flashback from a different time, a more recent time.  Michael
           looks broken down, his face lined by years in the mines. 
           He's been drinking.  There is a BITTERNESS in his voice.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But there was a time, long time ago -
                        used to be a helluva thing, livin'
                        on the moon.

           He sighs.  Takes a pull from a rusted silver flask.  

           We hear the faint CLANGING of someone else climbing up the
           scaffolding.  It sounds faint, far away at first - but it
           grows louder, more distinct, until finally -

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Hey -

           INT. CATWALK, SCAFFOLDING TOWER

           Brought back to the present, Caleb turns to see Dylan pull
           himself up onto the catwalk.

           Caleb is holding a small metallic vial in his hands.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Figured I might find you up here.

           Dylan comes over and sits down beside him.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        You go see Ms. Slater?

                                 CALEB
                        Yup.
           Dylan notices the metallic vial in Caleb's hand.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Those the ashes? 
                            (off Caleb's nod)
                        How long we got?

                                 CALEB
                        They're putting me on a transport in
                        seventy two hours.

                                 DYLAN
                        Three days?  That's it?

                                 CALEB
                        As soon as the lockdown is over.  

           Dylan stifles all the emotions that surge up inside.  Focuses
           on the task at hand.  Begins doing calculations in his head.  

                                 DYLAN
                        I don't know if that's gonna be enough
                        time.

                                 CALEB
                        It has to be.

           They look at each other a moment.  Look back out at the stars.

                                 DYLAN
                        Thought it was gonna be longer.  

                                 CALEB
                        Me too.

                                 DYLAN
                        If and when and only then, huh?

                                 CALEB
                        If and when and only then.  

           They both sit there, staring quietly out at the surface of
           the moon until -

           We hear the clanging of someone else climbing up the
           scaffolding.  Two someones in fact.  

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                        Man, this is too high.  Why do they
                        have to go up so high?

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        Just keep going.
                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                        I'm goin', I'm goin'.

           Borney comes up over the edge of the catwalk.

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                            (exasperated)
                        Hey guys.  Whew.  This is high.  How
                        about from now on we do this a little
                        lower to the ground.  How does that
                        sound?

           Marcus comes up behind him.  Takes a seat on the scaffolding. 
           Marcus doesn't talk much.  Borney, on the other hand, has a
           hard time sitting still.   

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                        How'd things go with the dragon lady?

                                 MARCUS
                        That lady scares me.

                                 BORNEY
                        That lady scares everybody.  I heard
                        once there was this kid that talked
                        back to her.  And then he disappeared
                        for two days and when they found him
                        again he couldn't remember a single
                        thing that happened.  He said all he
                        remembered was smelling the dragon
                        lady's perfume seconds before - man,
                        it's hard to even talk about.  Gives
                        me shivers, you know?

           Dylan stares at him with open bewilderment. 

                                 DYLAN
                        You realize not a single thing you
                        just said is true, right?

                                 BORNEY
                        Yeah, maybe, or maybe it's all true. 
                        What do you know?

                                 DYLAN
                        I know you're an idiot.

                                 BORNEY
                        Well, maybe YOU'RE an idiot.  You
                        ever think of that?
                            (to Caleb)
                        Seriously, what was she like?
                                 CALEB
                        She was okay.  She gave me a chocolate
                        bar.

                                 BORNEY
                        Shut up, really?  Like actual real
                        chocolate?  

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, you want it?

           Caleb fishes the chocolate bar out of his pocket and tosses
           it to Borney. 

           Borney fumbles the catch and the chocolate bar hits the
           scaffolding and almost clatters off the edge!  Borney
           scrambles for it -

                                 BORNEY
                        No, no, no -

           He grabs it, almost falling off the scaffolding himself in
           the meantime!  Marcus grabs him and pulls him back - for a
           big guy, he's incredibly quick.

                                 DYLAN
                        What the hell man!

                                 BORNEY
                        Sorry.
                            (to Marcus)
                        Thanks pal. 
                            (to the chocolate bar)
                        Man, real chocolate.  I can't even
                        remember the last time I had real
                        chocolate.

           Borney eagerly begins unwrapping the chocolate bar when he
           notices that no one else is excited (Marcus already picked
           up on the somber vibe).

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                        Wait a second, what's goin' on? 
                        What's wrong with you guys?

                                 DYLAN
                        He's leaving in three days.

                                 BORNEY
                        Three days?  I though the next transport
                        didn't leave for another two months.

                                 CALEB
                        They're sending one out as soon as
                        the storm warnings clear.
                                 BORNEY
                        What storm warnings?

           Dylan sighs.

                                 DYLAN
                        There's a meteor shower alert.  The
                        whole colony's going on lockdown in
                        a few hours.  Don't you pay attention?

                                 BORNEY
                        Sure I do.  We were busy is all.

                                 DYLAN
                        Doing what?

           Borney frowns.

                                 MARCUS
                        I dropped my shoe down the air shaft.

                                 DYLAN
                        What?  How?

           Marcus shrugs, as though it needs no further explanation. 
           Borney changes the subject.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Man, I'm sorry Caleb.  I know how
                        much getting out to the caves meant
                        to you.

                                 CALEB
                        We're still doing it.  We're leaving
                        tonight.

                                 BORNEY
                        Umm, what?  You just said --

                                 DYLAN
                        They issue those storm warnings all
                        the time and they never actually happen. 
                        They HAVE to put the dome on lockdown -
                        it's like an insurance thing or
                        something.  Doesn't change a thing.  

                                 BORNEY
                            (unconvinced)
                        I guess.

                                 CALEB
                        It's kinda the perfect time to do it. 
                        Once the lockdown starts no one's
                        allowed to leave, not even security.
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        So once we get to the surface they
                        can't come after us.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Besides, we already got the suits,
                        the rations and the tanks, right?  

                                 BORNEY
                        Well yeah, but we still don't have
                        codes for the garage.  How are we
                        gonna get out?    

                                 DYLAN
                            (smiles)
                        I got an idea about that.

           INT. LUNAR COLONY, COMMISSARY

           Addison Plath, the girl we saw with the boys in the beginning,
           is sitting alone at one of the tables, eating her lunch and
           absently manipulating an interactive 3D Projection of an atom. 

           The image is being projected by a small device roughly the
           size and shape of an Oreo cookie.  In fact, that's what we'll
           call it.  THE OREO.  She's still wearing those rather unique
           horn-rimmed reading glasses/swimmer's goggles.

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                        That's your idea?

           Caleb, Dylan, Borney and Marcus are huddled around a table
           across the commissary.  Borney is staring at Addison in open
           exasperation.  Dylan gives him a smack on the shoulder.

                                 DYLAN
                        Don't stare, stupid.  Yes, that's my
                        idea.

                                 BORNEY
                        Addison Plath?

                                 DYLAN
                        It's perfect.  She just came up from
                        Earth a couple months ago.  Doesn't
                        have any friends.  Like, at all.  So
                        she's lonely, right?  She'll probably
                        trip all over herself wanting to help
                        us just for paying attention to her.

                                 BORNEY
                        I hear she's weird.
                                 DYLAN
                        You're weird.  We hang out with you,
                        don't we?

                                 CALEB
                        Addison's dad is on the science team. 
                        That means she's got access codes to
                        all the sub-basement garages.

                                 MARCUS
                        It feels wrong.

           Everyone stops.  Marcus doesn't speak up very often.

                                 CALEB
                        Why?

                                 MARCUS
                        Like you said.  She has no friends. 
                        Seems like you're taking advantage of
                        her.

           Caleb and Dylan both look a little guilty - the same thought
           has clearly crossed their minds.  

                                 CALEB
                        Look, it's not - we don't have a
                        choice.  Any other chance we'd have
                        at getting the codes would take too
                        long.

                                 DYLAN
                        We can all do something really nice
                        for her when we get back.  But right
                        now it's the only way we get to do
                        this.

           Marcus can't really argue with that.  He nods.  Dylan gathers
           himself up, stands and heads over towards Addison's table.

           Meanwhile... 

           Over at Addison's table, she looks up and sees Dylan approach
           through the image of the 3D atom.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                            (charming smile)
                        Hi.

           Addison raises an eyebrow.  She twists the top of the "Oreo"
           and the projection of the atom disappears.

                                 ADDISON
                        Can I help you?
           The response takes Dylan by surprise.  He's used to girls
           wilting at his approach.  He tries to pivot and turn up the
           charm. 

                                 DYLAN
                        My name's Dylan.

                                 ADDISON
                        Yes, I know who you are.

                                 DYLAN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 ADDISON
                        Why wouldn't I?  We all live together
                        in a giant dome.    

                                 DYLAN
                        Right.  Umm, listen, I just --

                                 ADDISON
                        What do you want?

                                 DYLAN
                        What?

                                 ADDISON
                        Kids only talk to me when they want
                        something.  I know the way you guys
                        all think.  I'm the Earth girl.  The
                        spoiled kid whose dad's a scientist. 
                        So you all move around in your little
                        cliques treating me like I'm some sort
                        of leper until you need something.

                                 DYLAN
                        What's a leper?

                                 ADDISON
                            (rolls her eyes)
                        Whatever it is the answer's no.

                                 DYLAN
                            (flustered)
                        Okay, hold on, first of all, you
                        don't know why I came over here. 
                        Maybe I came over here because you
                        looked lonely and I feel bad that no
                        one ever talks to you.

                                 ADDISON
                        Yeah?  Well, in that case, I don't
                        need your pity.
           Dylan's at a complete loss.  He has no idea what to do, what
           to say.  He's never encountered anything like this before.

                                 DYLAN
                        You're mean.

           Addison waits for him to follow up.  He doesn't.

                                 ADDISON
                        Great.  So was that it?  Thanks for
                        stopping by.

           Addison twists the Oreo and the image of the atom reappears.

           Meanwhile... The other boys try to be inconspicuous as they
           watch from their table across the commissary.

                                 BORNEY
                        I don't think it's going very well.

           They watch Dylan stand at the table somewhat awkwardly. 

           Back at Addison's table, Dylan's teenage mind is running
           through possible solutions to this unexpected nightmare
           scenario.  He glances back across the commissary at Caleb -
           remembers what's at stake. 

           Addison glances up, takes in the curious phenomena that is a
           speechless Dylan as though she'd just stumbled upon a three
           headed monkey in a zoo. 

           Dylan turns back to the table.  Looks squarely at Addison. 
           Sits down across from her.  

                                 ADDISON
                        What are you doing?

                                 DYLAN
                        Okay, just -

           He's looking at her through the Oreo's 3D projection. 
           Flustered, he moves it aside.

                                 ADDISON
                        Hey -

                                 DYLAN
                        Just hear me out.  You see my friend
                        over there?

           Addison looks over at the boys' table, catches all three of
           them watching her.  Borney and Marcus quickly and awkwardly
           avert their eyes.  Caleb is the only one who holds her gaze.
                                 ADDISON
                        Yeah, so?

                                 DYLAN
                        His dad was one of the miners that
                        got killed last week.

           Addison wasn't expecting that.  Her defenses soften a bit.

                                 ADDISON
                        Oh.  I didn't - I'm sorry.

           Back at the table with the other boys.  Borney is still
           looking away.

                                 BORNEY
                        Is she still looking?

                                 CALEB
                        No Borney, you're all clear.

           He looks back over.

                                 BORNEY
                        Oh, well, that looks like it's going
                        better.

           Back with Dylan and Addison.

                                 ADDISON
                        So what do you need the codes for?

                                 DYLAN
                            (lowers his voice)
                        We need to - borrow - one of the
                        long range rovers.

                                 ADDISON
                        Why?

                                 DYLAN
                        Because we gotta go somewhere.

                                 ADDISON
                        Where you going?

                                 DYLAN
                            (getting frustrated)
                        Look, it's not important, okay?

                                 ADDISON
                        It is if you want the codes.

           Dylan sighs.  His face a picture of consternation.  This is
           a lot harder than he thought it'd be.
                                 DYLAN
                        Okay, listen, there's a couple caves
                        about fifteen miles outside the dome. 
                        His dad always wanted to take him
                        there.  Now he can't and my friend's
                        leaving for Omega in three days and -

                                 ADDISON
                        What's in the caves?

                                 DYLAN
                        What?

                                 ADDISON
                        Why did they wanna go see a bunch of
                        caves?  What's so special about them?

                                 DYLAN
                        I don't know, ask him if you want. 
                        Look, all we need are the codes - one
                        that'll get us into the sub-garage and
                        the other to open the access tunnel
                        that leads outside.
                            (off her hesitation)
                        He's been my best friend since we were
                        six years old and three days from now
                        I'm never gonna see him again.  I'll
                        trade you anything I have.  We all
                        will. 
                            (genuine)
                        Please.

           Addison looks from Dylan to Caleb and back.  Then --

                                 ADDISON
                        Are you fibbing?

                                 DYLAN
                        Am I what?

                                 ADDISON
                        Are you telling the truth?

                                 DYLAN
                        Of course I'm telling the truth. 
                        Look, you're the only shot we have
                        at making this happen.

           Addison contemplates.  Dylan holds his breath.  Then --

                                 ADDISON
                        Fine.  I'll get you the codes.

                                 DYLAN
                        Really?
                                 ADDISON
                        On one condition.

                                 DYLAN
                        Yeah, anything.

                                 ADDISON
                        I get to go with you.

                                 DYLAN
                            (caught off guard)
                        What?  Why?

                                 ADDISON
                        Not important.  Those are my terms. 
                        If you want the codes for your little
                        trip, then you have to take me with
                        you.

           Dylan has no idea what to do.  He racks his brain for some
           sort of logical objection and then - he's got it.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Look, you can't come.  We don't have
                        a suit for you.  There's no way we'd
                        have time to -

                                 ADDISON
                        That's okay, I've got one.  

           Dylan's face falls.  He's trapped.  Addison smiles.  Dylan
           weighs his options.  Looks back at the guys.

                                 DYLAN
                            (to Addison)
                        I'll be right back.

           INT. COMMISSARY - MOMENTS LATER

           The four boys are "in conference" at their table.

                                 BORNEY
                        Are you nuts?  This is not a good
                        idea.  This is like the worst idea
                        ever.

                                 DYLAN
                        Why?

                                 BORNEY
                        Because we'll be gone overnight. 
                        With a girl.

                                 DYLAN
                        Yeah, and?
                                 BORNEY
                        What if we have to go to the bathroom? 
                        I can't, you know, do certain stuff
                        with a girl around.

                                 CALEB
                        Borney, you don't think she'll have
                        to do the same stuff?

                                 BORNEY
                            (horrified)
                        Jeez, I never thought of that.  She
                        definitely can't come. 

           Meanwhile, back at her table, Addison watches the animated
           debate ensue and shakes her head, rolls her eyes.  Boys.

           Back at the boys' table -

                                 CALEB
                        Why does she even want to come?  Her
                        dad's on the science team.  She can
                        pretty much go wherever she wants.

                                 DYLAN
                        I don't know man, she's a girl. 
                        When was the last time a girl did
                        anything that made sense to you?

                                 BORNEY
                        This is bad.  What if she's coming
                        as a spy?  What if she's planning to
                        sabotage the Rover while we're out
                        there in the middle of nowhere and
                        then kill us?
                            (off their looks)
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                            (to Dylan)
                        Okay, look, there's no way she'll
                        give us the codes unless we let her
                        come, right?

                                 DYLAN
                        Pretty much.

                                 CALEB
                        Then we vote.  All in favor?

           Caleb, Dylan and Marcus all put their hands in the center of
           the circle.
                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                            (to Borney)
                        It's gotta be unanimous.

                                 DYLAN
                        Borney, put your stupid hand in.

           Borney begrudgingly puts his hand in.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        If and when and only then.

                                 BORNEY
                            (sighs)
                        If and when and only then.

                                 MARCUS
                        If and when and only then.

           For Caleb, these words carry a greater meaning now.

                                 CALEB
                        If and when and only then.

           Dylan nods.  This is their thing.  Like a clubhouse mantra.  

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                        Seriously?

           They turn to find an unimpressed Addison standing there.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        You guys have a secret handshake? 
                        So lame.  So what's it gonna be?

                                 CALEB
                            (smiles)
                        Let's go steal us a Rover.

           Addison smiles as -

           SFX: THE Rover's ALARM SHATTERS THE MOMENT!  

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. SUB-GARAGE - NIGHT

           We're back in the garage where we started.  The kids are
           frantically trying to find the "off-switch" for the alarm.

                                 BORNEY
                        I told you!  What did I say?  I said
                        this was a bad idea.  
                                 DYLAN
                        Borney, you're not helping, so why
                        don't you --

           A TEARING SOUND.  The alarm cuts out.  The group looks over
           to where Caleb has pulled a handful of wires out from under
           the console.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, that'll work.

                                 BORNEY
                        You think anyone heard?

                                 DYLAN
                        I don't know.  Like I said, these
                        models aren't wired to the main
                        system.  We could be ok.

           The PA system clicks on with a monotone announcement.  

                                 PUBLIC ADDRESS (O.S.)
                        Attention all personnel, mandatory
                        lockdown of all dome facilities will
                        commence in T-minus fifteen minutes.

                                 CALEB
                        We should go.

                                 ADDISON
                        Oh, gee, you think? 

           Addison shoves into the Rover past Caleb.  Caleb and Dylan
           share a look.

           Borney follows Addison in, still wearing the burlap sack on
           his head.  Dylan yanks it off.

           INT. ACCESS TUNNEL

           The Rover starts and stops and jerks and lurches as it makes
           it's way down the long tunnel.  Imagine a young driver
           learning stick shift for the first time and not doing
           particularly well...

           INT. ROVER

           Dylan is at the controls, growing increasingly frustrated as
           both Addison and Borney play backseat driver.

                                 ADDISON
                        No, you're not -
                                 BORNEY
                        I think that you're supposed to press
                        the button and pull the lever at the
                        same time.

                                 DYLAN
                        That's what I'm doing.

                                 ADDISON
                        I thought you said you knew how to
                        drive one of these things.
                            (off Dylan's look, if
                             looks could kill)
                        Well you did.

                                 DYLAN
                        Let me just --
                            (grinds the controls)
                        Come on --

                                 BORNEY
                        I'm pretty sure if you press the
                        button and pull the lever -

                                 DYLAN
                        I told you I'M DOING IT AT THE SAME --

           And then the gears shift into place.  The Rover begins running
           smoothly.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        There we go.  See?  Just like getting
                        out of bed.  A little sleepy at first
                        and then -

           The Rover LURCHES again.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                            (off Addison's look)
                        I got it, okay?

                                 ADDISON
                        I didn't say anything.

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The Rover is moving smoothly now.  It begins to slow as it
           approaches the tunnel's sealed exit doors.  

           INT. ROVER

           Dylan brings the Rover to a stop, lets out a deep breath. 
           Through the Rover's "windshield" we can see the heavy doors
           looming ahead.  
                                 DYLAN
                        This is it.

           Dylan, Caleb, Borney and Marcus all go quiet, staring out at
           the doors with a kind of awed reverence.  

                                 ADDISON
                            (confused)
                        Whatsamatter?

                                 DYLAN
                        Nothin'.  Just never been outside
                        the dome before.

                                 ADDISON
                        Seriously?  Wait a second, have any
                        of you?
                            (off their silence)
                        Really?

                                 BORNEY
                        They don't exactly take mining kids
                        on field trips.

           She waits for one of them to move, to do something.  

                                 ADDISON
                        Guess I'll open the doors then.

                                 CALEB
                        No.  I'll do it.

           She's about to make another wise-ass remark when she sees
           the look on his face and it sinks in just how huge a moment
           this really is for all of them.  She nods her head.   

           INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

           The door to the Rover opens and Caleb exits into the tunnel,
           wearing his space suit.  He touches down on the ground and
           looks at the access doors.  This is a big moment.

           Note about the spacesuits - these are not the traditional
           suits you see today with bulky appendages and a dome-like
           visor.  These are more streamlined, resembling something
           like space-aged coveralls with a clear high density plastic
           facemask that leaves the entire face visible.  Thus the
           movements of the actors are not overly restricted and their
           full range of emotion is visible whether they are in the
           Rover or in their suits outside.

           INT. ROVER - NIGHT

           The boys watch Caleb progress toward the doors.  Addison
           watches the boys watching Caleb, fascinated.
           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE ROVER AND THE TUNNEL AS NECESSARY.

           INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Caleb makes his way to the control panel beside the access
           doors.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay.  Gimme the code.

           In the Rover, Addison steps up to the control panel.

                                 ADDISON
                        Can you hear me?

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Yeah.

                                 ADDISON
                        The code is 10, 28, 58.

                                 DYLAN
                        The day they commissioned the colony.

                                 ADDISON
                        Somebody knows their history.

                                 DYLAN
                        We're not stupid, you know.

           He says it with a surprising sincerity that catches her off
           guard.  

                                 ADDISON
                        I know, that's - it's not what I
                        meant, I -

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        10, 28, 58.  Got it.

           In the tunnel Caleb stares at the control panel.  Hesitating.

                                 MICHAEL'S VOICE (V.O.)
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        You know, your granddad -

           INT. CATWALK, SCAFFOLDING TOWER - FLASHBACK

           We're back on the catwalk with Michael and Caleb.  Michael
           staring out at the inky void, grizzled, broken, taking a
           pull from his rusted flask.
                                 MICHAEL
                        He waited his whole damn life for a
                        chance to live on the moon.  Put his
                        number in the day he turned sixteen,
                        first year of eligibility back then. 
                        Course, that was when everyone wanted
                        to be here.  Before Omega became the
                        thing that made all this seem common. 
                        Pedestrian.  

           INT. REGISTRATION OFFICE, EARTH - FLASHBACK

           A CHILD'S POV.  The images should be hazy, half-remembered;
           the fragments and whispers of old ghosts.  This is not the
           moon.  This is Earth.  Michael's memory of Earth as a child.

           Long lines of tired, hopeful people, queued up in a DMV type
           building, waiting for their turn at the counter.

           Note about the flashbacks: though these are faded flashbacks
           of Earth, they should possess an ambiguously futuristic feel;
           recognizable as the world we know, though they come from
           some indeterminate time in the future.    

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        People'd queue up for hours just to
                        get their name in the system.  Every
                        year I'd go back with him - 

           Now Michael is looking up at his father, whose face we don't
           see.  Instead we see the types of arbitrary details we never
           expect to remember: the black, wiry hair on his arms, the
           crows feet in the corners of his eyes, oil stains on his
           pants, the rough skin on the backs of his hands.  The tiny
           details that made the man his dad.     

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        - just to see how many spots his name
                        had moved up the waiting list.  Waited
                        his whole damn life, and he was still
                        talkin' about it the day he died.

           INT. CATWALK, SCAFFOLDING TOWER - FLASHBACK

           We're back with Michael and Caleb.  Michael turns to look at
           his son.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        We're gonna make that right someday. 
                        Before we get off this rock, go to
                        Omega, you and me are gonna make that
                        right.

                                 CALEB
                        How?
                                 MICHAEL
                            (smiles wistfully)
                        You and me are gonna take a road trip.

                                 CALEB
                        What's a road trip?

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Caleb!

           INT. ACCESS TUNNEL

           Addison's voice brings Caleb back to the present. 

                                 ADDISON
                            (via comm)
                        You okay out there?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah.  I'm - uh - just a second.

           Caleb takes a deep breath.  Punches in the numbers.  He looks
           at the button for the release valve.  Presses it.

           Caleb stands completely still, watching with awe-struck
           anticipation as the doors begin to open.

           INT. ROVER

           Inside the Rover, the faces of the other three boys mirror
           Caleb's.  Addison smiles a genuine smile, getting to see the
           wonder of a mundane act through their eyes.

           INT. TUNNEL

           Wide shot of Caleb standing before the opening doors, the
           Rover in the foreground as the surface of the moon and the
           infinite void beyond is revealed.

                                 ADDISON
                            (via comm)
                        Umm, I don't mean to spoil the moment -

                                 CALEB
                            (smiles)
                        I'm comin', I'm comin'.

           He takes one last look at the opening doors, relishing the
           moment, before turning back towards the Rover.  

           INT. ROVER - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb hurries in through the Rover's airlock, pulling off
           his facemask.
                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                        You in?

                                 CALEB
                        Wait, wait, wait, don't go yet!

           He almost trips over himself as he races to the front.  

                                 DYLAN
                            (to Caleb)
                        What's wrong?

           Caleb tears open his satchel, starts digging around -

                                 CALEB
                        One second, I just need to -

           He finds what he's looking for and pulls out - a MOONMAN
           BOBBLEHEAD.  It's gotta be at least fifty, sixty years old. 
           He gingerly mounts it on the "dashboard" of the Rover.  The
           other boys seem to know what this represents.   

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        Now we can go.

           Dylan smiles and puts the Rover into gear.  CLASSIC AMERICANA
           ROAD TRIP MUSIC begins to play as the Rover moves towards
           the wide open doors.

           INT. TUNNEL

           The MUSIC CONTINUES as we watch the Rover pass beyond the
           confines of the tunnel and into the world outside.

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        A road trip's something we used to
                        do back on Earth.  Guess you might
                        say it was a tradition for us back
                        then.  

           INT. ROVER

           We pan across the faces of the kids - the looks of nervous
           anticipation mixed with wide-eyed excitement - as the Rover
           clears the doors and the lunar landscape opens up around
           them.  

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        Sorta thing that lets you leave behind
                        everything you think you are.  Maybe
                        even get a glimpse of who you're
                        gonna be someday.
           INSERT - FLASHBACK, SERIES OF IMAGES - MUSIC CONTINUES

           We're back on Earth, staring out the window of a futuristic
           eighteen wheeler as it rolls through the countryside.  A hazy,
           half-remembered view, like old film faded into the past.

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Your granddad, he was a long haul
                        trucker.  Used to take me with him
                        on runs from time to time.

           A young boy's arm propped on the open windowsill of the truck,
           letting the wind blow throw his fingers.  

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        We'd drive for days, weeks sometimes,
                        going all over the country.

           A Moonman bobblehead fixed to the dashboard - the SAME
           BOBBLEHEAD Caleb pulled out of his satchel.

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Nothin' fancy - warehouses, shipping
                        docks, places like that.

           POV of Michael's father, sitting in the driver's seat, his
           face obscured by the glaring sun streaming in the window. 

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But he always said the best part of
                        where you're going is how you got
                        there...

           INT. ROVER

           Dylan looks over at Caleb and they share a wide, mischievous 
           grin.  Borney, Marcus and even Addison are on the edge of
           their seats.  

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        And who you got there with.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The Rover has reached the crater wall and begun its ascent
           up the sloping access path to the surface.

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        He said someday we'd take a road
                        trip on the moon -

           INT. ROVER

           Caleb stares intently out the Rover's windshield.  They're
           about to crest the top of the path - they're almost there!  
                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        And we'd be like masters of our own
                        fate.

           And then -

           The joy turns to panic and despair.  

                                 DYLAN
                        No.  No, no, no, no -

           A REVERSE ANGLE reveals -

           An RETRACTABLE GATE of dense, interlocking iron bars closing
           in from either side of the path - they're sealing the exit!

                                 ADDISON
                        You didn't say there were gates up
                        here!

                                 DYLAN
                        I didn't know there were!

           The gate is closing fast!  They're too far away!

                                 BORNEY
                        Go faster, go faster!

                                 ADDISON
                        We're not gonna make it.

                                 CALEB
                        Yes we are!

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        So before we go to Omega, that's
                        what you and me are gonna do.

           INT. CATWALK, SCAFFOLDING TOWER - FLASHBACK

           Michael pulls the Moonman bobblehead from the pocket of his
           coveralls, hands it to Caleb.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We're gonna take your granddad on a
                        road trip.  

           INT. ROVER

           A SCREECHING of metal on metal!

                                 CALEB
                        Come on -
           The Rover is passing between the closing iron bars even as
           they begin pressing in against the Rover's sides!!!

           Dylan has all his weight against the steering column, but
           it's not enough!  Caleb throws himself against the column as
           well!  And then Marcus and Borney and Addison!  All five of
           them, pushing against the column with everything they have,
           willing it to go further, until finally -

                                 MICHAEL (V.O.)
                        And we're gonna be masters of our
                        fate.

           The Rover breaks free!!!  

                                 DYLAN
                        Whoooooo!!!!!

           The kids erupt in celebration as the Rover surges forward
           into the open!

                                 ADDISON
                            (disbelief)
                        We did it.

                                 DYLAN
                        Damn right we did!

           Borney scrambles towards the back of the Rover, shouting at
           the colony behind them.

                                 BORNEY
                        How do you like that, huh?!  You
                        think you can stop us?!?!  You can't
                        stop us!!!

           As the celebration continues, Caleb looks out the side window
           and the joy on his face turns bittersweet.

                                 DYLAN
                        Man, I thought those bars were gonna
                        tear right through this thing!  I
                        mean did you hear that?  We almost -

           Dylan turns, sees what Caleb sees and some of his joy fades
           as well.

           A REVERSE ANGLE reveals, off in the distance, a large platform
           with four sturdy pillars, one at each corner.

           The other kids have noticed too, the celebration dying down. 
           Everyone but Addison seems to know what's going on.

                                 ADDISON
                        What's wrong?  What is that?
                                 BORNEY
                            (quietly)
                        The launch site.  That's where the
                        transport ship takes off from.

                                 ADDISON
                            (she gets it)
                        Oh.

           Dylan puts a hand on Caleb's shoulder.

                                 DYLAN
                        Hey, screw'em, right?

                                 BORNEY
                        Yeah, screw'em, man!  This is gonna
                        be so awesome.  We're like, like
                        adventurers now!  Like -

                                 CALEB
                            (quietly, reverently)
                        Like masters of our fate.

                                 BORNEY
                            (smiles, relishing
                             the words)
                        Yeah.  Masters of our fate.

           Caleb looks at the Moonman on the dashboard, turns away from
           the window with a wry grin on his face.

                                 CALEB
                        Let's get the hell out of here.

           Dylan smiles, puts the Rover back in gear. 

                                 DYLAN
                        You guys ready to see the moon?

                                 BORNEY
                        Whoo-hooo!!!!

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The Rover gets underway, the dome and the past behind them -
           nothing but the wonderful unknown ahead.

           INT. ROVER - TRAVEL SEQUENCE

           As the Rover makes its way along the rocky lunar surface, we
           see the kids staring out the windows with wide eyes, excitedly
           pointing out the sights they see to each other - cool rock
           formations, cliffs, mountains, etc.  A whole new world they've
           waited their whole lives to see.
           At one point Borney takes a turn trying to drive the Rover
           and does a terrible job, much to Dylan's satisfaction, while
           Marcus sits in the background wearing Borney's burlap hood
           for no particular reason.

           Caleb looks back from the passenger seat at the faces of his
           friends, the joy and awe in their expressions, staring out
           the windows at the landscape that surrounds them.

           Addison however, looks a bit out of place.  A little
           uncomfortable.  Like she knows she doesn't quite belong there. 
           She looks at Caleb and smiles an awkward, nervous smile. 
           Caleb smiles in return, she's human after all.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - LATER

           The Rover continues to rumble along.  

                                 BORNEY'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        So what are some of the biggest
                        differences between Earth and the moon?

           INT. ROVER

           The kids are settled in now, the initial burst of excitement
           has passed.  Dylan is still in the driver's seat, Caleb
           sitting beside him.  Borney, Marcus and Addison are in the
           "common" area of the Rover, directly behind the cockpit. 

           Marcus is the only one still staring out the window, his
           eyes glued to the passing lunar landscape.

           Addison is staring at Borney, wondering if he's kidding.  

                                 ADDISON
                        Seriously?

                                 BORNEY
                        Yeah, why?

                                 ADDISON
                        Well, I mean, isn't that kinda
                        obvious?

           Borney gets a confused, slightly embarrassed look on his
           face.

                                 BORNEY
                        Oh.  Yeah, sure, I mean, of course I
                        know what they are, I was just
                        wondering, you know, what you think.

           Addison isn't sure if he's messing with her or not.  In the
           driver's seat, Dylan and Caleb roll their eyes.
                                 ADDISON
                        Okay, let's start with the obvious. 
                        You have no parks, you have no beaches,
                        you have no movie theaters, you have
                        no television, no television shows,
                        you have no books, no music, no swimming
                        pools, no seasons, which means you
                        have no rain or snow or leaves that
                        change colors in the fall, you also
                        have no trees, no grass, no culture -
                        I mean, you realize the moon is
                        absolutely nothing like Earth right?

                                 BORNEY
                        Well duh.

                                 ADDISON
                        You don't know anything about Earth,
                        do you?

                                 BORNEY
                        Sure I do.  I know plenty.

                                 ADDISON
                        Oh yeah?  What's the difference
                        between summer and winter?

           Borney shifts a bit uncomfortably.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Oh, come on, at least give me a hard
                        one.

           She stares at him waiting for an answer.  Her jaw dropping
           in disbelief when it becomes apparent he doesn't know.

                                 ADDISON
                        How can you not now this?  Do any of
                        you -

                                 CALEB
                            (annoyed)
                        Winter's cold, summer's hot.
                            (turns in his seat to
                             face her)
                        Don't be a jerk about it.

                                 ADDISON
                        No, I wasn't - I thought you were
                        messing with me.  I mean, you guys
                        go to school up here, right?

                                 DYLAN
                        Sure.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        That's where they teach us how to
                        mine helium, safety procedures for
                        working in the mines and mining
                        helium, how to handle helium once
                        it's been mined and, oh yeah, every
                        now and then we get to watch practice
                        demonstrations of the miners mining
                        helium.  It's a really great program.

           Addison looks around at the boys, convinced they're messing
           with her.  

                                 ADDISON
                        That can't be all they teach you.
                            (to Caleb)
                        Come on, if that's true, then how do
                        you know stuff about Earth?

                                 CALEB
                        Because my dad grew up there.

                                 ADDISON
                        So?  Didn't all your parents grow up
                        on Earth?

                                 DYLAN
                        Gee.  Not mine.  My grandparents did
                        though.  Borney over there, his -

                                 BORNEY
                        Great grandparents.

                                 DYLAN
                        Right.  Great grandparents did and
                        Marcus?  Marcus, how long's your
                        family been on the rock?

                                 MARCUS
                        Long time.

           Addison rolls her eyes, refusing to be the butt of a joke.

                                 ADDISON
                        That doesn't even make sense.  It's
                        a twenty-five year contract.  You
                        work twenty-five years in the mines,
                        then you get to take your family to
                        Omega.

                                 DYLAN
                        Sure, that's what they tell you.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        What they don't tell you is that every
                        time you're late for a shift, every
                        time you get a cold, every time you
                        delay production in any way, they add
                        time to your contract.  Before you
                        know it you worked ten out of twenty-
                        five years and you still have thirty
                        left to go.  How many people you think
                        actually finish the contract?

           Addison isn't sure what's going on - she was positive they
           were messing with her but now Dylan seems like he's getting
           upset.

                                 ADDISON
                        I don't --

                                 DYLAN
                        You know my old man, when he started
                        in the mines, he had six years to work
                        off from his dad before he could even
                        start on his own twenty five.  Marcus? 
                        Forget about him.  His dad's still
                        working off years his grandfather left
                        on the table.  So maybe don't talk
                        about how awesome the contract is they
                        offer folks, okay? 

           Addison looks around at their faces.  Marcus is still staring
           out the window.  

                                 ADDISON
                        You guys really aren't joking?

                                 BORNEY
                        My mom says most people come up and
                        really want to do their best, but
                        working in the mines wears them down
                        and they end up losing hope.

                                 DYLAN
                        The whole thing's bullshit.

           A silence falls over the Rover.  No sound but the sound of
           the engine as it climbs over the uneven terrain. 

                                 ADDISON
                        I'm sorry.  I didn't know.

                                 CALEB
                            (making peace)
                        The caves we're going to?  People call
                        them the Remembrance Caves.

                        They opened them back when they were
                        still planning to build a city up here. 
                        Before they discovered Omega.  It was
                        supposed to be a museum of Earth
                        history.  My dad told me when they
                        shut it down they just left behind all
                        the stuff that was already inside. 
                        It's the only piece of Earth we have
                        up here. 

                                 BORNEY
                            (excited)
                        Yeah, and then people just started
                        leaving other stuff there.  Tell her
                        about the stuff they'd leave there.

                                 CALEB
                        My dad said that for a while it became
                        kind of a tradition for people that
                        were stopping here on their way to
                        Omega.  Before they left the moon on
                        the transport ships, they'd visit
                        the caves and they'd leave a little
                        something behind.  A little piece of
                        Earth.  I'm not really sure why.

                                 MARCUS
                        My mom said it was to grant them
                        luck and safe passage on their journey
                        to Omega.

           Once again, the normally quiet and reserved Marcus has
           interjected a thoughtful commentary.  He's still staring out
           the window, transfixed by the passing landscape of the moon.

                                 BORNEY
                        I bet there's treasure there.

                                 DYLAN
                        You think there's treasure everywhere.

                                 BORNEY
                        But there is!  There's always treasure
                        in places like that.  It's how it works.

                                 DYLAN
                        If there was any damn treasure they
                        would have packed it up and put it
                        on a ship to Omega years ago.

                                 BORNEY
                        You don't know.  You think you know
                        everything.

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                        When I find the treasure I'm not letting
                        you have any of it.  And you're gonna
                        get alllll sad and say, "Aw jeez Borney. 
                        I'm sorry I didn't believe you.  Can I
                        pleeeeease have some of the treasure?" 
                        And I'm gonna say "sorry Dylan, you're
                        just gonna have to put a little more
                        faith in me next time and maybe then
                        I'll give you some of my NEXT treasure."

           Dylan can't help but smile, the mood lightened.  Borney has
           that affect on people.  

                                 DYLAN
                        If you say treasure one more time I'm
                        throwing you out of the Rover without
                        a suit.

           Silence.  All eyes on Borney.

                                 BORNEY
                        Treasure.

           Dylan throws the Rover into park and jumps up from the
           driver's seat.

                                 DYLAN
                        That's it!  You're goin' outside!

           Dylan playfully jumps on Borney, Marcus jumps on Dylan. 
           Caleb looks across the melee at Addison.  They share a brief
           moment.  Addison smiles.  Caleb jumps on the pile.  And they
           all fall on top of Addison.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay!  Okay!  Wait, wait, wait! 
                        Speaking of going outside -

           Dylan scrambles to his feet, grabs one of the space suits.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                            (devilish grin)
                        You guys ready to have some real fun?

           Smiles all around.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The Rover sits idle.  The door still closed.

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                        Wow.  
           INT. ROVER

           They're all suited up - the boys are all wearing second or
           third generation hand-me-down suits, incredibly shabby
           compared to Addison's much newer and much higher grade suit. 

           Borney stares at Addison self-consciously.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Your suit's a lot nicer than ours.

           Addison's not really sure how to reply to that.  Sorry?

                                 ADDISON
                        Umm, so who wants to do the honors?

                                 CALEB
                        Marcus.  You should go first.

           Marcus looks at him, surprised.

                                 DYLAN
                        Yeah man.  Definitely.

           They're giving him the Neil Armstrong moment.  He's not sure
           what to say.

                                 MARCUS
                        Ok.  

           He walks to the control panel that operates the door.  He's
           not sure which button to hit.  Addison steps up and helps
           him.

                                 ADDISON
                        Just press that and pull the lever.

           Marcus nods.  This is a big moment for him.

           He presses the button, then puts his hand on the lever. 
           Stares at it a moment.  Solemnly.  Reverently.

           EXT. MOON SURFACE

           The door to the Rover opens and Marcus walks down the ramp,
           slowly, his eyes wide as saucers.  Big, strong, quiet Marcus,
           staring in childlike awe at the wonders of the moon. 

           One by one, the kids disembark behind him - taking their
           first steps out onto the surface.  Even Addison is a bit
           awed. 

                                 ADDISON
                        It's so beautiful out here.
                                 CALEB
                            (smiles)
                        Bet you don't get anything like this
                        on Earth, huh?

           Addison returns the smile.  Then smacks Caleb on the arm and
           starts moving away from the group - as quickly as one can in
           the low gravity of the moon that is.

                                 ADDISON
                        You're it!

           She looks back, expecting them to give chase.  The boys just
           stand there staring at her.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        Seriously?  You guys don't even play
                        tag up here?
                            (sighs)
                        Okay, you know what?  I'm gonna show
                        you something that'll blow your minds.

           She turns and heads back to the Rover.

                                 CALEB
                        Where you going?

                                 ADDISON
                        We need a bat!

                                 DYLAN
                        A what?   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A confused Marcus holding a metal rod in his giant hands
           like a baseball bat.  Sort of.  The grip is awkward.  He has
           no idea what he's doing.  Addison is lined up about twenty
           feet away, a moon rock in her hand.  She lines up like a
           pitcher, scrapes her foot on "the mound".

           Borney is about ten feet behind Addison, in the "outfield",
           and he's clearly not sure what that means.

           Dylan and Caleb watch from the sidelines, somewhere between
           intrigued and bored.

                                 ADDISON
                            (commentating)
                        Tied at the bottom of the ninth, two
                        outs and a loaded count, Tollefson
                        at the plate.  Plath will try to
                        close out what has been an
                        ELECTRIFYING game seven.

                        the home crowd knows it.  They're on
                        their feet - 
                            (mocks crowd noise)
                        You can hear them chanting Plath,
                        Plath, Plath -

                                 DYLAN
                        What is she doing?

                                 CALEB
                            (sighs, laughs)
                        Will you just throw it already?

                                 ADDISON
                            (frustrated)
                        It's part of the whole - just trust
                        me okay?
                            (focuses)
                        Here's the wind-up -

           She winds up and lets the moon rock fly!  (Or as much as
           things can "fly" in the low gravity of the moon) We watch
           it's trajectory as it head towards Marcus who watches it
           approach until -

           CRACK!  He smacks the rock with surprising force even in the
           low gravity.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                            (commentating)
                        Oh!  Tollefson hits a doozy towards
                        center -
                            (turns excitedly to
                             Borney)
                        Go, you gotta catch it!

                                 BORNEY
                            (confused)
                        It's flying into space.

                                 ADDISON
                            (to Marcus)
                        Alright, well, at least run the bases!

                                 MARCUS
                        The what?

                                 ADDISON
                        Ugh, forget it.

                                 DYLAN
                        This was seriously one of the most
                        popular games on Earth?
                                 ADDISON
                        Well yeah, with gravity!  The moon
                        sucks.   

           Addison walks off "the mound" in disgust.  She keeps walking. 
           Away from the Rover, away from the boys.

                                 DYLAN
                        Where you going?

                                 ADDISON
                        For a walk.  

                                 CALEB
                        Hey, don't go too far.

                                 ADDISON
                            (wise-ass)
                        Okay dad.

                            (via comm)
                        And leave your comm on.  We might
                        have to -

           She switches her comm off, cutting off Dylan's voice.

                                 BORNEY
                        What do you guys wanna do now?

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           Addison comes over a small ridge, finds an outcropping of
           rock out of sight of the Rover and the boys.  She sits on
           the rock, staring out at the surface of the moon.  Far off,
           across the void, she can see Earth.  It looks so small from
           here - so small she can cover it with her hand.  She drops
           her hand and there it is again.  She looks homesick.  Lonely.  

           In fact, she's having an incredibly deep, significant moment
           when, out of the corner of her eye, she sees one of the boys
           SHOOTING UP INTO SPACE!  His arms and legs are splayed, a
           stream of vapor trailing from his midsection - like he was
           blown off the surface!!!  Addison leaps to her feat, frantic,
           switching on her comm -

                                 ADDISON
                            (panicked, into comm)
                        Guys, what -

                                 DYLAN
                            (mid-scream)
                        Whoooooo!!!!  This is awesome!!! 
           Addison's face contorts into the type of utter disbelief
           that only a teenage girl can muster when confronted with the
           idiotic mentality of teenage boys.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           ANGLE ON : THE SPOOL THAT HOUSES THE ROVER'S TOWING CABLE.

                                 DYLAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Okay, remember -

           A wider angle reveals Dylan hooking the end of the towing
           cable to a cargo hook on the belt of Borney's shabby suit
           while Caleb straps the oxygen tank to the front of his torso,
           cinching the clasp behind his back.  

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Crouch all the way down, then launch
                        yourself as hard as you can while
                        you open the valve -

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        What the hell are you doing?!

           They turn to see Addison storming towards them.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        Are you trying to get yourselves
                        killed?

                                 DYLAN
                        Don't be dramatic.  All you gotta do
                        is pump the tank a little on the way
                        down to slow your fall.

                                 ADDISON
                        Yeah?  And what if the cable snaps? 
                        You'll end up miles away in the middle
                        of nowhere, running out of oxygen and
                        waiting to die.  Also, you're WASTING
                        OXYGEN!  Which, not sure if you've
                        noticed, we kinda need out here.

                                 DYLAN
                        Okay, first of all?  This cable can
                        haul thousands of pounds.  I think
                        we'll be okay.  Second, it's an EXTRA
                        tank.  I grabbed one before we left. 
                        So if we don't use it then it's just
                        gonna go to waste.
                                 ADDISON
                            (dumbfounded)
                        That's the stupidest thing I've ever
                        heard.

                                 DYLAN
                        What do you know?  You thought
                        "baseball" was fun.
                            (off her look, sly
                             grin)
                        Come on, Earth-girl, admit it.  You're
                        just scared.

           And there it is.  The gauntlet has been thrown.  The other
           boys are holding their breath, waiting to see what happens
           next.  Dylan is smirking that infuriating smirk.  She stares
           daggers at him, fuming.  There's only one thing that can
           happen now.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           ADDISON'S POV as she launches up into space!!!

                                 ADDISON
                        Whoa - whoa - whoa!!!!!

           Back on the surface -

                                 BORNEY
                        I like her.  She's neat.

           Back with Addison -

           She reaches the cable's limit and it snaps her back!  Like
           bungee jumping in reverse!  She looks down at the surface,
           hundreds of feet below, then out at the black, infinite void,
           heart racing, breathing like she just stepped off a roller
           coaster, a huge smile on her face.      

                                 DYLAN
                            (via comm)
                        So?  Wha'd you think?

                                 ADDISON
                            (rolls her eyes)
                        Okay, fine, you were right.  It was
                        a little bit fun.

           MUSIC CUE.

           WHAT FOLLOWS IS A PLAYFUL SEQUENCE AS EACH OF THE KIDS TAKE
           TURNS STRAPPING IN AND LAUNCHING OFF.

           Each trip involves the Kids' POV of their launch, the sound
           of their breath, the blood pounding in their ears.
           MARCUS' TURN

           CALEB'S TURN

                                 CALEB
                        Whoooooo!!!!!!  This is amazing!

           Caleb's face is filled with a carefree joy we haven't really
           seen yet.  

           BORNEY'S TURN

                                 DYLAN
                        You ready?

                                 BORNEY
                        Ready!

                                 CALEB
                        Three, two, one, launch!

           Borney vaults himself off the surface, opening the valve!

           BORNEY'S POV

                                 BORNEY
                        Whoo-hooooo!!!!

           He's screaming away, rocketing out towards the stars, the
           chord reaches its limit, snaps back and --

           The cuts become faster as we continue to cycle through the
           kids.  The sense of fun continuing to build along with the
           pace - they're having a blast!

           Dylan!  Then Caleb!  Then Marcus!  Then Addison!  Then Borney! 
           Then Dylan!  Then Caleb!  Then Marcus!  Then Addison!  Then
           Borney!  Then -

           The hook on Borney's suit tears off!

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                        Wha --

           On the surface, everyone's heart stops. 

                                 DYLAN
                        No -

           Borney instinctively grabs at the small tear in his suit -
           but the oxygen tank is still propelling him up!  The jolt
           has sent him into a spin!  We hear the sound of his breathing
           change, suddenly panicked, stuttered -
           The kids stand frozen for a split second as Borney continues
           spinning out into the black void.

           INTER-CUT BETWEEN BORNEY AND THOSE ON THE SURFACE AS
           NECESSARY.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Nononononono!!!

                                 CALEB
                            (into comm)
                        Borney!

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                            (via comm, panicked)
                        I can't - please, I can't - I wanna
                        come down, I wanna come down!

                                 ADDISON
                        What do we do?!

                                 DYLAN
                            (into comm)
                        Borney, listen to me, shut off the
                        tank.  You have to shut off the valve
                        on the tank, okay? 

           BORNEY'S POV as reality spins - glimpses of his friends
           getting further away as he continues to spin.   

                                 BORNEY
                        I can't - I think it's stuck, I can't!

                                 ADDISON
                        He's gonna go out of comm range.

           Caleb is looking around frantically.  The three of them are
           panicked.  

                                 CALEB
                        We gotta - shit!

           Marcus is already moving towards the Rover, trying to move
           faster than the low gravity will allow.

                                 BORNEY
                            (panicked)
                        Please no, nonono, I wanna go back,
                        please.

           THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING we hear the constant sounds of
           Borney's desperate panic over the comms, the kids' breathing,
           the blood pounding in their ears, switching BACK AND FORTH
           BETWEEN THEIR POVs, creating a symphony of chaos that
           escalates the urgency and fear.  
           INT. ROVER

           Marcus grabs another of the oxygen tanks, goes back to the
           door of the Rover and -

           EXT. ROVER

           Marcus crouches down and launches himself up and away! 
           Opening the valve on the tank.  He's not tethered to anything!    

                                 DYLAN
                        Marcus, what --

                                 CALEB
                        There's more tanks inside!

           They both head back inside the Rover.  Addison wants to follow
           after them, doesn't want to take her eyes off Marcus and
           Borney! 

                                 ADDISON
                        No, wait, what are you -

                                 DYLAN
                        Talk to Marcus, you need to guide
                        him to Borney!

           Addison looks back, Marcus is heading in Borney's general
           direction, but he's going to miss him.

                                 ADDISON
                            (panicked)
                        Uhh, Marcus?  Marcus, can you hear
                        me?

           Meanwhile, Borney is spinning, flailing desperately, reaching
           with his free hand for something that will halt his progress,
           reaching for something that isn't there.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Please, please help me.  Please.

                                 ADDISON
                            (via comm)
                        Borney, listen to me.  I need you to
                        try and reach around your back, okay? 
                        I need you to reach around your back
                        and unhook the tank.  Can you do that?

                                 BORNEY
                            (whimpering)
                        I don't - I can't, I can't -
                                 ADDISON
                        Borney, you have to try, okay?  Marcus
                        is on his way, but you have to get
                        that tank off.

           We switch to MARCUS' POV as he tries to twist his head to
           get a look at Borney.  He can't see him -

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                            (via comm)
                        Marcus, you're getting close - angle
                        a little more to your right, no shit! 
                        Your left.  Go to your left.  Just a
                        little more.

           Borney appears in the periphery of Marcus' vision!  He's
           still too far away!

           Back on the surface, both Caleb and Dylan launch!  Each with
           their own oxygen tank.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?!  You can't -

           It's too late.  They're gone.  Addison is alone on the
           surface.  Frantic, terrified, trying to keep it together.

                                 MARCUS
                            (via comm)
                        I can see him.

           Marcus' voice brings her back to the moment.

                                 ADDISON
                        Good, that's good, um - Borney, how's
                        it coming with the tank? 

                                 BORNEY
                        I'm trying, I - 

           BORNEY'S SPINNING POV as he catches a glimpse of Marcus
           heading towards him.   

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                            (his transmission
                             breaking up)
                        I see --- !  --- ee him!

                                 ADDISON
                            (under her breath)
                        Shit.
                            (louder)
                        Marcus, listen to me.  You're about
                        to go out of range.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        Once Borney gets the tank off, he'll
                        start to fall.  If you don't adjust
                        your angle you're gonna shoot right
                        past him.  Did you hear that?  Marcus!         

           Borney's hand is fumbling behind his back, his body still
           spinning and spinning and spinning, his hand reaching for
           the clasp holding the tank to his waist, fumbling, grabbing
           and finally --

           He releases the clasp!  The oxygen tank spins away from him.

           MARCUS' POV - we can see Borney coming up through his visor. 
           Addison's voice is cutting in and out on the comm,
           unintelligible. 

           BORNEY'S POV tumbling end over end.  He can see Marcus
           reaching for him.

                                 MARCUS
                            (via comm)
                        Reach for my hand.

                                 BORNEY
                            (via comm)
                        Please, make it stop, please -

           MARCUS' POV of Borney reaching toward him.  Reaching.

           BORNEY'S POV spinning, his arm flailing and then -

           They connect!  Marcus' hand grasps Borney's arm!

                                 MARCUS
                        Got him.

                                 ADDISON
                            (transmission breaking
                             up)
                        Mar - us, -ose your - alve!  - still
                        go - ng out!

                                 MARCUS
                        Hold on to me, okay?  I have to -

           Marcus reaches for the valve on his tank, but Borney,
           panicked, grabs onto him too tight at the wrong moment and -

           Marcus fumbles his grip on the tank!  With the valve still
           open, it spins away from them, shooting off into another
           direction.  

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        No.  No, no -
           There's a moment of PANIC as Marcus grabs for the tank - but
           it's already gone.  Marcus watches the disappearing tank
           with wide eyes.  Nothing but the sound of his breathing. 
           And then --

                                 DYLAN
                            (via comm)
                        Watch out, watch out!

           Dylan slams into the both of them, coming from behind, almost
           knocking them apart -

           But Caleb comes from the other side!  It's a chaotic moment
           of reaching and flailing as they almost break apart and -

           The four of them grab on to each other!  Caleb and Dylan
           managing to keep hold of their tanks.  

                                 CALEB
                        It's okay. 

           Addison stands on the surface, watching them come back towards
           the surface, her breath still coming in ragged gasps.

                                 CALEB (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                            (via comm)
                        We're okay.

                                 ADDISON
                            (into comm)
                        You have to - make sure you use the
                        tanks to decelerate.  You can't -

           Addison chokes on a sob of relief, her voice giving out.  

           As one, the four boys come back down to the surface about
           thirty yards from the Rover, aided by short bursts from Dylan
           and Caleb's oxygen tanks to help slow their momentum.

           Addison is hurrying over to them as quickly as the low gravity
           will allow.  

           Back with the boys, nobody speaks.  The four of them just
           sit there, in shock.  Trying to catch their breath.  To stop
           their hearts from pounding.  Now that they're back on the
           ground, the scope of what just happened, what almost happened
           begins to set in.

           Dylan sees Borney's hand pressed against the tear in his
           suit.  He pulls a small, electronic tube from his belt and
           moves over to Borney -

                                 DYLAN
                        Hey, let me see that tear.  
                                 BORNEY
                            (pulls away)
                        No!  It's um, it's fine.  I can do
                        it myself.  Just - gimme a few
                        minutes, okay?  

                                 DYLAN
                        Sure.  Sure man, whatever you need.

           Addison reaches them. 

                                 ADDISON
                        Is everybody okay?

           Nobody's answers.

           We watch them all for a moment.  The five of them just
           standing and sitting in the absolute silence of space.  

           Finally -

                                 CALEB
                            (quietly)
                        I think we have to go back.

           Dylan looks up.  

                                 DYLAN
                            (confused)
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                            (still in shock)
                        To the dome.  I think we have to go
                        back to the dome.

           Caleb gets up and starts walking back towards the Rover. 
           Dylan follows. 

                                 DYLAN
                        No.  No, Caleb, look, everybody's
                        fine.  I know it was scary, but we're
                        all fine.  We don't have to -

                                 CALEB
                        It's not that.  We used too much oxygen.

           Dylan realizes immediately it's true.  

                                 DYLAN
                        You don't know that.
                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        He's right.  You said you only brought
                        one extra tank.

           Dylan turns.  Addison has followed them, though at a distance.  

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        We lost two.  Plus whatever you guys
                        used getting out there and back.  We
                        probably wouldn't have enough to
                        even make it to the caves, much less
                        get back.

           She does her best not to make it sound like an "I told you
           so."  Still, there's no getting around it.  Dylan's game has
           cost them the trip. 

                                 DYLAN
                        No, there's gotta - we can figure
                        something out.

                                 CALEB
                        There's nothing to figure out.  It's
                        math.
                            (off his look)
                        Dylan it's not your fault.

           Caleb turns back to the Rover.  Dylan's mind is racing, then -

                                 DYLAN
                        Wait a second.  What if we could get
                        more?

                                 CALEB
                        Where?

                                 DYLAN
                        The storage depot.  Don't they have
                        a couple buildings where they store
                        all the extra supplies that come up
                        on the cargo shuttles from Earth?

                                 ADDISON
                        He's right.  My dad and his team
                        dropped off a lot of their extra
                        equipment when we first got here.

                                 DYLAN
                        They must have spare tanks there.  

                                 CALEB
                            (to Addison)
                        Do you think you can get us in?
                                 ADDISON
                        If it's the same encryption they use
                        at the dome then yeah, we should
                        have a pretty good shot.

                                 DYLAN
                        Come on, man, it's worth a try.
                            (starts heading towards
                             the Rover)
                        We can pull up the specs on her little
                        whatchamacallit thing.

           Addison looks at Caleb, shrugs.  What have they got to lose?

           Meanwhile, back at the landing site, Borney is still sitting
           quietly, he hasn't moved.  Marcus sits a few feet away.

                                 MARCUS
                        We should get back to the Rover.

           No response.  Marcus gets up and walks over to Borney.

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        You guys ok out there?

                                 MARCUS
                            (into comm)
                        Yeah.  We'll be there in a minute.

                                 CALEB
                            (via comm)
                        You sure?  We're getting out of our
                        suits so we'll be off comms.

                                 MARCUS
                            (into comm)
                        Yeah, we're fine.

           Marcus looks down at Borney, not sure that's true.  

                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        We should get back to the Rover.
                            (no response)
                        Borney -

                                 BORNEY
                        I can't.

                                 MARCUS
                        It's okay.  You're okay now.  You
                        don't have to -
                                 BORNEY
                        No, I mean - I can't.  I can't go
                        back in there.

                                 MARCUS
                        Howcome?

                                 BORNEY
                        Just leave me alone okay?
                            (off his look, voice
                             trembling)
                        You hear what I said?  I said leave
                        me alone!  Get the hell out of here!

           Marcus doesn't react.  He just stands there, waiting perhaps
           to see if Borney needs to yell anymore.  Instead, Borney's
           lip quivers, he looks like he's on the verge of tears. 

                                 MARCUS
                        What's wrong?

           Borney doesn't want to say it.  Doesn't know what else to
           do.  

                                 BORNEY
                        I was so scared.  I just - I went.

                                 MARCUS
                        What?

                                 BORNEY
                        I went.  I went in my suit okay? 
                        And it doesn't have any of the lining
                        and stuff it's supposed to.  So I
                        just - I can't go back in there.  If
                        Dylan finds out, or Addison - she's
                        a girl.  And she's cool and pretty
                        and if she knows she's gonna think
                        I'm --
                            (voice breaking)
                        Why did it have to be me?  Howcome I
                        had to be the one?  It was so scary. 
                        I didn't -

                                 MARCUS
                        It's okay.  Hey, it's okay.  We'll
                        take care of it.  It'll be okay.

                                 BORNEY
                        How?

           Marcus thinks.  Searching for a plan.
                                 MARCUS
                        Just - come back to the Rover and
                        wait around by the back until they
                        clear out, okay?

                                 BORNEY
                        What?  No!  You can't say anything, 
                        please.

                                 MARCUS
                        I'm not gonna say anything.  Just do
                        what I said.  Once they come out you
                        can go in and get cleaned up.  No
                        one's gonna know.

                                 BORNEY
                        You promise?

                                 MARCUS
                        I promise.

           INT. ROVER

           Caleb, Addison and Dylan are gathered around a 3D IMAGE of a
           building being projected by her "Oreo".

           It's a blueprint schematic for what looks like an older style
           NASA installation.  Unlike the futuristic dome the kids
           departed from, this is based on a more twenty-first century
           modular design.

           Dylan is trying to "turn" the schematic, but he doesn't really
           know what he's doing.  Addison is getting frustrated trying
           to explain it to him.  It's kind of like trying to explain
           how to use a touch screen device to your grandmother.

                                 ADDISON
                        No, you don't grab it, you just -

                                 DYLAN
                        I'm not grabbing it.

                                 ADDISON
                        You just touch it really lightly and -

           Addison turns the image with ease.

                                 DYLAN
                        That's what I'm doing, I -
                            (annoyed)
                        Whatever.  That's the place I was
                        talking about.  
                                 ADDISON
                        Looks kinda big to just be a storage
                        depot.  

                                 CALEB
                        It was probably supposed to be another
                        part of the city they had planned. 
                        My dad sad they did a pretty good
                        amount of work before the project
                        got halted.  

                                 ADDISON
                        I can't believe they'd just build
                        all this and then abandon it.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Welcome to Omega Corp. Is there a
                        supply inventory listed anywhere?

                                 ADDISON
                        I can't find one, but the good news
                        is getting in shouldn't be a problem.

           Looking towards the Rover door.

                                 CALEB
                        Where the heck is -

           The Rover door opens.  Marcus makes his way through the
           airlock.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Where's Borney?

                                 MARCUS
                        He said he dropped something when we
                        touched down.

                                 DYLAN
                        What?  What the hell did he drop?

                                 MARCUS
                        A, uh - it was a moon rock.

                                 DYLAN
                        He dropped a moon rock?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah.  He said it was a really cool
                        one he wants to give to his mom. 
                        Said he had it in his hand when he
                        was launching out.
                                 DYLAN
                        Yeah, and he probably let go of it
                        while he was spinning through space.

                                 MARCUS
                        He says he didn't drop it until we
                        touched down.

                                 DYLAN
                        Well tell'em to get back in here. 
                        We'll find another rock.  We have to -

           Marcus takes a step towards Dylan.

                                 MARCUS
                        We'll leave once we help him find
                        the rock.

           Dylan stares at him, confused - Marcus looks like he might
           be ready to fight.  Where the hell is this coming from?

                                 DYLAN
                        What are you -

                                 ADDISON
                        He's right, we should help him look.

                                 DYLAN
                        It's a moon rock that he dropped on
                        the moon!

                                 ADDISON
                            (to Marcus)
                        He said it was special though right? 
                        What did it look like?

           Marcus blinks.  He clearly didn't think this all the way
           through.  The gears in his brain are turning.  Unfortunately,
           the gears in Marcus' brain don't turn very fast. 

                                 MARCUS
                        It's - round.

                                 DYLAN
                        Oh, good, it's a round rock.

                                 MARCUS
                        But - he said it had sharp edges. 
                        Like - a star.  He said it was shaped
                        like a star.  That's why he wants to
                        give it to his mom.

           Dylan looks to Caleb, who has stayed quiet.  He knows
           something's wrong.
                                 CALEB
                        We should help him look.

                                 DYLAN
                            (exasperated)
                        We're never gonna find it!

                                 CALEB
                        Doesn't matter.  We should help him
                        anyway.

           The words Caleb leaves unsaid is "that's what friends do." 
           Dylan sighs, knowing he's right.   

                                 DYLAN
                        Guess we better suit up again.

           They move towards the back of the Rover to get their suits. 
           Marcus puts his hand on Caleb's shoulder and stops him. 
           Leans in to whisper something in his ear.

           EXT. ROVER

           Borney is standing awkwardly around the side of the Rover,
           hidden from sight, nervous, when the door to the Rover opens.

           We hear Caleb directing the others.

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Borney's over the ridge where we
                        landed.  Me and Marcus'll go over
                        there, why don't you two cover the
                        other side.

           Borney holds his breath - maybe Marcus' plan will actually
           work.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The kids are walking towards their respective search zones. 
           Addison has walked ahead of Dylan.  

                                 DYLAN
                            (into comm)
                        Hey, maybe we could look for some
                        other cool stuff too, you know, just
                        in case we don't -

           As he speaks he turns in Caleb's direction and - catches a
           glimpse of Borney back at the Rover, sneaking inside.  

           Dylan looks at Caleb, confused.  Caleb raises a finger to
           his facemask, signaling for quiet.
           Dylan looks back at the Rover.  Something's going on. 
           Something serious.  

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Hey, you coming or what?

           Dylan nods to Caleb, suddenly feeling guilty for the way he
           was acting.

                                 DYLAN
                            (into comm)
                        Yeah.  On my way.

           INT. ROVER - LATER

           Everyone's back in the Rover, Dylan is driving, they're riding
           along in silence.  Addison looks over at Borney.  He looks
           like he's trying to hide how upset he is. 

                                 ADDISON
                            (leaning over)
                        Hey, you okay?

                                 BORNEY
                        Huh?  Oh yeah, sure.  You know.  

                                 ADDISON
                        Sorry we didn't find your rock.

                                 BORNEY
                            (covering)
                        I guess it was kinda crazy trying to
                        look for it anyway.  I'll find another
                        one.  

                                 ADDISON
                        Tell you what.  I'll help.

           Addison smiles at him.  Borney nods, smiles awkwardly, his
           cheeks blushing a bit, his discomfort momentarily forgotten.

           The Rover comes to a stop.

                                 DYLAN
                        This is it.

           Through the windshield of the Rover we can see the large,
           squat, modular building.  The complete antithesis of the
           sophisticated, innovative design of the dome.

           The boys all look at it with varying degrees of disappointment
           and mild disgust.  Addison, meanwhile, beams like a hipster
           walking down Haight Street.
                                 ADDISON
                        Man.  How cool is that, huh?

                                 CALEB
                        It's really ugly.

                                 ADDISON
                        It's old school.

                                 BORNEY
                        What do you mean?

                                 ADDISON
                        Well, that's the way they used to
                        design structures in space.  Before
                        they came up with the concept for
                        the dome.  Everything used to be
                        built in little boxes because it was
                        easier to transport building materials
                        up from Earth.  The dome changed
                        everything.  My dad says it was a
                        beta test for the type of architecture
                        they use all over Omega.

           Caleb's face falls a bit at the mention of Omega.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.

                                 DYLAN
                        Hey, Omega's not for a few more days,
                        right?

                                 CALEB
                        Right.  A few more days.  And then I
                        go to sleep for seventy five years.   

                                 DYLAN
                        Guess we better have a good time now
                        then right?

                                 BORNEY
                        Yeah.  Come on, Caleb.  I mean, I
                        shot myself out into space and almost
                        died and I'm having fun.

                                 DYLAN
                        He's got a point.  You and your little
                        space nap are just gonna have to
                        suck it up and deal.  Now's now. 

                                 ADDISON
                        Hey.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                            (thrusts her hand
                             into the center)
                        "All the when so if you can" or
                        something, right?

           Caleb smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        I guess that's close enough.

           They all put their hands in the center.

           INT. STORAGE DEPOT

           The mechanical doors open from within, revealing our ragtag
           team of space-suited five at the entrance.

           It's pitch black inside.  The only light coming from the
           lamps on their suits.

           From what we can see - the inside of the depot is, well,
           it's strange looking.  Surreal almost.  It's a jumbled
           hodgepodge of designs that look neither like those you'd
           find on Earth or in the dome.  It almost looks like a more
           technologically advanced version of a World's Fair "House of
           the Future".  Only bigger.  And gaudier.  And tackier.

           They stand there, staring, no idea what to make of the place. 

                                 MARCUS
                        This place is freaking me out.

                                 BORNEY
                        Maybe - it looks better with the
                        lights on.

                                 DYLAN
                        Doubt it.  

                                 CALEB
                        Let's just see if we can get the
                        power turned on.

                                 ADDISON
                        Blueprints said there was a control
                        panel towards the middle of the room.

                                 CALEB
                        Anybody wanna go first?

           Nobody wants to go first.
                                 ADDISON
                            (sighs)
                        Fine.

           Addison pushes past them and into the room.  

           INT. DEPOT

           The five of them are moving through the Depot, their lamps
           casting light on the odd, quasi-futuristic designs and large,
           garish pieces of furniture. 

                                 DYLAN
                            (under his breath)
                        Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
                        scrapping the whole city plan after
                        all.

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        I found it.

           Across the room, Addison stands by the control panel.  Punches
           in a sequence and -

           The interior is illuminated by bright red and yellow lights,
           as life support turns on and the O2 vents power up, flooding
           the room with Oxygen.

           The kids remove their face masks, looking around, both
           horrified and fascinated by the room.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Man, it looks even worse with the
                        lights on.

                                 DYLAN
                        What the hell is this even supposed
                        to be?

                                 ADDISON
                        I think it's supposed to be what
                        people on Earth thought living in
                        space would be like - before they
                        actually lived here.

                                 DYLAN
                        I've had nightmares that look like
                        this.

                                 BORNEY
                        Wow, check out this couch!

           Borney runs and jumps into the cushions of an enormous and
           gaudy plush synthetic couch.
                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                        Whew, this might be ugly, but it
                        sure is soft.  You guys gotta feel
                        this!

                                 CALEB
                        Hey, save that for later.  We'll
                        have plenty of time to mess around
                        once we find the oxygen.  Now the
                        blueprint said there's three levels.
                            (delegating)
                        Dylan, you go with Addison and check
                        upstairs, Marcus, you and Borney
                        check the lower level.  I'll take
                        this one.  

                                 DYLAN
                        I don't know if it's a good idea for
                        anyone to be wandering around in
                        here alone.

                                 CALEB
                        I'll be fine. 
                            (before Dylan can
                             protest)
                        Look, we can't risk hangin' around
                        in case we don't find any extra tanks. 
                        So let's get going.  Everybody take
                        the comm-link from your helmets and
                        let us know what you find.      

           Dylan is staring at Caleb with an odd smile in the corners
           of his mouth.  

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                            (off Dylan's look)
                        What?

                                 DYLAN
                            (smiles)
                        I'll tell you later.
                            (to the group)
                        You heard the man, let's get moving.

           INT. DEPOT, LOWER LEVEL

           Borney and Marcus make their way to the end of a long, narrow
           hallway that opens up into another cavernous and gaudy room.

                                 BORNEY
                        Man, it just gets worse and worse,
                        huh?

                                 MARCUS
                        Are you okay?  About before?
           Borney shrugs off the question, a little uncomfortable.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Sure, I'm okay.

           Borney continues poking around.  Marcus watches him, wanting
           to say something reassuring but not really sure what to say.

                                 MARCUS
                        People think I'm dumb.

           Borney stops.  Looks at him.  Caught off guard by the raw
           simplicity of the words.  

                                 BORNEY
                        What?

                                 MARCUS
                        People think lots of stuff about me. 
                        They think I'm big and dumb and
                        useless.  That I'm not good for much. 
                        That's what my dad thinks.  That's
                        what everybody back at the dome thinks
                        too.  And I know I'm not very smart. 
                        Or good at a lot of stuff.  But I
                        don't care what people think about
                        me.  It doesn't matter 'cause you're
                        my best friend.  And I know you don't
                        think that stuff.  And neither does
                        Caleb and neither does Dylan.  And
                        they never will.  No matter what. 
                        So that's all I care about.

           Borney looks at him.  Not sure what to say.  That might be
           the most Marcus has ever spoken at one time.

                                 BORNEY
                        You're my best friend too.

                                 MARCUS
                            (shrugs, simply)
                        I know.

                                 BORNEY
                            (furrows his brow)
                        Well fine then, you don't have to
                        get all sappy about it.  Jeez.

           Marcus pulls him in for a hug.  It's awkward and clumsy and
           sweet.  

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, UPPER LEVEL

           A hatch in the floor opens and Addison comes out, followed
           up the ladder from below by Dylan.
                                 DYLAN
                        Hey, I just wanted to say thank you.

                                 ADDISON
                            (coy)
                        Oh yeah?  What for?

                                 DYLAN
                            (rolls his eyes)
                        You know what for.  Not saying I
                        told you so.  With Borney and
                        everything.  

                                 ADDISON
                        You're welcome.
                            (smiles)
                        I did kinda tell you though.

                                 DYLAN
                            (sighs)
                        Yeah, you did.

                                 ADDISON
                        I sorta told you exactly what would
                        happen and then it happened.  Like
                        exactly how I said it would.

                                 DYLAN
                            (smiles)
                        Nevermind.  I take back my thank
                        you.

           Dylan heads into the next set of rooms.

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

           Addison follows Dylan into the room.  

                                 ADDISON
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 DYLAN
                        I guess so.  You probably will even
                        if I say you can't.

                                 ADDISON
                        Why is this so important to you?

                                 DYLAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 ADDISON
                        Getting out to the caves.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        I mean, I get why it's important to
                        Caleb, 'cause of his dad and
                        everything, but why does it matter
                        so much to the rest of you?

           Dylan stops, looks at her, genuinely confused.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Are you being serious?

                                 ADDISON
                            (suddenly self-
                             conscious)
                        Yeah.  Why?

                                 DYLAN
                        You go where your friends need you
                        to go.  Doesn't matter why or where. 
                        You just do.  How can you not know
                        that?
                            (joking)
                        Man, no wonder nobody back at the
                        dome talks to you.

           Dylan laughs, Addison doesn't.  She turns away, hurt.  

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.  I - I didn't mean that.  It
                        was just a joke. 

                                 ADDISON
                        It's okay.  You're not wrong.  You're
                        insensitive and stupid, but you're a
                        boy so I guess that's normal.  Come
                        on, let's just keep looking.  

           Addison hurries out of the room.  Dylan kicks himself, wants
           to say something to make it up to her. 

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

           Addison exits the room, embarrassed and angry at herself. 
           She wipes her eyes, refusing to cry.  She walks across the
           hall and slaps the access panel beside a door.  She steps
           into the room, not really looking where she's going --

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, UPPER LEVEL, ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Addison steps into the room and - stops dead in her tracks,
           awestruck and bewildered by what she sees.

           The room is a sprawling atrium, with a clear domed ceiling,
           and a gorgeous latticework of artificial sunlight shining
           down from above, all focused on the single object occupying
           the center of the otherwise empty room.

           A tree.

           And not just any tree.  It is the most magnificent, most
           beautiful tree she's ever seen.  Here in this stark, cold
           place where nothing lives, is a lush, vibrant, majestic piece
           of home.

           We watch her walk slowly across the room.  Entranced by its
           beauty, bewildered by its sheer impossibility.  We realize
           for the first time, how much she truly misses home.

           Meanwhile, Dylan arrives in the doorway -

                                 DYLAN
                        Addison, I -

           He sees the tree and words fail.  He stands there,
           overwhelmed, not even really sure what he's looking at.

           Addison reaches the tree.  She's a foot or so away.  Smiling,
           she reaches out a hand with shaking fingers to touch the
           bark, almost giddy with anticipation and -

           Her hand passes through the tree.  It's just a hologram.  An
           incredibly sophisticated illusion.  And it breaks her heart.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        What is that?

                                 ADDISON
                        It's - nothing.  It isn't real.

                                 DYLAN
                        Addison -

                                 ADDISON
                        Can you just - not talk right now?

           Dylan walks across the room.  He stands beside her in the
           "shade" of the tree.  Addison is staring at the floor.  Dylan
           looks at her.  Doesn't know what to say.  Wants to say
           something.  Shuffles his feet a bit.  Then finally -

                                 DYLAN
                        My dad's kind of a jerk. 
                            (furrows his brow,
                             looks at the floor)
                        He worked the mines for about six years
                        before he decided he couldn't stand
                        it.  He's not even trying to finish
                        the contract anymore.

                        Which means if I wanna sign up to go
                        to Omega I'll have to work off his
                        nineteen years before I can even start
                        mine.  Borney's dad's a drunk.  Beats
                        up on him and his mom.  You'd never
                        know it.  Damn kid's so happy all the
                        time.  Marcus, his dad's pretty much
                        like him.  Big and quiet.  The only
                        difference is he's mean.  Says shit to
                        Marcus you wouldn't say to a dog.

                                 ADDISON
                        Look, you don't have to -

                                 DYLAN
                        You asked why it's important to us,
                        didn't you?

                                 ADDISON
                        Yeah.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Caleb's dad, he was different.  He
                        was more a father to us than our own
                        dads ever were.  He wanted Caleb to 
                        go to the caves before he left.  It
                        was important to him.  So we're gonna
                        make sure he does.  For both of them. 
                        And if people at the dome don't talk
                        to you then it's their own damn
                        stupidity.  And it's their loss. 
                        Because you're pretty cool.  So -
                        that's it.  I guess.

           Addison doesn't know what to say.  Dylan for his part, has
           just said more to a girl in one burst than he has in his
           entire life and has no idea where to go from here.  So he
           does what any fourteen year-old boy does given the situation -
           he quickly walks around the "tree" and into the next room,
           leaving a dazed, slightly overwhelmed Addison standing like
           a deer in headlights, no longer thinking about the tree.

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, MAIN LEVEL

           Caleb wanders through a large room, taking in the strangeness
           of it, his mind drifting.

                                 CALEB'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Dad?  You in here?
           INT. LUNAR COLONY, CALEB AND MICHAEL'S QUARTERS - FLASHBACK

           Caleb turns on the light.  Sees Michael sitting at the small
           dining table, his flask in his lap, staring blankly at the
           wall.  He was sitting in the dark.  The moonman bobblehead
           is on the table.  Michael is VERY DRUNK.  This didn't happen
           very long ago.  

           Note: This is our first look at the colony living quarters. 
           They're small, sparse, furnished with the bare essentials. 
           A handful of personal affects distinguishing one unit from
           the next.

                                 MICHAEL
                            (rousing himself)
                        What?  Oh, yeah, sure buddy, I'm
                        fine.  Hey, c'mere and have a seat.

           Caleb goes and sits in the empty chair at the table.

                                 CALEB
                        Why were you sitting in the dark?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just thinkin'.  Had a little headache.

                                 CALEB
                        You want me to get you some water?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nah.  Listen, I want you to promise
                        me something.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You remember what we talked about? 
                        The road trip to the caves?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want you to promise me that no
                        matter what you'll get there, okay? 
                        Even if something happens to me, I
                        need you to take this guy here -
                            (picks up the
                             bobblehead)
                        And I need you to take him to the
                        caves.  Can you do that son?

                                 CALEB
                        What's gonna happen to you?
                                 MICHAEL
                            (smiles, drunken)
                        Nothing's gonna happen to me.  I was
                        just thinking.  Thinking about your
                        granddad.  The night he died, I sat
                        by his bed, and I held his hand, and
                        I told him I'd take him across the
                        moon someday.  I promised him that,
                        you understand?  A man has to keep
                        his promises.  You have to do that -
                        if you make a promise, you have to
                        keep it.  And I - if anything ever
                        happens - just in case - will you do
                        that for me?  Will you keep my
                        promise?

           Caleb's never seen his dad quite like this before.  It scares
           him a little but he tries not to show it.

                                 CALEB
                            (nods)
                        Okay.

           Michael smiles.  Puts his hand on his son's shoulder.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good.  Good man.  Good man.

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, MAIN LEVEL

           Caleb stands in the center of the room, the memory lingering
           in his mind.

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Guys, you there?

           The squawk of the comm brings Caleb back to present.

                                 CALEB
                            (into comm)
                        Any luck?

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, UPPER LEVEL

           Dylan and Addison stand in a cluttered room, filled with
           random equipment.  In one of the corners is a handful of
           oxygen tanks.  

                                 DYLAN
                        Well, I don't know if we could get
                        to Earth on what's here -
           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, MAIN LEVEL

           Back with Caleb -

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        But it should be enough to get us
                        the caves and back.

           Caleb smiles.  The trip continues.

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Can we eat now?

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, MAIN LEVEL

           The kids are lounging around on the giant ridiculous looking
           sofa we saw earlier, the empty containers and leftover rations
           evidence of their feast.  They sit around, full and worn
           out.  Addison is in the middle of a story that has everyone's
           attention.

                                 ADDISON
                        And so they nailed him to the cross
                        and a soldier drove a spear into his
                        side.  And as he hung there, dying,
                        he begged God to forgive the people
                        who had killed him.  Because God
                        sent him there to absolve them of
                        their sins.

           She looks around at their faces as they take this all in.  

                                 DYLAN
                        So they got absolved of their sins
                        because they murdered him?

                                 ADDISON
                        Right.

                                 MARCUS
                        And that's why his dad sent him there?

                                 ADDISON
                        Yup.

                                 DYLAN
                        Man, his dad sucked more than mine
                        does.

                                 ADDISON
                        Well, it wasn't quite the same thing -
                                 BORNEY
                        And so people would eat bread and
                        drink wine and pretend they were
                        eating and drinking him?

                                 ADDISON
                        Well, they wouldn't pretend.  When
                        the priest blessed the bread and
                        wine it would actually become his
                        body and blood.  You know,
                        metaphorically I guess. 

                                 BORNEY
                        Ugh.  That's even worse!  That's
                        cannibalism.

                                 ADDISON
                        It was called communion.

                                 BORNEY
                        I don't care what it was called.  If
                        you eat somebody's body and drink
                        their blood then you're either a
                        cannibal or a zombie.

                                 ADDISON
                        So you know what cannibals and zombies
                        are but you've never heard of
                        religion?  Seriously?  

                                 MARCUS
                        What are cannibals and zombies?

                                 ADDISON
                            (sighs)
                        Not the point.  It wasn't like that. 
                        It was symbolic.  It gave people
                        faith.

                                 BORNEY
                        Faith in what?  How does eating some
                        guy that you murdered give you faith
                        in anything?  You ask me it just
                        makes you feel depressed and a little
                        queasy.  You ask me it makes you a
                        little damn crazy is what.

                                 DYLAN
                        There's no way that's true.  She's
                        just messing with you.  

                                 ADDISON
                            (laughs)
                        I'm not!
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        This religion was around for thousands
                        of years!  And it wasn't even the
                        weirdest one.  Up until a few hundred
                        years ago they were huge.  People
                        used to fight wars over this kinda
                        stuff.  Maybe if you read a book
                        every now and then you'd know that.

                                 DYLAN
                            (smiles)
                        Yeah, well, they musta forgot to
                        stock the book room with those kinda
                        books.  Come to think of it, they
                        musta forgot to build a book room.

                                 ADDISON
                        It's actually called a library.

                                 DYLAN
                        Whatever.  

                                 CALEB
                        What's it like on Earth?  I mean
                        now.

                                 ADDISON
                        I don't know.  It's weird I guess. 
                        It's like - the history books are
                        filled with all this amazing stuff
                        that goes back thousands of years. 
                        You wouldn't believe all the different
                        cultures they had, all the different
                        belief systems, all these incredible
                        things.  It all sounds so beautiful
                        and so sad and so - I mean all these
                        things happened.  To people that
                        thought these things were the most
                        important things in the universe. 
                        Earth was everything to them.  Now
                        all anyone cares about is when they
                        can get to Omega.  And when Earth's
                        finally empty and everybody's gone,
                        it'll be like none of it ever even
                        happened.  Like none of it ever really
                        mattered at all.

           A silence falls over the group.

                                 BORNEY
                        I still think it's weird they
                        pretended to eat somebody.

           Borney has wandered over to the control panel and started
           pressing buttons.  Turning different lights on and off. 
                                 CALEB
                        Hey, be careful over there, don't -

           Borney hits another button and suddenly a hologram display
           appears in the middle of the room - a CHEERY WOMAN in her
           thirties wearing a crisp suit and a plastic smile.  

                                 GREETER
                        Welcome to the Alpha Project.  You
                        are one of the lucky few who were
                        selected to receive the once in a
                        lifetime opportunity to purchase one
                        of our luxury condos here on the
                        lunar surface.  Are you exited? 
                        Good!  So are we.  Let's get started
                        with the tour.

           Borney hits the button again, the hologram freezes.

                                 BORNEY
                        Man, how long you think SHE'S been
                        dead?

                                 DYLAN
                        What's wrong with you?

                                 BORNEY
                        I'm just sayin', they scrapped plans
                        for this place ages ago.

                                 MARCUS
                        It's like light from a star.

                                 CALEB
                        What do you mean?

           Marcus shifts in his seat a bit, the attention making him
           uncomfortable.  

                                 MARCUS
                        My mother used to tell me that it
                        takes so long for the light from
                        some stars to reach us, that sometimes
                        by time we see it the star that it
                        came from is already gone.  All we
                        see is the echo of what it used to
                        be.

                                 BORNEY
                            (to Caleb)
                        You think that's what this'll feel
                        like when you wake up?  Just an echo?

                                 DYLAN
                        Dude, shut-up.
                                 CALEB
                        I don't know.  Maybe.  

                                 ADDISON
                        My brother's on Omega.

           This catches everyone a little off guard.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        He will be anyway.  The transport
                        he's on doesn't land for another
                        like, seventy-three years. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Howcome your brother's going to Omega
                        and you're here?

                                 ADDISON
                        My parents got divorced.  My mom got
                        the residency they bought on Omega. 
                        My dad got the house on Earth.  Of
                        course, getting divorced wasn't enough
                        for her.  She actually had to spend
                        the rest of her life in a cryogenic
                        sleep so that my dad would be dead
                        by time she woke up.  My mom's kind've
                        a bitch.  But my dad, for some reason,
                        couldn't stand being on Earth without
                        her, or my brother I guess, or maybe
                        Earth just reminded him of some kind
                        of problem he couldn't fix.  Anyway,
                        he requested a transfer to the lunar
                        colony.  And here we are.

           An awkward silence.  None of the boys are really sure what
           to do with this.  And then -

           Dylan stands up and grabs a ridiculous looking crystal vase
           and hurls it against the wall with a CRASH!  Shattering it
           into a thousand bits.    

                                 DYLAN
                        Goddammit!  Can we talk about
                        something else besides goddamn Omega?

                                 CALEB
                        Dylan -

                                 DYLAN
                        So what, huh?  So it sucks. 
                        Everything sucks and all of us are
                        gonna get old and die while you're
                        packed away on ice going to a place
                        full of assholes you probably won't

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        be able to stand.  Who gives a shit. 
                        So what if it's nicer there and it's
                        full of fancy stuff you can't find
                        here?  So what?  We got two more
                        days before they put you to sleep
                        and ship you off.  That's gonna
                        happen, okay?  There's nothing you
                        can do about it.  So can we not spend
                        the next two days pissing and moaning
                        about it?

                                 CALEB
                        What do you want to do?

           Dylan looks around the room.

                                 DYLAN
                        Let's trash it.  

                                 ADDISON
                        What?

                                 DYLAN
                        Look at this.  This is just another
                        place they built.  It's just another
                        lie.  Just like the damn contracts
                        people sign.  This place is everything
                        they promised and didn't come through
                        on.  This place is what your dad
                        died working for.  This is what they
                        took from us.  This place is ours. 
                        It belongs to us.  So let's fucking
                        trash it.

           CRASH!

           They all turn.  Marcus threw a chair across the room into a
           ridiculous glass menagerie, sending the various oversized
           figurines scattering and shattering to the floor.  He looks
           at them and a wide smile spreads across his face.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Yeah.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah.

                                 BORNEY
                        YEEEEEEAH!!!!

           Borney picks up his chair and -

                                 ADDISON
                        No, no, wait, stop!
                                 BORNEY
                        What?

           Addison runs over and takes the chair from him.  

                                 DYLAN
                        What are you doing?!  Loosen up!

                                 ADDISON
                        He's about to smash a chair into the
                        life support controls!

                                 DYLAN
                        Oh right, um - good catch.

           Still holding the chair, Addison smiles a wicked grin and -
           SMASHES a bank of tele-screens!

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Hell yeah!

           And then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  They go crazy on the room,
           smashing and tearing and destroying everything in sight!  

           In the midst of the reckless celebration, something comes
           pouring out of Dylan.  A rage that he's kept bottled up for
           years.  His emotions are all so close to the surface, so
           jumbled and tortured.  He's a young boy who doesn't know
           what he's going to do when he loses the only person he's
           ever trusted.

           Caleb stops and watches Dylan, his own joy fading at the
           sight of his best friend letting go of all the agony and
           pain he feels inside, knowing there's not a thing he can do
           to help.

           Dylan throws his arms up in triumph, and let's out a scream
           of tortured exultation.  

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Whoooooo!!!!!

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SUPPLY DEPOT, MAIN LEVEL - LATER

           We pan across the room - it's a complete disaster.  The kids
           have torn, smashed and shattered everything they could get
           their hands on.

           Dylan, Marcus, Borney and Addison are sprawled out in various
           points in the room, fast asleep.

           Caleb is sitting on the floor with his back against the
           ridiculous couch, lost in thought, staring out at a PANORAMIC
           VISTA of the lunar landscape, the small vial containing his
           father's ashes in his hand.

           Addison stirs, turns over, opens her eyes.  Sees Caleb sitting
           awake by himself.

                                 ADDISON
                        Can't sleep?

           Caleb tucks the vial into his pocket.  

                                 CALEB
                        Figure I'll be sleeping plenty soon
                        enough.

           Addison frowns.  Not sure what to say.  She moves over to
           the couch and sits beside him.

                                 ADDISON
                        Man, this place is a mess.

                                 CALEB
                        Yep.  Thanks by the way.  For all
                        your help. 

                                 ADDISON
                        Don't mention it.  If I had to spend
                        another second in that dome I probably
                        would have gone crazy.  You guys did
                        me a favor.

                                 CALEB
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 ADDISON
                        Sure.

                                 CALEB
                        Why did you really want to come?

                                 ADDISON
                        I just told you why.
                            (off his look)
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                        Nothing.  You don't have to tell me
                        if you don't want to.  I still
                        appreciate everything you did.

           They sit in silence a moment, staring out at the room. 

                                 ADDISON
                        I didn't have friends on Earth either.
           The words linger there a moment.  

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        I pretend all the time it's because
                        of the stupid dome, or my dad's job,
                        like getting dragged up here was the
                        worst thing in the world that could've
                        happened.  Like I was torn away from
                        this wonderful perfect life full of
                        friends and flowers.  Truth is, the
                        only thing that's different about my
                        life up here is that I don't have
                        anything to blame it on.  

                                 CALEB
                        Blame what on?

                                 ADDISON
                            (shrugs)
                        Being me, I guess.  Anyway, I just -
                        I figured since you needed my help
                        then maybe - it's stupid.

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                        That's not a cookie.

           Addison looks over at Dylan, confused.

                                 ADDISON
                        What?

                                 DYLAN
                        Because I've already got some!

           Dylan turns over on his other side, still fast asleep.  

                                 CALEB
                        He talks in his sleep a lot.  Once I
                        listened to him have a whole
                        conversation.

                                 ADDISON
                        No way.

                                 CALEB
                        He did.  It's really weird.  Most
                        people mumble.  Dylan has arguments.

           Addison smiles, looks at the three boys lying on the floor.  

                                 ADDISON
                        They're gonna miss you.
                                 CALEB
                        I know.
                            (looks at Dylan
                             sleeping)
                        The first time I met Dylan, it was
                        the night my mom died.  I was standing
                        outside the commissary and all I
                        wanted was a sandwich.  I don't really
                        remember why.  That was the worst
                        day ever.  I'd been crying nonstop
                        for hours and - all of a sudden I
                        guess I just realized how hungry I
                        was.  It was like after all that, if
                        I could just get a sandwich then
                        maybe everything would be okay.  But
                        when I got to the commissary it was
                        already locked for the night.  I was
                        about to head back to the dorms when
                        all of a sudden Dylan came out of
                        the air vent above the door.  He
                        said he'd been breaking in for months
                        to steal fruit tarts for his mom. 
                        So we snuck back inside and spent
                        the rest of the night eating
                        sandwiches in the kitchen.  I didn't
                        even know who he was and he sat there
                        with me the whole night.

           Caleb watches Dylan's sleeping form, perhaps wondering what
           life will be like without him.    

                                 ADDISON
                        Why'd you tell me all that?

                                 CALEB
                        Because I think it's gonna be hard
                        for him.  When I'm gone.  Harder for
                        him than the others.  He might need
                        someone to stay up with him, eat
                        some sandwiches.  And I'm not gonna
                        be here to do it.

                                 ADDISON
                        I barely know him.

                                 CALEB
                        He didn't know me either.
                            (smiles)
                        And you're a lot prettier than I am.

           Addison smiles.  She rests her head on Caleb's shoulder. 
           It's not a romantic gesture, but rather the birth of a true
           and lasting friendship.
                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                        I told you, it's not supposed to be
                        green!

                                 ADDISON
                        That is so weird.  

           Caleb and Addison crack up.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The kids are "back on the road" as the Rover rumbles over
           the lunar surface.  

           INT. ROVER

           Dylan is driving.  The others are seated in the common space
           behind him.  There's a lull in the air.

                                 BORNEY
                            (bored)
                        Are we there yet?

                                 DYLAN
                        No Borney.  We're five minutes closer
                        than the last time you asked.

                                 BORNEY
                        Well how much further?

                                 CALEB
                        Scanner says it's only another mile.   

           Borney seems satisfied by this.  Thinks.  Then -

                                 BORNEY
                        So what are we gonna do once we get
                        to the caves?

                                 CALEB
                        I don't know.  Look around I guess. 
                        Maybe we can --

           The conversation is cut off by a grinding in the engine of
           the Rover.  It begins to shake and to rattle.

                                 ADDISON
                        What's going on?

                                 DYLAN
                        I don't know, it just --

           And then - it stops.  Stops dead.  Dylan tries to restart
           the engines, but it's not happening.
                                 BORNEY
                            (to Dylan)
                        What did you do?

                                 DYLAN
                        I didn't do anything.  It's an old
                        model.  Damn thing was probably in
                        the garage for repairs to begin with.

                                 ADDISON
                            (sarcastic)
                        Nice choice.

                                 DYLAN
                        Yeah, well, the luxury models are a
                        little harder to steal.  Hold on,
                        let me just --

           An alarm goes off on the control panel.

                                 CALEB
                        What the hell is that?

           Dylan scans the control panel.  

                                 DYLAN
                        The life support is shutting down.

           Dylan stares at the control panel, frustrated.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Goddammit!

           He starts banging the panel in frustration.

                                 ADDISON
                        Well that should help.

                                 CALEB
                        We should get our suits on.

                                 ADDISON
                        How much oxygen do we have left from
                        the storage depot?

                                 DYLAN
                        Probably a day's worth.  Maybe a day
                        and a half.  Which would have been
                        plenty if the damn life support still
                        worked!

           He smacks the control panel again.

                                 BORNEY
                        Is that even enough to get back?
                                 DYLAN
                        On foot?  Not even close.

           Addison's mind is racing.

                                 ADDISON
                        What about a distress signal?  Even
                        a pile of crap like this must have
                        one.

           Dylan nods toward a switch beside the control panel.

                                 DYLAN
                        Well yeah, sure, it's right  --

           Addison flips the switch.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you doing?!

                                 ADDISON
                        Relax.  The lockdown's still in effect
                        for at least a few more hours.  And
                        even in a rescue vehicle it's still
                        gonna take about half a day to reach
                        us.  By time they get here, we'll
                        already be back.
                            (looks at Caleb)
                        I mean, we are walking the rest of
                        the way, right?

           It's not so much a question as it is a confirmation. 
           Everyone's a bit surprised by Addison's brazenness.  Caleb
           smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, I guess we are.  

           Caleb reaches for the Moonman bobblehead and pulls it off
           the dashboard.  

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The five of them walk along the moon's rocky terrain, the
           Rover already fading into the distance.

           Addison looks back at the Rover, getting smaller and smaller,
           suddenly rethinking her suggestion to walk.  

                                 ADDISON
                        So.  A mile huh?  

                                 CALEB
                        Probably a little less. 
           Addison nods.  Looks back at the Rover again.

                                 ADDISON
                        Umm, how much less you think?

                                 DYLAN
                        Having second thoughts Earth-girl?

                                 ADDISON
                            (scathing)
                        Hey, I know, why don't we play "launch
                        off" again?

                                 BORNEY
                        Ha.  She got you there, man. 

           Dylan's big enough to know when he's burned.  

                                 DYLAN
                            (smiles)
                        You shut up before I throw you into
                        space again.

           Addison casts one final glance back at the Rover, not quite
           so confident out here on the surface.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           A "traveling sequence" as the group continues their journey.   

           Shots of each of them.  The thoughts going through their
           minds.  Taking in their surroundings.  The fear and the sense
           of freedom intermingling on their faces.

           Until finally -

           EXT. CRATER, LUNAR SURFACE

           They're standing atop the rim of a massive crater. 

           In the center of the crater is a "lunar pit" - a steep-walled
           hole leading to an underground cave sometimes found in the
           in the impact melt ponds of large craters.  

                                 ADDISON
                        Is that it?

                                 CALEB
                        Yup.

                                 BORNEY
                        Wow.  That is one big-ass hole.  
                                 CALEB
                        Looks like we can hook the cable up
                        to that rock over there.

                                 BORNEY
                        I wonder what kind of treasure it'll
                        be.

                                 DYLAN
                            (for the thousandth
                             time)
                        Borney there's no treasure.

                                 BORNEY
                        You don't know anything.  You think
                        you know stuff, but you don't.  You'll
                        see.

                                 DYLAN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 CALEB
                        Hey Borney.

                                 BORNEY
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                            (smiles)
                        Last one to the treasure doesn't get
                        any.

           With that Caleb leaps from the rim into the crater!

                                 BORNEY
                        Hey, no fair!  You didn't even count!

           The others follow suit, Borney included, leaping into the
           crater with a joyful recklessness, racing towards their
           destination. 

                                 MICHAEL'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Your granddad always said, the most
                        important thing about a road trip,
                        you gotta keep your eyes open.  You
                        gotta let it into your heart.

           INT. LUNAR COLONY, CALEB AND MICHAEL'S QUARTERS

           We're back with Caleb and his dad sitting at the dining table
           where we last saw them.  Michael's mind drifts in a drunken
           haze, a nostalgic smile on his face, staring at the moonman
           bobblehead in the center of the table.    
                                 MICHAEL'S VOICE
                        Because it's the stupid things, the
                        silly things, every single thing
                        that seems like it doesn't even
                        matter, that's where the magic is.

           EXT. CRATER, LUNAR SURFACE

           We're back with Caleb, a smile from ear to ear as he races
           against his friends, taking it all in - their freedom, their
           laughter, their release.  

                                 MICHAEL'S VOICE
                        That's what you remember.  Not the
                        beginning, not the end, just the
                        moments.  And if you don't watch out
                        for them, they may go by without you
                        ever even knowing they happened.

           The sequence ends with Caleb leaping into the lunar pit,
           free falling down into the cave below.

           INT. REMEMBRANCE CAVE

           Caleb lands on the floor of the cave.  The other four kids
           peer down from above, giving Caleb a moment in the caves by
           himself.

           Caleb stands, looks around, taking in the surroundings we
           don't yet see.  

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        You okay down there?

                                 CALEB
                            (into comm)
                        Yeah.  I'm fine.  

                                 BORNEY (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        There's treasure right?

           We hear Dylan smack Borney's helmet.

                                 BORNEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                            (via comm)
                        Ow!  Hey!

           Caleb walks deeper into the cave, taking it in. 

           A REVERSE ANGLE reveals what he sees.

           Unlike the storage depot, there is nothing flashy, nothing
           garish, nothing egregiously tacky.
           It is, quite simply, just a cave full of stuff.  But it's a
           cave full of stuff from Earth.  A cave full of stuff Caleb
           has never seen before.  A cave full of mundane little
           treasures.

           There are paintings made with real acrylic paint.  Family
           photo albums.  Caleb picks up a baseball with a smudged
           illegible signature scrawled across the rawhide.  He places
           it reverently back on its small stand. 

           Everything is arranged with exquisite care.  Nothing here
           was simply tossed onto the pile.  Each and every item was
           place with love.  The cave is a solemn place, a place of
           rituals - a temple where people came to say goodbye, and to
           leave a little something behind.

           He looks for an empty place, the perfect spot to make his
           own contribution.  Finding it, he reaches into his travel
           pack.  He pulls out the Moonman bobblehead.

           Caleb places the bobblehead on a small level ridge, in between
           an action figure and a stuffed bear.

                                 CALEB'S VOICE
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Come on, dad.

           INT. LUNAR COLONY, CALEB AND MICHAEL'S QUARTERS

           Caleb is helping Michael from the dining table to his cot,
           struggling to support his father's drunken, stumbling weight.  

                                 MICHAEL
                            (drunken)
                        You gotta remember.  Remember what
                        you promised.  You'll remember what
                        you promised?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah.  I'll remember.

                                 MICHAEL
                        A man keeps his promises.  Honors
                        the past.

           Michael drops down to sit on the cot, his back slumped against
           the wall.  Very, very drunk.  Caleb begins taking off his
           dad's boots.    

                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                            (shakes his head)
                        I'm so sorry.  I never wanted this. 
                        Not for you.  I just - I didn't know. 
                                 CALEB
                        I know dad.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I'm gonna make it right.  I love
                        you, son.  You know that, right?

                                 CALEB
                        Of course I know that.

                                 MICHAEL
                            (drunken)
                        I'm gonna make it right.  But you
                        gotta remember what you promised. 
                        Because we carry the past in our
                        hearts.  That's what your granddad
                        used to say.  Told me it's what makes
                        us who we are.  Guides us where we're
                        going.  You start forgetting where
                        you come from, starts getting hard
                        to figure out where you're going. 
                        You get lost.
                            (stares out)
                        You just get lost.

           Caleb stands stock still, not knowing what to say, what to
           do.  He just stands there watching his father drift off to a
           drunken sleep, still slumped against the wall.

           INT. REMEMBRANCE CAVES

           Caleb stares at the Moonman bobblehead.  He reaches back
           into his travel pack and pulls out the metallic vial
           containing his father's ashes.  He's looped a wire around
           the end of the vial, which he now carefully hangs around the
           neck of the Moonman bobblehead.

           In the background, we see the other kids dropping down into
           the caves.  We see them taking in the cave and all its
           "treasures" as Dylan approaches Caleb.  All the while Caleb
           is in the foreground, staring at the Moonman wearing his
           father's ashes.

                                 DYLAN
                        You okay?

                                 CALEB
                        Not really.  

           Meanwhile, Borney and Marcus are gazing at all the different
           stuff in the cave.

                                 BORNEY
                        Wow, check this out.
           Marcus moves and stumbles a bit.  Borney looks at him,
           concerned.

                                 BORNEY (CONT'D)
                        Hey, you okay?

           Marcus straightens up.  

                                 MARCUS
                        I'm fine.  Just a little dizzy.

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                        Borney, come here and look at this.

                                 MARCUS
                            (to Borney)
                        Go ahead, I'm good.  

           Marcus watches with a smile as Borney eagerly move off in
           Addison's direction.  

           She's crouched down before an elegantly crafted music box.

                                 BORNEY
                        What is that?

                                 ADDISON
                        Open it. 

           Borney lifts the lid and a small ballerina inside begins to
           rotate on a pedestal.  We see gears turning within the box
           but cannot hear any sound in the vacuum of space.  Addison
           watches Borney's wide eyes take in the intricate
           craftsmanship, the elegant design.   

                                 BORNEY
                        What's it doing?

                                 ADDISON
                        Playing music.

           Borney looks back at the box.  Smiles from ear to ear.

                                 BORNEY
                            (reverent, awestruck)
                        Treasure. 

           Back on the other side of the cave, Dylan is standing beside
           Caleb, looking at the moonman.

                                 DYLAN
                        He'd be proud of you.

                                 CALEB
                        I guess.
                                 DYLAN
                        Come on man, you should feel good
                        about this.  It was what he wanted
                        for you.  To see all this.  To -

                                 CALEB
                        I don't think it was an accident.

                                 DYLAN
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                        In the mines.  I don't think what
                        happened was an accident.  My dad
                        knew about the death benefit.  He
                        knew if anything happened to him,
                        then I'd get to go to Omega.  I don't
                        think it was an accident.  I think
                        he did it on purpose.  So I'd get to
                        go.

                                 DYLAN
                            (doesn't know what to
                             say)
                        Shit man.  I didn't - shit.

                                 CALEB
                        I could tell Ms. Slater.  They'd
                        probably cancel the contract, revoke
                        the benefit.  I could stay.

                                 DYLAN
                        Hey, no, no way man, are you crazy? 
                        You can't do that.

                                 CALEB
                        Why not?

                                 DYLAN
                        You listen to me, goddammit.  You
                        even think about that and I will
                        strap an oxygen tank to your back
                        and blow you off this goddamn rock
                        right now.  You hear me?  You don't
                        even think that.  Whatever your dad
                        did, he did it cause he loved you. 
                        You think my dad would do something
                        like that for me?  Would Marcus or
                        Borney's?
                            (off Caleb's silence)
                        Don't you get it?  You get to go. 
                        You're the one who gets to go.

                                 CALEB
                        I don't want to go.
                                 DYLAN
                        Well tough shit.  Because you're not
                        just going for you.  Man, I'd give
                        anything to get off this rock.  We
                        all would.  And now you wanna just
                        throw that away?  You're not just
                        going for you, or your dad, you're
                        going for the rest of us.  And it's
                        gonna be amazing man.  You're gonna
                        forget all about this place.

                                 CALEB
                        No I'm not!

                                 DYLAN
                        Yes you are!  And you should.  You
                        got so much ahead of you.  So many
                        things you're gonna see and do.  You
                        know why I smiled last night?  When
                        you were tellin' everybody what to
                        do and where to go?  Because it was
                        like, right there, I saw you.  I got
                        to see who you'll be when you grow
                        up.  You're gonna be a leader. 
                        Somebody people depend on.  Somebody
                        that goes where other people are
                        scared to go.  I got to see my best
                        friend grow up, right there.  All
                        the stuff I'm gonna miss.  I got a
                        chance to see.  And that one moment,
                        that one look - it made all this
                        shit worth it. 
                            (smiles)
                        I'm not letting you take that away
                        from me by acting like a jackass. 

           Caleb doesn't know what to say.  He looks around and sees
           Addison, Borney and Marcus all standing at a distance watching
           silently, having heard the entire conversation on their comms.

                                 CALEB
                        I don't -- Marcus?

           Dylan turns to see Marcus wavering back and forth before
           collapsing to the ground.

                                 BORNEY
                        Marcus!

           The kids all rush to his side.  Marcus, delirious, is trying
           to get back to his feet.

                                 MARCUS
                        I'm fine.  It's okay.
           Addison is checking the diagnostics on his suit.

                                 ADDISON
                        Oh shit.

                                 BORNEY
                        What's wrong with him?

                                 ADDISON
                        His carbon monoxide filters are
                        clogged.  He's not getting enough
                        oxygen.

                                 CALEB
                        Marcus, why didn't you say anything?

                                 MARCUS
                        I didn't want you guys to have to go
                        back.  

           There's something heartbreaking about his response.  About
           the lengths he'd go to make sure the trip was a success.  

                                 ADDISON
                        We gotta get him to the Rover.

                                 MARCUS
                        No.  I'll go myself.

                                 BORNEY
                        You can't go yourself, dummy, you
                        can't even stand.

                                 MARCUS
                        No, I can, it's fine.  You guys stay. 
                        Please.  I don't wanna ruin it.

                                 BORNEY
                        Well that's a bright idea.  You think
                        this is gonna be some kinda great
                        shakes if you die out there?  

                                 DYLAN
                        How much time do we have?

                                 ADDISON
                        There should be a sensor or an alarm
                        or something that goes off once he's
                        out of air.  We need to go now. 

           Dylan nods.  They all understand.  There's no time to waste.

                                 DYLAN
                        Okay, let's move.
           The group starts heading for the cable they hung from above. 
           Dylan lingers behind.  His eyes on -

           ANGLE ON : AN "OLD FASHIONED" NOTEBOOK AND PEN, SITTING ON
           ONE OF THE "SHELVES" OF THE CAVE WALL.

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                            (to Dylan)
                        What are you doing?  Let's go!

           Dylan thinks for a moment, then grabs the notebook and pen
           and stuffs it in his travel pack.

                                 DYLAN
                        Coming!

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The kids are moving along, Dylan and Caleb helping Marcus
           while Borney and Addison lead the way.

                                 DYLAN
                            (to Marcus)
                        It's not too much further, buddy,
                        you just hang in there, you're gonna
                        be --

           Suddenly, out of the corner if his eye, Dylan sees a tiny
           object strike the rocky surface.  Caleb saw it too.  It came
           from above and behind them. 

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        What the hell was that?

           Caleb turns and looks up at the dark inky void and sees,
           with a dawning sense of horror, the speckled swarm of tiny
           objects speeding towards them.

                                 CALEB
                            (under his breath)
                        The meteor shower.

           Hearing his voice on the comm, Borney and Addison stop and
           turn as well, paralyzed by what they see.  

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                            (screams)
                        RUN!!!!!!!

           Jolted back to the moment, the kids turn and start a mad,
           low gravity scramble towards the distant Rover.

           We switch to the frantic POV OF THE KIDS as they run,
           alternating from one character to the next, the sound of
           their panicked breath, their heartbeats racing! 
           Through their various POVs we see the first wave of tiny
           particles begin pelting the ground around them!  The "meteors"
           aren't much bigger than pebbles - it's like being caught in
           a deadly hail storm!

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                            (panicked)
                        Keep going, don't stop!  We're almost
                        there.

           No one else really speaks - not coherently anyway.  The sound
           is a collection of gasps and panicked mumbles as one foot
           goes in front of the next - none of them able to run as fast
           as they'd like in the low gravity!  And then -

           THE ROVER IS IN SIGHT!

                                 DYLAN
                        There!

           The kids continue to scramble in a blind panic.  Addison has
           fallen behind.  She's frantic, trying to catch up, panicking -
           we can tell from the sounds she's making that she's starting
           to cry.  And then -

           A larger meteor, the SIZE OF A BASEBALL, strikes the ground
           in front of her!  Missing her by inches!!!

           She stumbles back, falling to the ground.  Another rock hits! 
           Bigger than the last!!  Addison shrieks.  Panics, scrambles
           for cover! 

           The second wave is about to hit.  The rocks are getting
           bigger.

           Meanwhile, Borney is the first to reach the Rover.  He begins
           punching in the code to open the door.  But he's panicking. 
           He messes it up.

                                 DYLAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                            (via comm)
                        Borney, get that door open.

                                 BORNEY
                            (into comm)
                        I'm trying, I -

           A baseball-sized rock SMASHES into the Rover, just a few
           feet from Borney's head!  Borney lets out a throttled cry as
           he stumbles back.  Tries to find shelter against, underneath
           the Rover, trying to press himself into whatever crook or
           crease he can find.
                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Dammit, Borney, open the door!

           Dylan and Caleb arrive, dragging a groggy, half-conscious
           Marcus.  Dylan hurries over to the door and punches in the
           code.  As the door opens -

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Okay, we're okay.  We're here.  Just -

           Dylan looks around.  He doesn't see Addison.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Where's Addison?

           Caleb scans the area.  There's no sign of her.

                                 CALEB
                            (into comm)
                        Addison?  Addison, where are you?

                                 DYLAN
                            (into comm)
                        Addison!
                            (to Caleb)
                        Why isn't she answering?!

           The two of them stand there, a new sense of terror gripping
           them.  And then --

           The alarm on Marcus' suit goes off, indicating that his CO2
           filter is completely clogged - he's not getting any oxygen!

                                 CALEB
                        Over there!

           Caleb points to a rock formation about thirty yards away. 
           There's just a glimpse of Addison's suit peeking out from
           behind the rocks.

                                 DYLAN
                        Borney, get Marcus inside and change
                        his CO2 filter!

           Before Borney can respond, a LARGER ROCK - the largest we've
           seen so far - SLAMS into the side of the Rover!

           Borney is frozen.  Panicked.  Caleb grabs him by the arm,
           gentle, but firm. 

                                 CALEB
                        Borney!  You have to get Marcus inside
                        and change his filter.  Ok pal?
                                 BORNEY
                            (in shock)
                        I can't - I -

                                 CALEB
                        Borney, you want us to die out here? 
                        Do you want Marcus to die?

           Borney looks at Caleb.  Gets a hold of himself.  

                                 BORNEY
                        No.

                                 CALEB
                        Then move your ass!

           Borney nods, swallows his fear and grabs Marcus.  Pulls him
           into the Rover with an assisted shove by Dylan.

                                 DYLAN
                        You too, get inside.

                                 CALEB
                        No way.  I'm coming with you.

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (via comm, her voice
                             shaky)
                        I'm fine.  Get inside.

                                 DYLAN
                        Addison?  Addison, hold on, we're
                        coming to get you.

                                 ADDISON (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        No.  Go - go inside the Rover.  I'm
                        okay.  Don't come out here.

                                 DYLAN
                        Just hold on.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE, ROCK FORMATION

           Addison is crouched behind the rock formation, trying to be
           strong.  Explosions of rock going on around her.  She's not
           safe here.  But she doesn't want them putting themselves in
           danger for her.

                                 DYLAN (O.S.)
                            (via comm)
                        Just hold on.
                                 ADDISON
                            (into comm)
                        No!  No, stay where you are!  Dylan? 
                        Dylan!  Answer me.  Don't come out
                        here!  Dylan!

           Another impact close by.  Involuntary tears are streaming
           down her face.  She's terrified but she's holding it together.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                            (into Comm)
                        Caleb?  Dylan?

           There's no response.  And then --

           Dylan appears at her side.  Caleb close behind him. 

                                 DYLAN
                        Hey.  You having fun yet?

                                 ADDISON
                        I told you to get inside the Rover!

                                 DYLAN
                        Right, so let's go.

           Caleb looks up, eyes go wide.

                                 CALEB
                        Get down!

           Dylan looks up as -

           SMASH! 

           A meteor HITS THE ROCK FORMATION - sending fragments flying -
           one of them hits Dylan in the side of the head!  The "bang-
           bang" violence of the moment is jarring, as Dylan's limp
           form drops to the ground.

           Addison and Caleb recover, see Dylan lying prone on the ground
           as chaos reigns down around them.

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        Dylan?

                                 ADDISON
                        Dylan!!!!

           They drag him behind the cover of the rock formation as the
           storm intensifies.
           ANGLE ON : DYLAN'S FACE MASK. IT'S CRACKING.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        No, nonononono.

           Caleb is reaching into his belt.

                                 ADDISON (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 CALEB
                        I - I need to seal the cracks before
                        they spread.

           He pulls out one of the small electronic tubes Dylan had
           earlier and applies an epoxy sealant over the spider-webbing
           cracks in Dylan's face mask.  The epoxy holds, but Dylan is
           out.  There's blood on his face behind the mask.  It doesn't
           look good.

                                 ADDISON
                        Is he okay?  Is he gonna be okay?

                                 CALEB
                        I don't know.  I don't --

           Caleb is cut off as another meteor crashes down!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. ROVER

           Borney is sitting in the Rover, Marcus laying unconscious
           beside him.  He's got his knees drawn up to his chest, rocking
           back and forth as the Rover is besieged by meteors pelting
           the outside.  The Rover was designed to take a beating, but
           the experience inside is terrifying.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. ROVER - LATER

           Everything's quiet.  The storm is over.  Borney is sitting,
           staring at the door.

                                 BORNEY
                            (into comm)
                        Caleb?  Dylan?  Can anybody hear me? 
                        Addison?

           No response.  Marcus stirs beside him.
                                 MARCUS
                            (groggy)
                        What happened.
                            (looks around)
                        Where is everybody?

           Borney looks at him helplessly, he doesn't know what to say. 
           And then --

           The door to the Rover opens.  Borney practically leaps to
           his feat.  

                                 BORNEY
                        Guys!

           Borney's excitement fades when he sees Addison and Caleb
           drag an unconscious Dylan inside.

                                 MARCUS
                        What happened?

           Both Caleb and Addison are in shock.  They gently lay dylan
           down.  Sit beside him.

                                 BORNEY
                        Is he -

                                 ADDISON
                        He's fine.  It's gonna - it's gonna
                        be okay.  The rescue vehicles are
                        gonna be here soon.

                                 CALEB
                            (softly)
                        No they won't.
                            (off their looks)
                        The storm.  It means they're still
                        on lockdown.  They aren't coming.

                                 ADDISON
                            (teary-eyed)
                        Don't say that!

                                 CALEB
                        I'm so sorry.  This - this is all my
                        fault.

                                 ADDISON
                        Caleb, they'll be here.  Everything's
                        gonna be fine. 
                            (trying to convince
                             herself)
                        They'll be here.
           Addison looks down at the gauge on Dylan's oxygen tank,
           praying that she's right.

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE

           The Rover sits amongst the still, uncaring void of space. 
           We linger for a moment.  In the absolute silence. 

           INT. ROVER

           The kids are sitting together on the floor, their backs
           against the wall.

                                 BORNEY
                        What happens?  If the oxygen runs
                        out?

                                 ADDISON
                        As the levels get lower, your suit
                        starts recycling carbon monoxide. 
                        You'll start getting tired.  Then
                        eventually you'll fall asleep.  It's
                        peaceful.  You won't be awake when
                        it happens.  

           Borney nods.  Trying to be brave.

                                 BORNEY
                        Well, that sounds okay I guess.

           Addison smiles.  Does her best to lighten the mood.  

                                 ADDISON
                        I have to say, you boys certainly
                        know how to show a girl a good time.

           Marcus chuckles.  Then Borney.  Even Caleb smiles.  Addison
           looks at him, takes Caleb's hand.

           INT. ROVER - LATER

           ANGLE ON : CALEB'S FACE.  A TEAR ROLLS DOWN HIS CHEEK.

           A wider angle reveals he is the only one still awake.  Until -

                                 DYLAN
                            (groggy)
                        Caleb?

           Caleb turns, sees Dylan stirring.  Smiles.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        How long was I asleep?
                                 CALEB
                        For a while.  A few hours at least.

                                 DYLAN
                        The rescue vehicles?

                                 CALEB
                        They're on their way.  It's gonna be
                        fine.

                                 DYLAN
                            (frowns)
                        You're a crap liar, you know that?
                            (looks at the others)
                        Are they -

                                 CALEB
                        They're just sleeping.  For now.
                            (on the verge of tears)
                        I never should have made you guys
                        come out here.

                                 DYLAN
                        You're an idiot.
                            (off his look)
                        I'll probably live the rest of my
                        life on this goddamn rock and never
                        once set foot outside the dome again. 
                        These were the best two days of my
                        life.  Same goes for them.  So quit
                        pissin' and moaning about how bad
                        you feel. 
                            (smiles)
                        Besides, you didn't make us do shit. 
                        I woulda dragged you out here whether
                        you wanted to go or not.

                                 CALEB
                            (laughs)
                        That's probably true.

                                 DYLAN
                        Damn right it's true.  And don't
                        laugh.  You're wasting oxygen.

           That makes them both laugh.  They're getting delirious. 
           Practically drunk on the lack of oxygen.

                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Hey, I swiped something from the
                        caves.  One of those books they used
                        to use to write in?  I'm gonna write
                        you letters.  The way they used to
                        on Earth.  One every year.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DYLAN (CONT'D)
                        Send a letter on the transport ship. 
                        Tell you all the stuff that's going
                        on.  It'll be just like you're here.

                                 CALEB
                        Where the hell are you gonna learn
                        to write?

                                 DYLAN
                        I'll make Addison teach me.

           They laugh harder.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, she'll probably love that.

           The laughter tapers off.

                                 DYLAN
                        If and when and only then, right?

                                 CALEB
                        If and when and only then.

           Caleb's face grows nostalgic.

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        They were the best two days of my
                        life too.

           And then -

           The alarm goes off on one of the suits.  The same alarm we
           heard earlier on Marcus' suit.  The oxygen is gone. 

           Caleb is dazed.  Disoriented.

                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                            (groggy)
                        Is that - what is that?  Dylan, what
                        is that?

           Dylan doesn't respond.  He's drifted off.

           The sound of the alarm begins to grow faint.

           Caleb's strength is gone.  He's delirious.  He tips his head
           back against the wall. 

           CALEB'S POV as his eyelids grow heavy, beginning to close. 
           And just before it all goes black, a bright light shines
           around him.
           A wide angle of the Rover reveals the lifeless group of
           friends lying together in the Rover, the light coming from
           the flood lamps of an approaching rescue vehicle.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. INFIRMARY

           CALEB'S POV as he opens his eyes.  Taking in the room through
           his blurred vision, slowly coming into focus.  The machines
           by the bed.  The IV tube in his arm.  A NURSE comes in the
           room, walking towards him, a warm smile.

                                 NURSE
                        Welcome back, Caleb.

           End POV shot as Caleb tries to sit up, unsteady.  The Nurse
           puts out a hand to ease him back.

                                 NURSE (CONT'D)
                        Easy, not too fast.  Your body's
                        been through a lot.

                                 CALEB
                            (disoriented)
                        Where are the others?  Is everyone
                        okay?

                                 NURSE
                        Everyone's fine  The trip was a
                        complete success.

                                 CALEB
                        Trip?  What trip?

                                 NURSE
                        Aboard the transport.  You're on
                        Omega, Caleb.  

                                 CALEB
                        What?  No, I'm - I just fell asleep. 
                        We were in the Rover, I -

           He looks around the room, the reality of it setting in. 
           This room is not a room you would find in the dome.  

                                 NURSE
                        I understand it can be difficult at
                        first.  You're going to need time. 
                        To adjust.  There's a lot to deal
                        with.

                             to him)
                        This may help.

           Caleb looks at the folded sheet of notebook paper in her
           hands.  

                                 CALEB
                        What is it?

                                 NURSE
                        It came with your personal affects. 
                        Said to give it to you as soon as
                        you woke up.
                            (re: the letter)
                        Certainly don't see paper like that
                        anymore.
                            (warm)
                        It's gonna get better.  I promise.

           The Nurse leaves.  Caleb stares at the letter in his hand. 
           Gently unfolds it.

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        Hey man.  Told you I'd write.  Well,
                        actually, Addison's writing this one
                        because we're in a rush and my brains
                        are still falling out of my head a
                        bit.

                                 ADDISON (V.O.)
                        Hi Caleb!

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        Anyway I wanted you to know that
                        everyone's ok so that you didn't
                        worry when you woke up.  They're
                        getting ready to ship you out so
                        were gonna sign off for now.  But
                        I'll send another letter on next
                        year's transport, so keep an eye out
                        for it.  I'll send one every year,
                        just like I promised.  If and when
                        and only then.  Your friend always,
                        Dylan.

                                 ADDISON (V.O.)
                        And Addison!

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        And Addison.  

           Caleb sits in the empty room, staring at the page, the letter
           held limply in his hands.  We watch him from across the room.
           Isolated.  Alone.  His body begins to tremble.  Waves of
           emotion crash inside him like waves on a shore, choking him,
           until finally, he relents.       

           Throughout the following sequence, Caleb will read letters
           that span the years.  Just as we will see a progression of
           the life Caleb goes on to lead, we will also flash back to
           the moments in time when those letters were written.  We
           will see fragments and half-glimpses of his friends' life on
           the moon, much like the faded, half-glimpsed visions we saw
           of his father's recollection of Earth as a boy; recollections
           of a world and time that exist now only as a memory.  We
           never see the faces of the people his friends became.  

           Also, unlike the moon, there are daily cycles on Omega, so
           time of day for scenes taking place on Omega will be noted. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

           Caleb sits in a class full of kids, focused, as the teacher
           goes over 3D projections of different spacecraft design specs.   

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        Well, it's been another year and I'm
                        actually writing this one myself. 
                        I'm thinking of signing up for the
                        mines when they open registration
                        next year.  There's been a lot of
                        pressure to make changes to the
                        contracts so that the time doesn't
                        carry over anymore.  Who knows, maybe
                        I'll get to Omega someday yet.  Also,
                        I don't know what you said to Addison
                        before you left but the girl won't
                        leave me alone.

                        All year she's been showing up with
                        sandwiches.  I guess it's not so bad
                        though.

           EXT. OMEGA CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

           Caleb walks across the grassy campus.  The slightly orange
           tinged sun shining down, looking around at all the smiling
           faces.  He still doesn't feel quite like he belongs.  

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        We talk about you all the time. 
                        Everybody really misses you.  I hope
                        your first year on Omega has been
                        awesome.
           As Caleb continues to walk we -

           EXT. OMEGA CAMPUS, YEARS LATER - AFTERNOON

           Caleb, now nineteen, is walking with a group of friends, his
           manner calm, relaxed.  Things have changed.  He belongs here
           now.       

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        I asked Addison to marry me last
                        night.  She said yes.  Wish you could
                        be here, man.  Borney and Marcus are
                        doing great.  Marcus even met a girl,
                        if you can believe that.

           Caleb is talking to his friends when he notices a GIRL,
           standing with a group of her own friends.  Their eyes meet
           and the girl smiles shyly.  It's the kind of smile you fall
           in love with.

           INT. LUNAR MEDICAL CENTER

           Machines beep and pulse.  Dylan's hand holds Addison's, though
           we don't see their faces, we know the hands are theirs.  

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        It's been a rough year.  Losing the
                        pregnancy was hard.  I'm worried
                        about Addison.  I don't know how to
                        be there for her, I feel like I'm
                        letting her down.

           INSERT: Dylan, viewed over the shoulder, standing at the
           door of the Nursery they'd created for the child they lost.  

           INT. CALEB'S HOUSE - EVENING

           Caleb, now in his late-twenties, sits at his desk, the latest
           letter in his hand.  

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        I don't know to say this man.  We
                        lost Borney.  Doctor said it was
                        some sort of genetic heart defect. 
                        It's not fair.  Guy like that, he
                        deserved more time.  Marcus is taking
                        it pretty hard.  

           HILLARY, the Girl from the previous scene, comes into the
           room.  She's six months pregnant.  She leans over Caleb's
           shoulder, putting her arms around his neck and kissing his
           cheek.
           INSERT: A little girl in a white dress.  We see her feet,

                        Macey turned five today.  Every time
                        I look at her I think about how close
                        me and Addy came to calling it quits. 
                        Sometimes I think it was these
                        letters, knowing that you'd be reading
                        them someday, that gave me the
                        strength to hold on.

           INSERT: The dome.  Only this is not the dome we remember.

                        Addison's been working with that new
                        governance council I told you about. 
                        The changes here have been amazing. 
                        You wouldn't even know it was the
                        same place anymore.

                        you believe that?  Man, life is so
                        strange. 

           INT. LUNAR HALL

           A celebration is in progress.  There is a cake that read:
           CONGRATULATIONS DYLAN!  Perhaps it's a birthday, a promotion,
           It's hard to tell.  What is clear though, is that this is a
           room filled with joy.  

                                 DYLAN (V.O.)
                        I mean, if you'd told me this was
                        gonna be my life back in the caves,
                        that it would be so full of hope, so
                        full of joy, that we'd all find the
                        happiness we have, I woulda said you
                        were crazy.  But here we are.

           INSERT: FLASHBACKS

           Finally, over the following, we see images of the boys and
           of Addison on their road trip.  Images we've seen throughout
           the film.  Laughing in the Rover.  Raging in the storage
           depot.  Racing towards the caves.  We see them as we knew
           them.  As Caleb remembers them.  As they live on for him
           still.  
                                 DYLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I think I get it now, why it was so
                        important to your dad that you go on
                        that trip.  When I look at my girls,
                        I think about the friends they'll
                        make, the lives they'll lead, and I
                        think about us out in that Rover. 
                        What was it you called us?  Masters
                        of our fate, right?  I think we knew
                        somehow, even then, what that trip
                        really meant.  It was like this
                        magical dance you only get to dance
                        once in your life.  And when the
                        music stops, the record breaks - and
                        you'll never be a boy again.  Your
                        dad knew that.  And I think maybe we
                        did too.  Deep down, I think there
                        was a part of us that knew.

           We linger on the scene of them trashing the storage depot,
           the moment when Dylan threw his arms up in triumph, and let
           out a scream of tortured exultation.

                        bad news.

           INSERT: Dylan's frail hand in Addison's.  Tubes and machines
           that monitor his vitals.  The hand is not elderly.  It is
           the hand of a man ravaged by sickness.

                                 ADDISON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Dylan was sick for a long time.  He
                        didn't want to tell you.  He was so
                        sure he'd get better.

           INT. DYLAN AND ADDISON'S HOME

           Addison, now in her forties, stands with her back to us,
           going through Dylan's clothes.  

                                 ADDISON (V.O.)
                        He never stopped fighting.  All the
                        way up until the end.  He was that
                        same brave little boy that came
                        running through a meteor shower to
                        save me.  These letters meant the
                        world to him.  It's funny.  The page
                        I'm writing this on is the last page
                        left in the notebook.  Fitting I
                        guess.  He left me one more page to
                        say goodbye.
           INSERT: A pen scratching at the last sheet of paper in the
           notebook.  A tear falls on the page, smudging the ink.

                                 ADDISON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's so strange to think of you,
                        still on that ship, frozen in time. 
                        I suppose I'll be long gone too by
                        the time you read this.  But never
                        forget that a part of us will always
                        be with you.  

           INT. LONG RANGE SHUTTLE - DAY

           Caleb, now in his early forties, sits in the cockpit of a
           sleek, sophisticated long range shuttle, staring with a numb
           sense of grief at Addison's letter.  A small box sits on his
           lap.

                                 ADDISON (V.O.)
                        Just like a part of you was always
                        here with us.  Dylan made you
                        something while he was in the
                        hospital.  When his hands got too
                        weak, we made it together.  I hope
                        you like it.  After all this time, I
                        think I finally understand what it
                        means.

           Caleb gently opens the box and, at the sight of what's inside,
           something inside him gives.  He smiles, even as the tears
           begin to stream down his cheeks.

           He lifts a moonrock the size of his hand out of the box and
           he places it on "the dashboard" of the ship.  Carved into
           the rock are the words "If and when and only then."

                                 BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           Caleb gathers himself.  Turns to see his son, DYLAN (15),
           standing at the entrance to the cockpit with a travel bag in
           hand.

                                 CALEB
                        Dylan, hey, didn't hear you come
                        onboard.   

                                 YOUNG DYLAN
                        What's wrong?

                                 CALEB
                        Nothing, just - got a letter from an
                        old friend.
                                 YOUNG DYLAN
                        That the one that comes on the 
                        transport every year?

                                 CALEB
                        I guess your mother told you.

                                 YOUNG DYLAN
                        Bad news?

           Stares at the paper in his hands.   

                                 CALEB
                        This letter was written forty years
                        before I even woke up here.  It's a
                        funny thing, time.
                            (smiles)
                        I'll tell you all about it once we
                        get rolling.  Go on, strap in.

           Young Dylan takes his seat, begins buckling in. 

                                 YOUNG DYLAN
                        Where we going anyway?

                                 CALEB
                        I told you.  We're gonna take a little
                        road trip.

           Caleb starts up the ship's ignition sequence.  He glances at
           his son, staring out the front of the ship with a look of
           uncertainty and excitement.  Caleb smiles.

           We begin to pull back from the two, out of the cockpit, even
           as the ship begins its launch procedures.

                                 YOUNG DYLAN
                        So, you're saying this was something
                        they used to do on Earth.  

                                 CALEB
                        Yup.  And in fact, your old man
                        actually did it once with a couple
                        buddies of mine on the moon.

                                 YOUNG DYLAN
                        Really?

                                 CALEB
                        Sure did.  It wasn't long after your
                        granddad past away.  See, what
                        happened was...

           We lose the sounds of their voices as we withdraw further,
           the sounds of the ship overtaking them.
           All we see are father and son in the distance, their new
           journey about to begin as we -

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

                                 THE END
