               ..The camps were isolated, far from the centers of law, order 
               and protection. And so people took the law into their own 
               hands, when the occasion demanded it.

               Can't relax

                                                            FADE IN ON:

           THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

           A dark road, a darker night. Splitting all this nothing, a 
           BATTERED SUBARU barrels along, whipped speakers and rattling 
           exhaust pushed to the limit-

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           A rancher set back from the road -- The Subaru stops out front. 
           We glimpse PLATES: “North Dakota - Discover the Spirit!”

           Unfolding from the ride is a Native American TEENAGER. The back 
           of his jacket says ‘Pizza Palace’ and the name patch stitched to 
           the front reads ‘RJ’. A wannabe gangster, a dime-bagger townie.

           He pulls a rapidly cooling Meat Lovers from a warming sleeve, 
           makes tracks for the porch light. Knocks without hesitation-

           The door SWINGS OPEN, left ajar to the chilly Dakota winds. RJ 
           puzzles on this for a moment... Then he steps inside.

           INT. HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           An unlit hallway leads into the bowels of the home.

                                 RJ
                        Hello?

           TV SOUND throbs from the hall’s far end, which opens into an 
           attached kitchen... CANNED LAUGHTER, cranked up to 11.

                                 RJ
                        Yo! Pizza Palace!

           No answer. So young RJ has a look around -- Set by the door are 
           sunglasses and a wallet, fat with cash.. What to do, what to do?

           RJ quickly pockets the SUNGLASSES.

                                 RJ
                        I got a large Meat Lovers for...
                             (check his order)
                        Travis, here!

           Still nothing... Huh. Then RJ notices something odd: BLOOD. 
           Spattered and congealing, fanned up the hallway wall-

           A SCREAM slices the house -- RJ FREEZES. It came from the 
           kitchen... After some dithering, the kid screws up his courage, 
           creeps toward the sound. He peeks around the corner to see-

           INT. HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Three men. Or rather, TWO DARK MEN standing over one shattered 
           man, TRAVIS KEMPER, 30s, who’s curled in pain and plasma on his 
           simple kitchen floor -- Travis is a man UNDER SIEGE-
                                 TRAVIS
                        I’ve got cash... And keys’re... In 
                        the ignition... It’s a F-150, new! 
                        Got the satellite radio package!

           He pauses to cough a gob of blood matter onto the linoleum. 

                                 TRAVIS
                        Just take it. Take it and go...

           The dark men face away from RJ’s vantage. No way to gauge their 
           reactions... But the PISTOL tucked in the nearest man’s 
           waistband speaks volumes. The other grips a heavy PIPE WRENCH.

                                 TRAVIS
                        HEAR ME? THERE’S NOTHING ELSE-

           The wrench WHISTLES DOWN in a sickening arch -- RJ flinches 
           back, can’t watch. Backs out, digging his PHONE from his pocket-

           INT. SUBARU - NIGHT

           RJ’s back in the car, nervous. Waiting for something...

           Headlights flare in his rearview. They cut immediately, and a 
           HEAVYSET MAN moves to the window.

                                 FISCHER (O.S.)
                        Ya did right callin’ it in. They 
                        still there?

           The uniformed speaker is SHERIFF AL FISCHER... But we won’t see 
           much of him just yet -- For now all we get are GUT AND GUN.

                                 RJ
                        I think so.

           Fischer checks the load on his big Python.

                                 FISCHER (O.S.)
                        Hang tight. I’ll take care’a this.

                                 RJ
                        What’re ya gonna...

           RJ trails off -- The sheriff's already made for the front door. 
           He raises his revolver, creeps into the home without hesitation.

           RJ exhales heavily -- Reaches for the glove box. It clatters 
           open, junk spills out... RJ roots around on the floor... Finds 
           what he wants: Cigarettes. Next, goes for the lighter-

           POP!-POP! -- Smokes scatter into RJ’s lap as GUNSHOTS ring out -- 
           RJ’s saucer eyes go to the front door in time to see more 
           strobing FLASHES -- POP!-POP!-POP!-

                                                                CUT TO:
           POP!

           The CORK is pulled from a bottle of prosecco -- The geysering
           liquid is expertly controlled by a SOMMELIER.

                                 ELLIOTT (O.S.)
                        And this’ll get you into anywhere 
                        in the Capitol building?

           INT. MAURICES - NIGHT

           Widening out reveals JOHN STREET, 40s. Good suit and tie. Better 
           poker face... He politely declines the sommelier’s pour.

                                 JOHN
                        All that, plus a free side of slaw 
                        at Hooters.

           John’s handsome, sure. But more than that: Easy to trust. 
           Composed. And, impossible not to like... All handy qualities 
           when lying is a requisite to your work.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Why you bringin’ me here, then?

           Across is ELLIOTT, an Earthy mid-aged Missourian. He hands back 
           a CONGRESSIONAL ID. The restaurant is dim, thick with atmosphere 
           and DC strivers. The Capitol framed in the dining room window.

                                 ELLIOTT
                             (finally)
                        So what’s he like, your boss?

                                 JOHN
                        Busy.

           John exudes confidence. His only betrayal: He fiddles with a
           silver PENDANT, the size of a half dollar. It flashes through 
           his fingers rapidly, unconsciously, just below Elliott’s view.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        That why he couldn’t be here his 
                        own self? He too busy?

                                 JOHN
                        Not for the big boys, he’s not. 
                        Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon-

           Elliott smirks, helps himself to a breadstick.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Hey, it was you reached out to me. 
                        It was you who said the committee 
                        chair wanted to meet-

                                 JOHN
                             (interjecting)
                        Vandalia isn’t happening.

           Elliott enters a COUGHING FIT, face purpling-
                                 ELLIOTT
                        What??

                                 JOHN
                        You heard me. Vandalia. It’s over.

           Elliott gets his airway clear. Clear enough to get angry.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Ground breaking was six weeks ago!

           John shrugs. Showing as much emotion as the Palace Guard.

                                 JOHN
                        You got out ahead of yourselves. 
                        You didn’t do your diligence.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        What’re you- We’ve got permits, a 
                        bond issue... As we speak, 11,000 
                        square feet of sheet metal are 
                        being trucked across Indiana!

                                 JOHN
                        But you didn’t have everything.

           Elliott leans in, lowers his voice.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Now wait just a second, here. We 
                        were assured that contract was 
                        tucked in and waitin’ for us.

                                 JOHN
                        In so many words?

           Elliott eyes the passing waiter, considers how many forks he can 
           get into John Street’s eyes before they’re separated.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        You smug bloodsucker, I’ll-

                                 JOHN
                        C’mon Elliott, you know how this 
                        works. What we run on. Quid pro 
                        quo. And you got nothing to quo.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Check your books, asshole. We max 
                        donations to the committee members, 
                        the party and the PACs.

                                 JOHN
                        Just like everyone else. That’s not 
                        what it’s about any more.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        What the hell else you want from 
                        us? Kick our wives? Fuck our dogs 
                        around some?

                                 JOHN
                        Jobs.
                                 ELLIOTT
                        ...Jobs?

                                 JOHN
                        Jobs.

           Elliott settles back, thinking-

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Okay... Well... I suppose that, 
                        after the congressman leaves 
                        office, that we can find something 
                        for him. Advisor or some such...

           John FINALLY SMILES. He’s a heck of a smiler. Especially when 
           he’s hooked a fish-

                                 JOHN
                        You misunderstand. The party 
                        platform is refocusing. Employment 
                        is our brand next cycle-

                                 ELLIOTT
                        What’s this got to do with-

                                 JOHN
                        Let me finish, Elliott... 
                        Employment is our brand next cycle. 
                        Specifically, returning quality 
                        manufacturing jobs to heartland 
                        America. “America Assembling” we 
                        call it.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Well hell, right now we employ 
                        1,700. Once Vandalia comes online 
                        we’ll have 2,500 full time.

                                 JOHN
                        But it was 3,000 on the books last 
                        year. And 7,800 employees you had 
                        five years prior... And you aren’t 
                        even doing the outsourcing thing 
                        and shipping those jobs overseas.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        So? That’s nothing, a slump... 
                        Defense is an up and down industry.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re dying. Vandalia is a death 
                        rattle. I’ll put it in terms you 
                        can understand: We’re not marching 
                        out our prettiest daughter for a 
                        suitor who can barely limp his way 
                        to the porch step.

           John signals the passing waiter. He wants the check.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        You ain’t leavin’! Nothing’s been 
                        had yet but bread and bullshit!
                                 JOHN
                        I’ve got other meetings.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        Okay, okay! Hold on Mr... Street, 
                        is it? Look, success in my industry 
                        is predicated on two things, right?

                                 JOHN
                        War and innovation... Please. We 
                        get the NDIA annuals same as you.

                                 ELLIOTT
                        So we’re experiencing a drought of 
                        the first, right? But the second, 
                        well, we struck a gusher.

           John pauses, as though quaffing the veracity of this -- Deciding 
           if Elliott’s worth one more moment of his precious time. Then,

                                 JOHN
                        I’d need to see proof. Something I 
                        can take to the chair.

           Street conceals a smile, as Elliott reaches for his ATTACHÉ CASE-

                                                                CUT TO:

           BANG!

           A thick manila FOLDER lands on burnished wood. The folder reads 
           “CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY, NOT TO LEAVE OFFICES”-

           INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           John stands across from DAN GRISHOM, 60s, avuncular. Blue collar 
           manners at odds with his white collar sheen... Dan believes in 
           capitalism and second chances, in just that order.

           Also in the small but elegant Midtown office is KEN LEVO, a man 
           of martial bearing. He pages through the folder. It contains 
           schematics for a MILITARY DRONE.

                                 KEN
                        And then Elliott just gave it to 
                        you? On a phony ID and some 
                        bullshit?

           Ken SEETHES at this violation of security protocols.

                                 JOHN
                        He just gave it to me. After a 
                        phony ID and some bullshit -- 
                        Exemplary bullshit. But, still...

           Dan cuts him off with a look. Turns to smile at the client. 

                                 DAN
                        But that’s why you hire us, right? 
                        To find seams and turn stones.
           OFF Ken, taking this in-

           INT. CIGAR BAR - DAY

           All resplendent luxury, a great place for a victory lap. Dan and 
           John occupy a quiet table... Dan leans back, amused.

                                 DAN
                        Boy was he pissed. That file was 
                        supposed to be locked up tighter 
                        than a Mormon girl’s legs on prom 
                        night. Great work, bud.

           No answer -- John’s mind is elsewhere.

                                 DAN
                        John... John? You with me? Let’s 
                        talk a bit. How’s the family?

           John returns to present.

                                 JOHN
                        Alright... Tired. We’re trying to 
                        get Kate into Insight Academy.

                                 DAN
                        That specialized school you were 
                        talking about? What’s that like?

                                 JOHN
                        Equipped to help.

           Dan nods, knows what John’s talking about. We will later.

                                 DAN
                        The first half of our lives is 
                        ruined by our parents, the second 
                        half by our children.

           John cracks a smile at that. Dan’s on to new business.

                                 DAN
                        Well maybe I can help too: There’s 
                        something else. Just came up. Time 
                        sensitive.

                                 JOHN
                        I appreciate the thought, but this 
                        is my weekend.

           John stands, to go.

                                 DAN
                        Look, this new one? It’s serious. 
                        Need you to leave for DFW straight 
                        away.

           He produces a bulge of corporate stationary: “SecAn: Corporate
           Security Consultants” -- Affixed is a plane ticket, JFK to DFW.

           Pushes the papers forward. John stops, hates himself for asking:
                                 JOHN
                        ...How serious?

                                 DAN
                        $10,000 serious. For a week’s work. 
                        I like you too much to waste your 
                        time, John. Kate’ll understand.

           There’s John, frozen on the high dive-

                                 DAN
                             (nail in the coffin)
                        That school isn’t cheap, right?

           John’s eyes squeeze shut, and-

                                                                CUT TO:

           DING ... DING-

           Seatbelt light flares on. Time to descend.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           John seems not to hear it. He’s absorbed in the documents Dan 
           passed along -- Then, a light CHIME issues from his Blackberry. 
           This he notices. Takes it AS CUE to reach into jacket pocket-

                                 STEWARDESS
                             (in passing)
                        Sir? We’re landing.

           He nods, as he extracts an unlabeled PILL BOTTLE. Shakes two 
           into his palm. Knocks ‘em back, begins to tidy up for deplaning.

           INT. DALLAS/FORT WORTH - DAY

           John emerges into the bustling Arrivals Lobby. A suited DRIVER 
           waits, holding a sign with his name on it.

           EXT. DALLAS - DAY

           Strip malls and sprawl, far as the eye can see. The American 
           Dream on easy credit and Viagra.

           INT. TOWNCAR - DAY

           John watches it all roll by from the back of a towncar, the 
           silver pendant weaving through his fingers-

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Street? We’re here.

           EXT. MERCURY PETROLEUM BUILDING - DAY

           A towering glass monolith in downtown Dallas. The towncar slides 
           to a stop before it-

                                                                CUT TO:
           AN EARNEST CHILD

           In a framed POSTER, eagerly awaiting daddy’s arrival home from 
           work. Caption reads “Mercury Petroleum: Delivering Your World”.

           INT. RECEPTION - DAY

           John studies this piece of corporate propaganda. He waits in an 
           antechamber outside the office of some powerful man.

           The waiting room buzzes with ACTIVITY. Reports are being combed 
           by exhausted EMPLOYEES. The phone rings constantly. A rumpled 
           man snoozes on a couch -- His Mercury ID reads “Accounting”.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (to John)
                        You can go in now.

           INT. CALLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           John enters to find WILLIAM “PEP” CALLAN, 70s, standing, slowly. 
           Real money here, the kind that actually moves the world.

           Callan, once an undeniable force of nature, has become a 
           corporate lion in winter. He periodically sucks from an OXYGEN 
           TANK, something John takes in but does not mention.

                                 CALLAN
                        Mr. Street?

                                 JOHN
                        Mr. Callan.

           They shake. The office is a sea of tranquility relative to the 
           hurricane outside.

                                 CALLAN
                        Pep, please... Jamie, be a son of a 
                        bitch and fetch us up a drink. Mr. 
                        Street’s come a long way on short 
                        notice.

           Callan is attended by TWO PEOPLE. The first is JAMIE BLISS, 40s, 
           emotive as a cigar store Indian. Officially Bliss is the Mercury 
           VP of Internal Resource Management. But everyone knows what he 
           really is: Callan’s sycophant.

                                 JAMIE
                        Sure thing, Pep.

                                 CALLAN
                        Come, sit. How was the flight in?

                                 JOHN
                        Terrible. I tampered with the 
                        lavatory smoke detector, it became 
                        this whole to-do.

           Callan smiles, as Bliss sets down two whiskeys in cut glass 
           tumblers. Callan lifts his.
                                 CALLAN
                        To unquenchable appetites.

           He keeps the glass aloft briefly, waiting for John to hoist too  
           -- He does not. Callan shrugs, downs his alone-

                                 JOHN
                        Can we cut the shit, Pep?

                                 CALLAN
                        It’s your show. You tell me.

                                 JOHN
                        Because mergers are like a hot air 
                        balloon: Let off the gas and they 
                        sink right back to Earth.

           Callan’s face tightens -- But it’s Jamie Bliss who REACTS:

                                 JAMIE
                        What makes you think we’ve got a 
                        merger in the works?

                                 JOHN
                        Other than the accountants combing 
                        financials in your waiting room? 
                        Maybe the Kung Pao you had for 
                        breakfast after your all-nighter.

           Jamie narrows his eyes. Callan breaks the tension.

                                 CALLAN
                        What do you know about North 
                        Dakota, Mr. Street?

                                 JOHN
                        That it’s cold and it’s flat and 
                        it’s got a prettier sibling nearby.

           Bliss surreptitiously huffs into his palm, checks his breath.

                                 CALLAN
                        As you so astutely hypothesized, 
                        Mercury Petroleum is buying in 
                        North Dakota.

                                 JOHN
                        Fields? Land?

                                 CALLAN
                        Lunch.

                                 JOHN
                        Lunch?

                                 CALLAN
                             (nodding)
                        Or, rather, the capacity to serve 
                        it... Ms. Sanger?
           Callan’s second attendant, GINA SANGER, also 40s, spokesmodel
           looks muted for (and in service of) her high-flying career, 
           extends a thick FOLDER. John does not take it immediately...

           The folder she extends bears a logo and tag: “HOMESTEAD: All the 
           comforts...” It HANGS THERE, waiting for John’s acceptance-

           EXT. MERCURY PETROLEUM BUILDING - DAY

           John exits the building, headed for the waiting towncar. He 
           carries the proffered folder -- HE’S IN.

           The remainder of the office interaction continues in V.O.

                                 CALLAN (V.O.)
                        Mercury already owns and leases 
                        vast mineral rights in North Dakota 
                        -- At no small expense, mind you.

           EXT. EXECUTIVE AIRPORT - DAY

           The towncar drives onto the tarmac at Dallas Executive Airport. 
           A private jet bearing the Mercury logo waits idle.

                                 JAMIE (V.O.)
                        The Dakota shale fields have been a 
                        huge boon for us, for the entire US 
                        energy industry, really. With the 
                        advances in hydro-fracturing and 
                        horizontal drilling, we’re at an 
                        output of American oil that hasn’t 
                        been seen since the late 60s.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY

           A pretty FLIGHT ATTENDANT places a hot towel and flowers next to 
           John. He is one of two passengers on the flight, now airborne.

                                 CALLAN (V.O.)
                        Got the camel jocks quakin’ under 
                        their bedsheets. It’s great.

           He studies the folder, which is filled with dense financial 
           documents. Unconsciously massaging his pendant. Glances around-

           Gina Sanger is across, engrossed in a phone call. She sees John 
           looking. Smiles. ...Maybe this won’t be so bad after all?

           EXT. MUNROE AIRFIELD - NIGHT

           The jet banks toward a private airfield in Northwestern North 
           Dakota, a place characterized by a lack of characteristics. A 
           whole bunch of flat nothing, far as the eye can see.
                                 JAMIE (V.O.)
                        This boom means that little farm 
                        towns with one restaurant and no 
                        traffic lights are seeing 100, 200 
                        new workers arrive every month-

                                 CALLAN (V.O.)
                        Which is probably less than half of 
                        what we need, mind you.

           Early Spring snow edies and swirls as the Gulfstream descends.

           INT. HANGER - NIGHT

           The plane powers down in a hanger bearing the Mercury logo.

                                 JAMIE (V.O.)
                        Still, this means that specialized 
                        operators have sprung up with 
                        nothing to do with extraction, 
                        production or transportation of oil 
                        -- All they do is the people.

           The pilot points to a collection of luxury cars, loaner Mercedes 
           for visiting executives. John heads for one, Gina another.

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           John drives, surrounded by fields, unplanted, awaiting better 
           weather and the Almanac’s okay. Some fields sprout EXTRACTION 
           PLATFORMS -- They do not overwhelm, though. Horizontal drilling 
           allows for huge spacing between platforms.

                                 CALLAN (V.O.)
                        The best of them -- Or the biggest, 
                        anyway -- Is a company called 
                        Homestead.

                                 JAMIE (V.O.)
                        Provides room and board for some 
                        13,000 field workers, in exchange 
                        for a percentage of their gross pay-

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. CALLAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mercury HQ. John thumbs through the breakdown of Homestead’s 
           holdings. Callan has the same folder on his desk. 

                                 JOHN
                        And you’re buying Homestead -- 
                        Makes sense, vertical integration -- 
                        What’s your timeframe?

                                 JAMIE
                        The board votes in eight days.

           John snorts out a LAUGH at that, settles back-
                                 JOHN
                        So what do you need us for?

                                 CALLAN
                        Peace of mind. I might be a lot of 
                        things, Mr. Street, but reckless 
                        isn’t one of them. I want you to go 
                        out to Homestead.

                                 JOHN
                        Purpose being?

                                 CALLAN
                        The camps, these oil towns, they 
                        can be... Rough. They attract an 
                        element. It’s not unheard of for 
                        them to become drug hubs. Or worse.

                                 JOHN
                        And you want us to make sure this 
                        Homestead isn’t built on top of a 
                        pile of bodies.

                                 CALLAN
                        Last thing I want is being kept up 
                        nights wondering if the investment 
                        property I’m buying comes with a 
                        basement full of dry rot.

                                 JOHN
                        This is something you can’t look 
                        into on your own?

                                 JAMIE
                        We can. We are. But recently we’ve 
                        decided a little independent 
                        verification might be...
                             (delicate)
                        Prudent.

           Callan nods toward Gina Sanger, who has remained silent to now.

                                 CALLAN
                        This is Gina Sanger, our GC. She’ll 
                        be along to finalize terms. You’ll 
                        work with her.

                                 JOHN
                        So she does the deal, and I’m left 
                        auditing protocol and running 
                        background checks on roughnecks?

           Gina leans forward. Deploys her megaton smile.

                                 GINA
                        C’mon now. I promise we’ll find a 
                        way to get up to some trouble.

           EXT. MUNROE - NIGHT

           John’s loaner Mercedes flies past a SIGN for the township of 
           Munroe, North Dakota -- Pop. 11,246. The town, much like the 
           countryside it interrupts, is low and grey.
           Also displayed is the township’s motto: “Always A Smile!”

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Passing through Munroe. Little to see: Hardware store, pizza 
           shop, diner, bar, Ford dealership. Bare tree limbs rattle in the 
           wind, rictus fingers begging for a thaw that’s late in coming.

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - NIGHT

           Not exactly the Ritz, but comfortable. The parking lot is 
           jammed, license plates spanning the country: Iowa to Idaho.

           John’s Mercedes pulls in, finds the last available spot-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           A small and standard lobby, with an attached bar-restaurant, 
           Coasters. Rough men funnel in and out. It’s all strangely busy.

           John enters, heads for the reception desk, manned by a 
           septuagenarian DESK AGENT. Nametag: “Dave”.

                                 DESK AGENT
                        Help ya?

           John slides a card across to him.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve got a reservation.

           Dave checks his computer. John clocks the digs.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s busy.

                                 DESK AGENT
                        We’re booked near full. Just like 
                        every other night.

           OFF John taking this in-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           John searches for his room, number 171. On the way he passes 
           another group of hard men, casually walking with beer in hand.

           He finds his room, near the end of the hall by the back door-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John lets the door shut out the world behind him... Lets out a 
           deep breath... Then he moves to unzip his suitcase-

           But, something occurs -- He stops unpacking, checks his watch. 
           Then sits on the bed, lifts the phone receiver-

                                                              INTERCUT:
           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A homey kitchen in a pre-war building on the Upper West Side. A 
           fridge full of a young child’s art. EMILY BROGAN, 30s, enters-

                                 EMILY
                        No buts, missie! You brush your 
                        teeth and then bedtime-

           Emily is a delicate beauty seasoned by life’s perpetual 
           harassments. She’s also in the midst of a bedtime battle with an 
           energetic six year old foe. A nightly occurrence these days.

                                 KATE (O.S.)
                        I want a book! I want a book!

                                 EMILY
                        You just had a book! C’mon, brush 
                        ‘em up, double time!

           Emily sighs toward a sinkful of dirty dishes -- Just as she’s 
           about to scrub in, the kitchen phone begins to RING-

                                 EMILY
                        Hello?

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        Emily.

           She leans against the counter -- This is not a welcome call.

                                 EMILY
                        It’s late.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        I’ve been on the road all day, lost 
                        track of time... Can I say hi?

                                 EMILY
                        She’s going to bed. Hopefully.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        Will you just check for me?

                                 EMILY
                        You know our deal: You don’t call 
                        after eight. You work her up. She 
                        doesn’t sleep.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           This news, like a wet towel snapping his soul. He considers 
           pressure... Takes a different approach:

                                 JOHN
                        She keep waking up prettier every 
                        morning?

           The pendant has appeared in hand. He juggles it unconsciously.
                                 EMILY (ON PHONE) 
                        She does.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s from her mother she gets that.

           Emily’s annoyed GROAN floats clear from Manhattan to Munroe.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           She’s the ex-wife who’s heard it all before -- She shoulders the 
           phone, begins taking out exasperation on the dishes.

                                 EMILY
                        What do you want, John?

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        Something came up. Work. I was 
                        hoping we could switch weekends.

                                 EMILY
                        You promised you’d take her to the 
                        museum. She’s excited.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

                                 JOHN
                        I thought you might cover me?

           A hopeful BEAT. John squeezes the pendant tight-

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        No way. Not again. It’s too many 
                        times, now... But I’ll let her know 
                        you’ll take her next weekend.

           John smiles. Good enough.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           She stops her washing. The water runs.

                                 EMILY
                        But you have to do something for me-

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        Anything. Name it.

                                 EMILY
                        She’s getting worse.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        She’s still young. A lot can 
                        change.

           Emily is bone-tired. Though she and John share a devotion to 
           their daughter, this disagreement is an old one.

                                 EMILY
                        There was a situation. Yesterday. 
                        On the bus.
                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        A situation?

           Emily shudders, remembering -- Clearly an ugly scene. Our 
           imaginations run wild.

                                 EMILY
                        An incident. It was bad.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John’s eyes squeeze shut. A sense that he’s somehow blaming 
           himself for his daughter’s problems-

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        To top it off, I heard from 
                        Insight.

                                 JOHN
                        What’d they say?

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        They won’t hold our spot much 
                        longer.

                                 JOHN
                        Just remind me the tuition again?

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        Thirty seven.

           Ouch. John reels at the figure.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, well just... Let me see what 
                        I can do.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           In runs KATE BROGAN, age 6, dressed for bed, with a wild spray 
           of hair and eyes glowing with mania -- She radiates ENERGY, too 
           much of it given the late hour. Rushes to the kitchen pantry-

                                 EMILY
                        I’m at my wit’s end, John. I need 
                        help, here-
                             (then-)
                        No, baby! John, I’ve got to go-

           Kate is TEARING through the pantry, scattering canned goods and 
           jars wildly -- Emily moves to block her-

                                 EMILY
                        Whoa baby, whoa! Stop! What are you 
                        looking for?

           Kate’s expression isn’t malicious -- She’s SCATTERED. Keyed up.

                                 KATE
                        I forget. Who was on the phone, 
                        mommy?
           Emily’s used to tracking her erratic child. Doesn’t miss a beat.

                                 EMILY
                        Daddy.

                                 KATE
                        We’re seeing the blue whale 
                        tomorrow. They have tongues the 
                        size of elephants!

                                 EMILY
                        Not this time, honey. You’ve got to 
                        wait just a little bit longer.

           This news crushing the child. Emily wraps her arms around her.

                                 EMILY
                        Oh Bubble. I’m sorry.

           And then Kate’s face twists into a mask of childish RAGE. She 
           SQUIRMS in her mother’s embrace-

                                 KATE
                        No! No, no, NO!

                                 EMILY
                        Baby, you’re-

           Kate begins to BUCK VIOLENTLY against her mother’s grip.

                                 KATE
                        NO! NO! NO!

           Emily does the only thing she can: She clings on and waits for 
           the storm to pass. And prays it won’t last the whole night...

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John settles the receiver into its cradle... Absently shakes the 
           pendant some, stops. Stares at it -- A MAN’S FACE on it, just 
           visible through the wear... A wave of guilt comes over John.

           So he has a few calming breaths -- Count off to himself, 
           silently... The EXERCISE works. He grabs his jacket, and-

                                                                CUT TO:

           A TRIO OF SHOT GLASSES

           Oily brown whiskey is poured to overflowing, before they’re slid 
           across a sticky length of bartop.

           INT. COASTERS - NIGHT

           The shots join foamy cousins in pint glasses -- These 
           BOILERMAKERS are for yet three more ROUGH MEN, waiting.

           Coasters is the small bar-restaurant affixed to the Rest EZ. 
           Decor is pure cheese, but the clientele are something from Upton
           Sinclair’s “The Jungle” -- TOUGH MEN. Lots of them.
           John enters, clocks the scene, taking it in -- Then sees 
           something: Off in a quieter corner is Gina. Engrossed in work, 
           consciously blocking out the sea of testosterone. Moves for her.

                                 JOHN
                        Mind if I join you?

                                 GINA
                        Please. Keep the wolves at bay.

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks... Boy, this place is packed 
                        as a fridge after Thanksgiving. 
                        Hey, whatcha readin’?

           He turns the ring binder she’s highlighting. She examines him.

                                 GINA
                        Homestead’s P and L’s for the last 
                        three fiscal quarters.

           John flips the documents, scanning. He UNDERSTANDS what he’s 
           seeing -- Something not lost on Gina Sanger.

                                 JOHN
                             (impressed)
                        These are some ratios. What’re they 
                        doing in revenues a year?

                                 GINA
                        Almost 18 million. Privately held.

                                 JOHN
                        Who holds that 18 million a year?

                                 GINA
                        It’s scattered among a group of 
                        local investors... But mostly 
                        Homestead is Caleb Leaten.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s his story?

                                 GINA
                        Born here, Dad was a self-styled 
                        preacher, fundamentalist revivals, 
                        this sorta thing. He was also a 
                        drunk, with a long history of 
                        violence against Mom.

                                 JOHN
                        Sounds like a real charmer.

                                 GINA
                        Sure, and all that was before he 
                        went broke and lost the farm-

                                 JOHN
                        And the chance to lease the rights 
                        underneath when the town goes boom.
                                 GINA
                        Right... So, the bonanza kicks off 
                        and men flood Leaten’s town -- And 
                        there’s literally no place to put 
                        them. They’re making good money, 
                        and they’re living out of hotels 
                        and camping in parking lots-

                                 JOHN
                        He sees opportunity.

                                 GINA
                        Just inside of five years Homestead 
                        Logistics has three workforce 
                        lodges in Western North Dakota, 
                        largest being right here in Munroe.

                                 JOHN
                        Incredible.

           They’re interrupted by a COMMOTION -- At the bar, a shoving 
           match has broken out between two roughnecks. A bouncer separates 
           the drunk men, to the disappointment of the crowd.

           A SERVER appears, a young woman, rather plain. But as she moves 
           through the place she’s followed by LEERING, and we sense why: 

           There are almost no women here. One or two tough-looking lady 
           roughnecks, but few others. This constant attention has left the 
           server exhausted and suspicious.

                                 SERVER
                        What can I get you?

                                 JOHN
                             (re: the crowd)
                        Is it like this all the time?

                                 SERVER
                        Pretty much, yeah.

                                 JOHN
                             (to Gina)
                        What do you say we get out of here?

           ANOTHER FIGHT breaks out near the bar-

                                 GINA
                        I thought you’d never ask.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - INDOOR POOL AREA - NIGHT

           Our man RJ wanders into the indoor pool area of the hotel. He’s 
           in uniform, and sports a familiar pair of SHADES, evening or no-

                                 RJ
                        Call for a pizza?

           Seated at one of the wire mesh tables around the pool are John 
           and Gina. The place is otherwise blessedly quiet.
                                 JOHN
                        That’s right.

           RJ comes over, accepts cash without counting. He’s slump-
           shouldered, seems to have aged a lifetime in a day or two.

                                 RJ
                        Plates and napkins are in the bag.

           RJ turns and goes. John begins to set up dinner for them both.

                                 GINA
                        So how is it you got into this, 
                        anyway?

                                 JOHN
                        Serving pizza poolside at the Rest 
                        EZ? Funny, I was just wondering the 
                        same thing.

                                 GINA
                        You know what I mean: Consulting. 
                        Corporate Security.

           John passes her a slice on a paper plate.

                                 JOHN
                        I used to be a lawyer. ADA, 
                        Financial Crimes Division, Kings 
                        County... Once upon a time.

                                 GINA
                        You wanted to make a change?

                                 JOHN
                        Something like that.

                                 GINA
                        So this new gig, is it ever 
                        dangerous?

                                 JOHN
                        Sure. When I have to digest too 
                        much airport food.

           He bites into a slice -- It’s messy. She passes him a napkin... 
           They chew in silence for a moment, then:

                                 JOHN 
                        So what’s our plan of attack?

                                 GINA
                        Well, you assure the board members 
                        that the purchase of Homestead 
                        presents no undue surprise. You do 
                        this discretely, please, so as not 
                        to raise suspicions in our counter-
                        party. And while you’re doing that 
                        I’ll be finalizing the purchase 
                        negotiations.
                                 JOHN
                        And then we go live happily ever 
                        after?

                                 GINA
                        Easy, cowboy. Let’s see how the 
                        week goes first.

           Something’s going on here... Chemistry. 

                                 GINA
                        Can I ask what the coin is? The one 
                        you were playing with on the plane?

           John’s embarrassed, but... Might as well let her in. Just a 
           little. He gets out the pendant, passes it over-

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a pendant. St. Jude.

           She examines it -- The APOSTLE’S PORTRAIT worn down to nothing.

                                 GINA
                        Patron saint of lost causes.

           John nods, impressed.

                                 GINA
                        Funny, I wouldn’t of pegged you the 
                        God-fearing type.

           She passes it back. He begins moving it through his fingers like 
           a street magician.

                                 JOHN
                        Far from it... It belonged to my 
                        father. I carry it as a reminder.

                                 GINA
                        Of what you’ve got to live up to?

           He doesn’t immediately answer -- Instead, a timely interruption: 
           John’s Blackberry CHIMES. It’s Pavlovian: Instantly, he stands.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m going to hit the sack... I look 
                        forward to working with you this 
                        week, Ms. Sanger.

           He’s already moving toward the door. Gina’s confused as all hell 
           -- What just happened?

                                 GINA
                        Wait!

           He turns back.

                                 GINA
                        Gina. Call me Gina.

           John gives her a parting grin. It’s a doozy.
                                 JOHN
                        Goodnight, Gina.

           And he’s gone... Her smile DROPS. She returns to her work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           RUNNING WATER

           Gouting from a bathroom sink. A plastic cup is filled.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN’S ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           John shakes pills from THREE UNLABELED BOTTLES lined up on the 
           counter. Gulps them down. Then examines himself in the mirror -- 
           Studies his face. Checking for something... Not seeing it.

           Satisfied, he clicks the bathroom light off.

           EXT. MUNROE - DAY

           The sun rises all at once over the endless flat and cold of 
           Western North Dakota.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - INDOOR POOL AREA - DAY

           A lonely figure cuts across the pool -- John swims steadily, 
           goggled, doing laps, the only one up at this hour.

           Reaches the edge, momentarily bobs his head above surface-

                                 JOHN
                             (to himself)
                        Forty six-

           He ducks back under and pushes off.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           John shaves. Staring himself in the face. He’s clear-eyed. 
           Focused. Ready to work.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - CLOSET - NIGHT

           John peruses his shirts, finds the one he’s looking for -- 
           Smiles to himself...

           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - DAY

           A sprawling, fenced-in and lit facility, set back from the road 
           in the middle of nowhere. Low slung. Prisonlike.

           INT. NORTON’S OFFICE - DAY

           A wormy man, 40s, thin mustache, thinner hair, in short sleeve 
           shirt and tie. Nameplate: G. NORTON, DIRECTOR. He’s wiping 
           diligently at a spot on his desk when there’s a KNOCK-
                                 GILL
                        I’m on the phone!

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Someone to see ya Gill!

                                 GILL
                        What the fuck! Didn’t ya hear me?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        He’s from the county!

           Before he has a chance to give permission, the door swings open 
           and John strolls right in. Sticks out his hand-

                                 JOHN
                        Mr. Norton? John Street. Health and 
                        Human Services, Daggert County. How 
                        you doing?

           The man, whose Christian name is GILL, tentatively shakes-

                                 JOHN
                        I hope you don’t mind me barging in- 
                        I could see by the lights on your 
                        receptionist’s phone you’d finished 
                        your call.

           John pushes back a pair of unstylish glasses he’s donned for 
           this meeting, along with bad shirt, tie and shoes to match. 

                                 GILL
                        It’s... No problem. What can I do 
                        for ya?

                                 JOHN
                        Well, here’s the thing: The 
                        governor's wife Genie, she’s 
                        watching the TV some weeks back, 
                        and I know what you’re thinking, 
                        “Shouldn’t it be his honor who gets 
                        to hold the remote in the mansion 
                        in Bismark?”

           It’s all over Gill’s face: Who is this guy? Is he for real?

                                 GILL
                             (noncommittal)
                        Sure.

           John plows onward.

                                 JOHN
                        So Genie’s watching the TV, and on 
                        comes a report about crime in the 
                        man camps -- Gambling, drinking, 
                        fighting, etcetera-

                                 GILL
                             (interrupting/automatic)
                        Workforce lodges.
                                 JOHN
                        What’s that?

                                 GILL
                        Workforce lodges. We don’t call ‘em 
                        “man camps”- It conjures an image: 
                        lawlessness, vice, slums...

                                 JOHN
                        ‘Scuse me- Workforce lodges. 
                        Anyway, the governor’s wife sees a 
                        news story, now I’ve gotta drive 
                        out from the county seat.

           Gill turns this over in his head. Suspicious.

                                 GILL
                        Yah’d like, what, an inspection?

                                 JOHN
                        Nothing so formal. Just a courtesy 
                        call, to satisfy the old lady.

                                 GILL
                        Hey, no problem. Let’s go-

           Gill stands, gathers his coat from its wall hook.

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry to spring this on you. Not 
                        more than a formality, really.

           Gill doesn’t reply to this -- Instead, casually...

                                 GILL
                        Ya’re from the county, huh? How’re
                        those new offices working out?

           Without missing a beat:

                                 JOHN
                        New? Think you might have some 
                        wires crossed. We been in the same 
                        pile since ‘92, when the tornado 
                        cleaned us out.

                                 GILL
                        My mistake. This way please.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - OFFICES - DAY

           Gill leads John down the folding steps of his modular office 
           space and out among row after row of RESIDENCE BUILDINGS.

                                 GILL
                        Where ya want to start?

                                 JOHN
                        At the beginning, you don’t mind.
                                 GILL
                        Alright... This here is Homestead 
                        lodge. 4,500 beds. Biggest site of 
                        its kind in the US. And the safest.

           Gill produces a KEYCARD, inserts it into a door marked “26”-

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Inside one of the residence buildings. One long hallway, doors 
           on both sides, 120 rooms in all.

                                 GILL
                        Electronic card access, state of 
                        the art, plus full time security 
                        detailed to all common areas.

                                 JOHN
                        How many residence buildings you 
                        have at this site?

                                 GILL
                        Thirty eight.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - DISPLAY UNIT - DAY

           Gill shows John a DISPLAY UNIT: Single bed, dresser, clothing 
           rack, chair. Tiny and utilitarian, but not uncomfortable. Army 
           barracks crossed with a Red Roof Inn.

                                 GILL
                        All identical: Pillowtop mattress, 
                        heating and AC, WiFi throughout.

                                 JOHN
                        How many unoccupied beds you have?

                                 GILL
                        Maybe two or three come up a month?

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - HALLWAY - DAY

           John and Gill walk the same hall, passing a MAID CART.

                                 GILL
                        By rule, all units inspected and 
                        cleaned once a week, minimum.

           John has a glance into the open door. Inside is a MAN changing 
           sheets... John takes a moment to watch him work.

                                 GILL
                        Mr. Street?

           John turns back. Gill is waiting for him.

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry. Go on.
           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CAFETERIA - DAY

           John and Gill pick their way among CAFETERIA tables. The space 
           is well lit and maintained. As Gill mentioned, two uniformed 
           GUARDS oversee all.

                                 GILL
                        This is our Sundial cafeteria, one 
                        of two we have. Provides 24 hour 
                        food service.

                                 JOHN
                        How’s the grub?

                                 GILL
                        Not bad. Menu developed to maximize 
                        nutrients and proteins.

           John watches a man in a hairnet change out a steam tray of 
           chicken cutlets... Dumping the old ones in the trash.

                                 GILL 
                        If ya’ll follow me-

           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - DAY

           Gill leads John between buildings.

                                 GILL
                        Demand’s been pretty steady, on 
                        account of the boom. We got zero 
                        percent unemployment here, ya know? 
                        Men from all over the country are 
                        coming ta work.

                                 JOHN
                        Like the gold rush.

                                 GILL
                        Sure, except now days none of ‘em 
                        expect ta get rich. Now it’s enough 
                        if they just got a job.

           John isn’t listening. He’s stopped, staring at a fenced off 
           BUILDING different from all the rest.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s that building?

                                 GILL
                        Our infirmary. No real hospital for 
                        a good 100 miles, so we’re setup 
                        for most anything. Overseen by a 
                        man named Erskin. I’d introduce ya, 
                        but it’s closed today.

                                 JOHN
                        May I see it?
                                 GILL
                        Oh, not a good idea right now. 
                        Couple tanks of ammonia burst in 
                        there. Faulty valves. Doc says we 
                        gotta let it clear a day or two.

           John lingers. Wants to see in that building. Gill notices.

                                 GILL
                        This way, please.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - LEISURE BUILDING - DAY

           Gill and John walk a common area housing pool tables, couches 
           and flat-screen TVs. As in the cafeteria building, two uniformed 
           GUARDS are here, these posted by a door at the room’s far end. 

                                 GILL
                        This is our leisure building. We do 
                        a movie night every Tuesday. This 
                        week they’re showing “Manhunter”. 
                        Ya seen it? It’s good.

                                 JOHN
                             (enough shit)
                        So it’s 4,000 men living on top of 
                        one another... When was your last 
                        incidence of serious violence? How 
                        do you keep a lid on this place?

                                 GILL
                        Two ways. First, zero tolerance for 
                        alcohol, firearms, drugs. Caught 
                        once and see-ya. We got too many 
                        others tryin’ to get in.

                                 JOHN
                        And second?

                                 GILL
                        We’re an all male facility. No 
                        female tenants or staff.

                                 JOHN
                        There’s a sign on your treehouse
                        says ‘No Girls Allowed’?

           Emerging from the guarded door at the rear of the room is a 
           GIGANTIC MAN, sweaty, heavily TATTOOED. A corona of ORANGE 
           FLAMES licks up out of his t-shirt, a serious piece of NECK INK.

                                 TIGGER
                        Stays quieter this way.

                                 GILL
                        This is Tigger Zaitoon, Company’s 
                        Head of Security.
                             (to Tigger)
                        John works for the county. Health 
                        and Human Services.

           They shake.
                                 JOHN
                        Tigger? Interesting name.

                                 TIGGER
                        Yup.

           And that’s all he says... A man of few words, apparently.

                                 GILL
                        In there are our gym facilities. 
                        Would ya like ta see ‘em?

           Tigger’s unrelenting gaze bores into John.

                                 JOHN
                        I think I’ve seen enough. I’ll get 
                        out of your hair.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - DAY

           Gill and John exit the leisure building. John seems unnerved.

                                 JOHN
                        What is, uh- What’s his story?

                                 GILL
                        Tigger? He’s been with the company 
                        since the beginning. He and Caleb, 
                        the boss, they go way back.

           A pair of silver SUVs enter the compound, splooshing through 
           puddles and muck- John can see GINA in the rear of the second... 
           They pass, parking in front of Gill’s office.

                                 GILL
                        Speak of the Devil... Listen, ya 
                        mind finding your own way out?

                                 JOHN
                        No problem.

                                 GILL
                        Pleasure, Mr. Street.

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks for putting the first lady’s 
                        mind at ease.

           Gill nods, hustles off. John watches him go... And immediately 
           seizes the moment to deviate towards the forbidden infirmary-

                                 TIGGER (O.S.)
                        Visitor parking is that way.

           John turns- Tigger’s appeared, as if from nowhere, smoking among 
           HVAC and PLUMBING units out behind the leisure building.

                                 JOHN
                             (small talk)
                        Hey, lookit all that HVAC and 
                        plumbing... This building must pull 
                        serious resources, eh?
           Tigger’s jaw tightens, eyes narrow. He positively exudes menace.

                                 TIGGER
                        Who are ya?

                                 JOHN
                        Mr. Norton, he explained-

                                 TIGGER
                        Bullshit. Ya ain’t no Human 
                        Services whatever... Ya some kinda
                        liberal fag reporter, sniffin’ dirt 
                        in the flop and slops?

                                 JOHN
                        Absolutely not.

           Tigger drags on his cig, letting the moment linger. Then-

                                 TIGGER
                        Whatever mister. But know this: 
                        Ain’t nothing happens in the man 
                        camps I don’t get my arms ‘round.

           John showing nerves:

                                 JOHN
                        You mean, workforce lodges?

           Tigger gives him an icy, level gaze.

                                 TIGGER
                        Right.

           John can take no more, turns and heads for his car. A little 
           faster than is necessary-

           INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           John pulls the door shut. Catches his eyes in the rearview -- 
           Begins repeating to himself, remembering:

                                 JOHN
                        Zaitoon, Zaitoon...

           He starts the car-

           INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dan is at his desk in his Midtown office, inputting information 
           into his computer. A BACKGROUND CHECK appears-

                                 DAN
                        Here we go. Zaitoon, Tyler J. DOB
                        2/5/78... As for criminal 
                        records...

           Dan whistles, impressed-
                                 DAN
                        This one’s a peach. Here, 
                        forwarding you a copy now-

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

           John is back in his hotel room speaking with Dan by phone. On 
           his laptop Tigger’s criminal record appears.

                                 JOHN
                        Starts out a general nuisance: 
                        Assault, assault with intent, 
                        resisting. Then ups his game, gets 
                        nicked on Federal charges for drug 
                        trafficking into the United States.

           The St. Jude pendant moves through his fingers as he speaks.

                                 DAN (ON CELL SPEAKER)
                        Lands 14 months for that.

                                 JOHN
                        Must be where he picked up his 
                        people skills -- But trafficking 
                        charges and he barely does a year?

           INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dan scrutinizes his screen-

                                 DAN
                        Looks like they could only make a 
                        LIO distribution charge stick. Had 
                        a brother who took the brunt of it.

           Up pops a labeled prison INTAKE PHOTO of Tigger’s BROTHER STU. 
           Another real charmer, by the look of his dead-eyed stare.

                                 JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE)
                        So what’s a guy like that doing 
                        running security?

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

                                 DAN (ON CELL SPEAKER) 
                        Search me... But I want you to 
                        watch yourself. Let me know if you 
                        want me to send someone.

           John smiles. His boss’s concern is touching.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m auditing a company in advance 
                        of merger, Dan. Most I risk is a 
                        paper cut.
           INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 DAN
                        Just be careful. I didn’t pluck you 
                        from the remainder bin to see you 
                        tossed right back in.

                                 JOHN (ON SPEAKER PHONE)
                        Hey, I learned from the best.

           And John’s gone... Dan stares at the phone. Seems to toy with
           some decision, then -- Lifts the receiver-

                                 DAN
                        Find me Ed Hayes.

           EXT. MUNROE SHERIFF STATION - DAY

           A little storefront Sheriff Station. On Main Street, slotted 
           between Big Dick’s Hardware and the Eternal Youth Toy Store.

           INT. MUNROE SHERIFF STATION - DAY

           Small and unkempt. Behind the desk a Native American woman, 
           WINONA, 50s, reads a book about training game dogs. The BELL 
           above the door sounds. John enters. Winona does not look up.

                                 WINONA
                        Help you?

                                 JOHN
                        Hope so. My name is John Street, 
                        I’m an investigator. I need to talk 
                        to someone about Homestead Lodge.

           He shows a New York State PI IDENTIFICATION. She glances at it.

                                 WINONA
                        New York? You a long way off home.

                                 MATTIE (O.S.)
                        I’ll take this, Winnie.

           They’re joined by DEPUTY MATTIE COOPER, late 20s, youthful good 
           looks and rookie enthusiasm undulled by the uniform and gun.

                                 MATTIE
                        This way, please.

           Winona just shrugs, returns to her book.

           INT. MUNROE SHERIFF STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Mattie leads John into a cluttered interview room.

                                 MATTIE
                        My name is Deputy Cooper. What can 
                        I help ya with, Mr. Street?
           John looks her over, getting her measure: Mattie appears to be a 
           young mother playing at cop -- Though she’s got a reservoir of 
           grit that runs far, far deeper than even she knows.

                                 JOHN
                        I just had a couple questions.

                                 MATTIE
                        About Homestead.

                                 JOHN
                        You get many calls out of there?

                                 MATTIE
                        Not really. Stays pretty quiet.

                                 JOHN
                        And what do you know about their 
                        Head of Security? Zaitoon?

                                 MATTIE
                        A lot, actually. I usedta be 
                        married to his brother.

           John raises his eyebrows at this.

                                 JOHN
                        Small town, huh?

                                 MATTIE
                             (nodding)
                        Funny, Tigger’s about the last I’da
                        picked to run my security, but... 
                        Sometimes people change, I guess.

                                 JOHN
                        But usually they don’t.

                                 MATTIE
                        That’s true... So want to see ‘em?

           She eagerly begins scanning evidence boxes piled along the wall.

                                 JOHN
                             (confused)
                        ...What?

           She finds the box she’s looking for, plops it before John.

                                 MATTIE
                        We been taking bets on whether 
                        someone would show up asking after 
                        ‘em. Ya just won me a lunch.

           He has no idea what she’s speaking about -- But instinct tells 
           him to go with it-

                                 JOHN
                        And?

                                 MATTIE
                        We got about zero on ‘em so far. 
                        That’s why we put ‘em on the wire.
           She takes out medical examiner’s PHOTOS, postmortem close ups of 
           the men from Travis Kemper’s kitchen -- Both SHOT MULTIPLE 
           TIMES, puckered entry wounds shining under clinical light.

                                 MATTIE 
                        By their dental work, we’re 
                        guessing they ain’t from here.

                                 JOHN
                        What happened to them?

                                 MATTIE
                        Winona out there? Her nephew 
                        delivers pizza, caught ‘em at a 
                        home invade a couple days back. The 
                        Sheriff took it from there.

           She begins removing CRIME SCENE photos from the box. Dirty brown 
           blood smeared across the kitchen floor, the pipe wrench speckled 
           with viscera and hair, etc. -- All revealed in lurid detail.

                                 JOHN
                        Whose home did they invade?

           She passes over another picture, this one of Travis in a 
           security UNIFORM and shades, leaning on a truck. Happier times.

                                 MATTIE
                        Man by the name of Travis Kemper. 
                        Worked him over good... Died on the 
                        ER table in Lewiston, poor guy.

           John studies the photo -- NOTICING a badge on the uniform...

                                 JOHN
                        He was a guard at Homestead.

                                 MATTIE
                        ‘S why you were askin’ about 
                        Tigger, right?

           John carefully maintains his cool.

                                 JOHN
                        You mind if I make copies?

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - GINA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a Rest EZ hotel room door, seen from just inside. 
           Speaking on the phone OFF SCREEN is Gina. Providing dispatches 
           from the front, for the benefit of the Powers That Be.

                                 GINA (O.S.)
                        Price is all but agreed on.

           A POUNDING comes on the door-
                                 GINA (O.S.)
                        Only thing they’re stubborn on is 
                        indemnification...

           Again, the POUNDING. Louder.

                                 GINA (O.S.)
                        Sorry, would you mind holding a 
                        sec, sir?

           She walks into frame wearing an old UT sweatshirt and jeans, 
           phone in hand. Opens the door-

                                 JOHN
                        We need to see something.

           She covers the phone receiver-

                                 GINA
                             (whisper)
                        What’s up? I’m on a conference with 
                        Dallas.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re going to want to call them 
                        back anyway.

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           John drives the sloppy highway. A light Spring sleet has come 
           up, not unusual this time of year. Gina rides shotgun.

                                 GINA
                        This better be good. Pep hates 
                        interruptions. His third wife went 
                        into labor during a refinery ground 
                        breaking -- He detests the kid to 
                        this day.

                                 JOHN
                        Trust me.

           By her sidelong look it is quickly becoming obvious that she 
           DOES NOT -- Street doesn’t notice. Not yet.

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           The car stops before a familiar home: The one belonging to the 
           recently deceased Travis Kemper, now decorated with CRIME SCENE 
           TAPE -- John beelines for the front door.

           Gina gets half out. Reluctant to commit fully.

                                 GINA
                        What are we doing?

           He ignores this, busily snaps on latex gloves. Reaches past the 
           neon yellow police tape to try the front door... No luck.
                                 JOHN
                        Let’s try the garage.

           INT. HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT

           Quiet and dark. Momentarily. Then a beam of light cuts across 
           the dark space, illuminating fishing rods and hunting gear. 

           It’s quiet. EERIE. John’s penlight finds the door leading from 
           the garage into the house.

                                 GINA
                        Who lives here?

                                 JOHN
                        Nobody.

           He just keeps going. Relentless in pursuit of his logical end --

           INT. HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The kitchen light flares on. John pulls his gloved hand from the 
           switch, takes a moment to look over the scene.

           It’s bad.

           Furniture is overturned and dishes are broken. The patio door is 
           shattered. A thick smear of muddy brown blood has dried across 
           the tacky yellow linoleum, like some perverse Rothko. Somehow, a 
           ‘SECURITY’ jacket still hangs from a hook by the door.

           John lifts the jacket, displays the Homestead PATCH for Gina... 
           She stays quiet -- Better to see where all this is going.

           He skirts the stained floor to open a cupboard... Empty. He 
           takes a Xeroxed crime scene photo out, compares. It’s a match.

                                 JOHN
                        See the shoebox in the picture?

           He taps a RED BOX contained in the photograph cupboard.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s in an evidence locker. Know 
                        why?

           Gina just shakes her head. Something building inside her-

                                 JOHN
                        It had almost $15,000 in it.

           John shows her a Coroner’s photo of Travis. Ugly.

                                 GINA
                        We know about this.

                                 JOHN
                        What?
                                 GINA
                        We know about this. Travis Kemper, 
                        right? This was a burglary went 
                        bad.

                                 JOHN
                        ...That’s the current theory. But 
                        by the time the sheriff showed 
                        they’d been working on him awhile.

                                 GINA
                        You’re not listening: We know about 
                        this already. The official report 
                        confirms what I’ve just told you-

                                 JOHN
                             (interjecting)
                        If they were here to rob him, why 
                        not just grab the goods and go? Why 
                        stay and play Inquisition on the 
                        Prairie?

           Gina’s not liking what she’s hearing -- Her mask is slipping.

                                 JOHN
                        What if this wasn’t a home 
                        invasion? What if it was something 
                        else, something targeted? Something 
                        connected to Homestead-

                                 GINA
                             (icy)
                        Fuck you, Street.

           And she storms from the kitchen... He’s CONFUSED as all hell.

           EXT. HOME - NIGHT

           Gina marches from the home, gets to the car. It’s locked. She’s 
           forced to wait, standing there in that pissing Midwest sleet-

                                 JOHN
                        Hang on, wait-

           She spins, anger bursting like a furnace door thrown wide -- 
           This is not the Gina we knew the night before. This is a cold 
           blooded corporate assassin -- The velvet off the switchblade:

                                 GINA
                        What’s your game, huh?

                                 JOHN
                        What?

           She scrutinizes him.

                                 GINA
                        You working for him?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m working for Mercury-
                                 GINA
                        Because this deal, Homestead? I 
                        brought this in... Me! My vision.

           John is confused. This is not the reaction he expected.

                                 GINA
                        You know how goddamn hard it is to 
                        climb the ranks as a woman working 
                        in oil, in fucking Texas?

                                 JOHN
                        ...Can’t say as I do.

                                 GINA
                        I have to be twice as smart and ten 
                        times as tough as any good ol’ boy 
                        whose only qualification is 
                        dangling between his legs!

           And now she’s loosing a torrent of vitriol built over years-

                                 GINA
                        So, fuck you, and fuck Jamie Bliss, 
                        and fuck whatever angle you’re 
                        working to torpedo my deal!
                             (then; done-)
                        Drive me back.

                                 JOHN
                        If you’ve got some... Political...
                        Situation, I’m sorry. But that 
                        doesn’t change the fact that I was 
                        hired to dig into Homestead. And 
                        that’s what I’m doing.

           He triggers the keyless entry. Doors slam and the car is off, 
           skidding into the damp evening...

           ...And after the Mercedes leaves, another car rumbles to life -- 
           A purple MONTE CARLO, a real G-ride. ...Was it there before?

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           John drives. Gina stares out the window, silent. The storm is 
           passing. For a moment they just ride... Then:

                                 JOHN
                        What am I even doing here?

           Gina speaks without looking his way:

                                 GINA
                        Jamie Bliss. He’s got Callan’s ear. 
                        He used Kemper’s murder to get your 
                        company in on this.

                                 JOHN
                        And what does he want me to find?

                                 GINA
                        Anything... Something he can use to 
                        kill the buy.
                                 JOHN
                        I don’t understand... What I can 
                        see by the papers, this deal makes 
                        sense for everyone.

                                 GINA
                        Exactly. Except him.

                                 JOHN
                        This is about Callan, isn’t it? How 
                        sick is he?

                                 GINA
                        It’s the only adversary the bastard 
                        can’t beat or buy -- Time. He’ll 
                        need to appoint a new CEO soon.

           John stops the car at a red light. She finally turns.

                                 GINA
                        If the Homestead deal comes off the 
                        boost in share prices will be 
                        undeniable-

                                 JOHN
                        -And fresh on Callan’s mind when 
                        he’s picking his successor.

                                 GINA
                        So, spend the week. Walk through 
                        Homestead’s books, run whatever 
                        checks you want... Then, sign off 
                        on the deal. You do that and I’ll 
                        double your fee -- Not to your 
                        company either. Straight to you. 
                        Call it a completion bonus.

           John glances her way -- She’s collected. Composed.

                                 JOHN
                        Who do you think I am, exactly?

                                 GINA
                             (unflinching)
                        I know who you are, Mr. Street -- 
                        You’re just like the rest of us... 
                        You are a man with a price.
                             (beat)
                        Now you just have to figure out 
                        what that is.

           A CAR HORN sounds behind him. The light has gone green. Suddenly 
           the Monte Carlo ROARS past- Giving him a JOLT. 

           John collects himself, lets his foot off the brake, drives on-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - GINA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gina enters her room, shuts and locks her door... Then SHOVES 
           OVER a pile of documents in frustration. She stands at the 
           center of the dim room vibrating with ANGER-
           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John enters his room, stops, FREEZES -- His room has been 
           TRASHED. Ransacked. Someone’s been in here, and they made an 
           awful mess having a look around-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - GINA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gina gets hold of herself, crosses to her laptop. Types “John 
           Street Kings County ADA” into her search engine-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John begins sifting though the mess of his room, taking stock, 
           reassembling the remains -- Something occurs-

           He shows PANIC -- Scrambles to the bathroom-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - GINA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           ...And now a strange thing: Huddled in her laptop’s glow, as an 
           ancient adventurer on a foreign shore, Gina begins to SMILE...

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The bathroom, similarly destroyed, toiletries and towels 
           scattered -- But John’s only got eyes for one thing:

           During the search his PILL BOTTLES were EMPTIED OUT -- In haste 
           some caplets were trod on, others tossed to dissolve in the 
           toilet -- Whatever was in them, John will be doing without...

           OFF his concern, as he lifts a discarded bottle from the floor-

                                                               FADE TO:

           A FRAMED NEWS ARTICLE

           The headline: “A Homegrown Success: Caleb Leaten”. In the 
           picture a TRIM MAN, 40s, shakes hands with the lieutenant 
           governor while receiving an award.

           The caption below the photo: “Leaten, Born and Raised in Munroe, 
           Credits ‘God and Timing’ for Success”.

           INT. LEATEN HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY

           The framed article is one of many adornments on the sweeping 
           staircase wall, which leads up from the columned foyer of a 
           grand entranceway. Low along the wall is a METAL TRACK.

           Down the stairs creeps the man from the article, CALEB LEATEN. 
           Whippet thin and balding, swaddled in high-end jogging gear, he 
           moves quietly, trying not to wake the house. It’s early.

           Passes more mementos: Photos of his wife DARLA and their twin 
           boys, a framed ‘First Dollar’. Religious iconography pervades.
           INT. LEATEN HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

           Caleb reaches the base of the stairs, passing a grey metal chair 
           attached to the track, for use by a disabled person.

           Just before he reaches the door he stops, noticing -- Light 
           HYMNAL MUSIC floats from somewhere further in the house.

           INT. LEATEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           At the breakfast nook in the expansive kitchen sits Darla 
           Leaten, 40s. She is wheelchair-bound. She listens to religious 
           radio and flips through a gossip magazine in the morning light.

                                 CALEB
                        Hey hon. Didn’t know ya were up.

           She does not look up during their conversation.

                                 DARLA
                        For a bit now. Ya goin’ ta run?

                                 CALEB
                        Gonna run just a little bit yeah. 
                        Gonna stop by work on the way 
                        back... Got church in ya later?

                                 DARLA
                        Uff da. My leg’s ‘re screamin’.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay so we try for tomorrow.

           He turns and leaves. She flips the page of her magazine.

           EXT. LEATEN HOUSE - DAY

           A bloated Palladian McMansion erected on a large lot marked out 
           by newly planted trees. The yard is brown and dead.

           Caleb emerges. Fits EARBUDS in, presses PLAY -- Up comes a 
           VOICE, popping with static, a copy of a copy. The breathless 
           fire in the voice remains undiluted.

                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        I’d like to talk for a moment about 
                        our universe -- God’s universe! -- 
                        And the state of natural order...

           After some perfunctory stretching, Caleb begins jogging down the 
           long, curving drive.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

           The intersection where the driveway meets the desolate road. The 
           morning is cold and clear. Caleb runs with conviction. 
                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        Now despite the... Troubled... 
                        Times in which we live, there are 
                        some truths that have not changed! 
                        Some truths that will not change...

           As the preacher builds in energy so too does the runner.

           EXT. EMPTY ROAD - DAY

           A long and low horizon, split by drilling platforms -- The only 
           crops that produce year round.

                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        The universe was purposefully 
                        designed. Every and all things in 
                        their rightful place: Man to serve 
                        God... And woman to serve man!

           Leaten’s stride is steady. He pumps steam like a locomotive in 
           the cold morning air.

                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        From whence am I receiving these 
                        wild ideas? Some entertainment or 
                        idle talk? No! These are the words 
                        of the Lord our God!

           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - DAY

           The camp is quiet on account of the hour.

                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        For man does not originate from 
                        woman, no! But woman from man... 
                        For man was not created for woman’s 
                        sake, oh no! But woman for man’s.

           Caleb flies past, flashing between buildings at top speed.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - LEISURE BUILDING - DAY

           A GUARD, half asleep, snaps to as the boss, huffing and 
           sweating, enters the premises. Head swiveling. Seeing all.

                                 PREACHER (V.O.)
                        These are the words of our Lord and 
                        they are sacrosanct...

           INT. WINDOWLESS SPACE - DAY

           A small waiting room, unadorned except for a single, somehow 
           lurid, decoration: Christ in agony on the cross.

           Seated at a DESK is Tigger. He yawns and stretches, turns up the 
           volume on a small TV set. Lights a cigarette.

                                 CALEB
                        Ya wanted to see me?

           Caleb enters by way of a SPIRAL STAIRCASE.
                                 TIGGER
                        Got a visitor yesterday. Guy from 
                        the county wanted an inspection.

                                 CALEB
                        So?

                                 TIGGER
                        So he wasn’t what he said he was.

                                 CALEB
                        What was he? Reporter?

                                 TIGGER
                        Roper ‘a some kind.

                                 CALEB
                        What’s that now?

           Tigger taps a paper, though his attention remains with the TV. 
           On it a horny cartoon skunk manhandles an unwilling female cat.

                                 TIGGER
                        He’s staying at the Rest EZ, I had 
                        a look around his room. He works 
                        for a company does something called 
                        ‘Corporate Security Consulting’.

                                 CALEB
                        I wish you’da asked me first, Tig.

           Caleb takes the paper, briefly. It’s the job summary written on 
           corporate stationary that Dan handed John in the cigar bar.

                                 CALEB
                        This is nothing. Ya know what this 
                        is? This is Mercury being 
                        careful... He hasn’t found 
                        anything, right?

                                 TIGGER
                        The dead guard. He knows about 
                        that.

                                 CALEB
                        Him, and everyone with a TV set in 
                        the county. Anything else?

                                 TIGGER
                        Not so far as I could tell.

                                 CALEB
                        Good. And there’s gonna be nothing 
                        else to find... Right?

           Tigger finally looks up. A moment.

                                 TIGGER
                        Right.
                                 CALEB
                        So leave him be. Let him turn 
                        stones. Just make sure there’s 
                        nothing under ‘em...

           Tigger frowns, draws on his smoke. Caleb changes the subject.

                                 CALEB
                        How’s the flock? Up yet?

                                 TIGGER
                        Not yet.

                                 CALEB
                        Let’s go ‘head and roust ‘em, yah?

           He claps Tigger on the shoulder, as he moves past, using a 
           keycard to unlock the DOOR behind the desk. It is marked “39”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SPLOOSH!-SPLOOSH!-SPLOOSH!-SPLOOSH!-

           Arm churn. Rapidly. Franticly.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - INDOOR POOL AREA - DAY

           John SWIMS like a maniac -- As though being chased, almost. He’s 
           in the pool at the Rest EZ and has been for some time.

           He nears the edge -- Fingers extend, touch -- He pulls himself 
           out, huffing, COUGHING: He’s worked himself to exhaustion.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

           The room has been hastily reassembled. A cup of hotel coffee 
           steams on the nightstand... Police reports and photographs are 
           now mixed among the Homestead financial documents.

           Among it all, John, freshly showered, paces with PHONE to ear-

                                 JOHN
                        -No, no, NO -- You’re not -- You 
                        aren’t hearing me- I need you to 
                        overnight them...
                             (then-)
                        What do you mean you won’t?!
                             (then-)
                        Because I’m in the middle of 
                        nowhere. I don’t have anyone.

           He listens... And then, uncharacteristically, he EXPLODES:

                                 JOHN
                        Well what GODDAMN GOOD are you?

           PING -- Call waiting... He checks the caller ID.

                                 JOHN
                        Shit...
           He has a deep, calming breath... Takes the OTHER CALL:

                                 JOHN
                             (chipper)
                        Hey Dan, what’s up?

           Dan comes across with all the subtlety of a buzz saw:

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        What’s this I hear about you 
                        dragging Gina Sanger off a 
                        conference call to play Keystone 
                        Kops at some murder scene?

                                 JOHN
                        Good morning to you too.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. RUSSIAN & TURKISH BATHS - DAY

           Dan wears a cotton robe, speaks on a cell phone. He walks 
           between saunas, enjoying a morning steam. 

                                 DAN
                        She’s lobbying to have you pulled.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        And why would she do that? Because 
                        I’m coming onto something-

                                 DAN
                        Hello! Hello! What’s the first 
                        thing I taught you when I brought 
                        you in? When you were radioactive?

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        Dan, there’s something else too-

                                 DAN
                             (interrupting)
                        Remind me: Rule number one, is..?

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

           John grimaces. A kid caught red handed. Squeezing his father’s 
           pendant tight, says by rote:

                                 JOHN
                        “The people signing the checks make 
                        the rules.”

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Thaaaat’s right! And rules number 
                        two through all the rest? How do we 
                        sum those up?

                                 JOHN
                        “Don’t be a fuckhead”.

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Ding ding ding... We got a winner.
           INT. RUSSIAN & TURKISH BATHS - DAY

           Other robed patrons, Hassids, give Dan a nasty look for cursing. 
           He doesn’t notice -- He’s an angry parent slapping wrists-

                                 DAN
                        Now, I’ll grant you no orders were 
                        specifically issued against taking  
                        the general counsel of the Fortune 
                        500 company out to some dead 
                        townie’s house... But you know why?

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

           John doesn’t answer. Just waits for it-

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        ...Because that’s one of those 
                        things that falls under rules two 
                        through all the rest!

                                 JOHN
                        I’m telling you, that dead townie? 
                        He was into something. Why else 
                        would he have the box full of cash?

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Unless it’s to do with Homestead’s 
                        integrity as a company, I don’t 
                        care! What the man did, bought, 
                        snorted or sold in his free time or 
                        in his own home is not our concern.

           John sighs, scrubs his face. He’s looking a bit... Frayed.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re probably right.

           INT. RUSSIAN & TURKISH BATHS - DAY

                                 DAN
                        That’s right I’m right. You were 
                        hired to review corporate security. 
                        Not play Sam Spade of the Fly-
                        Overs.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        There’s something else. My room-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                             (interrupting)
                        Sorry, but I gotta ask: Are you 
                        taking your... Shit? Whatever you 
                        need to keep straight?

           John’s caught OFF-GUARD -- This subject so taboo to him-

                                 JOHN
                             (finally-)
                        What?
                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Your meds? You taking them?

           The pendant, moving FURIOUSLY... John cuts eyes at the 
           wastebasket. It contains three empty pill bottles.

                                 JOHN
                             (then-)
                        Yes.

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Alright then. Keep me updated.

           Dan ends the call, John sets the phone down. Then, stares at 
           it... And his medication reminder alarm CHIMES, tauntingly.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - GINA'S ROOM - DAY

           A HAND reaches into frame, KNOCKS politely.

                                 JOHN
                        Gina? Gina, it’s John. You in 
                        there? I come to make peace.

           No answer. He knocks again... The door opens. Gina looks great. 
           Smiles when she sees him. The smile doesn’t touch her eyes.

                                 JOHN
                        I just wanted to apologize. About 
                        last night. There was no reason for 
                        you to be there.

                                 GINA
                        You were just doing your job.

                                 JOHN
                        Right.

                                 GINA
                        Zealously.

                                 JOHN
                        What?

                                 GINA
                        Zealously. Manically.

                                 JOHN
                        Right...

                                 GINA
                        I’m glad we had this talk.

           And she closes the door. John turns and walks off down the 
           hall... Then, turns back -- What was that??

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - DAY

           Lot still jammed with cars. It’s clear that, wanting for other 
           options, desperate roughnecks have taken to living in the hotel.
           One difference this particular morning: Waiting out front is a 
           Munroe Sheriff's Department CRUISER. Leaning against it, in her 
           fur-lined sheriff coat and hat, is Mattie.

           She’s carefully unscrewing the top from a plaid print THERMOS. 
           Sets the top aside, begins to pour steaming coffee into a 
           Styrofoam cup. Sets it aside, begins pouring a second-

                                 JOHN
                        Waiting for someone, Deputy Cooper?

           John has emerged through the hotel’s automated front doors.

                                 MATTIE
                        Call me Mattie.

           She extends a cup to him.

                                 MATTIE
                        That’s ground cinnamon you’re 
                        sniffing. Better’n any cup in town.

           He accepts, gratefully.

                                 JOHN
                        Thank you.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya get a chance to go by Kemper’s?

           John’s demeanor shifts.

                                 JOHN
                        I did.

                                 MATTIE
                        ...And?

           She’s smiling at him... But scrutinizing as well. Under her 
           homey North Dakota patina, this woman has some steel.

                                 JOHN
                        And it was ugly stuff. Very sad.

           She waits, hoping for more... It doesn’t come -- Instead, the 
           SLIGHTEST TWITCH registers on his face. Mattie notices.

                                 MATTIE
                        Everything okay?

                                 JOHN
                        Sure.

           Beat. Mattie decides to let it lie.

                                 MATTIE
                        Well, if you’re not busy this 
                        morning I thought we might run by 
                        RJ’s, ask him a couple questions.
                                 JOHN
                        The kid who called it in?
                             (incredulous)
                        You haven’t talked to him yet?

                                 MATTIE
                        Not me -- Al. That is, Sheriff Al 
                        Fischer. My boss. He spoke with him 
                        and he wrote the report.

                                 JOHN
                        And what’d Al say?

           She turns, surveys the horizon... Then:

                                 MATTIE
                        Nothing. Just the kid shows up with 
                        a pizza, hears screaming. He calls 
                        it in and splits.

                                 JOHN
                        But you think there’s more.

           She stays quiet. Just sips from her coffee-

                                 JOHN 
                        Listen, I wasn’t completely honest 
                        with you yesterday. I’m not here 
                        for Travis Kemper.

           Mattie’s look suggests that this, she ALREADY SUSPECTED. Hers 
           are hidden depths, disguised in a town that would otherwise 
           mistrust female intelligence.

                                 MATTIE
                             (cagey)
                        Oh? You’re not a detective?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes- No- I mean, I am. But a 
                        different kind.

           She looks him over, taking her time in answering:

                                 MATTIE
                        What kind are ya, Mr. Street?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m here to investigate a company. 
                        Review its security. Make sure 
                        everything’s above board.

                                 MATTIE
                        Homestead?

                                 JOHN
                        That’s right.

                                 MATTIE
                        That where you’re goin’ all fancy?

                                 JOHN
                        That’s right.
                                 MATTIE
                        And what exactly does that entail?

           John is confused.

                                 JOHN
                        ...I’m sorry?

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m investigating too. I’m 
                        investigating the death of a man no 
                        one else seems ta care about. A man 
                        killed just three nights ago but’s 
                        already been forgot. To do this I’m 
                        going ta talk ta the only living 
                        witness to his murder, and then I’m 
                        going to try’n discern why a 
                        security guard who made fourteen 
                        seventy five an hour had thousands 
                        a’ dollars in his kitchen.

           John can’t help it... He’s impressed.

                                 MATTIE
                        When ya investigate a... Company? 
                        What do ya do? Where do ya go?

                                 JOHN
                        Not so much as that... I’ve got an 
                        appointment with Burton Transport.

                                 MATTIE
                        The trucking concern? That’s right 
                        near the station. C’mon, hop in.

                                 JOHN
                        How will I get back?

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya come see me after. We’ll grab a 
                        bite, then I’ll drive ya back.

           He doesn’t answer straight away, sizing her up. She looks right 
           back at him, open and honest. But EYES SHARP-

                                 JOHN
                        Okay.

           She claps a little.

                                 MATTIE
                             (excited)
                        Okay? Great.

           INT. CRUISER - DAY

           John clambers into the shotgun seat of Mattie’s cruiser -- As he 
           sits a recorded voice starts up:

                                 MATTIE (ON RECORDER)
                        Cinnamon bark home remedy for bed 
                        wetting?
           John pulls a small digital VOICE RECORDER from under his 
           buttocks. Mattie, embarrassed, snatches it away.

                                 MATTIE
                        So I don’t forget. Better than Post 
                        Its, I think.

                                 JOHN
                        Sure, and less mess.

           John examines the state of Mattie’s cruiser: It’s a jumbled 
           mishmash of children’s sports gear and police equipment. He  
           moves a bulletproof vest, picks up a hockey stick-

                                 JOHN
                        This police issue?

                                 MATTIE
                        Sorry. My week for the carpool.

                                 JOHN
                        How long you been with the 
                        department?

                                 MATTIE
                        Eight months, and it still seems 
                        funny... Never thought I’d wear a 
                        gun for a living.

                                 JOHN
                        How’d you get started, you don’t 
                        mind me asking?

                                 MATTIE
                        I don’t. Stu, my ex? Well, he was a 
                        bit of a dope... Anyway, he went 
                        away and Braden and me, we needed 
                        something dependable.

                                 JOHN
                        Braden, that’s your son?

                                 MATTIE
                        Mr. Hercules, pride of Munroe 
                        Elementary two years running.

           She taps a PICTURE clipped to her sun visor. In it a fourth 
           grader proudly displays a trophy, all brown hair and smile.

                                 JOHN
                        Cute.

                                 MATTIE
                        You have any kids, Mr. Street?

                                 JOHN
                        One. Kate. Six years old.

                                 MATTIE
                        I bet I check your billfold, all I 
                        find is pictures, right?
                                 JOHN
                        Sorry?

                                 MATTIE
                        I got two sisters myself. It’s 
                        something my father used ta say: “A 
                        daddy carries pictures where his 
                        money used to be”.

           OFF John’s appreciation for this bit of folksy wisdom-

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Another one story rancher, nicely maintained. Parked in the 
           drive are two cars, one of which is RJ’s familiar SUBARU.

           On the brown front lawn Winona, the police dispatcher, holds the 
           collars of two young Spaniel DOGS -- They strain, wanting to go 
           for the TRAINING DUCK across the yard. 

           Winona won’t let go. Between her teeth she has a whistle.

           INT. CRUISER - DAY

           Mattie pulls the car to a stop outside Winona’s house.

                                 JOHN
                        Where are we?

                                 MATTIE
                        Winona’s place. RJ stays with her.

                                 JOHN
                        Wait-

                                 MATTIE
                             (already exiting)
                        I’ll be quick.

           SLAM. Her door shuts. John watches Winona blow her WHISTLE and 
           release the dogs, before she and Mattie speak.

           After a brief (unheard) conversation, Winona points to the 
           house. Mattie nods her thanks and heads inside. In the distance 
           the dogs vie for control of the silicon duck.

           John SIGHS... Then opens his door-

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Winona stares at the dogs, still locked in a tug-of-war over the 
           duck. Frustrated, she blows two bursts on her whistle.

           John, approaching, squints a little at the sound. Before:

                                 JOHN
                        It’s Winona, right?

                                 WINONA
                             (still on the dogs)
                        Inside. Down the hall, second door 
                        on the left.
                                 WINONA (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        They got no problem fetching. But 
                        they don’t return for shit.

           INT. RJ’S ROOM - DAY

           A murky space. Blinds pulled, clothing in piles. On the walls, 
           posters for metalcore bands: Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, 
           etc. The den of a teenage boy stuck in neutral.

                                 MATTIE
                        C’mon RJ, just take me through it 
                        once more, ya don’t mind...

           RJ sits on the floor, hypnotized by some videogame. He marauds 
           through a digital war zone, firing a digital rocket launcher-

                                 MATTIE 
                        Ya arrive at Kemper’s house with a 
                        meat lovers, one’a my favorites by 
                        the way... Who answers the door?

           RJ’s tuned out. Blowing away terrorists in a pixilated land.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya’re not in any trouble, RJ.

           RJ gives a total of zero fucks. They might not even exist. Just 
           clacking on the game control -- Then, BWOOP! The TV powers down-

                                 RJ
                             (finally-)
                        Hey!

           Street stands with the loose end of the TV’s POWER CORD-

                                 JOHN
                             (without enthusiasm)
                        Answer the question, RJ.

           RJ shifts. Taken by surprise.

                                 MATTIE
                        This is John Street. He’s working 
                        with me.

                                 RJ
                        I don’t got-

           He stops. Looks nervously between them. Somewhere off in the 
           house a phone begins to RING-

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m just wonderin’ if there might 
                        be something ya... Forgot? When ya 
                        made your report to Al.

                                 RJ
                        He already talked to me. The, uh- 
                        Fat. One.

           John looks at Mattie-
                                 MATTIE
                             (aside)
                        Sheriff? He’s a bit of a big fella.
                             (then, back to RJ)
                        We know and thank ya much, RJ. 
                        Just... Maybe ya were maybe a 
                        little intimidated and didn’t want 
                        to say?

           RJ squirms. Uncomfortable in his own skin.

                                 RJ
                        I was ‘bout to knock when I heard 
                        the two of ‘em. Beatin’ on him.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya didn’t get a look? Ya didn’t 
                        hear what they were arguin’ about?

           RJ just shakes his head -- And Winona enters. She’s holding the 
           house PHONE, covering up the receiver with a palm-

                                 WINONA
                        Mattie? It’s Al.

                                 MATTIE
                        Give us a sec’ here, Winnie.

                                 WINONA
                        He wants to talk to you.

                                 MATTIE
                        In a minute.

                                 WINONA
                        He says right now like.

           Mattie looks at John -- What’s this about?

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Mattie steps out into the hall, accepts the phone-

                                 MATTIE
                        How ya doin’, Al?

           INT. RJ’S ROOM - DAY

           John is left with RJ, still seated, looking up at him. They 
           stare at one another. Neither wanting to be where he is.

                                 JOHN
                             (finally)
                        How’s the pizza racket? Tips okay?

                                 RJ
                        I guess.

                                 JOHN
                        People ever screw with you?
                                 RJ
                        Like how?

                                 JOHN
                        You know, order a dozen pies, send 
                        ‘em to the Bulimia Support Group, 
                        that sort of thing.

                                 RJ
                             (shrugs)
                        Sometimes people are assholes.

                                 JOHN
                        Is that why you let yourself in? 
                        You figured he was being an 
                        asshole, not answering the door?

                                 RJ
                        But I didn’t go in. I heard like, 
                        fighting. So I called 911 and left.

                                 JOHN
                        Then how’d you know there were two 
                        of ‘em in there?

                                 RJ
                        I didn’t- What?

           John’s speech is speeding up. RJ notices, unease growing-

                                 JOHN
                        Two of them, two of them -- You 
                        said you heard two of them... How’d
                        you make the number without going 
                        in there, Carnac?

                                 RJ
                        I, uh... I don’t...

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, maybe you get that from the 
                        Sheriff.

                                 RJ
                        Yeah. Yeah, that musta-

                                 JOHN
                             (cutting him off-)
                        But that still doesn’t explain why 
                        you’ve got the man’s sunglasses.

           John digs out a CREASED PHOTO of Kemper, the one of him standing 
           by the truck, wearing shades. Shows it to RJ.

                                 RJ
                        ...What?

                                 JOHN
                        Travis Kemper’s sunglasses. You 
                        were wearing them two night ago. 
                        When you were out delivering pizza.
                                 RJ
                        I’m not sure-

                                 JOHN
                             (and, again-)
                        They’re right there... Between the 
                        roach clip and the girlie mag.

           Sure enough, the nightstand is AS DESCRIBED.

                                 JOHN
                        So, why don’t you spare us both? 
                        What was happening... In that 
                        HOUSE?!

           The last word nearly SHOUTED -- Freaking them both out.

                                 RJ
                             (caving)
                        Sheriff says, he says don’t tell 
                        anyone! Don’t tell anyone I was in 
                        there. Don’t say what I heard.

           John seems to consciously rein back. Regaining control.

                                 JOHN
                        Why? What’d you hear?

                                 RJ
                        He’s doing my aunt a big favor, 
                        letting me slide. I get trespassing 
                        at least, if anyone knows went 
                        in... Says maybe I get blamed. For 
                        him. For him dying.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, slow down. What’d you hear?

                                 RJ
                        They was beatin’ on him. With a 
                        wrench, real bad... They’d swing, 
                        and it’d make this horrible sound, 
                        like wet and hollow... And in 
                        between swings they kept askin’ him 
                        a question.

                                 JOHN
                        What were they asking?

                                 RJ
                        Same question. Again and again. 
                        They’d hit him and then one would 
                        say, “Where the girl”.

                                 JOHN
                        “Where the girl”? Just like that?

           RJ’s out of steam, deflates.

                                 RJ
                        ...What’s gonna happen to me?
                                 MATTIE
                        Excuse me, John? Will you step 
                        outside with me, please?

           Mattie’s reappeared. Her demeanor has shifted.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re going to want to hear this-

                                 MATTIE
                             (cutting him off-)
                        Now please.

           She removes CUFFS from a pouch on her belt. John silently clocks 
           this change in mood.

           INT. CRUISER (MOVING) - DAY

           Now John rides in BACK of the undivided cruiser, among footballs 
           and homework. Mattie drives. Her earlier warmth frosted over.

                                 JOHN
                        At least tell me what this is 
                        about?

                                 MATTIE
                        Nothin’ probably. Just a quick 
                        couple’a questions.

                                 JOHN
                        What questions?

                                 MATTIE
                        Al called New York. Says your 
                        license has been flagged.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s why the big display?

                                 MATTIE
                        Says someone used it ta get past a 
                        night guard at a hospital outside 
                        Cleveland, maybe messed with a 
                        buncha medical papers... Sound 
                        familiar?

           John takes this in stride.

                                 JOHN
                        That was me.

                                 MATTIE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 JOHN
                        Pharmaceutical company doing third 
                        phase trials. Hospital had a 
                        security leak. I flushed it out.

                                 MATTIE
                        Is that right?
           John looks out the window. The desolation here is consuming.

                                 JOHN
                        Your boss is lying to you.

                                 MATTIE
                        It doesn’t much sound like it.

                                 JOHN
                        Not about me. About Kemper’s
                        murder. The report he filed, he 
                        left something out.

                                 MATTIE
                        And why would he do that?

                                 JOHN
                        People lie all the time. Make up an 
                        illness to cover for oversleeping, 
                        maybe a phantom trip to Europe to 
                        impress a first date, whatever... 
                        But when they lie about the big 
                        stuff, the stuff that might get 
                        them fired or arrested or worse, my 
                        experience? There’s only two 
                        reasons for that.

                                 MATTIE
                        Which are?

                                 JOHN
                        Money or sex... Or, money and sex.

           OFF her eyeing John in the rear view-

           EXT. ANGIE’S - DAY

           A homey family diner. As usual, the parking lot is packed with  
           trucks -- Not an inch of this town doesn’t crawl with men. 

           Mattie’s CRUISER turns into the lot.

           INT. CRUISER - DAY

           John’s confused-

                                 JOHN
                        ...What are we doing?

                                 MATTIE
                        I promised ya a meal, didn’t I?

           She climbs from the car.

           EXT. ANGIE’S - DAY

           She comes around, opens John’s door.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll make my appointment after all?
                                 MATTIE
                        We’ll see... Hands-

           He sticks out his wrists, she makes to uncuff him-

                                 MATTIE
                        One condition: I want honesty.

                                 JOHN
                        Or you get the boys in county to 
                        turn me into a fingertrap?

           Something parental in her look: Not mad. Just... Disappointed.

                                 MATTIE
                        A man’s dead... Someone, somewhere 
                        is hurting for him.

           This hits home. His poker face falls. She unsnaps his cuffs.

           INT. ANGIE’S - BOOTH - DAY

           An aged WAITRESS waits patiently for John and Mattie to complete 
           their order. It is midmorning but the restaurant is busy.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s good here?

           She removes his menu from his hand as she tells the waitress-

                                 MATTIE
                        Two patty melts. Thanks Shirl.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Comin’ up.

           She takes the menus, goes. John looks at Mattie, “Patty melt”?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s like 10:30 in the morning.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya gotta treat yourself. Ya never 
                        know which is gonna be your last 
                        sandwich.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s profound.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya disagree?

                                 JOHN
                        Not me, but I know someone who 
                        would.

                                 MATTIE
                        Oh yah? Who?

                                 JOHN
                        My ex. Nutritionist. A grazer, 
                        practically.
                                 MATTIE
                        Why’d ya two split?

           John is suddenly engrossed with the stirring of his coffee.

                                 JOHN
                        Irreconcilable differences.

           Mattie knows there’s more there. Aims a frank stare -- “Honesty, 
           right?” A moment... Then:

                                 JOHN 
                        Okay... I used to be a lawyer.

                                 MATTIE
                        I knew there was somethin’ about ya 
                        wasn’t ta be trusted.

                                 JOHN
                        I was one of the good ones: ADA. 
                        Put the bad guys away.

                                 MATTIE
                        Why’d ya quit? Money not enough?

                                 JOHN
                        Wasn’t the problem...

           John’s got the St. Jude pendant in hand -- Funny, doesn’t even 
           remember getting it out... He TRAILS OFF, stares at it-

                                 MATTIE
                        ...John?

                                 JOHN
                        My dad? He was what they called 
                        “troubled” -- And he’d never cop to 
                        it, never.

                                 MATTIE
                        A boozer?

                                 JOHN
                        And worse. Up here.
                             (taps his temple)
                        Bipolar. Not that he’d ever see a 
                        doctor. And he sure couldn’t seem 
                        to find work... Instead he’d 
                        disappear for weeks, God knows 
                        where, drinking and making bets he 
                        never had a chance of settling... 
                        Then he’d stumble home, beaten and 
                        broke, and absolutely crash -- Just 
                        stay in bed for months.

           Mattie’s not really sure what to do with this information.

                                 MATTIE
                        ...I’m sorry.
                                 JOHN
                        Apologize to my mother, who had to 
                        work and keep house and raise three 
                        boys -- For me, it was fine. I knew 
                        what I needed to do: Study my ass 
                        off and get as far away from that 
                        broken loser as I could.

                                 MATTIE
                        It sounds like you did.

                                 JOHN
                        I thought so... Then, during law 
                        school, things start changing -- 
                        I’d stay up for weeks cramming... 
                        Then, post finals, I can barely 
                        leave my room... But right away I 
                        know what it is -- All the signs 
                        are there. I’d seen it all my life.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya seem pretty together to me.

                                 JOHN
                        Because I got aggressive on it. 
                        Meds, every day, on a schedule. 
                        Exercise. Meditation... I do it 
                        all. And guess what? It works. I 
                        don’t have to tell anyone. Ever... 
                        I don’t have to ruin my chance at a 
                        normal life.

                                 MATTIE
                        So what happened?

                                 JOHN
                        Things were going great. I had the 
                        wife, apartment, kid on the way -- 
                        And most of all? I’m not my dad.

           John hesitates. Not an easy subject, this...

                                 JOHN
                        You know the difference between bad 
                        luck and fate? Fate’s got a sense 
                        of humor.

                                                                CUT TO:
           A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE

           A fine vintage. Lying on its side on a dance floor, drained -- 
           Now just an empty vessel. The label splotched with BLOOD-

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        We’d won a case, a big one: 
                        Hospital administrators defrauding 
                        Medicare for millions. Trial took 
                        weeks. And my boss had everyone out 
                        celebrating afterward.

           A slow pan reveals the DOWNTOWN CLUB in full -- The kind that 
           exists to inflame the synapses of the beautiful and upwardly 
           mobile. But, like the champagne, it has been emptied. Ominous-

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Now, I’m not allowed to drink -- 
                        Zeroes out the stabilizing effects 
                        of the meds in my bloodstream. And 
                        I know this. I’ve known it for a 
                        long time.

           Next, a VIP BOOTH fit for American royalty: Power brokers and 
           the nouveau riche -- But TRASHED. Table split, mirror shattered-

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        And I figure: Just this once. Just 
                        one time. I’ll let down my guard. 
                        I’ll live like everyone else.

           And now we hear it: Sirens, lots of them, wailing like lost 
           children, from nearby. Just outside the lavish club.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I don’t remember any of it. All I 
                        know is from the papers, once they 
                        got hold of it: Some poor kid 
                        spills a drink. We get into it, and 
                        I just start hitting him. Over and 
                        over. Took three bouncers to drag 
                        me off. Then I went after them-

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. ANGIE’S - BOOTH - DAY

           Mattie, affected by his telling-

                                 JOHN
                        The DA convinced the family not to 
                        press charges, but I still lost 
                        everything in the fallout: My 
                        career, my family -- I hadn’t told 
                        them -- I hadn’t told a soul -- 
                        About my... Condition.

                                 MATTIE
                        Your wife?
                                 JOHN
                        Not a soul.
                             (then, carefully-)
                        It’s been my experience that... 
                        When people, no matter how 
                        enlightened... Get wind that you’re-

           “Crazy” -- Can’t even bring himself to say the word-

                                 JOHN
                        Well, it’s suddenly a whole lot 
                        easier not to trust you.

           Their food arrives, ending the line of discussion. John tucks in 
           -- Happy to be done with his retelling. For her part, Mattie is 
           a bit off-balance, the story is so... Raw -- So, downplays, as:

                                 MATTIE
                        So what’d RJ tell ya?

                                 JOHN
                        What the guys who killed Travis 
                        Kemper wanted.

           Mattie’s excitement shows plain:

                                 MATTIE
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        “Where the girl”.

                                 MATTIE
                        Where the girl?

                                 JOHN
                        “Where the girl”... Meaning either 
                        RJ doesn’t hear English real good, 
                        or those guys didn’t speak it.

           And now she’s caught up in logicking it out-

                                 MATTIE
                        RJ tells this to Al, and Al just... 
                        Leaves it out of the report?

                                 JOHN
                        Told the kid he was doing him a 
                        favor... He’s scared of being 
                        implicated.
                             (re: sandwich)
                        These are excellent, by the way.

                                 MATTIE
                        I think we should go talk ta him 
                        again. And I wanna have another 
                        look around Kemper’s place.

           She signals, trying to get the waitress’ attention.
                                 JOHN
                        You know the most dangerous thing 
                        to chase, deputy?

                                 MATTIE
                        This is what, a trick question?

                                 JOHN
                        A cause. Thinking- Knowing- there’s 
                        a wrong needs to be put right. And 
                        you’re the one to do it.

                                 MATTIE
                        What’s that got ta do with-

                                 JOHN
                        What happens when the bad guys win?

                                 MATTIE
                        But the bad guys don’t win.

           Like a tidal pull, John’s speech is again increasing in volume -- 
           Mattie sinks further and further back during the following:

                                 JOHN
                        Sure they do -- They’re winning 
                        right now -- And nobody cares... 
                        Bankers taxed at a quarter the rate 
                        of teachers, politicians put in 
                        office by corporate money doing 
                        favors in kind, gun companies 
                        selling the idea they make us 
                        safer...
                             (beat)
                        Bad guys are winning all the time. 
                        And you don’t even know it.

           Mattie’s response is halting... And, concerned:

                                 MATTIE
                        Maybe out there. But not here. Not 
                        in Munroe, North Dakota. Here 
                        people are decent. Here people look 
                        after one another.

                                 JOHN
                        Is that right?

           John gets to his feet. He’s leaving.

                                 MATTIE
                        Sure. Heck, I haven’t had to take 
                        out my sidearm once. Haven't even 
                        thought I might.

                                 JOHN
                        May your luck continue. But you’re 
                        in barely a hockey season...
                             (then)
                        So, thanks for lunch. Tell your 
                        boss... Whatever. I’m out of here 
                        in a couple of days.
           Mattie’s face falls. She wants to believe in the goodness of 
           John Street -- To trust him. But he’s not making it easy...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DOLLY OF BANKERS BOXES

           Being pushed effortfully and set down heavily-

           INT. BURTON TRUCKING - OFFICE - DAY

           The bearer, STEPHANIE, late 40s, exhales from the exertion... 
           She studies John, in the midst of a growing PAPER MASS.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        That’s most of the Homestead 
                        manifestos. Ya want I should keep 
                        going?

           She adds the boxes to the pile already here. He’s auditing 
           shipping manifestos. It’s boring.

                                 JOHN
                        All you’ve got, please.
                             (then)
                        Stephanie, right? Would you c’mere, 
                        take a look at this for a second?

           She comes around. He’s holding a manifesto CARBON COPY-

                                 JOHN
                        What’s this look like to you?

           The genial woman dons a pair of reading glasses, then-

                                 STEPHANIE
                             (reading)
                        Tubing, IV Bags, Codeine Phosphate, 
                        Azithro...

                                 JOHN
                        Azithromycin. Common antibiotic. 
                        This is medical supplies they’re 
                        ordering, right? Okay, read this-

           He points to an entry.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Levo... Norgestrel implants... 
                        What’s that?

                                 JOHN
                        Norplant. Birth control sticks they 
                        put under the skin. Good for like 
                        five years. Big in the third world.

           Stephanie gives him a even Midwestern look -- So?

                                 JOHN
                        What’s a ‘No Girls Allowed’ man 
                        camp want with that?
           A moment... Then the phone out front begins to RING.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I gotta get that.
                             (as she goes)
                        ...So it’s happening? Mercury 
                        buying Homestead?

           He focuses on the medical supply sheet -- Something percolating-

                                 JOHN
                        I really can’t say.

           She stops, turns back -- Starts to say something ... Doesn’t. 
           She’s staring at his hand -- It’s tap-tap-tapping on the desk.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Ya work for Mercury, right?

           He follows her gaze... Stops his tic. Moves hand to his lap.

                                 JOHN
                        Consultant, yes.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        ‘S funny. When Caleb started up 
                        Homestead there was about a dozen 
                        other little roughneck dorms 
                        startin’ up too.

           This gets his attention. He looks up from his work.

                                 JOHN
                        But his was the only one that took.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Lucky, I guess. It’s like he says 
                        at Bible Study: Wealth dwells in 
                        the houses of the righteous.

           The phone continues to RING.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’ll see what else I can find.

           She closes the door behind her... And his cell phone begins to 
           RING -- He digs it out from under a paper mound, answers-

                                 JOHN
                        Hello?

                                 KATE (ON PHONE)
                        Daddy I’m in school!

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           A bustling city grocery store. Kate stands with her mother mid-
           aisle, with Emily’s cell phone pressed to her face. 
                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        What’s that, honey?

                                 KATE
                        I’m in school, I’m in school!

           Kate’s speech is pressured, excitable -- She’s worked up.

           INT. BURTON TRUCKING - OFFICE - DAY

           John’s happy to talk, but CONFUSED. Plus her tone worries him 
           some -- The obvious mania of it. Still, continues playfully:

                                 JOHN
                        Like, right now?

                                 KATE (ON PHONE)
                        Daddy, when will I see you?

           This change in tack, though seemingly erratic, still HURTS.

                                 JOHN
                        Soon Bubble. We’ll go to the 
                        museum. To see the whale.

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                             (interrupting)
                        -Hang on -- It’s me now-

           John’s face adjusts.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Kate’s abandoned the phone to her mother, to dash off and sate 
           some urgent curiosity.

                                 EMILY
                        She insisted on talking to you.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        What was she saying?

                                 EMILY
                        Insight called today. They gave her 
                        a scholarship.

           INT. BURTON TRUCKING - OFFICE - DAY

           John’s face LIGHTS.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s wonderful news, Em!

                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        It’s only partial tuition. But it’s 
                        something.

                                 JOHN
                        How partial are we talking?
                                 EMILY (ON PHONE)
                        We just need to come up with twenty 
                        two.

           Not quite the windfall he’d hoped for -- John resumes tapping 
           away on the desk, with gusto.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        I’m just not sure where to-

                                 EMILY
                             (interrupting/emotional)
                        Listen! Listen, Goddamn you!
                             (then; collecting herself)
                        She’ll go days bouncing off the 
                        walls, and then a week where she’ll 
                        barely eat or talk-

           Emily notices: Kate is half done with a mustard Jackson Pollock 
           on the floor -- A real mess. Strangers give Emily the evil eye-

                                 EMILY
                        I knew this was a possibility, 
                        okay? Wasn’t quite what I signed up 
                        for, but I made peace with that... 
                        But I’m doing it alone, John! This 
                        is your problem! And I’m handling 
                        it all alone!

           She stabs at the End Call button, heads for Kate. Steeling 
           herself for the outburst that’s sure to come.

           INT. BURTON TRUCKING - OFFICE - DAY

           John stares at the phone, seems to make a decision -- Then 
           Stephanie reappears, another BOX underarm.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I found one more!

           John eyes the new box -- And, like clockwork, his Blackberry 
           alarm CHIMES. Again John feels the twist of the knife.

                                 JOHN
                        Mind if I pick it up tomorrow? 
                        There’s someone I need to see.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Course. I’ll have it right here.

           John’s already headed for the door.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Busy. Like always. Roughnecks everywhere. John enters, 
           approaches Dave the Desk Clerk.

                                 JOHN
                        171. Any messages?
                                 DESK AGENT
                        I’ll check... No.

           John nods, turns to go -- Then stops, turns back-

                                 JOHN
                        A woman I work with checked in same 
                        night as me... I’m wondering if 
                        you’ve seen her tonight? She’s-

                                 DESK AGENT
                             (interrupting)
                        She’s in Coasters.

                                 JOHN
                        You know who I’m talking about?

                                 DESK AGENT
                        We only got the one staying. I just 
                        saw her go in.

                                 JOHN
                        In the entire hotel? You’ve only 
                        got one woman staying?

           OFF Dave’s vacant smile-

           INT. COASTERS - NIGHT

           Gina Sanger occupies a quiet table, apparently alone. John sits 
           down all at once, places hands on tabletop -- Again, his speech
           is RAPID. As though his words are all in a race to escape.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, listen. I’m not here to cause 
                        problems for anyone. I want you to 
                        know that you can count on me. That 
                        everyone can count on me.
                             (insinuating)
                        And I’m hoping that I can count on 
                        you... As in regards to what we 
                        spoke about. The bonus.

           John stops, stares, expectant. Gina says nothing. Instead:

                                 CALEB (O.S.)
                        You’re in my seat.

           John looks up. Standing there is Caleb Leaten. He’s got two 
           drinks, one for him and one for Gina.

                                 GINA
                        John Street, this is Caleb Leaten. 
                        Caleb, this is John.

                                 CALEB
                        Nice to meet ya.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry, are you two... 
                        Celebrating?
                                 GINA
                        Negotiations are complete.

           John stands, making way. Caleb studies him.

                                 CALEB
                        Would ya care to join us?

                                 JOHN
                        I wouldn’t want to interrupt. You 
                        two have a nice evening.

           They watch him go. Once he’s safely out of earshot:

                                 CALEB
                        That was him?

                                 GINA
                        That was him.

                                 CALEB
                        Should we be worried?

                                 GINA
                             (shaking her head)
                        He’s found his price.

           OFF Caleb’s contained relief-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dark. Quiet. It’s very late at night. But John’s EYES ARE OPEN -- 
           Staring at the wall. Unable to sleep... The phone RINGS.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah?

                                 MATTIE (ON PHONE)
                        RJ’s dead.

           Mattie speaks in a HURRIED WHISPER -- She shouldn’t be making 
           this call. John sits up, silhouetted in the dark.

                                 JOHN
                        What? What time is it?

           He looks at the clock -- It reads: 3:47.

           EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

           A typically deserted meeting of backroads, now not so empty: Two 
           Sheriff's cruisers block off the scene, EMTs cover a LIFELESS 
           FORM laid out on the road -- No saving this one.

                                 JOHN (ON PHONE)
                        So why are you calling me?

           A familiar SUBARU is parked on the roadside, driver’s window 
           BLOWN OUT with gore. Mattie stands a ways off, speaks furtively.
           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

                                 MATTIE (ON PHONE)
                        Al’s calling it suicide.

           John switches on the bedside lamp, sits up-

           EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

           She waits on the phone, expecting something... Nothing comes.

                                 MATTIE
                        Single shot to the head, found 
                        alone in his car. Weapon was 
                        registered to one Travis Kemper.
                             (then)
                        ...John?

           In background, an obese, uniformed man, SHERIFF AL FISCHER, 
           turns from the body... We won’t get a good look at him just yet-

                                 FISCHER
                        Mattie? Mattie, what’re ya doing 
                        here?

                                 MATTIE
                        Shoot, I’ve gotta go.

                                 FISCHER
                        Ya know you’re not supposed to be 
                        here, now-

           She quickly hangs up.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John replaces the phone in cradle. DISTURBED by what she’s told 
           him. Attempting to put it out of mind.

           Flips the sheets off, wanders to his window. Mulling a decision, 
           his father’s pendant in hand... Pulls aside the curtain-

           See something odd, a car different from the rest -- The MONTE 
           CARLO -- We’ve seen it once, but he hasn’t yet -- Just sitting 
           there, standing out. Two men inside, obscured in darkness-

           Suddenly, a FLASH -- A zippo being struck. Briefly illuminating 
           the DARK FACES haunting the car-

           BANG-BANG-BANG-

           Street nearly jumps out of his skin -- What was that? He spins 
           around, looking.. It comes again from the door -- BANG-BANG-BANG-

           Street approaches. Cautiously.

                                 JOHN
                        Who is it?

                                 HAYES (O.S.)
                        Judge Crater, who do ya think!
           John puts his eye to the peephole -- Revealed in FISHEYE is a 
           MAN’S CHEST. Too big to get a look at him-

           John backs from the peephole, thinks...

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           From behind we see a HUGE FORM bearing a duffle. The door 
           finally cracks, John pokes his face out-

                                 JOHN
                        ...Hayes? What’re you doing here?

                                 HAYES
                        You don’t write, you don’t call? I 
                        was worried, Johnny.

           ED HAYES, 30s, is a mass of coiled energy in a Carhartt jacket: 
           Heavy shoulders, boxer’s nose. Hands that know how to hurt.

                                 JOHN
                        Jesus, it’s like four AM.

                                 HAYES
                        Yeah, well. I wanted to let you 
                        know I’m across the hall. 172.

           He turns for the door opposite, inserts a keycard, opens up-

                                 HAYES
                        You got nothing to worry about. 
                        We’re gonna finish strong on this.

           OFF John, left blinking in the hall-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - DAY

           Shades of morning eke over the horizon. John’s dressed and on 
           his phone, PACING like a caged animal -- Looking like he never 
           did get to sleep last night.

                                 JOHN
                        You don’t just spring Hayes on me 
                        like that. The guy twists the heads 
                        off pigeons for fun.

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        You said it yourself: These are 
                        sketchy customers. Can’t be too 
                        careful with my best investigator.

           John stops pacing to look from his window -- The Monte Carlo is 
           GONE. Left sometime in the night.

                                 JOHN
                        So you’re not... Worried about me?

           John heads for the door.
           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY

           John closes his door as quietly as possible, sneaks a glance at 
           172. It’s shut, “Do Not Disturb” hanging on the handle. 

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Isn’t that what I just said?

                                 JOHN
                        So it never occurred that I might 
                        turn up something... 
                        Uncomfortable... Out here?

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

           Reception is quiet. It’s very early in the morning indeed. John 
           speeds through, heading for the door.

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Why? What have you found?

                                 JOHN
                        Client’ll have my report in a 
                        couple days, same as you.

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        I’m not liking what I’m hearing, 
                        John. You don’t sound great.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m perfectly clear. I’ve never 
                        been more clear.

                                 DAN (ON PHONE)
                        Because you don’t sound great. You 
                        sound like you’re slipping. You 
                        sound like a guy who’s losing it.

           This hitting John hard -- Dan saying what John too is thinking.

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - DAY

           John exits the hotel, digs out his keys -- Doesn’t notice the 
           LARGE FORM approaching silently from behind-

                                 HAYES (O.S.)
                        Up early?

           John STARTS, spins -- There, blithely sipping coffee, is HAYES.

                                 JOHN
                        Jesus, don’t you sleep?

                                 HAYES
                        Tried it once. Wasn’t for me.

                                 JOHN
                             (deadpan)
                        That’s not psychotic at all.

                                 HAYES
                        Pot, kettle, black. Right Street?
           OFF John’s choked back anger-

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - DAY

           Hayes pilots the car. John sits shotgun. He isn’t happy about 
           this new arrangement.

                                 HAYES
                        Where to first?

                                 JOHN
                        Homestead Lodge. I’ve got questions 
                        regarding their pharmaceutical 
                        supply order.

                                 HAYES
                        They leave Valium on the pillow 
                        like hotel mints?

                                 JOHN
                        Something like that.

                                 HAYES
                        I shoulda booked there.

           Street glances sidelong at Hayes-

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - DAY

           They’re coming up on Homestead Lodge. The fence and sprawl 
           visible, the facility sedate, quiet.

                                 JOHN
                        We get in you follow my lead, okay?

           Hayes tightens his grip on the wheel-

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - INFIRMARY - DAY

           A rudimentary treatment room, one we’ve not seen before. The 
           room lights are low, to better reveal an INFECTED FOOT, bright 
           under harsh exam lights. Gloved hands probe the area.

           After a satisfactorily disgusting examination:

                                 DR. ERSKIN (O.S.)
                        How often have you been changing 
                        your socks, Colt?

           POP -- Room lights come up. DR. ERSKIN, warm and wooly, lab-
           coated and name-tagged, late 60s, turns from the roughneck’s 
           foot to see John and Hayes.

                                 JOHN
                        Doctor Benjamin Erskin?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        Yes?

           John checks his paperwork, shows Erskin’s medical license.
                                 JOHN
                        Of 255 Winfred Lane?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        What’s this about?

           John fast flashes his Rest EZ keycard in his wallet sleeve-

                                 JOHN
                        We’re with FDA Compliance and 
                        Enforcement. Your license has been 
                        flagged.

           Dr. Erskin, a conscientious objector-type, looks between the two 
           serious men... Gulps.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - INFIRMARY HALL - DAY

           Erskin is leading Street and Hayes down a hallway, fumbling KEYS 
           and words as he goes. We move with them-

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        I don’t understand it... Flagged? 
                        Like, what does that even mean?

                                 JOHN
                        Probably nothing. With Obamacare
                        large-scale ‘scripts monitoring 
                        went digital -- Now it’s just 
                        computers looking for atypical 
                        orders, we follow up... Kinda takes 
                        the fun out of it, right Hayes?

           Hayes just grunts in response. He lacks John’s finesse.

                                 JOHN
                        Machines spot something they don’t 
                        like, we come out and poke. Usually 
                        it’s nothing. Sometimes it’s 
                        something. How are your controlled 
                        substances handled, doctor?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        Gosh, shipment comes in first 
                        Thursday of every month, moves 
                        straight into the cage from the 
                        truck. Here we are-

           Erskin reaches a large closet space that’s been modified into a 
           PRESCRIPTION CAGE -- A little holding cell for drugs. He uses 
           two keys to open it, flips on lights, steps back-

                                 JOHN
                        Everything is held here?

           John enters the space, scanning the shelves -- Whatever he’s 
           looking for, it ISN’T THERE-

                                 DR. ERSKIN 
                        That’s right... Is there a problem?

           John presents him with one of the Homestead manifestos.
                                 JOHN
                        Is this your signature?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        Yes, but- This order... This can’t 
                        be ours.

                                 JOHN
                        And why is that, Dr. Erskin?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        Well, look at these: Lorazepam, 
                        Ativan... These are 
                        benzodiazepines. We got no call to 
                        keep those on hand, and especially 
                        in such quantities... And, this 
                        here? The Norplant? I don’t even 
                        know where to begin with that...
                             (beat; returns form)
                        These aren’t my drugs.

                                 JOHN
                        Who else has keys to this room?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        No one. Just me, and-

                                 TIGGER (O.S.)
                        That’s enough!

           Tigger, plus a uniformed GUARD, has arrived -- Behind are two 
           more GUARDS, surrounding them -- Things ratchet up quickly-

                                 TIGGER
                        Doc, scram!

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        These men are with the FDA.

                                 TIGGER
                        They’re no FDA. This one’s a 
                        corporate dick, and this must be 
                        his rent-a-goon-

                                 HAYES
                        ...Goon?

                                 JOHN
                        Stay calm, Ed-

           Erskin, thoroughly confused, backs away -- The guard nearest 
           Hayes whips out an extending TRUNCHEON-

                                 HAYES
                        Better be planning to use that to 
                        direct traffic, Plastic Badge.

                                 JOHN
                        We just had a couple questions, 
                        that’s all. We’ll be on our way.
                                 TIGGER
                        You’re going nowhere ‘til I get 
                        some questions of my own answered-

                                 HAYES
                        Fuck this-

           -And then Hayes LASHES OUT at the guard behind him -- Spinning 
           and BASHING his head into the cement wall -- The violence and 
           brutality of it, JARRING-

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t-

           The guard with the club lunges forward, cracks Hayes on the back 
           of the skull, staggering him -- Hayes spins, twists the club 
           from man’s grip, SMASHES his forehead into the attacker’s nose-

           Suddenly Hayes’ back ARCHES, muscles go TAUT -- Collapses -- The 
           coiled leads of a STUN GUN poke from his back, extending from 
           the third guard’s hand-

                                 JOHN
                        Whoa, whoa! This is all just- This 
                        is a misunderstanding-

                                 TIGGER
                        Smug bastard. Stay outta my camp.

           BAM -- Tigger’s FIST fills frame, driving John (AND US) down the 
           express lane to dreamland-

                                                              SMASH TO:

           BLACK

           And quiet. Momentarily. Then up comes a voice, a new one we’ve 
           only heard a few times before-

                                 FISCHER (V.O.)
                        Ya sure been causin’ a mess of 
                        trouble, haven’t ya?

           INT. MUNROE SHERIFF STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The cluttered interview space. Except more crowded this time: 
           Seated on one end, finally viewed in full, is SHERIFF AL 
           FISCHER, jowly and perspiring. Huey Long meets Boss Hogg.

           Across the interview table, with CUFFED HANDS, are Street and 
           Hayes. Hayes sports a gash on his forehead, hastily repaired 
           with butterfly bandages. Street’s got a prime shiner.

                                 FISCHER
                        Running around, spinning up a 
                        tornado of lies. Leavin’ confusion 
                        and destruction in your wake.

                                 JOHN
                        I think we’re owed a phone call?
           Fischer smiles -- Then SHOVES the table forward, slamming it 
           into John and Hayes -- Both exhale heavily, OOF!

                                 FISCHER
                        Sticking your nose in open 
                        investigations. Clouding the 
                        judgement of my deputies.

                                 JOHN
                             (coughing)
                        Where is Mattie?

                                 FISCHER
                        Deputy Cooper allowed a suspect to 
                        go free. Deputy Cooper has been 
                        placed on administrative leave.

                                 JOHN
                        She was too close, wasn’t she? Too 
                        close to the stain this shitheel
                        town’s collectively agreed to drop 
                        a rug over top of-

           WHAM! -- The table again connects with Street and Hayes-

                                 HAYES
                        John, give it a rest!

                                 FISCHER
                        You boys readers?
                             (to John)
                        I bet ya are, with your smart 
                        mouth. Am I right?

                                 JOHN
                        You want help spelling ‘Public 
                        Scandal’?

           Fischer makes like he’s going to SLAM the table again -- Street 
           and Hayes FLINCH... Fischer smiles like a snake-

                                 FISCHER
                        I was born in this shitheel town. 
                        Daddy farmed spring wheat. Now the 
                        schools, they weren’t for nothin’ -- 
                        Couldn’t teach fakin’ it to a six 
                        buck whore. But there was one thing 
                        stuck with me: Better to reign in 
                        hell than serve in heaven... So I 
                        never left. And now-
                             (spreads arms wide: ”Here 
                              I am...”)

           Hayes and Street wait, knowing more is to come...

                                 FISCHER
                             (drums fingers on table)
                        So, what’re we to do with you?

                                 JOHN
                        Enough of the routine. Either 
                        charge us or cut us loose.
           Fischer is up and out his seat -- He moves surprisingly quick 
           for a man his size -- GRABS a handful of Street’s shirtfront-

                                 FISCHER
                        You’re getting charged, boy-

           A sudden KNOCK on the door spares us the dispensation of 
           Fischer’s justice -- He goes to the door... Waiting there, just 
           seen, is Caleb. Fischer half-shuts the door and they converse-

           Only MURMURS are heard, but the discussion is a heated one... 
           Finally, Fischer reenters. Cowed. A decision has been made.

                                 FISCHER
                        There’s someone else out here wants 
                        to talk to ya... But before I let 
                        her... Man runs Homestead called 
                        Norton, you know him?

                                 JOHN
                        I met with him two days ago.

                                 FISCHER
                        Seen him since?

                                 JOHN
                        Why? Something happen to him?

                                 FISCHER
                        He left for work this morning but 
                        never made it... You boys wouldn’t 
                        know anything about that, would ya?

           Hayes and Street share a puzzled glance. Fischer reads it.

                                 FISCHER
                        Figures.

           He steps out, trading places with a new entrant: Gina Sanger. 
           She enters, sits... She’s ALL BUSINESS. As though this meeting 
           were taking place in a boardroom, rather than a police station-

                                 GINA
                             (chipper)
                        Gentlemen. Glad I caught you... 
                             (to Hayes)
                        I’m sorry, we haven’t been 
                        introduced, Gina Sanger.

           Hayes looks to Street, confused as all hell.

                                 HAYES
                        Nice to meet you?

                                 GINA
                        I just wanted to give you a little 
                        update as to where we stand. 
                        Mercury’s agreement for purchase of 
                        Homestead is complete. 
                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        They rode us hard on 
                        indemnification and earn-outs, but 
                        we felt that, in the end, their 
                        requests were more than reasonable.

                                 JOHN
                        Get to the point.

                                 GINA
                        The final step of the process is 
                        approval by our board of directors.

           Gina produces two REST EZ ENVELOPES. Lays them on the table.

                                 GINA
                        They will arrive for a formal 
                        presentation soon, and when they do 
                        I will summarize the terms of the 
                        agreement for them. And a 
                        representative from your 
                        organization will present its 
                        independent report as well.

           Hayes has no idea what’s going on-

                                 HAYES
                             (to John)
                        What’s she talking about?

                                 JOHN
                        You’ll like this part. I promise.

                                 GINA
                        In these envelopes are two 
                        disbursements from a discretionary 
                        account, meant to guarantee 
                        expeditious completion of said 
                        report, as well as to express our 
                        gratitude for such... Thorough...
                        Auditing during this process.

           She removes one of the checks from its envelope. The amount has 
           already been filled in -- It is for $20,000.

                                 GINA
                             (to Hayes)
                        Who shall I make it out to?

                                 HAYES
                        Uh, Ed- Edward- Hayes.

           She fills in the PAYEE LINE, tucks Ed’s check back into its 
           envelope, extracts the next check-

                                 GINA
                             (to John)
                        And yours?

           They LOCK EYES... And a lifetime passes. Somewhere in the world 
           a baby is being born. But in here, in this crooked police 
           station, in this flyspec town, a tattered remnant of John 
           Street’s soul is crying out-
                                 HAYES
                             (answering for him)
                        John Street. That’s great-

                                 JOHN
                             (firm)
                        No.

           Her eyes FLASH DANGEROUSLY-

                                 GINA
                        ...No? I hope you realize that to 
                        reject this disbursement would 
                        alter our relationship. Mercury 
                        would no longer be able to provide 
                        legal protection for any misconduct 
                        during your time here.

           John looks away.

                                 JOHN
                        No... Emily Brogan. Make it out to 
                        Emily Brogan.

           Her lips curl into a the slightest of smiles... She’s got him.

           INT. CRUISER (MOVING) - NIGHT

           John and Hayes ride in the rear of Fischer’s undivided cruiser. 
           He’s chatting amiably, much for his own benefit as theirs. All 
           signs of his earlier menace gone.

                                 FISCHER
                        Time was Munroe wasn’t much more 
                        than farmland and floodplain.

           John and Hayes aren’t listening. Fischer doesn’t care. John digs 
           in his jacket pocket -- Difficult with cuffed hands.

                                 FISCHER
                        And now I hear talk about fracking, 
                        and how it’s bad for the 
                        environment or what the heck.

           We see what John is up to: He takes the Rest EZ envelope 
           containing the check, presses it up against the passenger 
           window, begins to ADDRESS IT. Hayes watches him do this.

                                 FISCHER
                        But I tell ya: In this town ya 
                        could change your second name to 
                        ‘fracking’ and run for mayor.

           John’s writes: “Emily Brogan, 495 West End Ave.”

                                 JOHN
                        I hate to interrupt the Prairie 
                        Home Companion there Sheriff, but 
                        do you have any stamps?
           Fischer’s eyes GO HOT in the rear view-

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - NIGHT

           SCREEE! The cruiser jerks to a stop in front of the hotel -- 
           Fischer clambers out, yanks John from the back seat.

                                 FISCHER
                        Listen close: After your show at 
                        Homestead you clear out of our 
                        charming little town, hear?

           Fischer uncuffs John. John massages his raw wrists.

                                 JOHN
                        Charming? There are plagues that 
                        would skip this place on account of 
                        wasted effort.

           Fischer breaks into a BIG GRIN-

                                 FISCHER
                        Hey, don’t forget our motto... 
                        “Always a smile”!

           And he plants a MEATY FIST in John’s stomach.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Reception at the Rest EZ, same as always. The auto-doors part to 
           admit Street and Hayes -- Or rather, Street on Hayes. The latter 
           supporting the former.

                                 HAYES
                        You just had to needle the man?

                                 JOHN
                        There’s nothing worse than 
                        corruption going nostalgic.

           Hayes smiles at that. That’s one he’s gotta remember-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           They move down the hall. Tired after the day they’ve had.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll take it from here.

           John decouples from Hayes. Each at his respective room door.

                                 HAYES
                        You alright?

                                 JOHN
                             (nodding)
                        Nothing a night’s sleep won’t cure.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John enters the darkened room, letting the door shut behind him. 
           He gropes for the lights-
           They come on and he’s staring at an IMPOSING FIGURE, dark and 
           muscular, with matching SCARS carved outward from the corners of 
           his eyes. It is for these scars that JAPA was named.

                                 JAPA
                        Please, no shout.

           Japa speaks with a thick BRAZILIAN ACCENT.

                                 JAPA
                        Mano, he is... Nervous type.

           John, still frozen by the door -- No idea what the hell is going 
           on -- Startled by the emergence of another YOUNGER MAN from the 
           bathroom, MANO.

                                 JOHN
                        Figures. Put out the housekeeping 
                        sign, the help thinks they can 
                        spend all day in your room.

           Japa smiles. Likes John immediately -- But he’s had to hurt 
           plenty of people he liked... Mano starts chattering angrily in 
           PORTUGUESE. Japa translates.

                                 JAPA
                        Mano want to know who is you?

                                 JOHN
                        God’s risen son. I vacation here to 
                        ruminate on hell.

           Mano speaks no English... But is fluent in smart-ass. He 
           violently SLAMS Street to the wall, holds a knife to his eye. He 
           shows John the CORONER’S PHOTOS of the men who killed Kemper-

                                 JAPA
                        Mano want to know for what you have 
                        these?

                                 JOHN
                        Who are you...?

           Mano is eye-to-eye with John... He’s unhinged, desperate.

                                 JAPA
                        These Mano’s brothers.

           John’s face falls.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry.

           Mano may break down at any moment -- Either tears or violence, 
           not clear which...

                                 JAPA
                        You ride with us.

                                 JOHN
                        Sounds like a hoot, but I’ve got 
                        work to do.
                                 JAPA
                        This was no question.

           John’s eyes slide to the shining REVOLVER that’s appeared in 
           Japa’s hand -- Mano SHOVES HIM toward the door-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           John’s hustled toward the back door by the Brazilian men -- 
           Hazards a look at Hayes’ room. Japa jams his gun in John’s back-

                                 JAPA
                        No.

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - NIGHT

           Mano runs ahead, opens the Monte Carlo, Japa indicates for John 
           to climb in the back-

           INT. MONTE CARLO (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Mano drives with abandon, bloodshot eyes skipping between the 
           road and rear view. Japa sits in the back with John, staring out 
           the window. His face a blank.

           As they drive Japa fiddles with a zippo, flicking it open and 
           striking it, then snapping it shut, all in one motion -- 
           CLICK... SNICK, SNAP! -- Over and over. A neat trick.

                                 JOHN
                        You guys wanna give me a clue where 
                        we’re headed?

           No answer. Just: CLICK... SNICK, SNAP! -- CLICK... SNICK, SNAP!

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

           The Monte Carlo turns off the highway onto an unmarked DIRT 
           ROAD. Leads off into a field still patchy with snow... In the 
           distance an OIL DERRICK shows on the dark horizon.

           The noise of the lighter continues: CLICK... SNICK, SNAP! -- 
           CLICK... SNICK, SNAP!

           INT. MONTE CARLO - NIGHT

           The car jerks to a stop. John peers out. The derrick LOOMS 
           above, rust covered and in some disrepair.

           EXT. ABANDONED DRILL SITE - NIGHT

           The men exit the car. The place lonely, ABANDONED. The ground 
           below, DEPLETED. Japa notices John noticing-

                                 JAPA
                        Drained out. Long time.
                             (stamps ground)
                        Dead.
           Japa gestures with his gun, toward the small utilitarian 
           building near the drilling platform. It is dark.

                                 JAPA
                        Come.

           Mano SLAMS shut the trunk. He’s got a JERRY CAN.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MURKY DARK

           And somewhere in it a WHINE, long and low. Like a trapped animal 
           dying slow. ...Then, the CLICK... SNICK of the zippo -- Flame 
           floating up into a GASLAMP-

           INT. ABANDONED DRILL SITE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Light blooms through the dark interior of the abandoned site 
           office, powder-coated with dust, empty for some time.

           The details are unimportant, though -- All John can see is 
           what’s in front of him. And it’s not pretty-

           GILL NORTON, the man who toured John around Homestead Lodge 
           early on, has been affixed to a metal chair with baling wire. 
           HEMOGLOBIN has congealed all down his naked chest, poured from 
           the remains of his face. His breathing is shallow, sharp-

                                 GILL
                        Who- Who is it? Who’s there?

           Gill cocks his head awkwardly, trying to line up his ONE 
           REMAINING EYE -- It’s swollen shut -- Meanwhile, Mano and Japa 
           force John into a similar chair across from Gill, twist wire 
           around his wrists and legs -- Finally, Japa turns-

                                 JAPA
                        Boa noite, Senhor Gill.

           Gill RECOILS, screaming-

                                 GILL
                        No! No more! Get away, just kill me 
                        or get away-

           Gill topples his chair-

                                 JOHN
                        Jesus, you’re torturing him?!

           Japa lazily wheels the gun in John’s direction. Reminding him 
           who’s in charge -- Says something in Portuguese to Mano. Mano 
           sets Gill’s chair upright. And then he LOSES IT -- Mano begins 
           senselessly ATTACKING Gill with abandon-

                                 JAPA
                        Mano! No! No Mano!
           Mano isn’t hearing -- Right until Japa SHOOTS OFF the big gun 
           into the wall, BLAM!

           Mano FREEZES, panting, turns to Japa -- Japa shouts at him in 
           PORTUGUESE -- A bit of a back-and-forth... Then Mano SPITS on 
           Gill. And then he turns and leaves. Ordered outside.

                                 JAPA
                        Desculpe... Mano, he has hot 
                        temper.

           Japa tucks his gun away. Bends to pick up the jerry can. Gill 
           begins to cry softly. John struggles against the wire, biting 
           into his wrists-

                                 JAPA
                        Senhor Gill is telling us about 
                        girls... Senhor?

           Gill says nothing. Continues to cry... Japa adopts the look of a 
           man disappointed in a half-trained dog -- Begins to SPLASH Gill 
           from the jerry can -- Air overhead folds in waves from the fumes-

                                 JAPA
                        Senhor Gill! Senhor Gill! Please 
                        tell us more about girls!

           Gill snaps to, SPUTTERING -- Words begin to gush. They don’t 
           make much sense at first-

                                 GILL
                        A year! A year! They just do a year 
                        and then he sends them back!
                             (gasp-gasp)
                        It’s really not so bad! They’re 
                        healthy, made comfortable! They’re 
                        from the missions and the favelas, 
                        for godssake! He only takes 
                        unmarried, with no kids!
                             (gasp-gasp)
                        ...And I protested! From day one! I 
                        swear to God I did!

                                 JOHN
                        What’s he talking about?

           Japa splashes again, caught up-

                                 JOHN
                        What’s he- Stop! Gill, what are you 
                        talking about?

           Japa looks at John.

                                 GILL
                             (blubbering)
                        The girls! The girls! I got nothing 
                        to do with them! I don’t even have 
                        the card for Thirty Nine!
                                 JOHN
                        ...What’s he talking about?

           Japa sets down the gas, leaving a trail from Gill’s chair, 
           reaches into his pocket -- Sets a tattered neon HANDBILL on
           John’s lap. Turns back, squats by the gas trail.

           John examines the document. It is old, near illegible, and 
           written entirely in Portuguese -- But one thing is familiar-

           Right there at the top is the HOMESTEAD LOGO-

                                 JOHN
                        What does it say?

                                 JAPA
                        A job. Is a job. “Young ladies 
                        wanted. Empregadas domésticas -- 
                        Maids. For to work in Estados
                        Unidos. Medical care, good wage.”

           This falls heavily on John.

                                 JOHN
                        Homestead is bringing them in?

                                 GILL
                        They’re treated good! They’re 
                        treated good! I swear...

           Gill breaks into SOBBING.

                                 GILL
                        Please... I don’t want to die...

           Japa does his trick with the lighter-

                                 JAPA
                        Shame, Senhor Gill! You seem to 
                        have no more to say...

           And Japa TOUCHES the lighter to the gas trail. The flame races 
           across the floor... And then-

             ...FWOOM!

           The space is lit NOON BRIGHT, as Gill’s SCREAMS echo throughout -
           - John struggles, horrified, but his bonds hold tight -- Japa 
           just watches implacably, as Gill’s thrashing slows and stops.

                                 JAPA
                             (turning)
                        Now we are to find what you know.

           John can’t take his eyes from Gill’s bubbling corpse-

                                 JAPA
                        Mano, he no like it here. This Mano 
                        first time out Brasil.

           Japa picks up the gas can. Playing the moment out.
                                 JAPA
                        Me? I no mind... Much- How you say?
                             (throws arms wide)
                        Space. Is no like favelas. Is you 
                        go many miles... And no people. Is 
                        you scream-

           Japa demonstrates -- AAAAHHHHHH!

                                 JAPA
                        -And no one hear.

           John knows Japa’s trying to rattle him. And it’s working.

                                 JAPA
                             (big smile)
                        Is now questions... Who you are 
                        work for? Homestead?

                                 JOHN
                        No. I work for another company, 
                        Mercury. They’re buying Homestead.

                                 JAPA
                        What you do at the home of dead 
                        guard two nights behind?

                                 JOHN
                        I was trying to figure why he got 
                        killed.

                                 JAPA
                        And why he get killed?

           Gill’s charred head FALLS OFF -- Disgusting-

                                 JOHN
                        Probably same reason as him. To 
                        figure where they’re being kept.

           Japa shows a toothy grin. Pleased John’s piecing it together.

                                 JAPA
                        Where they keep them?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not sure...

           John trails off. Japa shakes his head... He holds the gas up by 
           his ear, sloshes it.

                                 JAPA
                        Is still half full... “39”? Where 
                        this “39”?

                                 JOHN
                        I never heard of it before 
                        tonight... But I know who knows.

           Japa gets down, nose to nose with John. Studying him closely, 
           with his strangely scarred eyes.
                                 JAPA
                        Who?

                                 JOHN
                        Guy who works- Worked-
                             (re: Gill)
                        With him... Homestead’s head of 
                        security. Zaitoon.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hold it!

           This from the darkened DOORWAY -- Japa looks curiously, as-

                                 MATTIE
                             (steps in)
                        Right there! Put down the gas! Put 
                        it down!

           Mattie is dressed in plainclothes, her service weapon drawn and 
           ready, looking huge in her hand. Japa cocks his head. As though 
           he’s examining an exotic bird.

                                 JAPA
                        Who you are?

                                 MATTIE
                        Sheriff's Department. Now ya put 
                        your hands up real slow like.

                                 JAPA
                        You are to shoot me, Gatinha?
                             (chuckles)
                        I think no.

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m real serious now. Ya put down 
                        that down.

                                 JAPA
                        Is easy to kill, you know?

                                 MATTIE
                        You have until three.

                                 JAPA
                        I do my first at 15.

           Japa’s free hand is slowly reaching for his hidden gun...

                                 MATTIE
                        One.

                                 JAPA
                        In prison cell. Ten men watch.

                                 MATTIE
                        Two.

                                 JAPA
                        This when I learn: Kill without 
                        pause. Or next time...
           Japa drops the jerry can and his revolver FLASHES up -- BLAM!

           With shaking hands, Mattie lowers her gun... Her face ashen and 
           blank -- Japa CRUMPLES forward. Dead.

                                 JOHN
                        Mattie... Mattie, quick. I need you 
                        to untie me.

           She comes to, just keeping it together -- Puts her gun on the 
           floor and kneels by John. Sets to work on his bonds-

                                 JOHN
                        How’d you find us?

           She’s fumbling, gets one wrist free. Tears welling in her eyes-

                                 MATTIE
                        I, uh- Picked ya up outside the 
                        hotel. And then I lost ya on the 
                        drill roads, there’s just so many 
                        back here-

           John’s eye’s widen -- Over her shoulder, a DARK SHAPE takes form-

                                 JOHN
                        Look out!

           She barely has time to spin as Mano HOWLS out of the dark -- 
           SINKING his knife into her neck, toppling her over -- They go 
           down in a heap -- Her gun skittering away-

                                 JOHN
                        No!

           John wrenches his other wrist out with painful effort -- Even as 
           Mano scrambles back up... And they both see it at once: Mattie’s
           SERVICE REVOLVER -- Kicked against a wall-

           Both dive at the same time -- Awkward -- One of John’s ankles is 
           STILL WIRED to the chair -- They struggle, ripping at one 
           another, totally brutal, inelegant -- 

           Mano getting on top as John claws for the weapon -- John 
           wrestles it to Mano’s chest-

           BLAM!

           John shoves the corpse off him, lies back panting -- All at 
           once, remembers: MATTIE -- Scrambles to his feet-

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A darkened master bedroom in a homey bungalow -- A peaceful 
           scene. Broken by POUNDING at the front door.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Doc! Doc, I need help out here!

           The bedside lamp clicks on. A matronly woman, Doc Erskin’s wife 
           JUNE, turns and shakes the snoring man-lump next to her-
                                 JUNE
                        Benny... Someone’s downstairs.

           EXT. ERSKIN HOME - PORCH - NIGHT

           Dr. Erskin pokes out his sleep-addled face. He gets a shock when 
           he sees John, with Mattie in his arms. Just past, John’s driven  
           Mattie’s cruiser right up onto the lawn. Lights still flashing.

           INT. ERSKIN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Erskin sweeps tchotchkes from his kitchen table. Erskin’s wife 
           looks on, clutching her house coat. John, layered with blood and 
           sweat, lays Mattie on the table. She’s pale, breathing shallow.

                                 DR. ERSKIN 
                        Keep pressure on her -- June, hand 
                        me my bag and call Lewiston. Tell 
                        them to send a helicopter.

           Erskin puts his stethoscope on Mattie. Doesn’t like what he 
           hears. Gets a bandage, Vaseline and tape from his bag.

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        Her lung is punctured. Air’s 
                        pocketing under her chest wall-

           He coats the bandage with the jelly, pushes John’s hand away 
           from Mattie’s wound. Opens her shirt and tapes three sides of 
           the bandage down over the ugly gash-

                                 JOHN
                        Is she going to be alright?

           The doctor’s tone is grim. John squeezes his pendant tight.

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        She’s lost a lot of blood, EMTs are 
                        an hour away by air... What 
                        happened? You call the police?

                                 JOHN
                        She is the police. The only police 
                        worth a damn, anyway.

           With that, John walks from the kitchen-

           EXT. ERSKIN HOME - NIGHT

           John makes for Mattie’s cruiser, still idling out front. Erskin, 
           baffled, follows behind -- Is this all some bad dream?

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                             (incredulous)
                        You’re leaving?

                                 JOHN
                        You ever been in unit thirty nine 
                        at Homestead, Doc?
           Confusion shows on Erskin’s face.

                                 DR. ERSKIN
                        There is no unit thirty nine.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s what I thought.

           John piles in the cruiser, backs right over Erskin’s gardenias, 
           then tears off into the stygian night-

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - HAYES' ROOM - NIGHT

           A Rest EZ room we’ve not yet seen. Bed untouched. Only use of 
           the facilities: Two HAND TOWELS -- One under a DISASSEMBLED 
           PISTOL, the other being used to carefully oil the slide.

           Hayes meticulously goes about his cleaning of the gun... Then, a 
           frantic POUNDING at the door. His look the same as Erskin’s 
           earlier -- Who’s there at this hour?

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Ed! Ed, open up!

           Hayes obliges... And his legendary stoicism breaks, albeit 
           slightly, at the sight of John, covered in Mattie’s blood.

                                 JOHN
                        Get your jacket.

                                 HAYES
                        Why?

           John’s a nuclear reactor in full MELTDOWN-

                                 JOHN
                        We’re going to that camp. And we’re 
                        burning it to the fucking ground.

           -And then he sees the disassembled pistol on the table.

                                 HAYES
                        Slow down... What happened? Whose 
                        blood is this?

           Hayes follows John’s gaze, sees he’s looking at the gun.

                                 HAYES
                        Look, get cleaned up and we’ll grab 
                        a drink, go over everything that 
                        happened... Dan will be here soon.

                                 JOHN
                        What? Why?

                                 HAYES
                        I think he’s worried. For you.

           John seems to find an eye in his storm:
                                 JOHN
                             (absently)
                        For me or about me?

           And, for John, all moments in his life reduce to this one -- 
           Covered in a woman’s blood in a crummy hotel hallway...

                                 HAYES
                        What?
                             (beat)
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                             (abruptly)
                        I’ll change.

           John turns, crosses to his room. Hayes watches him enter, shuts 
           his door and lifts his phone to dial-

                                 HAYES
                        We got a problem.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           John comes in all at once, shuts and locks the door -- Examines 
           the chaos brought on the room by the investigation...

           PING! A text message comes into his phone. Digs it out, reads:

                               She paid for your silence.
                               She paid him for the same.

           The number is BLOCKED. And the message remains only momentarily, 
           because a medication REMINDER, with the requisite Blackberry 
           CHIME, shows over top.

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - JOHN’S ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The water runs. John splashes some on his face, reaches for a 
           towel -- Catches a look at himself in the mirror.. He looks bad.

           And all at once it hits him: What if he’s losing it? Spinning 
           out, in the grips of some deep mania? He’s been off-meds for 
           awhile now. Can he trust himself to see this thing through?

           The water keeps on running. He keeps on staring.

           EXT. REST EZ HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Hayes exits his room. Adjusts his canvas jacket -- A noticeable 
           bulge, where the .45 waits... Reaches to knock on John’s door-

           HONK!-HONK! -- Hayes looks through the door at end of the hall, 
           sees the Mercedes. John signaling to him from the driver seat-

                                                                CUT TO:
           A SEA OF FACES

           Old, young, white, black -- Multiform. But, all MEN. Some lives 
           percolating, others rolling to a stop... A wistful tune plays.

           INT. WHITE OWL BAR - NIGHT

                                 JOHN
                        When it comes to regret, the 
                        shrinks and the talk show hosts, 
                        they all go one way --

           He sits before us at THE WHITE OWL, a bar glowing with beer ads 
           and testosterone -- Out of place in his clean shirt and jacket.

                                 JOHN
                        Let it go -- Release -- Forgive 
                        yourself, move on... Bullshit. I 
                        gotta another way of lookin’ at it-

           He’s talking to no one, talking to himself, talking to his 
           untouched drink -- He’s been here awhile.

                                 JOHN
                        What if regret’s useful? What if 
                        that horrible sinking feeling -- 
                        that endless black that keeps you 
                        up and breaks you down -- What if 
                        regret’s a talisman?

           As he speaks he fiddles with his PENDANT -- Moving, always 
           moving -- As though locked in some perpetual magic trick.

                                 JOHN
                        Something a man can use to remember 
                        where he’s been, and protect 
                        himself where he’s going --

           Hayes, sitting next to him, is listening, if just.

                                 HAYES
                        It’s time.

           John nods, gets to his feet... Makes to tuck the pendant away -- 
           It SLIPS -- It never slips -- Plinks down to the dirty bar floor- 

           He stares at it, among peanut shells and tobacco stains and God-
           knows-what-else. So worn and tarnished, a symbol of everything 
           he’d hoped not to become, and did... And then he turns and goes.

           He leaves it behind, with all the other offal so casually 
           discarded in this ugly place.

           EXT. WHITE OWL BAR - NIGHT

           Fronted by highway and a whole bunch of nothing else. Horizon 
           broken only by a DRILLING PLATFORM.
           John and Dan exit, make for the car-

                                 JOHN
                             (offhand)
                        What time you say his plane was 
                        getting in?

           No answer -- Instead: THUNK-

           Hayes hammers the butt of his PISTOL into the back of John’s 
           head -- Staggering him, dropping him to the muck-

                                 JOHN
                        What the fuck!

                                 HAYES
                        You a good talker, Street. Sure 
                        most of it’s bullshit, but still. 
                        Wish it ain’t come to this...

           And Hayes begins screwing a SILENCER onto his .45 -- They both 
           know what this means. Game over.

                                 HAYES
                        Walk.

           John slowly gets to his feet. Muddy, exhausted. Accepting his
           fate... Begins shunting into the snow-patched fields beyond.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           John walks with eyes directed up, seemingly at a remove from his 
           situation. Pondering the mysteries. Then... Remembers-

                                 JOHN
                        My pocket. The envelope. You’ll see 
                        she gets it?

                                 HAYES
                        You got my word... That’s far 
                        enough.

           John nods gratefully, stops and passes over the stamped Rest EZ 
           ENVELOPE, flecked with mud. Hayes pockets it.

                                 HAYES
                        Wallet, keys and phone too.

           John passes these over without argument. Turns and gazes up at 
           the night sky. Stars shine bright. An endless cosmic mandala.

                                 JOHN 
                        Grow up in the city and you go 
                        months without seeing the night 
                        sky. I remember I was little my Dad 
                        taking us camping at Kisco, saying, 
                        “Without real dark you never get a 
                        chance for the stars.”
           Hayes does something unexpected: He smiles. He genuinely likes 
           John... But he’s a pro. The clock is running.

                                 HAYES
                        There ain’t nothing worse than 
                        corruption going nostalgic.

           John nods, recognizing his words from earlier. Shows a last 
           sardonic grin.

                                 JOHN
                        Not the face, okay?

           PSHINK! The shot punches John square in the chest. He drops 
           immediately, crumpling in the muddy snow.

           Job done. Hayes tucks away his gun, heads back for the car. 
           Checks the wallet as he goes -- The billfold contains NO MONEY. 
           Just pictures of Kate, cherubic, smiling up at him.

           No reaction from Hayes -- He’s a blank, an empty vessel. Simply 
           trudges onward, into the windblown prairie night...

                                                               FADE TO:

           DAN GRISHOM

           In the flesh. Leaning on a rental car. Rubs his hands together, 
           fighting a chill... Checks his watch. Waiting.

                                 DAN
                             (to himself)
                        Look at this place. It’s Siberia 
                        with Walmarts.

           EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

           Another lonely back road... After what feels like forever, a 
           second car cruises up, joins Dan: John’s Mercedes. Lights and 
           engine cut. Hayes gets out.

                                 DAN
                        Everything go okay?

                                 HAYES
                        Fine... How was your flight?

           Dan’s mind is elsewhere.

                                 DAN
                        Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

           Hayes moves to the Mercedes’s rear, busies himself-

                                 DAN
                        I gave him a chance, you know? No 
                        one else would. I scraped him up.

           Hayes finishes his work, joins Dan back by his rental car.
                                 DAN
                        I tell him over and over, you take 
                        your meds, you follow the rules. 
                        Listen to the client. Do what the 
                        client wants.

           Both turn and stare silently at a gas-soaked rag, already 
           FLAMING, working its way down the Mercedes’ gas tank-

             BOOOOOOOOM!

           The two men flinch back as pieces of the car rain down on the 
           patchy Dakota landscape.

                                 DAN
                        So why’s he gotta do this to me?

           INT. REST EZ HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

           Dan and Hayes enter. Exhaustion curdles their faces. Long night. 
           Hayes stops. As far as he’s willing to go.

                                 DAN
                        You’re leaving?

                                 HAYES
                        Suitcase is already in the car... 
                        Unless you need something else?

                                 DAN
                        Best we get you in the wind.

                                 HAYES
                        You got my number.

           Dan nods and heads off down the hall. Hayes turns to go back out 
           the automatic doors... Then stops. Remembering-

           He comes back and drops the ENVELOPE addressed to Emily in a box 
           labeled “Outgoing Mail”. Then turns and heads for the edges of 
           the map, not to be seen again.

           OFF this small evidence of the departed killer’s humanity-

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CARD

           Homemade, in a second grader’s scrawl: “Feel Better!”

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Mattie’s bed is tilted up. She is pallid, bandages poke from her 
           gown. But ALIVE. She happily accepts the card.

                                 MATTIE
                        For me?

           BRADEN, usually a happy kid but today not so much, nods.
                                 MATTIE
                        This is really nice, Bray.

                                 BRADEN
                        I drew it last night.

           Mattie’s mother CAROL, Plains traditional, 50s, chimes in:

                                 CAROL
                        He wanted to get flowers, but I 
                        said keep your money -- We don’t 
                        need ta be spendin’ on something 
                        that’s just gonna die in a day.

                                 MATTIE
                        Gosh, thanks Mom.

           She opens the card.

                                 MATTIE
                        Braden, what is this?

           The interior of the card shows two crude figures -- One with a 
           badge, long hair and a GUN.

                                 MATTIE
                        Is this me?

           Braden nods. Near to tears.

                                 MATTIE
                        And who is this?

           The other crude figure is being SHOT. Crayola blood sprays.

                                 BRADEN
                        The bad guy. Who hurt you.

                                 MATTIE
                        Ya know that mommy doesn’t shoot 
                        people unless she has to, right?

           Braden’s big eyes, digesting -- Then-

                                 FISCHER
                        Am I interrupting?

           Fischer’s appeared at the door. Mattie hardens at his arrival.

                                 CAROL
                        ‘Course not. How are ya, Al?

                        Good. Happy ta see this one awake 
                        and doin’ okay.

                                 MATTIE
                        Mom, take Braden home, will ya? 
                        Sheriff Fischer and I need ta talk.
                                 CAROL
                        ‘Course. Real nice ta see ya, 
                        Sheriff. C’mon, Bray.

           They exit. Fischer and Mattie watch them go -- Then:

                                 FISCHER
                        I wanted ta let ya know we got ID 
                        back on one of the guys ya found 
                        Street with. Brazilian national, 
                        some kinda real life Scarface, no 
                        pun intended. They’re not even sure 
                        how he got in the country.

                                 MATTIE
                        What happened to John?

                                 FISCHER
                        Still looking. Found his car back 
                        on one’a them service roads gets 
                        used for drilling. Blown apart like 
                        a church girl during fleet week.

                                 MATTIE
                        He saved my life, Al.

                                 FISCHER

                        your life, Street fled. Or tried 
                        to... Who knows how he was mixed up 
                        with those boys?

                                 MATTIE
                        He coulda left me to bleed out.

                                 FISCHER
                        The important thing is you’re okay.

           Fischer glances at the clock. The room phone begins to RING.

                                 FISCHER
                        We found your cruiser at the hotel. 
                        I had it brought over for ya. But I 
                        oughta write ya up for the mess.

           He sets her keys next to the ringing phone. Mattie says nothing.

                                 FISCHER
                        Look hon, I’ve got to go... Ya want 
                        me to get that for ya?

                                 MATTIE
                        Yah, just hand it over.

           He does so.

                                 FISCHER
                        Take it easy, hear?

           Fischer turns and leaves. Mattie puts the phone to her ear.

                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Mattie Cooper?
           Mattie sits up a little.

                                 MATTIE
                        Yes?

                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Deputy Cooper, you don’t know me 
                        but I have a message for you.

           OFF Mattie’s steadily widening eyes-

           EXT. HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mattie, in hospital gown and furred Sheriff's jacket, hustles 
           into the hospital parking lot. Orderlies in pursuit.

           She spots what she’s looking for: Her cruiser.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A LIGHT-FILLED DOORWAY

           Mattie steps through, glances all around. She’s changed into 
           street clothes, carries a BANKER’S BOX.

           INT. ANGIE’S - DAY

           Mattie scans the restaurant, searching... Doesn’t find what 
           she’s looking for -- It’s all roughnecks tucking into breakfast.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Table for one? Deputy?

           Mattie goes right past her, walking the length of the 
           restaurant. As usual, male eyes follow as she goes. She reaches 
           the last booth where a hunched man polishes off a patty melt.

                                 MATTIE
                        Not a very healthy breakfast.

           He turns and looks up at her -- It’s John, alive and well.

                                 JOHN
                        Treating myself... You bring it?

           She smiles, plops down the box, slides in across from him.

                                 MATTIE
                        Stephanie knew just what ya were 
                        talking about.

           Mattie notices she’s sitting on something -- Holds up the
           BULLETPROOF VEST from her cruiser. It bears a SIZABLE SCAR at 
           center. Right where Hayes shot him.

                                 JOHN
                        Haven’t made the cleaners, sorry.
           She marvels at the vest as John opens the box, the one he never 
           got to during his work at Burton Trucking.

                                 MATTIE
                        What’re ya hoping to find?

                                 JOHN
                        Something. Anything that’ll help us 
                        find them.
                             (reading)
                        Norplant, benzos... Jesus, these 
                        poor women... What else? There must 
                        be something...

           Both stare at documents, scouring... Mattie taps an item-

                                 MATTIE
                        Lots of vitamin D. Good in the 
                        winters, when ya don’t see sun.

           John looks at her like she’s hit Cold Fusion -- Flips pages.

                                 JOHN
                        Look at this: Mouse traps in bulk. 
                        A standing filter order for a 
                        recycled air system-

                                 MATTIE
                        They’re being held underground.

                                 JOHN
                        Most likely.

                                 MATTIE
                        But where? The camp is huge.

                                 JOHN
                        To find a shell company, we’d look 
                        for empty offices. To find a 
                        subterranean prison? We look for 
                        ventilation.

           EXT. ANGIE’S - DAY

           John strides from the restaurant. Mattie’s right behind.

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m coming with you.

           John continues walking.

                                 JOHN
                        Your boss wouldn’t like that.

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m coming with you.

                                 JOHN
                        It’ll be dangerous-

           The dry KLACK of a revolver hammer being drawn-
                                 MATTIE
                        Hold it!

           He turns. She’s got her sidearm free.

                                 JOHN
                        I thought you didn’t like pulling 
                        your gun?

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m warming up.

                                 JOHN
                             (beat)
                        We got a couple stops to make on 
                        the way.

           INT. CRUISER - DAY

           Mattie watches nervously as John reenters her cruiser, tosses 
           SHOPPING BAGS on the seat.

                                 MATTIE
                        This is your big plan?

                                 JOHN
                        You got a better idea?

                                 MATTIE
                        Sure. Call in the cavalry: State 
                        police, FBI, whoever we can get.

                                 JOHN
                        No time. If Homestead hasn’t 
                        disposed of the evidence, Mercury 
                        sure will after taking over.

                                 MATTIE
                             (beat)
                        “Disposed of the evidence”?

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s go.

           His look is grim. She starts the car-

                                                                CUT TO:

           A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION

           Glowing on a projector screen showing one huge word: “Synergy”. 
           Gina Sanger, dressed to kill, steps to fore.

                                 GINA
                        And, just as Mercury takes pride in 
                        anticipating the needs of the US 
                        energy market, Homestead prides 
                        itself on anticipating the needs of 
                        its residents... Again you’ll note 
                        overlap in values and governance.
           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Widening out reveals a long, featureless conference room. Gina 
           recedes back behind a podium.

                                 GINA
                        Questions?

           At the wide table are Caleb Leaten, Jamie Bliss and Dan Grishom, 
           all business, plus Sheriff Fischer, barely awake.

           The real audience though, the one that matters, is the eight 
           member BOARD OF DIRECTORS, a mix of wealth and privilege. They 
           swivel chairs from Gina to an LCD screen at the back.

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        I think you shaded in the greys 
                        pretty good, Ms. Sanger. Nice work.

           Callan is VIDEO-CONFERENCED IN from a hospital bed in Dallas. 
           Tubes and wires snake from his chest. He looks unwell.

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        Now can we put this damned thing to 
                        a vote and move to new business?

           From a seat of cold remove, Jamie Bliss interjects:

                                 JAMIE
                        Pardon me, Pep? Aren’t you 
                        forgetting something?

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        Speak up, Bliss.

                                 JAMIE
                        Our security consultant. Shouldn’t 
                        we hear from him prior to voting?

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        Oh yes, Mr. Street... Where is he?

           Gina fumbles. Dan Grishom swoops into the conversation.

                                 DAN
                        I’ll field this one. Mr. Callan, 
                        I’m Dan Grishom, head of Security 
                        Analytics. Mr. Street... John... 
                        He’s-

           Door flies open. JOHN’S entrance is nothing if not dramatic.

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry I’m late. Rig spun out in 
                        front of me on the way over. I saw 
                        my life flash before my eyes.
           An apparition has just floated in, by the drop of Dan’s jaw... 
           In his blue collar get-up, John may well have resurrected as a 
           roughneck: He’s gone native.

           Among the pressed and coiffed board members, he couldn’t stand 
           out more. And Sheriff Fischer? He’s wide awake now.

                                 GINA
                             (handling it)
                        No problem, Mr. Street. You’re 
                        right on time. Please, if you will.

           John takes the podium. Gina sits next to him, tense. As though a 
           cobra were coiled just under her chair.

           ...And John begins to speak. He seems collected, cool. At first.

                                 JOHN
                        Good morning ladies and gentlemen. 
                        First I’d like to thank Mr. Callan 
                        for the opportunity to speak here. 
                        I’d also like to thank Ms. Sanger, 
                        who’s been incredibly helpful, and 
                        my boss, Dan Grishom, who was 
                        behind me a hundred percent.

           Sweat beads on Dan’s brow.

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        That’s real nice, Mr. Street. But 
                        none of us are getting any younger.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay... Let’s see, where to begin?
                             (drums his fingers; 
                              playing out the moment)
                        I think Mercury Petroleum should 
                        definitely buy Homestead Logistics.

           Gina Sanger relaxes ever so slightly.

                                 JAMIE
                        That’s it? Perhaps you’d like to 
                        offer up, I don’t know, analysis?

           He nods at the screen, glowing from Gina’s presentation.

                                 JOHN
                        Synergy, right? Both companies are 
                        malignant parasites, blind and 
                        heartless, eager to destroy lives 
                        for the slimmest of margins.

           The room ERUPTS.
           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - DAY

           Mattie passes between buildings. She’s in baggy clothes, with 
           hair under a knit cap. Trying to blend, to pass, just about 
           pulling it off... But still drawing looks as she goes.

           She diverts for the leisure building, careful to pick it out by 
           the mass of HVAC and plumbing equipment attached.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Now all speak at once -- A veritable cacophony of effrontery:

                          GINA
                                                         JAMIE
                                             Wait, maybe we should hear-
           Mr. Street, this is uncalled 
           for!

                   CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                                                     BOARD MEMBER 1
           Everyone, quiet!
                                             Who is this man?

                    SHERIFF FISCHER
                                                         CALEB
           You pissant. I told you to-
                                             Get security-

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        I said be QUIET, GODDAMMIT!

           Callan degenerates into an ugly wet COUGHING FIT. This, combined 
           with his shout, finally silences the room.

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN) 
                        Now-
                             (cough-cough)
                        Now-
                             (cough-cough)
                        Now... Mr. Street... You were 
                        saying?

           John smiles. Gotta admire the codger’s grit.

                                 JOHN
                        Mercury is multinational, one of 
                        the biggest companies in the world, 
                        with revenues that put it neck-and-
                        neck with the GDP of Norway. And to 
                        reach these lofty heights, the 
                        company has extracted unfair 
                        subsidies that cost taxpayers 
                        billions, engaged in brutal labor 
                        practices in some of the world’s 
                        poorest countries, and promoted 
                        junk science claiming climate 
                        change is a fiction... All in the 
                        name of money.

           These things are all true. The room is quiet. Then Callan, on 
           his screen, does something unexpected... He LAUGHS.
                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        You ‘bout done there, hoss? Cause 
                        I’ve had worse lashings mutton 
                        busting as a kid.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m just getting warmed up... It’s 
                        because Mercury and its people are 
                        unscrupulous soup-to-nuts, that 
                        “y’all” are such a fine pairing for 
                        Homestead... An organization that, 
                        while less destructive in scope, is 
                        even more willing to plumb rancid 
                        depths of human misery in search of 
                        profitability-

           Gina gets to her feet-

                                 GINA
                        Enough. These are ravings, pure and 
                        simple... Ladies and gentleman, 
                        this man is unwell. We’re clearly 
                        witnessing some kind of breakdown.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - LEISURE BUILDING - DAY

           An exiting roughneck pushes though the door to the leisure 
           building. Before it swings shut Mattie slides through.

           She scans the room, acting nonchalant. All appears normal: Some 
           men watch TV, others shoot pool. She eyes the door to the gym, 
           still monitored by two of Zaitoon’s uniformed GUARDS.

           One of the guards takes notice of her immediately -- Taps his 
           buddy, pointing her out. She turns away quickly.

           Too late. The guard begins picking his way across toward her. 
           She casually heads away from him.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           It’s now John who’s set off-balance, reeling.

                                 JAMIE
                        What are you talking about?

           Gina shows an old TABLOID she’s procured. Headline reads: “ORDER
           IN THE CLUB: Prosecutor Blinds Student in Posh Disco Brawl” 

           The splash photo is a SPLIT -- One side is a shot of a hulking 
           COLLEGE KID, the other side shows a professional portrait of a 
           YOUNGER JOHN. Face unlined, eyes agleam.
                                 GINA
                        He was with DA’s office in Brooklyn 
                        until 2008, when he clubbed some 
                        Fordham student near to death with 
                        a champagne bottle, during an 
                        altercation at a dance club. Took 
                        three men to drag him off...
                             (beat)
                        Turns out he has bipolar disorder, 
                        something he’s failed to disclose 
                        to, well, everyone. Instead, he’s 
                        been attempting to manage it on his 
                        own, taking prescription drugs 
                        without any medical supervision.

           All eyes in the room swivel back to John. Exposed. Naked.

                                 GINA
                        Now, since Mr. Street’s arrival in 
                        Munroe he’s grown increasingly 
                        erratic... All culminating in a 
                        brazen extortion attempt three days 
                        ago, where he promised to divert 
                        these proceedings unless I paid him 
                        a substantial sum.

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        How can this be true?

           Dan speaks up. Grim.

                                 DAN
                        It’s my fault. I should have seen 
                        the warning signs.
                             (to John)
                        I believe in second chances, John. 
                        But you’ve been unreachable... When 
                        was the last time you took meds? 
                        When’s the last time you slept?

                                 JOHN
                        I, uh- It’s been...

           John trails off, trying to remember. Seeming, more than 
           anything, a man totally OUT OF CONTROL -- The moment breaks-

                                 CALEB
                        SECURITY!

           Two uniformed GUARDS burst in -- Sheriff Fischer stands.

                                 FISCHER
                        Don’t bother. I’ll handle this-

                                 JOHN
                        HOLD IT!
           All FREEZE -- John has a gleaming black GUN pressed square to 
           the head of Gina Sanger -- His speech is pressured, speedy -- 
           Much like his daughter, when she’s in the grips of her mania-

                                 JOHN
                        Hold it right there, do not -- Do 
                        NOT -- Move a muscle... Now, since 
                        touching down in this Godforsaken 
                        stretch of flyover tundra I’ve been 
                        beat up, shot and nearly 
                        incinerated... Well now it’s my 
                        turn! So all of you SIT DOWN and 
                        LISTEN... Very. Closely.

           It’s safe to say that John has LOST IT -- Mania oozes from his 
           every pore... He’s capable of anything.

                                 FISCHER
                        Let’s not do anything crazy-

           John turns his ice pick eyes on Fischer-

                                 JOHN
                        Sit. Down.

           Fischer complies.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - LEISURE BUILDING - DAY

           The guard is almost on her, reaching for his truncheon-

                                 GUARD
                        Hey. Hey! Lemme see your ID card-

           And just before she’s exposed, his RADIO crackles:

                                 VOICE (ON RADIO)
                        Gun in two, repeat, gun in two...

           Both guards instantly break off for the door. Mattie breathes a 
           sigh of relief... Then makes her way to the door of the gym.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           John’s words tear over everything. A destroying avalanche:

                                 JOHN
                        As Ms. Sanger was so kind to point 
                        out, Homestead prides itself on 
                        catering to the needs of its men. 
                        And what do men in this town need?

           John turns to Caleb. Caleb’s look hardens.

                                 JOHN
                        Women.
                                 DAN
                        John. Don’t do this.

                                 JOHN
                        But look around -- Not a great 
                        influx of them, are there? So 
                        somebody figured, ‘Maybe we expand 
                        the search’.

                                 DAN
                        Think of Kate, John.

           John swings his gun toward his boss-

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - GYM - DAY

           Mattie enters the gym. Flips on the lights for a look around. 
           The majority of the high-end Nautilus machinery seems to never 
           have been touched.

           At the room’s far end is a door. She moves toward it. Has a deep 
           breath... All at once, YANKS it open-

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dan is holding it together -- Just. Not the type who’s logged 
           much time staring down the business end of a .45-

                                 DAN
                        What you’re doing right now, it 
                        will end badly. And Kate needs you.

                                 JOHN
                             (quiet; dangerous)
                        What did you say?

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - GYM - DAY

           Mattie is staring with disbelief into a JANITORIAL CLOSET: Mop, 
           bucket, spray bottles, a feather duster... Nothing.

                                 MATTIE
                        No.

           She tears things from the closet in frustration, scattering 
           cleaning supplies, pounding the walls. Searching frantically.

                                 MATTIE
                        No!

           ...And then there’s no place left to search. She slumps down, 
           against a wall in frustration. Hangs her head.

           Then she notices something: The duster she’d thrown is MOVING. 
           Being ruffled... Air is being pushed through a wall seam.
           She scrambles to her feet. Moves to the wall panel against which 
           the duster had fallen, pushes gently... It gives way. A metal 
           SPIRAL STAIRCASE is revealed.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           John aims his righteous anger at his erstwhile boss -- Dan 
           swallows heavily, his bravura shriveled and gone-

                                 JOHN
                        What did you say?

           John takes two very dangerous steps toward Dan-

                                 DAN
                        Just, you know... Think.

           John takes two more steps-

                                 JOHN
                        What’d she give you, Dan? Options? 
                        Cash? With your fucking rules and 
                        your endless bullshit? What’s YOUR 
                        price you SON OF A-

           CRACK!

           John goes down hard, WHANGING off the table as he falls.

                                 CALLAN (ON SCREEN)
                        Thank you, Ms. Sanger. I couldn’t 
                        take much more of that.

           Gina sets down the STAPLER she’d brained John with, steps back. 
           Security swarms John.

           INT. WINDOWLESS SPACE - DAY

           Mattie creeps down the spiral staircase, gun first. Playing it 
           safe. Takes in what she sees: Empty desk, blank empty room, 
           crucifix. A door, marked “39”, propped open with mop and bucket-

           She cocks her head -- Sounds are echoing out through the door. 
           GRUNTING. Rhythmic and steady... Stops for a moment. Then starts 
           up again.

           INT. “39” - HALL - DAY

           Mattie moves down a long, dimly lit hall with doors on either 
           side. The rhythmic grunting continues from the far end -- Mattie 
           takes a moment to peek into a door on her right.

           Inside might be a prison holding cell: Thin mattress, stripped, 
           plus exposed toilet and sink. But the room is done in garish 
           PINK. Someone’s idea of femininity... Disturbing.

           Mattie grits her teeth, moves forward, clearing each identical 
           room as she goes. All are empty.
           Finally she gets to the last door on the left. The grunting is 
           loud, now matched with heavy RUSTLING noises-

           Mattie spins into the room-

           INT. “39” - LAST ROOM ON THE LEFT - DAY

                                 MATTIE
                        FREEZE!

           Tigger turns to look up at her. He is shirtless, on hands and 
           knees. Wearing rubber gloves, holding a BRUSH he was using to 
           work at a ruddy brown BLOOD PATCH on the room’s floor.

                                 MATTIE
                        Where are they, Tig?

           Tigger slowly gets to his feet.

                                 TIGGER
                        Hey Mattie. Long time no see.

           Tigger drops his brush in a murky bucket.

                                 TIGGER
                        How’s Braden? He been up to see his 
                        daddy lately?

                                 MATTIE
                        I’m real serious. Where are they?

                                 TIGGER
                        Who?

                                 MATTIE
                        The girls ya had down here for... 
                        Use. Of the men... Ya didn’t...

           She cuts eyes at the blood, trails off.

                                 TIGGER
                        Oh, them. No Mattie, c’mon. I’m not 
                        a monster... They’re in a flatbed 
                        container bound for Port of Newark.

                                 MATTIE
                             (re: blood)
                        What’s that?

                                 TIGGER
                        Well, somea them needed... 
                        Encouraging.

           INT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           John is hauled to his feet by the guards.

                                 FISCHER
                        Take him to my car.

           Dan collects John’s gun from the carpet. Lighter than he 
           expected. It leaves a tacky black BLOTCH on his palm-
                                 DAN
                        What is this?

           Gina takes it from him, with a pen through the trigger guard-

                                 GINA
                        A toy. Spray painted. Probably on 
                        the way over.

           Dan shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 DAN
                        He lost it. He totally lost it.

                        to work.

           INT. “39” - LAST ROOM ON THE LEFT - DAY

           Tigger snaps off his rubber gloves, one at a time.

                                 MATTIE
                        Who knew? Caleb? Al?

                                 TIGGER
                        Everybody. Everybody knew. Heck, I 
                        figured ya knew too... It was Stu 
                        first suggested it.

           Her ex. His brother. She recoils.

                                 TIGGER
                        Heck Mattie, ya were married to the 
                        guy. Ya know him better than 
                        anyone.

                                 MATTIE
                        Stu? No. This is too much. Even for 
                        him.

           Tigger pulls his cigarettes from his pocket. Slow.

                                 TIGGER
                        Nah, this is an irresistible 
                        amenity. As in, “Hey Tig, ya know 
                        what’d be an irresistible amenity 
                        at them mancamps?”

                                 MATTIE
                        That’s people you’re talking about.

                                 TIGGER
                        They was willing ta come thousands 
                        ‘a miles to scrape roughneck shit
                        from communal toilets... And this 
                        is so bad?

                                 MATTIE
                        You’re disgusting.
                                 TIGGER
                        Ya didn’t answer my question... 
                        Braden see Pooh lately?

           Tigger pats his pockets, casting around for matches-

                                 TIGGER
                        A boy should see his daddy.

           He spots his matchbook on the grimy pink coverlet. Under the 
           pillow, just visible, is a GUN. But Tigger takes the matches.

                                 MATTIE
                        Braden’s never seeing either of ya 
                        again, never.

           Tigger lights up, takes his time -- Not taking his eyes from 
           hers. The gun in her hand, rock solid-

                                 TIGGER
                             (then-)
                        So what’re we doing here-

           BLAM.

           The back of Tigger’s head FANS OUT across the oily pink wall 
           behind -- He slumps, collapses, mouth moving soundlessly -- 
           Smoke drifting from nostrils and ENTRY WOUND.

           Cold blood.

           Mattie lowers her weapon.

           A part inside bricked over. A good part.

           She leaves.

           EXT. HOMESTEAD LODGE - LEISURE BUILDING- DAY

           Mattie exits. Legs unsteady. Falls to her knees. VOMITS.

           There. Done. Resolve settles on her like a cloak. She’ll wear 
           this day the rest of her life-

           Then she sees John being tossed into Fischer’s cruiser. Shit.

           INT. CRUISER (MOVING) - DAY

           Fischer talks and drives. John is woozy. HANDS CUFFED. Ugly gash 
           on his forehead where he caught that table.

                                 FISCHER
                        Gotta hand it to ya, you’re one 
                        resilient bastard.

           Fischer slows the car.

                                 FISCHER
                        Crazy as a goddamn beached whale. 
                        But resilient.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Fischer turns the car from the highway onto one of the 
           innumerable access roads that crisscross the area.

           INT. CRUISER - DAY

           Fischer U-turns, brings the car to a stop. Cuts the engine.

                                 JOHN
                             (faint)
                        I promised...

                                 FISCHER
                        What’s that?

           John trails off. Fisher pulls his revolver, snaps it open.

                                 JOHN
                             (faint)
                        To take my daughter to the 
                        museum... I promised.

           He pours bullets from the chamber into his palm. POCKETS them.

                                 FISCHER
                        This gonna be the first promise to 
                        her you broke?

                                 JOHN
                        It was going to be the first one I 
                        kept. In a long while, anyway.

           Fischer closes the now empty gun, turns and holds it to John:

                                 FISCHER
                        Take it. Go on.

           John’s eyes slip shut. Sees it all clear -- Something else, 
           though... Through the windshield -- Unseen by either man-

           Mattie’s CRUISER is barreling STRAIGHT AT THEM.

                                 FISCHER
                        “Suspect became unstable, went for 
                        officer’s service weapon. Officer 
                        fought off suspect, though deadly 
                        force was required-”

           Ker-SMASH!! The car IMPLODES-

           EXT. ACCESS ROAD - DAY

           Quite a sight: The two identical cars shattered in what could 
           have been some sort of law enforcement demolition derby.

           The door on Fisher’s cruiser wrenches open with a SQUEAL -- 
           Fischer tumbles out -- Bleeding from nose and ears-

                                 FISCHER
                        MATTIE!
           He’s screaming. Spitting. All blind gothic RAGE -- Raises his 
           gun, points it toward-

                                 FISCHER
                        MATTIE!

           And we see her now -- She’s dazed, PINNED -- Trying desperately 
           to get free of her car -- TOO LATE-

           Fischer PULLS THE TRIGGER-

           -Click.

           Empty. Of course.

           Whips open the chamber, digs into his pocket -- Reloads -- Snaps 
           the gun shut -- Saunters right on up to her destroyed windshield 
           -- No way to miss at this range -- The whites of her eyes-

           URK! -- The sheriff is DRIVEN down to the gravel -- John’s on 
           him, cuffed and bleeding, HAMMERING with clasped hands -- And
           SCREAMING -- PRIMAL, ANIMALISTIC -- As he swings down, over and 
           over, locked in a state of PURE ID-

                                 MATTIE
                        John... John. It’s okay. Relax, 
                        John. It’s done... Over.

           John looks up -- Mattie is there. Freed of her car. Hand on his 
           shoulder. Motherly tones in her voice...

                                 MATTIE
                        It’s okay. It’s over.

           John’s released from his fugue state... Looks down to find 
           Fischer, brutalized. Pummeled into a bloody heap.

           He slackens, practically falls over. Lays in the road. All the 
           manic energy finally drained off.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           A KEY

           Mattie works it into John’s handcuffs. They’re both exhausted, 
           sitting on the hood of her ruined cruiser.

                                 JOHN
                        You find 39?

           She nods. Gets the cuffs off. They fall to the gravel.

                                 JOHN
                        And the girls?

           She just shakes her head.

                                 JOHN
                        But, Zaitoon? You arrest him?
                                 MATTIE
                        He’s dead.

           Can’t believe what he’s hearing-

                                 JOHN
                        So all this? It was for... Nothing?

           Mattie roots in her pocket-

                                 JOHN
                        All of this...

           Finds what she’s after -- Her little DIGITAL RECORDER:

                                 MATTIE (ON RECORDER)
                        I’m real serious. Where are they?

                                 TIGGER (ON RECORDER)
                        Who?

                                 MATTIE (ON RECORDER)
                        The girls ya had down here for... 
                        Use. Of the men... Ya didn’t...

           John slumps back as RELIEF floods through him. Mattie looks 
           around. Studies the remains of her old life. Her face sets. 

           She’s determined to see this through.

                                                                CUT TO:

           With same set face, now sat before us, smartly dressed, with a

           Footage from inside a maze of shipping containers at a busy

           malnourished and scared, to waiting ambulances.

           INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

           Mattie shifts in her seat, uncomfortable with the cameras, 
           uncomfortable with the praise.

                                 MATTIE

                        Homestead’s new owner, Mercury 
                        Petroleum, has its stock in 
                        freefall and both its CEO and 
                        General Counsel have resigned, 
                        leaving the huge company in the 
                        hands of a relative unknown, a Mr. 
                        Jamie Bliss... But one question 
                        remains-

           The anchor surprises Mattie with a PHOTO of John.

                                 MATTIE
                        ...I don’t, uh- What’re ya lookin’
                        for, here?

           The anchor really goes for it, angling for his duPont Award-

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        John Street, a disgraced attorney 
                        with a violent history of mental 
                        illness, was hired to investigate 
                        Homestead as part of Mercury’s 
                        purchase. It’s been suggested that 
                        he learned of the ongoing crimes 
                        and solicited bribes in exchange 
                        for his silence.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The interview finishes out on the TV in Emily’s Upper West Side  
           living room:

                                 MATTIE (ON TV)
                        John’s a good man. He risked his 
                        life ta save those women. He saved 
                        my life too.

           The TV is shut off, the door can be heard to open and close...

           ...And we PAN DOWN to an end table. Atop it, next to a darling 
           photo of Kate, is A LETTER. It lies open, as if recently read, 
           next to its envelope from the Rest EZ-

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Dear Emily-

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Emily rides in her building’s elevator. Examining her reflection 
           in the metal door. Grappling with something.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        This envelope once had a check... 
                        And now there’s only promises-

           EXT. 84TH STREET - DAY

           Emily exits her building, begins walking. It’s lovely out. 
           Springtime in Manhattan is a fine time, indeed.
                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I promise that I will be a better 
                        father. I promise that I will be a 
                        better man.

           EXT. PS 9 - DAY

           Emily passes PS 9, playground brimming with happy, typical 
           youngsters. A cheerful girl waves to her. Emily waves back.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        I promise that my legacy will be 
                        more than faulty wiring.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

           Emily turns onto Central Park West. The trees awash with 
           blossoms. So different from the stark emptiness of North Dakota.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        And most of all, I promise that 
                        from here on I will be there for 
                        you. I will be there for Kate. And 
                        together, we will find a way to 
                        make it work.

           EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

           Emily climbs the wide stairs at the entrance of the iconic 
           museum. Everywhere are people: Men, women and children.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        PS: Would you call the hospital in 
                        Lewiston, North Dakota and ask for 
                        Deputy Mattie Cooper? Ask her to 
                        pick up where I left off at Burton. 
                        And tell her I owe her a sandwich.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE WHALE

           Well known to every NYC school child. Gigantic and blue, 
           suspended like some inflated Dalí, in the Hall of Ocean Life.

           INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

           Kate, face full of wonder, marvels at the giant fiberglass 
           mammal. Locals and tourists wander about. 

                                 KATE
                        The blue whale is the biggest 
                        animal ever to have lived, ever!

           John, sporting a new pink SCAR on his forehead, is close behind. 
           It’s family day at the Museum.

                                 JOHN
                        Is that right?
                                 KATE
                             (nodding)
                        Bigger than dinosaurs, even!

                                 JOHN
                        Really?

                                 KATE
                             (nodding)
                        And they live together in families. 
                        They don’t like to be alone.

                                 JOHN
                        No one does.

           Kate notices something past her father-

                                 KATE
                        YOU CAME!

           Kate runs to her mother, who is approaching from behind. As she 
           and Kate embrace, Emily turns eyes on John. Saying more with a 
           look than any words could.

                                 EMILY
                        ‘Course I did... What’d I miss?

           ...And John breaks into a grin, open-hearted and truly happy. 
           He’s finally regained his peace.

           And it’s right here in front of him.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                        THE END
