           EXT. “THE ADMIRAL BENBOW” - DAY

           Half-way between no-place special, and nowhere in particular, 
           tucked into the hollow between two hills, is a small, stone-
           built inn, pub, and stable. 

           A board hangs over the door, an oil painting of a SHIP OF THE 
           LINE, and the name ADMIRAL BENBOW in gold lettering. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BEDROOM - DAY/FLASHBACK

           A simple room: brick walls, a window looking out on not much 
           at all, and a bed. In the bed, pale, sickly, GEORGE HAWKINS, 
           44. He COUGHS, and the sound is gurgling, painful, hacking. 

           He’s attended by DR. DAVID LIVESEY, a solid, handsome man. 
           Serious, intelligent, thoughtful, Livesey is every bit a 
           gentleman of the Enlightenment. George whispers to him.

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Livesey walks into the small, bare kitchen, and finds JIM 
           HAWKINS, 15. He’s handsome, or will be once he grows out of 
           awkward. He’s pale, uncertain and deeply sad. 

           Jim is carefully assembling an ornate ship in a bottle. 

           Cooking over the stove is his mother, MARY, 34. She’s pretty 
           in a plain, unvarnished, honest way.

                                 LIVESEY
                        Jim, he asked for you. 

           Jim gets up, Livesey stops him with a gentle hand.

                                 LIVESEY (CONT’D)
                        Jim, anything you need to tell him 
                        this would be the time. Understand? 

           Jim nods solemnly, taking his ship with him. 

           EXT. THE CRAGGY COASTLINE OF SOUTH-WEST ENGLAND - DAY

           The Sea crashes against the rocky shores of England. A narrow 
           road leads up onto bluffs overlooking a bay, and as credits 
           roll we FOLLOW a sad little FUNERAL PROCESSION. 

                                 CLERGYMAN (V.O.)
                        It hath pleased Almighty God, 
           A ragged pony pulls a cart with a cheap, pine casket in the 
           back. Following the cart, in his Sunday best, is JIM.

                                 CLERGYMAN (V.O.)
                        ...in his infinite wisdom...

           Next to Jim walks his mum, wearing her one good dress, a 
           black shawl around her shoulders, and a black bonnet.

                                 CLERGYMAN (V.O.)
                        ...to take George Hawkins...

           Behind them, a CLERGYMAN, and Livesey.  

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BEDROOM - DAY/FLASHBACK

           Jim walks in, slowly, afraid of the dying man in the corner. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Come in, boy. 

           EXT. CHURCHYARD - DAY

           Rain threatens, as usual, as the pine box is lowered into the 
           Earth. 

                                 CLERGYMAN
                        Kind Father, loving husband...

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BEDROOM - DAY/FLASHBACK

           George is examining the ship the bottle. 

                                 GEORGE
                        The Golden Hind, is it? 

           Jim nods. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Drake was an Englishman alright. 
                        First man to Captain a ship around 
                        the world. 

                                 JIM
                        Not Magellan?

                                 GEORGE
                        He made a go of it; but was killed 
                        in Cebu. I don’t reckon a man who 
                        doesn’t live through a journey 
                        rates as having finished the job. 
           George gives back the ship, hands trembling. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Bit like me not finishin’ the job 
                        of growin’ you. 

           Jim’s tears flow freely. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I know you dreamt of seeing some o’ 
                        the world, but someone has to take 
                        care of this old place now.  

           Jim nods.

                                 JIM
                        I’ll do my best, father. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I know you will, son, I know you’ll 
                        do a fine job of it too. 

           George stifles a cough. 

           EXT. CHURCHYARD - DAY

           The Gravestone, fresh-carved among the moss covered slabs of 
           the long-dead, reads “GEORGE HAWKINS, 1713-1757, a goode and 
           honest man”.

                                 CLERGYMAN
                        ...We commit his body to the Earth, 
                        looking ahead to the glorious day 
                        of resurrection, when the Sea shall 
                        give up her dead, Amen. 

                                 ALL
                        Amen. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BEDROOM - DAY/FLASHBACK

           George is fading, his breath wheezing. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Always keep your word. It’s your 
                        bond, Jim; say what you mean, do 
                        what you say. 

           George tries to say more, but FITS OF COUGHING WRACK HIM. It 
           grows worse, blood spattering his hand as he wretches. 
                                 JIM
                        DOCTOR! DOCTOR!

           Livesey rushes in, George closes his eyes, exhausted from the 
           effort of saying goodbye to his son. 

           EXT. CHURCHYARD - DAY

           Jim’s alone looking out over the grey and restless sea. He 
           makes a silent, important choice. He leaves the ship in the 
           bottle on top of the gravestone.

                                  TREASURE ISLAND

           EXT. SEA - DAY

           Maybe it’s the magic of CGI, maybe it’s an old-school match 
           cut - but the ship in the bottle BECOMES a small sloop, 
           fighting its way through the unfriendly seas.

           TITLE: TWO MONTHS LATER

           EXT. SLOOP “BELLE FACILE” - CONTINUOUS

           The single masted sloop is a warren of rigging, dirty sails, 
           and wet SMUGGLERS. These gristled, rough-hewn men do their 
           work efficiently. This is fair weather to them.  

           WAVES SLAP the hull, and send spray across the decks, the men 
           heave the lines in ever tighter. 

           At the wheel: BLACK DOG, 35. He’s nothing like the pirates of 
           your imagination; just a hard-man in an oil skin coat and a 
           wet wool hat. Dog scans the distant shore with his spy-glass. 

           SPYGLASS POV: the shore line, foaming with surf, the rocks 
           slick with seawater, and a sandy cove, and just barely, he 
           can see a small FIRE FLICKERING at the beach-side. 

                                 DOG
                        Prepare to jibe!

           EXT. COVE - DAY

           Rocky cliffs surround the turbulent cove. The “Belle Facile” 
           bobs at anchor at the cove’s mouth, and a longboat is being 
           rowed ashore by 24 of Dog’s crew, their master at the helm. 
           At the reach the sandy shore, the smugglers leap out, and 
           drag the boat up onto the beach with bare feet and rolled 
           breeches.

           EXT. CLIFF - CONTINUOUS

           Dr. Livesey is out gathering plants, carefully uprooting a 
           small, green herb from the ground - he stops as he sees 
           movement in the cove below. 

           He crawls closer to the edge, and spies from the cover of a 
           bush. Concern spreads across his features. 

           Even from his vantage point, it’s clear. The men are 
           smugglers, thieves and bastards. They’re armed to the teeth, 
           clubs, swords, pistols and a massive BLUNDERBUSS.

           Livesey sneaks back to the road, mounts his horse, and RIDES 
           HARD AWAY!

           EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

           Waiting by the paltry fire, is PEW, 60. He’s a ragged old 
           thing, his face a shadow inside a moth-eaten, hooded cloak. 

           Dog catches one of his SMUGGLERS drinking from a flask. He 
           stomps on the back of the drinkers knee, and cuffs him across 
           the side of the head before wrenching the flask away. 

                                 DOG
                        What did I say about drinkin’?

                                 DRINKER
                        Christ, it were just a nip. 

           Dog lets the man up, glowering at the others. 

                                 DOG
                        I told you lot. I said it. This 
                        ain’t a few barrels of pish past 
                        the tax man- Mark me close: we’ll 
                        hang for what’s planned today. We 
                        move fast, we move quiet, and we’re 
                        gone with the tide. 

           FENNICK, 40, a toothless shite, grins. 

                                 FENNICK
                        We know what we’re ‘ere for. 
                                 DOG
                        The stop muckin’ about. Don’t like 
                        it? Can’t carry the weight? Do me a 
                        favor and piss off now.   

           The men are quiet, resolved, dangerous. Pew hasn’t moved, 
           like a carved idol, he sits by the flame. 

                                 PEW
                        You finished? 

           Pew stands, and turns towards the cliffs. 

                                 PEW (CONT’D)
                        Narrow is the path.

           His cloak falls back: HIS EYES HAVE BEEN SEARED OUT!!! 

                                 PEW (CONT’D)
                        Best keep your eyes open. 

           The hardened smugglers all swallow hard. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - AFTERNOON

           Jim has a simple apron over his tunic and breeches. He 
           carries a bucket in one hand and a rag in the other, and gets 
           to work washing the windows. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/STABLES - AFTERNOON

           A STEAMING PILE OF HORSE SHIT - Jim stares at the mess left 
           by the CART HORSE who snickers and fidgets. 

           Jim takes the shovel, and scoops it up. He CURRIES the cart 
           horse. He SPREADS hay. He SWEEPS the flagstone. Chores, 
           chores, chores. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BACK DOOR - LATER

           Jim’s chopping wood for the fire. His mum dumps a slop bucket 
           to run down hill. 

                                 MARY
                        Have you mucked and swept the barn?

                                 JIM
                        Yes mum. 

                                 MARY
                        Did you speak to the Captain?
                                 JIM
                        No mum. 

                                 MARY
                        3 pounds, 4 shillings and 6 pence. 

                                 JIM
                        Yes mum.

                                 MARY
                        Bar needs a fresh keg, can you 
                        manage on your own?

                                 JIM
                        Yes mum. 

           He waits for her to go inside, and takes all his frustration 
           out on another lump of wood; splitting it to kindling. 

           INT. BEER CELLAR - AFTERNOON

           It’s a small, low ceilinged cellar where the beer cools. Jim 
           heaves a heavy barrel onto its side, and ROLLS IT UP A RAMP. 
           Each push is about as much as he can handle. 

           He GROANS as the barrel creeps up and over the stoppers 
           nailed to the ramp. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jim opens a tiny half-door next to the stove, and rolls the 
           beer barrel out from it. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           Jim rolls the keg into the pub. It’s a warm space, wood 
           panelled, brass pieces here and there that look as if they 
           came from a naval salvage yard. 

           He manhandles the keg into place, lifting it first onto a low 
           stool, then up the final few feet to the bar. He sets the tap 
           with practiced efficiency. 

           The FRONT DOOR OPENS, framing a man in a long frock coat and 
           a tricorne hat. THE CAPTAIN 65; sun-baked, rum-pickled, and 
           battered by the storms of life. He sings as he makes his way 
           to the bar.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Her heart was poundin’ like a drum, 
                        Her lips wuz red as any plum...
                                 JIM
                        Captain. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        A wee dram if you please, Master 
                        Hawkins. 

                                 JIM
                        There’s the matter of your arrears.

           Jim pours a drink for the captain, but keeps it out of reach.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        My whats?

                                 JIM
                        You’ve not paid rent for 3 months- 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Well, ‘tis the sabbath, and the 
                        good book allows for no business 
                        transacted on the Lord’s day. 

                                 JIM
                        It’s Tuesday. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Ah. So it is. 

                                 JIM
                        3 pounds, 4 shillings and 6 pence. 

           The Captain glances at the rum, and licks his lips. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        I’ve not got it on me, but I’m as 
                        good as my word-

                                 JIM
                        Mum said-

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Give me the rum, boy. You’ll get 
                        your money when I’m good and ready 
                        for you to have it, and that’s my 
                        last word. 

                                 JIM
                        But-

                                 CAPTAIN
                        The rum damn you! 
           The Captain slams a fist onto the bar. Jim chickens out, and 
           slides the mug to him. He gulps it greedily, visibly relaxing 
           as he pours the liquor down his throat. 

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                           (calmer)
                        Tomorrow. I’ll get you your pounds 
                        and your shillings on the ‘morrow. 

           Jim’s flushed. He clearly doesn’t handle confrontation well. 

                                 JIM
                        Thankee Captain. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - AFTERNOON

           The SMUGGLERS led by Pew and Dog hide behind the bushes that 
           mark the lane. 

           Pew stands from behind the bushes and makes his way onto the 
           lane, and walks carefully towards the Benbow. 

           Fennick leans in and whispers to Dog. 

                                 FENNICK
                        Who cut out ‘is peepers, then?

                                 DOG
                        Cap’n Flint himself, s’how I heard 
                        it.

           Fennicks eyes go wide at that. 

                                 FENNICK
                        One of Flint’s crew? Him? 

           They watch as Pew walks his way towards the Benbow’s front 
           door, surely as a man with eyes. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - MOMENTS LATER

           The Captain is seated by the fire, rum in hand. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Fifteen men on a deadman’s chest, 
                        yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!

           MR. JONES, 48, a quiet drunk who works the local farms is in 
           his usual spot, nursing a mug of ale. 

           Jim looks up from cleaning the bar as the door opens. He 
           can’t see Pew well in the darkness of the pub. 
                                 JIM
                        Can I help you, sir? 

           Pew ignores him, walking on like a SPECTRE. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        The Mate was fixed by the bosun’s 
                        pike...

                                 JIM
                        Sir?

           Pew stops, right behind the Captain. Jones watches with 
           feigned disinterest. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        The bosun brained by a 
                        marlinspike...

                                 PEW
                        And Cookey’s throat was marked be 
                        like...

           The Captain turns from the fire, fear white on his face. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Pew? 

                                 PEW
                        In the flesh. What little remains.

           Pew reaches into his cloak, and takes out a small square of 
           linen paper. 

                                 PEW (CONT’D)
                        Your left hand Billy Bones. 

           Jim watches, transfixed as The Captain holds out his hand. 
           Pew grasps for it, blind hands reaching up the arm to find 
           the palm, before placing the paper in it. 

           On the page, almost two inches across, a single BLACK SPOT. 

                                 PEW (CONT’D)
                        Crew’s had a vote, Bill. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Ain’t no cursed crew left!

                                 PEW
                        There’s not so many, s’true, but, 
                        not so few either. We wants the 
                        map. That’s all. 
                                 CAPTAIN
                        I don’t have it. I never had it. 

                                 PEW
                        You always was a bad liar. 

           The Captain (aka Billy Bones) turns over the black spot. 
           SUNDOWN is written in an unsteady hand. 

                                 PEW (CONT’D)
                        The rules has been abided. 

           And with that, Pew turns, and stalks away; he turns those 
           EYELESS SOCKETS on Jim, FREEZING HIM WITH FEAR!

           The Captain is left shaken. He stands, and goes to the bar. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        A drink. 

                                 JIM
                        Who was- [that?]

           The Captain PUSHES Jim in the chest, and reaches out, taking 
           a bottle from the shelf and GUZZLING from it. He coughs HARD, 
           and staggers as he heads for the stairs. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Captain? CAPTAIN!

           Bones ignores Jim, and thunders up to his room.

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           Pew walks back to the Smugglers hiding behind the low hedge. 

                                 DOG
                        Did he give it to ye? 

                                 PEW
                        Not yet. 

           Dog glances back to his crew. 

                                 DOG
                        Fen, take a few lads, watch the 
                        back door. 

                                 PEW
                        We gave him till sundown-

                                 DOG
                        Bugger sundown. 
                                 PEW
                        A man has a code, or he’s no man at 
                        all. 

                                 DOG
                        That what you are; a man? More like 
                        a broken, blind, bastard. Bollocks 
                        to your code. 

           Dog signals Fennick, who runs around to the Benbow’s rear 
           door.  

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        No witnesses. 

           The Smugglers check their pistols, and draw their swords. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/CAPTAIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A small, cozy room, with a window looking out to the sea. 

           The Captain BOLTS the door locked. He drags a heavy sea-chest 
           out from under the bed. He fumbles with the lock, and then 
           flings the chest open. 

           He mutters madly, GLUGGING huge sups of rum from the bottle.

           He starts ripping the contents out, a fine coat, an extra 
           shirt, then, A BLACK PIRATES FLAG, neatly folded; a shrunken 
           native head, a teak Buddha, a Japanese tanto...

           With the trunk empty, he then rips out the FALSE BOTTOM- and 
           reveals a hidden cache. 

           Gold bars, coins, and velvet pouches are tossed aside as he 
           greedily grips a leather folder hidden at the very bottom. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        ...can’t have it. Give it to me he 
                        did... to me. “Take care of it” he 
                        told me. “So I will” said I... on 
                        his deathbed... ON HIS BLOODY 
                        DEATHBED!

           The Captain stands up suddenly, drains the bottle, and 
           SMASHES IT AGAINST THE WALL!

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jim has just reached the landing when he hears the sound of 
           breaking glass. He KNOCKS LOUDLY on the door...
                                 JIM
                        Captain! Captain!

           Mary appears at the bottom of the stairs. 

                                 MARY
                        What the hell was that?

           EXT. COVE - LATE AFTERNOON

           The ‘Belle Facile’ is still straining at her anchor, but now, 
           the ridge above the cove is crowded with HORSEMEN. This is 
           the county MILITIA.

           All of them have MUSKETS slung on their backs. Ammunition 
           belts, and a motley collection of weapons and gear round out 
           their equipment. 

           Leading them are Dr. Livesey, and SQUIRE TRELAWNY, 65. The 
           Squire is vital, aggressive, an old soldier who refuses to 
           let time get the better of him.  

           Next to Trelawny is his old colour-sergeant, “RUTHIE”, 55, 
           6’5”, and all of it sinew, scars and loyalty. Never did a man 
           deserve a feminine nickname less. 

           On foot, scanning the footprints of the smugglers in the soil 
           is “RIVER”, (actually Two Rivers) 44, an Iroquois Warrior. 
           River keeps his black hair long, but wears English clothing 
           and boots with an impressive hair-pipe native breastplate. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        How many? 

                                 RIVER
                        15 to 25 men, following the coast. 

           Rivers mounts up, and the Squire waves everyone forward. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/CAPTAIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Captain has opened the leather folder, revealing a sheaf 
           of CHARTS. He has one folded open on his bed. It’s been hand 
           drawn, with great attention to detail. 

                                 MARY (O.C.)
                        Open this bloody door at once!

           Madness has overwhelmed him, his face is turning redder and 
           redder. The Captain traces the diagram with his finger, 
           mumbling the place names...
                                 CAPTAIN
                        Look-out hill... Skeleton island... 
                        aye, the three fingers...a deadman 
                        points the way... three...

           SOUND CUE: The rapid DOUBLE BEAT of his strained heart. Thump-
           thump, thump-thump...

           He holds his chest, and starts to gasp. He looks suddenly 
           confused. He tries to stand, pushing himself up to his feet.

           The heart-beats STOP!

           He takes two steps to the door, and then a spasm twists his 
           entire body, and he falls over with a heavy THUD. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mary and Jim hear the heavy THUD and turn to look at each 
           other. 

                                 MARY
                        Fetch your axe Jim.

           WE FOLLOW: Jim as he dashes down the stairs, through the pub 
           (where Mr. Jones is watching everything in some confusion), 
           to the kitchen, to the back door - he opens the back door, 
           and grabs his axe. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BACK GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           Hidden among the growing turnips and the woodshed, Fen holds 
           his MEN back with a quick gesture. 

           Jim, in his haste, never sees the smugglers. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mary, hands on hips and FURIOUS, points to the door. 

                                 MARY
                        Knock in that damned door, or I’ll 
                        roll up my blimin’ sleeves and do 
                        it myself. 

           Jim hauls back, and starts HAMMERING at the door. 
           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/CAPTAIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Captain is still laying where he fell. The DOOR SHUDDERS, 
           ONCE, TWICE - the iron bolt is giving way with each THWACK of 
           Jim’s axe. 

           Finally the door gives, and Jim stumbles in. He sees the 
           Captain, and rushes to check on him. 

           He lifts the Captain’s head, but the blue tone on his skin is 
           a bad, bad sign. Jim listens to his chest. 

                                 JIM
                        I can’t hear his heart!

                                 MARY
                        You spoke to him about his arrears? 

                                 JIM
                        Mum, the man’s dying. 

           Mary kneels on the other side of the Captain and feels at his 
           neck for the pulse. 

                                 MARY
                        Well, did you? 

                                 JIM
                        He said tomorrow.  

                                 MARY
                        Fresh out of ‘tomorrows’ he is. 

           Mary’s eyes take a quick stock of the room, the chest, and 
           the scattered items on the floor. She reaches into the sea 
           chest, coming out with a small GOLD BAR. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus wept.  

                                 JIM
                        Mum, that’s his property. 

                                 MARY
                        Look like he needs it? Check those 
                        papers on his bed. 

           She pours the contents of a velvet pouch into her hand: 
           precious gems, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, lapis, 
           turquoise and jade! Mary GASPS!

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        We’re rich!
           Jim is looking at the map, and has just read the legend at 
           the top corner. FLINT’S ISLAND...

           Mary is looking at one of the stones in the light, captivated

           MARY POV: in the foreground: A STUNNING RUBY glitters. In the 
           background: a DOZEN BRIGANDS OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR!

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           Dog strides into the pub, followed by his men. Mr. Jones 
           takes one look, and realizes, it’s time to get the hell out. 
           He leaves a few pennies on his table.  

                                 DOG
                        Leavin’ is you, mate? 

                                 MR. JONES
                           (nervous)
                        Oh aye, long day tomorrow. 

           Dog steps aside, and as Mr. Jones tips his hat to him, Dog 
           JAMS A LONG BLADE INTO HIS BACK. 

                                 DOG
                        There, there, you can take the day 
                        off now, can’t you? 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/CAPTAIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mary and Jim hear Jones SCREAM, and scurry to the door. Jim 
           peeks out, and they slip quietly into the hallway, even as 
           they hear boots coming up the stairs. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mary and Jim sneak down the hallway, pinned to the wall as 
           Dog walks straight into the Captain’s room. 

           Hardly daring to breathe, they steal their way to a thin door 
           at the end of the hall. 

           More SMUGGLERS come up the stairs, Jim just manages to close 
           the door behind him. 
           INT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

           A narrow servant’s-stairway leads to the ground floor. Jim 
           and Mary tip-toe down to the ground floor - they slip out, 
           the door above OPENS and the DRINKER sticks his face in.   

           Their luck can’t hold forever...

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/CAPTAIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dog sees the stack of charts on his bed and starts going 
           through them, expert sea-captains eyes searching for 
           something he’s not finding. 

                                 DOG
                        Virginia - Cuba - Louisiana - damn 
                        you where is it?

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mary and Jim tip-toe into the kitchen towards the back door. 
           But suddenly, it starts getting POUNDED ON from the other 
           side. 

                                 FENNICK (O.S.)
                        Open the bloody door!

           Mary freezes. They’re trapped!

           Jim pulls her by the arm, and opens the little hatch to the 
           BEER CELLAR. Mary and he barely squeeze through as more 
           Smugglers bustle into the kitchen. 

           INT. BEER CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mary and Jim scurry down the long ramp. They move quietly, 
           while above them, they follow the footsteps of the intruders 
           through the imperfect seams of the floorboards.

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/CAPTAIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dog re-checks all the maps, but none of them are what he’s 
           looking for. 

                                 DOG
                        PEW! Pew, damn you, it isn’t here!
           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           Pew has just walked in the front door. He sniffs the air, as 
           if searching for something. 

                                 DOG (O.C.)
                        PEW!

           Dog comes down the stairs, and THROWS THE USELESS CHARTS at 
           the blind man. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        No bloody map. 

           Dog draws his blade, still wet with Jones blood, and drags 
           Pew to the ground, knife to his throat. 

           Pew cocks his head. 

                                 PEW
                        You hear that? 

                                 DOG
                        Hear what? 

                                 PEW
                        Sounds like...

           EXT. POST ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

           HOOF-BEATS!

           With the sun low in the cloudy sky, the MILITIA is riding up 
           towards the Admiral Benbow. Clods of dirt fly as their horses 
           churn the ground. 

           INT. BEER CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jim tries the hatch to the cellar, but it’s LOCKED FROM THE 
           OUTSIDE! He scurries back to his Mum. 

                                 JIM
                           (whispered)
                        It’s locked - shall I smash it? 

           Mary shakes her head. 

                                 MARY
                           (whispered)
                        Don’t make a sound!
           She holds her son close, and they duck low behind a stack of 
           barrels. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           Dog steps through the front door, and sees the men of the 
           Militia forming up. 

                                 DOG
                        BLAST!

           He ducks inside, and slams the door shut. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           Dog draws a pistol out from one of the many holsters on his 
           body. 

                                 DOG
                        Standby to repel boarders!

           The smugglers are suddenly galvanized - tables are 
           overturned, and run up to the windows. Pistols are cocked, 
           the BLUNDERBUSS - a gun with a barrel like a trombone - is 
           poured with powder, and a handful of big musket balls!

           Pew rolls aside to avoid being trampled, but there on the 
           floor, he starts sniffing at the floorboards. 

           INT. BEER CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jim watches BLACK DOG through the tiny gap made by a knot-
           hole in the floor planks. Jim stands on a heavy beer barrel 
           to get a better look...

           Above him, Pew SNIFFS CLOSER - 

           They end up EYE TO EYE - (eye to scarred eye-socket)

           Jim YELPS in shock, and FALLS OFF THE BARREL!

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           In the clamor of preparing for the Militia, only Pew hears 
           Jim fall. He WHOOPS. 

                                 PEW 
                        I smells a rat.
           Pew moves away from the knothole, crawling towards the 
           kitchen: literally following his nose. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           The Militia jog up to the Inn in two neat ranks. They up-end 
           the picnic tables and make temporary barricades.

                                 RUTHIE
                        Check your flints!

           The Militia is well trained, the men careful behind cover, 
           long muskets aimed forward. 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           The SMUGGLERS crowd in at the windows, their pistols in hand. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/BACK GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           The Squire, Livesey and River make their way quietly through 
           the back garden. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           Militia level their muskets in trained, drill-sync.

                                 RUTHIE
                        You lot in there have until I count 
                        to three-

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           BLUNDERBUSS-MAN, a thick-necked thug, aims at Ruthie. 

                                 RUTHIE (O.C.)
                        -to present your poxed arses for 
                        surrender!

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Pew is crawling, crawling and sniffing as he searches. He 
           makes his way around the stove, and finds the tiny door.

                                 PEW
                        Can’t hide from me. 
           Pew opens the door, and draws a dagger that he clamps between 
           his teeth. He crawls into the darkness. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie eyes the pub, and looks over at his men. 

                                 RUTHIE (O.C.)
                        ONE!

           Ruthie gets a glimpse of the blunderbuss and DROPS to the 
           ground a split second before it FIRES!

           A massive PLUME OF SMOKE erupts from the pub window, and a 
           dozen lead balls WHISTLE right over Ruthie and BLAST a 
           cartwheel sized hole in the hedge behind him!

           All the SMUGGLERS FIRE - their pistol-shots PEPPERING the 
           thick wood of the tables - three MILITIAMEN are hit.

           One is killed with a headshot. He drops like a puppet with 
           the strings cut. Another is hit in the shoulder, and he falls 
           back SCREAMING. 

           The third is hiding behind one of the tables: the bullet 
           shatters the wood, sending a spray of splinters 6 inches long 
           into his thigh!

           Ruthie rolls to his side, screaming at his men. 

                                 RUTHIE (CONT’D)
                        Give’em the bleedin’ riddle!

           All the flintlocks CRASH at once, and a massive, belching 
           blast of fire and smoke fills the air...

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/PUB - CONTINUOUS

           The effect is DEVASTATING - the concentrated fire TEARS FIVE 
           MEN DOWN at once, splintering the table-top they’re using as 
           cover, and punching them down to the ground. 

           The BAR in the back of the room is smashed to shit. Rum, 
           whiskey and brandy glug out and drip down to the floor. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           The Militia men are reloading, Ruthie is getting to his feet. 
           Pistols shots CRASH from the pub, bullets WHIZZ overhead. The 
           Militiamen ignore them, and calmly, professionally reload.
           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           River peers into the kitchen through the open door, pistol in 
           one hand, GUNSTOCK-AXE in the other. This is one bad-ass 
           Native American weapon.  

           He slips in, followed by Livesey, a long rapier in his hand, 
           and the Squire, with two finely chased DUELLING PISTOLS.

           The Squire holds Livesey back. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        One more volley, I think -

           INT. BEER CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pew comes down the ramp like a spider, and slides to his 
           feet. He sniffs the air again. 

                                 PEW
                        We’re all blindmen in the dark.

           Pew advances carefully, dagger in one hand, the other out in 
           front as a guide.

           Jim protects his mother, keeping his body in front of hers. 
           His hands tight on the shaft of his axe. 

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie aims his own gun this time, and they FIRE ANOTHER 
           VOLLEY - 

           Ruthie’s musket - detail shot - in SLOW MO: The firing hammer 
           drops, flint striking steel and SPARKING. Powder in the touch-
           hole LIGHTS... The PACKED CHARGE within the barrel detonates, 
           sending a .75 Inch musket ball out at 1400 feet per second.

           FOLLOWING THE SHOT - Blunderbuss-man, rushing to reload, is 
           STRUCK IN THE CHEST - 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           The smugglers are all COWERING from the power of the second 
           volley, which rakes through the thin cover, and wastes 
           another four men. 

           An errant ball RICOCHETS, zipping up, and knocking a lantern 
           down from the wall, the candle landing right into the pooling 
           booze - 
           Sudden, intense, flames FLARE to LIFE! 

                                 DOG
                        Sod this! Hoof it! 

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The Squire and River are either side of Livesey. 

           The FIRST MAN to surge into the kitchen is shot dead by 
           River, the second by the Squire, and the third is DOG: he 
           clashes his sword with Livesey’s. 

           They begin to fight, Dog slashing, hacking, and stabbing, 
           Livesey parries, ripostes, and lunges - BRUTE vs ART.

           River steps into the fight “Last of the Mohicans” style with 
           his gunstock-axe. He makes short, but brutal work of two more 
           smugglers as they try to fight their way through the kitchen. 

           INT. BEER CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           Pew is inching closer and closer to Jim and his mum. Jim 
           finally acts, chopping out with the axe with all his might. 
           Pew neatly steps aside. 

           He slices with the dagger, and Jim narrowly avoids the blade, 
           only to take a hard CLOUT on the ear, which sends him 
           sprawling. 

                                 MARY
                        JIM!

           Pew turns on her. 

                                 PEW 
                        Give it here!

           Mary reaches into her bosom, and takes out the bag of Jewels. 
           She THROWS IT AT PEW, but it bounces off his chest; the small 
           fortune SPILLS to the floor.

           INT. ADMIRAL BENBOW/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Dog realizes he can’t win, and Livesey is pressing his 
           advantage; the awkward doctor can fight. 

           Dog reaches into a pouch, throwing a cloud of fine gunpowder. 
           He DRY FIRES HIS PISTOL, the flint sparks, the powder FLASH 
           DETONATES!
           The explosion is loud, bright and sudden; an 18th century 
           Flash-Bang. When the smoke clears - DOG IS GONE.

           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie and the Militia are fixing bayonets when the front 
           door opens, and the remaining smugglers come running out of 
           the burning pub. 

           Ruthie wades in, skewering one man on his bayonet, and 
           crushing the skull of another with the brass butt-plate. 

           Fennick and two others throw up their hands in surrender.

           INT. BEER CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           The fire RAGES above, a thin layer of smoke up against the 
           ceiling already. 

           Pew grabs at Mary, and pulls her towards him. With both 
           hands, she holds back his knife, but the old pirate pushes 
           the blade inexorably towards her neck. 

                                 PEW
                        All I wants is that map.

           Jim gets back to his knees. Above him, smoke and flame are 
           surging through the cracks in the floorboards.

           He could help his mother, he could get to his feet, he could 
           FIGHT. Instead, he hesitates... locked up by FEAR.

                                 MARY
                        Jim!

           Pew and his mother fall to the floor, the dagger just inches 
           from her throat! 

           There’s a CRASH from above, a spill of light, and LIVESEY 
           comes leaping down the stairs. 

           He boots Pew off of Mary, and DRIVES HIS SWORD through Pew’s 
           chest. 

           Pew screams his last. Livesey pulls the blade free, and 
           hoists Mary to her feet. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        On your feet, Jim!

           Jim scrambles for the stairs as his home BURNS ABOVE HIM!
           EXT. ADMIRAL BENBOW - NIGHT

           Three SMUGGLERS are locked in chains by men of the Militia. 
           The rest watch as the Admiral Benbow roars in flames.

                        What on Earth could they have been 
                        after?

           Jim holds up the map. 

                                 JIM
                        They were after this. 

           Jim unfolds it on the ground, by the light of the burning 
           Inn.

                        What is it?

                        It’s a nautical chart of some kind.

                                 JIM
                        Look.

           Jim points to the TITLE: FLINT’S ISLAND 

           Below that, scrawled in the same neat calligraphy, “bulk of 
           Treasure here.”

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. BRISTOL HARBOUR - MORNING

           One of the busiest ports in the world, in 1757 anyway. Scores 
           of ships bob at anchor. Men labor with barrels, crates, and 
           bales at the dock side as the trade of the world flows in.

           TITLE: 3 WEEKS LATER

           At the water’s edge, between the SEAWALL and the low tide, a 
           ROUGH GALLOWS has been constructed. 

           Three men are facing justice, a placard with PIRATE written 
           on it hangs about their necks. Two already hang, limp and 
           inert. The third is FENNICK, waiting his turn.  

           A crowd has drawn to watch the men hang.
           Fennick stands on a barrel. The noose tight around his neck. 

                                 FENNICK
                        Oh Jesus, forgive my wickedness!

           The HANGMAN KICKS out the barrel that was holding him up, and 
           Fennick drops. His feet ‘do the Tyburn dance’ as he chokes 
           his last. 

           Jim watches, with Livesey, his Mum and the Squire. He clearly 
           doesn’t like the spectacle. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Resquiat in Pace. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Amen. 

           Mary, pretty in a new dress, sniffs self-righteously.

                                 MARY
                        Good riddance to bad rubbish.

           The Squire hands Jim an envelope. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Jim, please deliver this to Lloyds 
                        ship insurance.  

           Jim takes the envelope, and struggles as his mum stops him 
           for a kiss. 

                                 MARY
                        Oh hush, I won’t see you for 
                        months, will I? 

                                 JIM
                        We don’t leave till the night tide, 
                        mum. 

           Jim kisses her on the cheek, and runs off. 

                                 MARY
                        He’s young for his years. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Mary, he doesn’t have to come. We 
                        can get along without him, and 
                        you’ll still get your shares.

                                 MARY
                        And what kind of a man would I be 
                        raising then? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        No, Jim will go, and represent our 
                        interests, as is proper. Just 
                        promise me you’ll bring him home. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        I’ll look after him as if he were 
                        my own. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Off he goes a boy; but he’ll come 
                        home a man; and if all goes well, a 
                        very rich one at that. 

           Mary watches him through the crowd, and can’t help but worry. 

           EXT. STREETS OF BRISTOL - DAY

           Fishmongers, butchers, tailors and haberdashers all work in 
           the awnings of their shops, crowding the narrow streets. 

           Jim stays to the edges of the street, avoiding the foulness 
           that runs down the middle, and finds himself jostled by the 
           ragmen and tradesmen that clog the fetid passageways. 

           He senses the eyes of someone watching him, but as he turns 
           around, all he finds are the watching eyes of a toothless 
           HAG, who grins at him and winks. 

           It’s creepy back here. 

           He turns around and runs into a large man. 

                                 JIM
                        Terribly sorry-

           The man is BLACK DOG - looking the worse for wear. Jim 
           recognizes him at once. 

                                 DOG
                        Not yet you’re not. 

           Dog GRABS Jim by the shoulder, only to find Jim twisting out 
           of his grasp. Jim runs away fast, Dog just a few paces back.

           Jim cuts through a narrow, nearly deserted alley, running for 
           his life. Dog’s close enough that Jim can hear him breathing. 

           Jim dodges a rag cart, and stumbles over a sleeping drunk as 
           he comes to an intersection, and turns left. Dog comes 
           tripping after him, and reaches out, fast as lightning, 
           grabbing for Jim’s jacket. 
           Jim rips his buttons off as he tears out of the jacket, Dog 
           pulls so hard, he falls back, Jim’s coat in his hands.

           Jim turns back to see Dog lying in the filth. He turns a 
           corner, thinking he’s safe: only to be KNOCKED ON HIS ASS BY 
           a heavy pallet being hoisted up to the storerooms above. 

           He cracks his head on the cobblestone streets, and in the 
           moments of being dazed, Dog stands over him. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        Ought to watch where you’re going. 

           Dog PUNCHES Jim in the face, knocking him out cold.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Jim wakes up as a BUCKET OF WATER is tossed onto his face. 
           He’s tied securely to a support beam. All around him, stacks 
           of cotton from the New World wait for processing. 

                                 DOG
                        Hung the poor buggers!

           Jim gasps for air, and struggles against the knots. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t even get to doin’ any proper 
                        piracy! 

           Dog paces back and forth in front of Jim. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        Been watchin’, I have. Seen you and 
                        your fine gentleman friends. Takin’ 
                        a voyage are you? 

                                 JIM
                        I... I work for the Squire. 

                                 DOG
                        The Island is where you’re headed, 
                        Flint’s Treasure. Say it ain’t so.

           Dog holds a dirty old knife dangerously close. 

                                 JIM
                        S’true. 

                                 DOG
                        Verified the map, have you? 
                                 JIM
                        Aye. It’s Flint’s own hand. 

                                 DOG
                        Know who Flint was, boy?

                                 JIM
                        A pirate. 

                                 DOG
                        Flint was a legend! The greatest 
                        Pirate who ever took to sea! That 
                        treasure’s the cream of twenty 
                        years plunder- empires rise and 
                        fall over fortunes such as Flint’s.

           Dog holds the knife close again. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        The Map was worth a thousand pounds 
                        to me. So, your fine gentlemen 
                        friends will have to pay that now. 

           Jim struggles, but he’s well secured. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        Can ye write? 

           Jim nods. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        Then it’s a note I’ll be needing. 
                        Any bolloxin’ about...

           Dog holds the knife down low. 

                                 DOG (CONT’D)
                        You’ll lose your little prick 
                        before you’ve ever done more than 
                        wrestle with him? Understand?

           Dog suddenly stiffens, dropping his knife. His hands reach 
           behind him. Pain and confusion play across his features. 

           Jim watches as a SWORD POINT EMERGES from his stomach, blood 
           staining his filthy white shirt. The blade twists, DOG CHOKES 
           UP A MOUTHFUL OF BILE AND BLOOD, and collapses. 

           Dog drops, revealing LONG JOHN SILVER, 50. 

           He’s a handsome man, sharp blue eyes, long blonde hair, going 
           to grey, held back in a thick pony tail. He wears a frock 
           coat, and tricorne hat. 
                                 SILVER
                        I’m guessing you’re the Master 
                        Hawkins there’s been so much 
                        trouble over. 

           Jim doesn’t know if he should say thanks, or scream for help. 
           Silver sheathes his cutlass. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Never did like backstabbing a man, 
                        but I ain’t the swashbuckler I once 
                        was. 

           He gestures down; his RIGHT LEG is gone above the knee, the 
           trouser leg tied up in a tight ball. He leans on a solid 
           crutch.

           Taking a long knife, John cuts the ropes that bind Jim.

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        John Silver’s my name. Called Long 
                        John by some, old Barbecue by 
                        others, an other things not fit for 
                        polite conversation. I’m 
                        quartermaster on the Hispaniola, 
                        hired by your friend the Squire. 
                        Thank heaven I found you lad. That 
                        poor doctor friend of yours was 
                        worried pale. ‘Ne’ermind Doc,’ says 
                        I. “If anyone knows the nooks and 
                        cranny’s of Bristol, it’s old 
                        John.”

           Jim, with his hands free, pushes off the ropes. And stares 
           down at the corpse of Dog. 

                                 JIM
                        What about him? 

                                 SILVER
                        Won’t bother no more boys and their 
                        mums; will you, ya bastard? 

           Silver kicks the body. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Givin’ honest sailors a bad name. 

           Jim looks up at Silver with curiosity in his eyes, he 
           knuckles his forehead in respect. 

                                 JIM
                        Thank you for rescuing me, sir. 
           Silver makes a show of looking behind him. 

                                 SILVER
                        “Sir?” There a Lord behind me I 
                        can’t see? Bollocks to “sir” I say. 
                        I’ve a proposal for ye; I’ll be 
                        John, and you’ll be Jim, and we’ll 
                        be fast-friends and ship-mates. 
                        Won’t it be so?

           Silver puts out a hand, and Jim shakes it.

           EXT. STREETS OF BRISTOL - NIGHT

           Jim and Silver walk the waterfront on their way to the 
           Hispaniola. Silver, on his crutch, is remarkably agile.

           Silver catches Jim staring at his missing leg. 

                                 SILVER
                        Gentle creatures, whales, until you 
                        go about harpoonin’. I was an ace 
                        harpoon-man in my youth. Could 
                        drive ‘em deep, and run ‘em long.  
                        All that blood in the water; brings 
                        in the sharks; know you what a 
                        shark is? 

                                 JIM
                        A manner of fish?

                                 SILVER
                        The worst fish in all creation! 
                        Imagine it; twice the length of a 
                        man, as big around as barrel, with 
                        a bow-end that’s all teeth- and 
                        don’t think you’ll out-swim one, 
                        no, fast as you like, from way up 
                        under they come, from the dark 
                        water-

           Jim looks doubtful.  

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Think I’m tellin’ sea stories? Come 
                        and look. 

           Silver swings over to the windows of a CURIO shop. Shrunken 
           heads, statues of idols, carved reliefs, and a set of 
           bleached SHARK JAWS. 
                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Them there came from a shark off 
                        the coast of Guinea, not a hundred 
                        leagues from where I lost my leg. 

                                 JIM
                        Think he’s the one that bit you?

                                 SILVER
                        Not near enough rotten teeth.

           Jim’s eyes are wide, distorted even wider by the warped glass 
           panes of the window. 

           EXT. BRISTOL HARBOUR - NIGHT

           A rough collection of salty WHALERS waits on the seawall. A 
           dozen in all. 

           Jim looks at the faces of the men, landing on the dark, black 
           features of ACHILLE, 47, a giant, muscular EX-SLAVE from 
           HAITI; Achille grins at him, his teeth filed to points.

           Jim backs up a step. 

                                 SILVER
                        Don’t be afraid of Achille, Jim. 
                        Who was it pulled me out the brine, 
                        saved the rest of me from bein’ a 
                        fishies lunch?

           Silver puts a protective arm around Jim. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Lads, meet our new shipmate, the 
                        famous Jim Hawkins. Jim this here’s 
                        Israel Hands. But two more fingers 
                        go, he’ll be Israel Hand. 

           ISRAEL HANDS, 44, a grizzled bastard, waves: he’s missing 
           three fingers on his right hand!

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        And this here’s Job, so named on 
                        account o’ long sufferin’.

           JOB ANDERSON, 41, boyish despite his years and permanent 
           scowl. 

                                 JOB
                        Piss off. 
           A long ROWBOAT waits at the waters edge, the sailors climbing 
           in. 

                                 SILVER
                        Jim, take the oar next to Job over 
                        there. 

           Jim clambers his way in, nearly upsetting the balance of the 
           entire thing. 

                                 JOB
                        Oi! Easy does it. Lubber are you? 

           Jim takes a seat on the bench. 

                                 JIM
                        You mean a Land-Lubber? 

           Israel laughs loudly. Silver clambers into the cox’s seat, 
           and pushes off with his crutch. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        But wait!

                                 SILVER
                        What is it, Jim? 

                                 JIM
                        I didn’t say goodbye to my mum.

           He’s greeted with GALES OF LAUGHTER!

                                 SILVER
                        Time and tide wait for no man. Or 
                        his Mum. 

           They shove off.

           EXT. BRISTOL HARBOUR - NIGHT

           They pull past the gallows, where the three PIRATES hang. 

                                 SILVER
                        Look well lads; the wages of sin, 
                        an all that. Cost of their evil 
                        ways. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Cost a gettin’ caught!

           The men all LAUGH again, but Silver shuts them up with a 
           single savage look. 
           EXT. HISPANIOLA - NIGHT

           The HISPANIOLA is a merchant cruiser, long, and sleek, her 
           sides painted a dark blue. The gilt scroll-work glitters by 
           lamp-light. A beautiful, fast and able ship. 

           The row boat sidles alongside, and Silver ties her off 
           expertly on one end. The others clamber off like monkeys, 
           scrambling up ladders and lines. 

           Jim looks at the single knotted line next to him, and the 
           fifteen feet of hull he has to climb. 

           Silver smiles, knowingly. 

                                 SILVER
                        Shoes off. 

           Jim takes his shoes off, and Silver ties the laces together 
           and hangs them around Jim’s neck. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Barefoot’s the way to be on deck. 

           Silver, his crutch attached to a lanyard, grabs the rope, and 
           hand over hand, hops up the line. 

           Jim can barely stand up in the boat without getting dumped in 
           the bay. He climbs. One difficult step after the other. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           It’s all action on deck. STORES are being lowered into the 
           main hold. Sails are being unpacked, men move in all 
           directions, and everyone seems to know where to go. 

           Jim is lost in the middle of it until the Doctor finds him. 
           He begins inspecting Jim for damage.

                                 LIVESEY
                        Thank goodness they found you, Jim. 
                        We’ve had men scouring the city. 
                        Are you hurt?

                                 JIM
                        Not that I can tell.

                                 LIVESEY
                        We’ll have just enough time for you 
                        to write a letter to your mum.
           Livesey takes Jim below, and we find the Squire and CAPTAIN 
           SMOLLET, 55. Stern, proper, and professional, he is a 
           shipmaster par excellence; and a real dick. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Have I purchased a good ship?

                                 SMOLLET
                        A fine vessel. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Have I met your every requirement 
                        for provisioning, for equipage.

                                 SMOLLET
                        To the letter, Squire-

                                 SQUIRE
                        Then why must you abuse me so over 
                        this matter of the crew? 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Who is this crew? I don’t know a 
                        one of them!

                                 SQUIRE
                        Whalers all of them, men with 
                        decades at sea, solid men; men who 
                        ask no questions.

                                 SMOLLET
                        Ask no questions?

           Smollet leans in close, whispering. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        So none of them know about your 
                        map? About the treasure? 

                                 SQUIRE
                        They know that they’re well paid, 
                        and that shares will be generous. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Bah. And you trust ‘em?

                                 SQUIRE
                        I assure you, Silver has vouched 
                        for every man-jack of them. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Prithee, Squire, tell me: who 
                        vouches for Long John Silver? 
           Silver couldn’t have overheard them, but he tips his hat to 
           the Captain from across the deck, with a warm smile. Smollet 
           shakes his head at some badly handled action on deck. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        Damn your eyes, I said store the 
                        blasted powder in the stern hold!

           O’BRIEN, 44, a big, ham-faced IRISHMAN knuckles his forehead. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Right away, Cap’n. 

           The Squire turns away in anger to follow River and Ruthie as 
           they carry a heavy trunk below decks. 

           MR. ARROW, 55, the Bosun, not too smart, not too dumb, blows 
           his PIPE among the chaos. 

                                 ARROW
                        Anchor’s away in a quarter hour! 
                        Move it, swabs, hand over hand!

           The crew continues their work efficiently and expertly. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - SUNRISE

           The Square rigged brigantine has her sails full of wind as 
           she heads south, south west, the wind at her back, and 
           England disappearing behind her in a wreath of fog.

           EXT. QUARTER DECK - MORNING

           Smollet is at the wheel, eyes scanning the sails, studying 
           the craft. Livesey and Jim watch England fading away. Silver 
           reports to the quarter deck, handing Smollet a mug of coffee. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Thank you, Mr. Silver. 

                                 SILVER
                        With your permission sir, I’d like 
                        to draft young Hawkins into 
                        service.

           Jim, who was happily watching the horizon, turns. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        By all means. Step lively Hawkins, 
                        there’s forty souls on this ship 
                        won’t be feeding themselves. 
           Jim knuckles his forehead, and disappears below decks. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Might I remind you, Captain, Jim 
                        Hawkins is a partner in this 
                        venture, not a cabin boy. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        I’ll have no favorites on my ship. 

           Smollet sips his coffee, and BELLOWS down the deck. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        Tighten up that gallant, it’s 
                        looser than a fat tart’s cunny!

           INT. GALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Tightly cramped in between the hull at the bow, is the heavy 
           iron stove. There’s a long counter, and a dozen small 
           cabinets. 

                                 SILVER
                        Worked the kitchen with your Ma, 
                        did you? 

           Jim nods. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Well, get this straight, this is no 
                        kitchen. This here, is a galley. 

                                 JIM
                        I know it. And that’s a hatch -

           Jim points to the door. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        And stairs is ladders, and ropes is 
                        lines, unless they’re fixed to 
                        sails, and then they’re sheets. 

                                 SILVER
                        Know all that do you? I’ll shut up 
                        and take my orders from you then. 

                                 JIM
                        My Dad was in the Navy. 

                                 SILVER
                        And what does he do now? 
                                 JIM
                        Nothing. I mean, he’s dead. 

           Jim gets very quiet. 

                                 SILVER
                        It’s a bitter, short life 
                        sometimes, and that’s the truth.  

                                 JIM
                        I don’t really know anything about 
                        ships, Mr. Silver. Not unless 
                        they’re in bottles anyway. This is 
                        as far as I’ve ever been from home. 

           Silver reaches down, and picks up an odd shaped package, 
           draped with an old piece of sail-cloth. 

                                 SILVER
                        Can you keep a secret?

           Jim nods. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        We has ourselves a stowaway. 

           He pulls back the cloth, revealing... A PARROT. He pulls a 
           metal LOCK-PICK from out of his hat, and with it, unlocks the 
           cage. Jim watches with surprise. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                           (re: the pick)
                        Easier than keepin’ a key. Hold out 
                        your finger like this...

           Jim holds out his pointer finger, mimicing Silver. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Now let him climb aboard. 

           The parrot clambers neatly onto Jim’s finger.

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Jim Hawkins, meet Cap’n Flint. 

           Silver smiles broadly. Jim grins. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Named after our favorite pirate.  

                                 JIM
                        Does he talk? 
                                 CAP’N FLINT
                        Bollocks to ya. Landlubber. 

           Jim and Silver laugh, the Parrot has a keen sense of timing. 

                                 SILVER
                        Poor old Cap’n Flint, been at sea 
                        for years he has, all he’s learned 
                        is bad language.  

           Silver lets Flint climb onto his finger, and sets him on his 
           shoulder, feeding him a small morsel as he does. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You’re a quick lad, I can see it 
                        clear; smart as paint, you are. 
                        Been at sea 33 years, has old Long 
                        John; if you’re willin’ to learn, 
                        I’ve a trick or two to teach. 

           Jim smiles as John stirs the thick pot of gruel on the stove. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK/HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - MORNING

           Jim is swabbing the decks with the rest of the crew. 

           TITLE: 2 WEEKS LATER

           EXT. MAIN DECK/HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - DAY

           Jim hauls on a thick sheet, one of a half dozen of the crew, 
           his face set in determination. 

           The sheet is tied off, and Silver, peeling potatoes, nods to 
           Jim in recognition of a job well done. 

                                 SILVER
                        Tell me, what names do you give the 
                        sails there on the fore mast-

           Jim points to the sails.

                                 JIM
                        There’s the fore-top’sl, the top 
                        gallants, and the fore-royal. 

                                 SILVER
                        Why ain’t we flying’ the royals?

                                 JIM
                        Too much wind, ships’ makin’ her 
                        headway, and at her ease...
                                 SILVER
                        Sea’s in your blood, Jim. You’ll be 
                        First Mate afore you turn 20, so 
                        you will. 

           Silver tousles Jim’s hair. A sudden gust heels the ship, Jim 
           stumbles. Silver stares out over the water with concern.

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - EVENING

           A STIFF GALE is blowing. The Hispaniola fords the heavy 
           troughs of each wave with a plunging crash. 

           White-water washes thick across the deck as the waves batter 
           the tiny ship. 

           At the wheel SMOLLET stands firm, grim, and steady. Livesey 
           clambers up to him, having to shout above the waves. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Captain... are we going to make it?

                                 SMOLLET
                           (harsh)
                        Prithee; let me do my work. 

           Suddenly, above them, with a sickening RIP one of the sails 
           TEARS at the yardarm. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Arrow! I’ll have a working 
                        Main’sl or none at all!

           The crew, are standing by, clinging to safety lines. 

                                 ARROW
                        ‘awkins, ‘Arry - up you go: punch 
                        in the main... 

           HARRY PERKINS, 17, and already 3 years at sea, flips into the 
           rigging fast as a cat. Jim hesitates. 

                                 ARROW (CONT’D)
                        Come on, son, we don’t have all 
                        blinkin’ day-

           Jim fights back his fear, and steps to the rigging ladder. 
           The ship is rolling and bucking as he climbs into the ropes.

                                 LIVESEY
                           (drowned out by the storm)
                        Jim NO!
           One moment he’s hanging over the sea, the next he’s flung 
           over, looking down at the deck as she heels to and fro. A 
           line SNAPS with the strain; a loud CRACK and a sudden 
           WHIPLASH of rope and wood crashes through the rigging!

           The main yard is forty feet over the deck, and every step up 
           makes the wild gyrations of the ship feel worse. 

           Silver emerges at the hatch, and watches. Harry’s already out 
           on the yard arm, but nothing can happen until Jim moves. 

                                 HARRY
                        Come on, Jim!

           Up in the rigging. Jim freezes. He locks his arms through the 
           ladder, and hangs on tight, eyes closed. 

                                 ARROW
                        ‘urry up ‘awkins!

           Silver, despite the rolling deck, swings into action. He 
           pulls himself into the rigging. In seconds he’s up with Jim. 

                                 SILVER
                        Hold fast, Jim, hold fast. 

           He clambers OVER Jim and out onto the spar. Silver shimmies 
           out onto the main yard. Jim watches; ashamed. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Haul away Mr. Arrow. 

           The crew pulls on the halyard, and the mainsail creeps up. 
           Silver and Harry gather the cloth, and punch it into folds. 

           The sail comes up, one slim fold at a time.Silver shimmy’s 
           back to the rigging, where Jim is still waiting. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Never you mind, Jim. Never you 
                        mind, come on back down. 

           Silver and Jim make their way back down together.

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - MORNING

           The wind blows still, but less ferociously, and the waves 
           that buffet the bow no longer wash over the decks. 
           INT. LIVESEY’S CABIN - MORNING

           Livesey has two FOILS, light, training swords on his bunk, 
           and is digging through his trunk when Jim comes in. 

                                 JIM
                        Doctor, you asked to see me? 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Jim, yesterday’s incident-

                                 JIM
                        When I turned yellow?

                                 LIVESEY
                        Turned yellow? 

                                 JIM
                        That’s what the crew says.

                                 LIVESEY
                        Mr. Arrow was foolish to order you 
                        up into the rigging. You don’t have 
                        the experience. 

                                 JIM
                        Thank you for saying so, Doctor, 
                        but... 

                                 LIVESEY
                        I made your mother a promise. A 
                        promise I intend to keep.  

           Livesey tosses Jim a foil. He catches it, awkwardly. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - DAY

           Livesey and Jim practice the basic forms of fencing. Silver 
           looks on, approvingly, as he peels potatoes. Cap’t Flint 
           paces around, BWAAAACKING, and swearing a blue streak. 

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - DAY

           Jim, with a ‘Brown Bess’ musket, goes through the drills of 
           reloading a black powder gun. Jim bites off the cartridge, 
           pours the powder down the barrel, slips in the ball, and rams 
           it all home. 

                                 RUTHIE
                        Hurry, son, but never rush.
           He primes the pan, cocks, aims, and FIRES off the back of the 
           ship at a barrel being trailed 50 yards away. He MISSES.

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           Harry and Jim wait on deck, each on one side of the boat, 
           hand on the rigging ladder. 

           Silver drops his hat, and both lads begin to RACE EACH OTHER 
           up the ladder. 

           Harry’s moving faster, but Jim’s pouring it on. The crew 
           SHOUTS and CHEERS the boys along. 

           EXT. CROW’S NEST - DAY

           Harry reaches the crows nest first, Jim heaving himself up a 
           few beats after. 

                                 HARRY
                        Better luck next time, Hawkins. 

           Jim pants, but smiles through it. The view is STAGGERING, 
           nothing but blue sea in every direction. 

           EXT. FOREDECK - DAY

           River and Jim are wrestling. River tosses Jim off his hip, 
           and down onto the hard deck. 

           Jim SLAMS his hand down onto the wood in frustration. River 
           offers him a hand up, but Jim just lies there, sulking. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - EVENING

           A jaw-dropping sunset guides them west, but Jim and Livesey 
           are locked into a demo-duel. Jim’s competent, but Livesey 
           disarms him, sending the blade skittering across the deck. 

                                 JIM
                        Bloody hell.  

                                 LIVESEY
                        Mind your language, Jim. 

                                 JIM
                        I’m terrible. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Wrong. You’re improving. 
           Jim goes to fetch his sword. 

                                 JIM
                           (under his breath)
                        Bollocks. 

           Livesey swats him across the ass with the edge of the foil. 
           Jim leaps in pain. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        You can learn to be a sailor, but 
                        you’ll speak like a gentleman. 

           Silver watches it all thoughtfully.

           INT. GALLEY - NIGHT

           Jim is chopping up potatoes, and dumping them into a pot. 
           Silver tastes his stew with a finger tip. 

                                 SILVER
                        You’ve gone all quiet. 

                                 JIM
                        He’s not my father. 

                                 SILVER
                        Who? 

                                 JIM
                        You saw what he did. 

                                 SILVER
                        You have been gettin’ a bit salty.

           The parrot eyes Silver evilly; BWAAAAACK!

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        He’s a good man, that Doctor. Kind, 
                        well-meanin’, ever so clever; but 
                        he ain’t really like us, is he? 

                                 JIM
                        Like us? 

                                 SILVER
                        Workin’ men. Nothin’ wrong with it, 
                        s’world we live in, there’s such as 
                        ‘im, and such as us.

           Jim slides his potatoes into the pot, and wipes the sweat 
           away. 
                                 JIM
                        Workin’ men. 

           EXT. QUARTER DECK - DAY

           Jim rams the ball, stows the ramrod, cocks, aims, and FIRES!

           The barrel is HIT with a satisfying THWACK! An enthusiastic 
           pat on the back from Ruthie nearly knocks Jim overboard. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - AFTERNOON

           The crew’s gathered as Jim and Harry prep for another race. 
           Silver pushes himself up to standing. Reaching out with his 
           free hand, he holds his hat out, bowl up. 

                                 SILVER
                        I’ve a gold sovereign that says Jim 
                        beats him outright. 

           It’s the 1757 version of laying down a hundred. Israel Hands 
           flips a SOVEREIGN neatly into the upturned hat. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Got yourself a wager. 

           Israel looks at Harry, threateningly. 

                                 ISRAEL (CONT’D)
                        Balls it up, and I’ll thump ya.  

           Silver just WINKS at Jim, taking the two sovereigns in hand. 
           Silver looks at the boys-

                                 SILVER
                        Ready lads? 

           Harry and Jim exchange a glare before they nod. Silver 
           slashes his hat down - and it’s on! 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Go!

           The boys climb fast. Both of them are off like rabbits, and 
           crew begins to cheer. 

           Smollet, keeps one hand on the wheel, an eye on the race. The 
           Squire and River smoke their pipes, eyes fixed on the climb. 

           It’s neck and neck in the rigging. Jim climbs fearlessly, and 
           at the first collar, both lads are eye to eye. Harry makes a 
           misstep. He darts across the collar and tugs Jim’s ankle. 
           Jim drops, catching himself three rungs down. He FREEZES. 

           Harry climbs up past him, on the same rigging now. Jim STEELS 
           HIMSELF! He starts climbing, even faster, and grabs Harry at 
           the ankle, and buying himself a rung. 

           Above, in the CROWS NEST, Job Anderson is waiting. 

                                 JOB
                        Come on!

           Jim speeds up, gaining on Harry. As the ladder gets narrower, 
           they’re running out of room to share. 

           Jim’s moving faster than Harry, passing him. He stalls when 
           Harry grabs his belt. 

           Jim holds on tight this time, but Harry climbs him, stepping 
           on Jim’s shoulder to take the victory. 

           Israel Hands takes the two sovereigns with relish. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        A fool and his money, Silver. 

           Cap’n Flint’s beady eye catches Israel in his gloating. 

                                 CAP’N FLINT
                        Up yer arse. 

           The crew are still LAUGHING when Mr. Arrow comes up from 
           below decks. 

                                 ARROW
                        Alright you lot!... Back to 
                        bleedin’ work. 

           The crew all grumble, but they go back to their places. 

           Up in the rigging, Job Anderson is climbing back down. 

                                 JOB
                        Take my watch. I need a piss. 

           Jim clambers to the nest. He’s tanned, and carrying some 
           muscle. Hard to believe it’s the same boy who left Bristol.

           EXT. FORE-DECK - DAY

           Jim coils a rope expertly, twisting each rotation, and making 
           the rope lie flat, and cinching the whole coil up quickly, 
           hanging the lot from a cleat on the foremast. 
           Silver smokes his pipe and watches with satisfaction. 

                                 SILVER
                        A place for everything, and -

                                 JIM
                        Everything in its place. John, you 
                        shouldn’t have bet on me. 

                                 SILVER
                        Bet? I didn’t bet on you. 

                                 JIM
                        You lost a sovereign-

                                 SILVER
                        No. I paid for your lesson. 

                                 JIM
                        What, that I can’t beat Harry? 
                        Coulda told you that for free. 

                                 SILVER
                        Long John’s Rules of Life. Number 
                        2: There ain’t no such thing as 
                        fair. Weren’t fair that your daddy 
                        died. Weren’t fair when I put my 
                        cutlass through Black Dog’s back-

                                 JIM
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 SILVER
                        Harry knew that if he lost, he’d 
                        catch a wallopin’ from Issy.  

                                 JIM
                        So he cheated- 

                                 SILVER
                        He won. There will come a time when 
                        it’s your life; the lives of your 
                        friends, your shipmates, luffin’ in 
                        the breeze; will you do what has to 
                        be done to win? Because that’s rule 
                        number 1, boyo; survive.  

           Israel and Achille approach. Israel looks up to the rigging.

                                 ISRAEL
                        That’s a sloppy excuse for a batten 
                        on the top gallant, Mr. ‘awkins. 
                                 JIM
                        Sir? 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Well? It won’t fix itself.

                                 JIM
                        Aye aye. 

           And, fast as a monkey, Jim’s scaling the rigging. 

                                 SILVER
                        Weather’s getting warm, eh lads, 
                        warm and wet...

           Hands looks back towards the Quarter Deck, where only the 
           Squire and Livesey can be seen. Israel leans down close. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Time for a meetin’.

                                 SILVER
                        Israel-

                                 ACHILLE
                        Tonight.

           Israel walks forward, bellowing up at Jim. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        You’ll have that creased and ‘anked 
                        away or I’ll know the reason why!

           INT. MAIN HOLD/HISPANIOLA - NIGHT

           It’s where the stores are kept, stacks of crates, and large, 
           iron-banded hogs-head barrels. 

           Jim enters the dark hold, and lights up one of the lanterns. 

           He clambers up and peers down into one of the tall, wide 
           barrels. Down, at the very bottom, sloshing in a few inches 
           of salt water, are the last of the apples. 

           To get to them, Jim has to lower himself into the barrel. 

           He’s ankle deep in water, fishing the apples up, when he 
           hears the DEEP VOICES of Israel Hands, and Tom O’Brien. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Trust the nose, Issy, two things it 
                        always knows, land and a tasty 
                        piece of crumpet. 
           Jim hesitates in the barrel as O’Brien and Hands walk into 
           the hold. Job and Achille join them. 

                                 JOB
                        Your nose couldn’t tell a girl from 
                        a sheep’s arse.

                                 O'BRIEN
                        In Killkenny, s’true, we’re partial 
                        to both; but we knows our girls 
                        from our girls, and our men from 
                        our men. 

           O’Brien lets the barb sink in, and we notice, that Job is in 
           fact a WOMAN, living as a man. (script refers to Job as HE 
           for duration)

           Job draws a dirk from his belt. 

                                 JOB
                        A quick flick of the wrist, and you 
                        can be a girl too.

                                 O'BRIEN
                        You’ll need a bigger knife than 
                        that. More of a sawin’ motion.

           O’Brien mimics a broad sawing motion, like cutting a tree!

                                 ISRAEL
                        ‘ardly. 

           The THUMP-step of Silver on his crutch announces his arrival.  

                                 SILVER
                        Achi’, keep a sharp ear.

                                 JOB
                        It’s time, Silver. 

                                 SILVER
                        Time for what?

                                 ISRAEL
                        We’re sick of all this. Bosun’s 
                        pipes, knucklin’ our fore’heads 
                        like a pack a simple seamen-

                                 JOB
                        The map’s on the ship, John. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Flint would ‘ave taken the ship. 
                                 ISRAEL
                        Throw the buggers overboard, I 
                        says.

           It’s MUTINY. Jim draws back from his peep-hole and tries to 
           think. 

                                 SILVER
                        Throw them overboard should we, 
                        Israel? And pray tell me then, how 
                        do we find the cursed island? Can 
                        you read the sun by sextant, and 
                        can you, by clock and compass, plot 
                        the charts? I can’t. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        We’re close-

                                 SILVER
                        Tommy O’Brien’s nose tell you so? 

           Silver spits on the deck at Hand’s feet in disgust. He stares 
           down O’Brien as well.

           Achille, at the hatchway, suddenly HISSES. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Attendez!

           Everyone shuts up, as footsteps get louder. MR. ARROW walks 
           in, lantern in hand, followed by young HARRY. 

                                 ARROW
                        Well, well, what ‘ave we ‘ere? 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Piss off, Arrow, crew business.

                                 ARROW
                        I know what you’re after. The gold. 
                        Whalers you say? Bollocks, you’ve 
                        sailed together before, but it 
                        wasn’t no whales you was ‘untin’.  
                        Tell me I’m wrong. Well, not one of 
                        you will see the sparkly stuff, 
                        will ya? ‘Arry, fetch the Captain.  

                                 SILVER
                        Harry, stay right where you are.

           Harry steps back away from Arrow. 

                                 ARROW
                        I’m not afraid of you, Silver. 
           Arrow is backing up for the door, but Achille cuts him off. 
           Jim watches as Silver slowly, silently draws his blade.

                                 SILVER
                        Fear isn’t a weakness. It’s an 
                        instinct men develop to keep 
                        themselves alive. 

           One hand on the beams above, Silver crosses the hold in a 
           swing, lands on his good foot, driving the blade into Mr. 
           Arrows guts!

           Riding him to the deck, John stabs him over and over again. 
           He cups his hand over Arrow’s mouth, stifling his screams. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You know where I learned my trade.

           Silver watches the life going out of his eyes. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        An’ who I learned it from. 

           By the lamplight, Silver is suddenly terrifying, cold and 
           cruel. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You needn’t think on our plans, as 
                        I’ve reasoned every particular. We 
                        play this charade until the last 
                        moment - till this ship’s loaded 
                        with gold, and a day from port if I 
                        have my way. 

           The other’s don’t like it, but John’s made his case.

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Now then, Harry, how about you and 
                        I have a little chin-wag?

           Jim watches as Job and O’Brien wrap Arrow in a sail cloth, 
           Hands going ahead as look out. They lift the corpse and walk 
           it out, Achille slipping behind them. Silver takes a seat, 
           leaning against the apple barrel. 

           All Silver’s rage dies, all his anger, the exertion of 
           killing a man. Gone. A perfect transformation to his 
           charming, kind self. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Have a seat, m’boy, and tell me 
                        what you know. 

           Harry sits on a crate opposite Silver. 
                                 HARRY
                        I know you was Quartermaster on 
                        Flint’s old ship, The Walrus. 

                                 SILVER
                        The Walrus. What a ship, and you 
                        never saw such a crew. That’s where 
                        I lost me old leg. We took a 
                        broadside from a Spanish Man’O War. 
                        Chain shot it was; Tore across the 
                        deck, splintered the foremast, and 
                        caught me at my gun. Our surgeon, 
                        was killed by a mortar, so the 
                        ships carpenter did the honors for 
                        Long John. Sawed it through; as if 
                        it were a broken spar. 

           John’s tale is utterly convincing.

                                 HARRY
                        So it’s true. 

                                 SILVER
                        You’re a smart lad, Harry, I seen 
                        it as soon as I laid eyes on you. 
                        “Smart as paint” I said to myself.

           Jim scowls as he hears Silver’s false-flattery repeated. 

                                 HARRY
                        What will become of the others? 

           Silver nods heavily. 

                                 SILVER
                        I’ll not tell a lie; it’s a bloody 
                        death for them; a bleedin’ fortune 
                        for us. What say, ye, Harry? 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m for fortune, Cap’n Silver. 

                                 SILVER
                        Cap’n is it? Well, then, Harry, 
                        fetch us an apple, killin’s a 
                        thirsty business.

           Jim’s trapped in the barrel. He’ll be caught for sure. 

           Harry stands and takes out a small flask. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’ve a taste of Brandy, if you’ll 
                        share it with me. 
                                 SILVER
                        With gratitude. 

           Silver tilts back the flask, and hands it back to Harry. 

           Harry takes Silver’s hand, and helps him to his feet. Silver 
           lumbers out of the hold, blowing out the lantern as he goes. 

           Jim, now in almost perfect darkness, waits as the thump-step, 
           thump-step of Silver’s crutch fades away. 

           Jim wants to SCREAM, instead, he PUNCHES the thick oak of the 
           barrel until his knuckles bleed.

           INT. SMOLLET’S CABIN - MORNING

           Smollet, the Squire, the Doctor and Jim are gathered in the 
           cramped cabin. Jim’s just dropped the bombshell, and its 
           impact on the three adults is enormous. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Thank God Hawkins fancied an apple 
                        last night.

                                 LIVESEY
                        The question is; what do we do 
                        next?

                                 SMOLLET
                        Once we sight land, I’ll give the 
                        men a day off on shore. We’ll even 
                        the odds, and take the ship. 

           The Squire and Livesey nod. 

           There’s a KNOCK at the cabin door. Smollet points Jim into 
           the corner, and Livesey steps between him, pulling the Squire 
           over to block the boys presence. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        Come in. 

           Israel Hands enters, knuckle to his forehead. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Beg pardon, Cap’n. Mr. Arrow’s gone 
                        missin’ sir. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Missing? Explain yourself.
                                 ISRAEL
                        We’ve searched every hold and 
                        berth, he’s gone sir. 

           Smollet makes a show of concern. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Pipe to assembly, Mr. Hands.

           Hands salutes before leaving. Smollet looks sternly at the 
           others. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        Acting’s the game now, gentlemen, 
                        we shall play the fools. Know this, 
                        the performance is for your lives. 

           Jim, Livesey and the Squire each exchange a worried look. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK/HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - MORNING

           The whole crew is gathered in a loose square on deck. 
           Smollet, Livesey and the Squire up on the Quarter deck. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Who was on watch last night? 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Me. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        And? 

                                 ACHILLE
                        I never saw him. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Who did see Mr. Arrow last night? 

           Job raises his hand. 

                                 JOB
                        I saw him just after nine bells, 
                        sir-

                                 SMOLLET
                        His condition? 

           Silence from the crew. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        There’s no secrets on a small crew, 
                        I know Mr. Arrow liked his drink.
                                 SILVER
                        It’s bad luck, speakin’ ill of the 
                        dead, sir. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        It’s no ill to speak the truth. 

                                 O'BRIEN
                        He’s been workin’ that grog barrel 
                        as hard as ever did us; to be sure. 

           Jim is boiling with anger, the smoothness of the lies, the 
           ease of the evil...

                                 SMOLLET
                        There’s a lesson here. A nip or 
                        two’s every sailors right. But I 
                        won’t tolerate drunkenness-

           From up in the crows nest, HARRY calls down. 

                                 HARRY
                        LAND-HO!

           The crew rushes to the gunwales and peers out to the horizon; 
           the interruption in the line of the horizon is clear. 

                                 SMOLLET
                           (to Livesey)
                        We’re out of time. 

           EXT. TREASURE ISLAND - DAY

           The island rises from the sea like the hump of giant sea 
           creature, frozen in place, and overgrown with a thick forest 
           of green. The heights are clouded with the mists of morning. 

           From a distance, you can make out cliffs, streams and a 
           churning water fall. Paradise. 

           The Hispaniola is just coming to a slow gliding stop, anchor 
           dropping into the turquoise blue waters of a lee shore.

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           The crew know their business, the last few yards of sail have 
           been rolled up, and there’s a palpable excitement in the air.

           Not for Jim. He’s staring out to sea. Livesey approaches, and 
           leans onto the gunwale next to him. 
                                 LIVESEY
                        Jim? 

           Livesey can see the tears in the young mans eyes. 

                                 LIVESEY (CONT’D)
                        Jim, you heard the captain. 
                        Everything depends on us putting on 
                        a good show...

                                 JIM
                        I thought he was my friend. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Who?

                                 JIM
                        Silver. John. I thought...

           Jim wipes away the tears. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Oh Jim.

                                 JIM
                           (trying his best)
                        Don’t worry Doctor, I know what I 
                        have to do. 

           The pipe calls the crew to attention. Jim joins the crew at 
           attention. Smollet takes his place on the quarter-deck. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        I’m proud of you men. It was a long 
                        sail, a hard trip. You have earned 
                        a day off. A full cask of rum, 
                        provisions, a night ashore; no 
                        other work for the next 24 hours. 

           The men CHEER. Simple fools. Only Silver sees the meaning in 
           it. They break up, unshipping the jolly boats. 

           He slides up next to Israel and Achille. 

                                 SILVER
                        Think they smells it? 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Can’t tell. 

                                 SILVER
                        Puttin’ off the crew. I don’t like 
                        it. 
                                 ACHILLE
                        There’s four men below, ready to 
                        take the magazine.

                                 ISRAEL
                        Shall we do it now?

           Silver thinks, eyes scanning the deck, until they find Jim.  

                                 SILVER
                        I’ll take Hawkins with me to the 
                        Island. He won’t be able to lie to 
                        old John. You’ll stay here, Issy. 
                        If they knows, I’ll fire off a 
                        pistol, that’ll be your signal to 
                        take the ship. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        An if they don’t? 

                                 SILVER
                        Why, we play along until this here 
                        ships loaded to bursting with gold. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        I say we go now. 

                                 SILVER
                        And I says we don’t. 

           Achille and Silver lock eyes, Silver wins the battle of will.

                                 ISRAEL
                        Sailing awful close on this, John. 

                                 SILVER
                        Right into the wind. 

           Silver sees Jim walking his way and puts his kind face on 
           again.

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Jim lad, I bet you can’t wait to 
                        get your dogs on land again. 

                                 JIM
                        Doctor asked me to help him with 
                        his... his...

           The Doctor comes up, just as Silver guides Jim to the side. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Mr. Silver, I... I must protest-
                                 SILVER
                        You’d not keep a young lad from 
                        explorin’ and swimmin’ and a night 
                        ashore; why Doctor, it’s not 
                        Christian! Lad that age...

           Livesey sees the looks from Hands, Achille, O’Brien and 
           Anderson. He senses the challenge. So does Jim.

                                 JIM
                        Please Doctor? 

           Livesey looks down at Jim, the question clear in his face. 
           Jim nods; he knows exactly what he’s doing. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Don’t see how I can say no. 

                                 SILVER
                        That’s good of you Doctor. 

                                 LIVESEY
                           (double meaning)
                        You won’t let any harm come to him, 
                        will you, Mr. Silver?

                                 SILVER
                        Safe as houses.  

           Livesey and Jim lock eyes as Jim goes over the side and down 
           to the jolly boat. 

           INT. SMOLLET’S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie and the Squire are prepping supplies. Muskets, 
           pistols, swords, knives...

           Smollet slams his hand on his desk. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Why the hell did that fool boy get 
                        in the boat?

                                 LIVESEY
                        To give the rest of us a chance. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Then I say we take that chance.

                                 SQUIRE
                        And leave the boy in their hands?
                                 LIVESEY
                        Never. 

           Livesey takes out FLINT’s MAP, spreading it across the desk. 
           He points to the bay as represented on the map. 

                                 LIVESEY (CONT’D)
                        We take the launch- make for the 
                        stockade and dig in. We trade Jim 
                        for the map. Agreed? 

           The other’s nod, and Smollet hands the map to Livesey. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        We’ll be trapped on the island. 

           Smollet takes his remaining charts, and starts making some 
           notations. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        The ship’s in irons, on a lee 
                        shore.

           Smollet writes nautical directions with charcoal on the beam 
           over the desk. He then sweeps all the charts off the desk and 
           into a weighted bag. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Speak English, sir! 

                                 SMOLLET
                        They’ll be trapped ‘ere too.  

           Smollet throws the bag out the window, and watches it sink. 

                                 SMOLLET (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your Indian? 

                                 RUTHIE
                        Don’t you worry about Two Rivers, 
                        Cap’n, he’s where he likes to be; 
                        behind enemy lines. 

           Ruthie cocks his musket, and kneels by the doorway. 

           EXT. JOLLY-BOATS (ROWING TO SHORE) - CONTINUOUS

           Jim looks to the shore, where gentle waves lap a white beach. 
           The men row smoothly, and the long jolly eats the distance 
           easily in these calm seas. 
           Silver rows in the first seat, Jim at the rudder. The other 
           boat is no more than 20 feet to the left, and keeping pace a 
           a boat-length back, JOB ANDERSON as cox.  

                                 SILVER
                        We’ll hunt down a goat, or maybe a 
                        hog and roast him over a fire. 

           Jim is careful, he judges the distance to shore, and fixes 
           Silver with a frosty glare. 

                                 JIM
                        How’d you lose the leg, John?

                                 SILVER
                        I told you Jim, a shark-

                                 JIM
                        Not from a Spanish broadside? 

           Silver makes the sudden connection. Before he can react, JIM 
           SLAMS THE RUDDER OVER. 

           The Boat, over-loaded with men as it is, HEELS HARD OVER. Jim 
           pulls, CAPSIZING the boat in the shallow water! 

           JIM SWIMS under the water, comes up in the shallows and runs.

           JOB sees Jim go, and DRAWS A PISTOL: He AIMS...

           Silver surfaces, and waves his arms-

                                 SILVER
                        NO!

           Job FIRES the pistol at JIM as he runs through the shallow 
           water and soft sand. The BULLET ZIPS OVER HIS SHOULDER. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           The sound of the shot rolls faintly across the calm waters. 
           Israel turns to O’Brien. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        There it is. You know what to do. 

           O’Brien nods and draws his two heavy pistols. 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           All of Job’s crew draw their weapons and splash through the 
           shallow water, CHASING JIM up the beach.
           Jim looks back once, and RUNS for the thick, green jungle 
           that grows thick as a curtain at the beach’s edge. 

           Half a dozen more SNAP SHOTS whizz past Jim, one CRACKING 
           into the tree right in front of him. 

           Jim runs into the jungle; gunshots and MUTINEERS following. 

           INT. HISPANIOLA LONG PASSAGE - DAY

           River, his gunstock-axe in one hand, a long blade in the 
           other, waits as THREE ARMED MUTINEERS pass him. He steps out 
           behind them, and makes a BIRD CALL. 

           As they turn, he GOES TO WORK!

           It’s almost a fair fight. Almost. River tears into them, 
           blocking, hacking, tripping, slashing, and cutting. 

           From the MAGAZINE (a small room for powder and guns) off the 
           main passageway, Israel hears the commotion. He see’s River 
           RIPPING HIS GUYS UP!

           INT. MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS

           Israel knocks the lid off of a red-painted crate, and reveals 
           GRENADES. In these days, it was a heavy metal ball, with a 
           wick sticking out the top, “spy vs spy” style. 

           He grabs one, lights the wick, and tosses the GRENADE!

           INT. HISPANIOLA, MAIN PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS

           River drives the spike of his axe deep into a sailor’s chest 
           when the grenade lands, fuse HISSING! 

           He dives away - TOO LATE - the BOMB EXPLODES. The explosion’s 
           MASSIVE: fire and smoke fill the narrow passage - 

           The smoke clears, River lies still, eyes shut; presumed DEAD. 

           INT. PASSAGEWAY/HISPANIOLA - DAY

           A MUTINEER approaches the Captain’s cabin, pistol up. He 
           never sees the bullet as Ruthie BLASTS HIM OFF HIS FEET!

           The narrow passage FILLS with smoke from the shot. 

           O’Brien, GILLIE and COYLE (2 young sailors), are waiting 
           around the corner.
                                 O'BRIEN
                        While he reloads-

                                 COYLE
                        Why us?

           O’Brien sticks a pistol in each of their faces, prompting 
           them to ATTACK! 

           Gillie and Coyle each push into the cloud of thick smoke, and 
           CHARGE towards the cabin. 

           Ruthie KILLS Coyle with a snap-shot. Gillie charges in at him 
           sword already swinging. 

           Ruthie blocks the sword: teeth fly as the stock SHATTERS 
           Gillie’s jaw. Sensing O’Brien, he uses Gillie as a shield. 
           Both his shots hit Gillie-

           O’Brien ducks back as Israel approaches from behind. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        What happened? 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        What does it bleedin’ look like? 

           A trail of bodies fills the corridor. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Right tools, for the right job. 

           Israel lobs a Grenade INTO SMOLLET’S CABIN. 

           INT. SMOLLET’S CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie sees the heavy Grenade land. Livesey is at the window, 
           lowering supplies down to the launch. He drops his musket, 
           and TACKLES LIVESEY out the window - 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA/AFT - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie and the Doctor are wrapped together, flying out the 
           window a SPLIT SECOND before the entire cabin EXPLODES! 

           The windows SHATTER, and smoke PLUMES out of the wide 
           windows. In the launch below, Smollet and the Squire DUCK as 
           they’re covered in debris. 

           Ruthie and Livesey SPLASH DOWN into the water.
           EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

           Jim sprints down a narrow pig-run through low bushes and 
           scrub - voices all around him from the pursuing pirates. 

           He dashes around a fallen tree, and then doubles back, HIDING 
           under the fallen log. 

           As he tries to calm his breathing, FOUR MUTINEERS run past.

           One walks over to where Jim is hiding. He stops just inches 
           away from the log. Jim hardly dares to breathe. 

           A long beat passes, and next to Jim’s head, a stream of piss 
           comes from above. Jim doesn’t dare move as the pool of 
           stinking urine inches towards him. 

           The Mutineer runs off after his fellows, even as piss soaks 
           Jim’s hair.

           Second pass, and the crashing pursuit turns to silence. Jim 
           cautiously slips out from cover, and starts, quietly heading 
           off on another angle. 

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Silver, soaked to the bone, gathers the Mutineers around him. 

                                 SILVER
                        Bring me Jim Hawkins. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        I go. 

                                 SILVER
                        Alive, Achi’, alive. 

           With that, Achille strips off his shirt to reveal a CICATRIX 
           of past whip-marks across his muscled back. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA/AFT - CONTINUOUS

           Livesey, Ruthie Smollet and the Squire, are rowing away. From 
           the Quarter Deck, we hear the BIRD CALL AGAIN, Ruthie and the 
           Squire look up, and watch as RIVER dives off the rail. 

           He swims out towards them, and lets himself be hauled aboard. 

           He’s got a nasty piece of SHRAPNEL in his shoulder. 
                                 SMOLLET
                        It’s not over yet, row! Row for 
                        your blasted lives. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

           Shouts from the others can be heard at a distance, but Jim 
           keeps moving, slowly, carefully, until he hears a TWIG BREAK 
           not 15 feet away. 

           It’s Harry. He’s got a pistol aimed at Jim - he can’t miss. 

           Harry checks over his shoulders, aims well HIGH and fires. 

                                 HARRY
                           (whispered)
                        Run ya daft git, run.  

           Jim bolts. Not a second too soon, as JOB comes running up. 

                                 JOB
                        Did you get him?

                                 HARRY
                        I bloody missed!

           Job SPRINTS after Jim. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT ANCHOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Israel and O’Brien push the big, brass cannon back towards 
           the quarter deck. 

           A ramp lays on the stairs, but they strain to get the 500lb 
           cannon up, each second buying the launch precious time. 

           EXT. LAUNCH/ROWING - CONTINUOUS

           The pace is slow and steady, the Hispaniola isn’t more than a 
           hundred yards away: the cannon can shoot ten times that!

           EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

           Job is tracking Jim. He passes the broken branches that mark 
           Jim’s passing, and finds a wet footprint high on a rock. 

           Stalking further, Job approaches a fast-running stream. A 
           muddy footprint at the bank is a dead give away, and Job 
           looks to the nearby stones for a crossing. 
           JIM LEAPS OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE! He lowers his shoulder, 
           slamming Job into the water, and takes three leaping steps on 
           the rocks to cross the river. 

           The water is cold and deep. But Job’s on his feet, and aiming 
           his pistol in a few short seconds. 

           Jim’s less than a dozen feet away. Job aims. There’s only the 
           hollow click of a flintlock on wet powder. 

                                 JOB
                        Damn it!

           Jim doesn’t stop running. 

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           O’Brien and Israel, sweating and swearing, push the cannon 
           into position. 

           EXT. CLIFF FACE - CONTINUOUS

           Jim has reached the end of the line. The waterfall to one 
           side, a high cliff face to the other. It’s a long, nearly 
           vertical climb to the top. 

           He looks for a hiding place but there’s nothing. 

           Achille emerges from the jungle; Jim starts to climb.  

           The first 30 feet happen before he even knows it. He makes a 
           difficult scramble, and then heaves up and over another 
           obstacle before chancing a look back, and down to Achille. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Come down, no one will hurt you. 

           Job Anderson has snuck up, and standing just a few feet 
           behind Achille, he raises the gun. Achille senses the 
           movement, and slaps the gun just as he fires. 

           The bullet goes wide, cracking off rocks a few feet from Jim. 

                                 ACHILLE (CONT’D)
                        Silver wants him alive-

                                 JOB
                        That boy’ll be the ruin of us.

           Jim worms his way into a crevice, shimmying further up. 

           Achille puts a protective arm around Job. 
                                 ACHILLE
                           (whispers)
                        Let Silver play his games; we play 
                        ours. 

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - AFTERNOON

           O’Brien staggers back to the cannon, and rams a silk bag of 
           powder down the barrel, and then loads a cannon ball. He rams 
           that home, while Israel adjusts the elevation.

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Clear and ready. 

           Israel pushes a thin spike through the touch hole, and then 
           pushes a lit match cord through the hole. 

           The CANNON BELCHES FIRE, and a shot roars out - the Cannon 
           rockets backwards, right over O’BRIEN’s FOOT. 

                                 O'BRIEN
                        JAYSUS!

           EXT. LAUNCH/ROWING - CONTINUOUS

           The BALL hits the water, 15 feet behind them, right on the 
           line. The SPLASH goes 40 ft up, soaking the men in the boat!

                                 SMOLLET
                        That was his cold shot...next one 
                        will be closer. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Damn fine gunnery. 

           EXT. CLIFF FACE - CONTINUOUS

           The rolling BOOM of the cannon shot is clear, even up here. 
           Jim hazards a glimpse out at the bay. He can see the small 
           boat rowing away, and the cloud of white smoke at the stern. 

           A hundred feet down, he can still see Achille. 

           Jim has to lever himself out and onto the cliff face. He 
           finds a hand hold, clings tight, and searches for a foothold. 

           He weights the foot, and is transitioning over, when the 
           FOOTHOLD GIVES WAY. 

           He FALLS THROUGH SPACE. For a long second, it’s all over. 
           His hands reach out, and find a thin ledge. He CRIES OUT IN 
           PAIN as his fingers take his full weight in a sudden shock, 
           his body SLAMS into the rock face. 

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - AFTERNOON

           Israel is packing his own powder and shot now. O’Brien is 
           leaning against the wheel, his foot a swollen mess.

                                 O'BRIEN
                        It’s broken. Every blasted bone.

                                 ISRAEL
                        Who’s fault is that? 

                                 O'BRIEN
                        The gunner who didn’t secure the 
                        goddamned gun? 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Or maybe the pillock who said he 
                        was clear when he wasn’t. 

                                 O'BRIEN
                        So it’s my fault is it? 

           Israel levers the gun up with a long spar, and places the 
           wedge, and lowers the gun back down. 

                                 ISRAEL
                           (sarcastic)
                        Clear?

           Israel touches the match to the hole; the cannon BARKS again. 

           EXT. LAUNCH/ROWING - CONTINUOUS

           The ball arcs in on a low, flat trajectory. It cuts the air 
           with the sound of ripping fabric...

           It lands not four feet from the bow, almost upsetting the 
           small boat. The wave sloshes all four men. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Damned fine gunnery!

           They really start to pull now.
           EXT. CLIFF FACE - CONTINUOUS

           Jim’s feet scramble for a hold. His fingers are slipping... 
           his other hand searches... finally finding a good grip! He 
           latches on; pulling as hard as he can. He starts to climb and 
           climb FAST.

           EXT. FOOT OF THE CLIFF FACE - CONTINUOUS

           Silver nimbly works his way over to Achille and Job. They 
           release hands at his approach, does he notice? 

                                 SILVER
                        What part of ‘alive’ was so hard to 
                        understand? 

           Achille points up to Jim, now a small figure high, high 
           above. 

                                 JOB
                        What you so soft on him for anyway, 
                        John? You taken a fancy to him, all 
                        them long nights at sea?

           Silver CRACKS Job in the face with a hard left, knocking him 
           flat on his ass. Achille BOILS; but a subtle hand signal from 
           Job holds him back. 

                                 SILVER
                        Jim Hawkins was the only currency 
                        that woulda bought that map. 

           Silver turns away, beginning the long trek back. Achille 
           helps Job up; the look he gives Silver would turn your blood 
           cold.  

           EXT. LAUNCH/ROWING - CONTINUOUS

           The launch has almost made it to the thin spit of land that 
           juts out over this corner of the bay. 

           Four hard strokes, and they’re onto the sand.

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           ISRAEL aims down the barrel. He HAMMERS the wedge home a few 
           more degrees. Match to the touch hole, and KA-BOOM!!!

           CANNON BALL POV: we accelerate to 1400 feet per second - 
           arcing out over the turquoise water of the bay... towards 
           that long, narrow spit, and down, right for the small boat...
           EXT. SPIT - CONTINUOUS

           Ruthie, Livesey, Grey and Smollet each have a cask in their 
           arms when the Squire sees the flash. The trajectory is clear, 
           you can follow it with your eye...

           They all DIVE and COVER as the Cannon Ball SMASHES THE BOAT 
           to splinters. The rolling BOOM follows a few seconds later. 

           The Squire emerges from the shallow water, shaking himself 
           like a dog, and losing his wig in the process. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        The man’s a prodigy!

           EXT. CLIFF TOP CLEARING - AFTERNOON

           Jim clambers up the last few feet of rock, scurries through 
           the vines and bushes, and finally emerges onto the flat, 
           grassy top of the cliff. 

           He crawls to the edge, and looks out over the bay. He can 
           just see the spit and his friends. The RED ENSIGN flag is 
           being lowered from the Hispaniola’s mast. 

           Hands raw from the climb, terrified, exhausted, Jim collapses 
           to the ground, and BREATHES. 

           A FACE appears in the shadows between the branches. Wild 
           doesn’t begin to describe him. A long white beard, a shock of 
           grey hair matted into thick dreadlocks, framing a face burned 
           and scaled by the sun. 

           Insane eyes fix on Jim with intensity, this is BEN GUNN, 64. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - AFTERNOON

           Out on the spit, surrounded by the sea on three sides, and 
           ringed by a palisade-fence of sharp stakes is The Stockade. A 
           half dozen rusting cannon face out to sea.

           In the center of the compound; a simple log cabin, thick tree 
           trunks roughly planed and stacked like Lincoln-logs. The roof 
           is thickly overgrown with wild plants. 

           Livesey extracts the shrapnel from River’s shoulder. 

           Smollet uses his telescope, examining the Hispaniola. 

           TELESCOPE POV: The BLACK, DEATHS-HEAD FLAG is hoisted!
           EXT. CLIFF TOP CLEARING - EVENING

           The Sun is setting on Treasure Island, and Jim Hawkins is 
           still lying in the tall grass of the clearing. 

           From the darkness of the jungle the eyes of Ben Gunn watch 
           Jim. He mutters, just under his breath. Madness.

                                 BEN
                           (to himself)
                        Isn’t real. Boy isn’t real, Ben. 
                        Blithering great fool, finally gone 
                        mad you has... ships and boys... 

           He sniffs the air...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Smells real. Yes he does, smells 
                        real enough...

           Ben takes a cautious step out of cover. His tanned brown body 
           is covered in a poncho of goat skins. 

           Jim hears the movement, and sits up, and turns around. When 
           he sees Ben, he BOLTS to his feet. 

           There’s nowhere left to run. 

           Jim tries to dodge around him, only to be tackled. He fights 
           as hard as he ever has, but Ben is strong and wily. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        He’s real. He is! He is!

           Ben starts running his hands all over Jim’s face.

           Another BOOM from the Hispaniola startles Ben, and Jim BUCKS 
           HIM OFF and tries to scramble away. Ben grabs his foot.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Say a word! Speak so I knows!

                                 JIM
                        Let me GO!

                                 BEN
                        Talks to us, did you hear him? 
                        Talks to us. And you talks to 
                        yourself, old-chum, doesn’t mean 
                        anything, does it now? 

           Jim struggles to pull his foot free, falling over as Ben lets 
           him go. Ben scurries up next to him. 
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, friend, are you real?

                                 JIM
                        Of course I’m real. 

                                 BEN
                        He’s here, he’s real, real as life. 
                        Ha! Ha! I’m saved. SAVED!

           Ben rolls on his back, kicking his feet up in the air in a 
           wild jig! Jim realizes, this person isn’t all there. 

                                 JIM
                        Do you have a name?

                                 BEN
                        A what’s? A name? Why. I’m Ben 
                        Gunn. That’s who I am, Benjamin 
                        Peter Gunn, so I am, but most just 
                        calls me Ben. 

           Ben leaps to his feet as another CANNON SHOT BOOMS!

                                 JIM
                        How did you get here, Ben, were you 
                        shipwrecked? 

                                 BEN
                        Shipwrecked? No. No, not 
                        shipwrecked my plum. Not 
                        shipwrecked at all. Ben was 
                        MAROONED. 

                                 JIM
                        That’s awful.

                                 BEN
                        Tell me Jim, and it’s a strange 
                        question, yes I know, but it’s the 
                        one thing I dream about, above all 
                        else... have you any cheese? 

           Ben leans down close, SNIFFING at Jim like a big dog.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        A blue Stilton, maybe or a chalky 
                        cheddar? A runny Brie perhaps? Even 
                        a nasty old Dutch rind...

                                 JIM
                        I’m sorry, Ben, I don’t.
                                 BEN
                        Maybe on that fine ship then? 

                                 JIM
                        On board? Why, we have wheels of 
                        cheese on board-

                                 BEN
                        Wheels you says?

           Ben sniffs the air, and stares hard into Jim’s eyes. He draws 
           his short, well-used knife and holds it to Jim’s neck. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Better not lie to Ben. 

                                 JIM
                        I’m not lying! But there’s a 
                        problem. 

                                 BEN
                        A problem? What problem? 

                                 JIM
                        Pirates have the ship - They’re 
                        trying to kill me and my friends.

                                 BEN
                        What name uses these pirates? 

                                 JIM
                        They’re led by Long John-

                                 BEN
                        SILVER.

           Ben’s rage, the knife at Jim’s throat - shit, Jim might get 
           cut just because Ben’s a loon. 

                                 JIM
                        Ben, you don’t need the knife.

           Ben stands, looking out towards the ship, blade still in 
           hand.

                                 BEN
                        John Silver, here, on my island now 
                        are you? Know what you’ve come for 
                        John, so I do. Hehehehehehe. 

           Ben dances a mad little caper. He sheathes the blade.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Jim. Your friends, take you to them 
                        safe and sound I will. Knows all 
                        the ways, I do. 

           Ben slinks towards the Jungle, and Jim follows.

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           The Mutineers are a rough looking lot. They’ve been into the 
           rum already, and they’re half pissed. A fire’s going, and 
           skewers of salt pork are sizzling on sticks.  

           It looks more like a beach party than a pirate invasion. 

           Silver, Achille and Job come down from the tree line. 

           Silver walks around to where MORGAN and BIBLE DICK are 
           roasting their skewers. 

                                 SILVER
                        On your feet, we’ll take the 
                        stockade before dark.

                                 MORGAN
                        Cap’n gave us a day off.

                                 SILVER
                        The Captain who we deposed in a 
                        mutiny? Would that be the one? Well 
                        sure. If he gave you a day off, who 
                        am I to contradict him?

                                 MORGAN
                        Get off your high horse, we’re here 
                        at the Island. We have the ship, 
                        thought’d we’d have a drink first. 

           Silver smacks Morgan upside his head. 

                                 SILVER
                        That’s what you get for thinkin’ 

           Morgan catches Silver by surprise, pushing him on his back. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Keep your hands to yourself, 
                        cripple. 

           Silver sweeps his crutch out, and CRACKS Morgan at the knee. 
           As he falls, Silver swarms him.
           John batters Morgan with hard punches, pinning his arm with 
           his good leg. He drives a thumb into Morgan’s eye socket. 

           Morgan thrashes, but Silver rides him easily, thumb pressing 
           down HARD.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        John - NO!

                                 SILVER
                           (whispered)
                        I ever tell you how Flint lost his 
                        eye?

                                 MORGAN
                        No...please John, please...

           Silver lets go, and pushes himself up on his crutch. 

                                 SILVER
                        You’re a decent shot, Will. Hate to 
                        waste a good gunner. 

           The Mutineers are shamed to silence. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You lads wanted your day of rest, 
                        well take it. Even God gave Adam 
                        the sabbath, isn’t it so, Dick?

           Bible Dick nods his head. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You’re useless to me like this 
                        anyway. 

           Silver stalks off down the beach.

           EXT. STOCKADE - NIGHT

           Torches burn inside the stakes of the palisade, and the long 
           grass at the approach the small cabin has been cleared. 

           Ruthie is on guard duty, eyes watching the night. 

           Approaching from the jungle beyond, Ben Gunn slithers across 
           the rocks as surely as a lizard. Jim follows behind. 

                                 BEN
                        Here’s where I leaves you, plummy. 
                                 JIM
                        No Ben, come in, have something to 
                        eat, I want you to meet the Squire-

                                 BEN
                        Yes, yes, I’ll meet him soon. Work 
                        for Ben tonight, Jim Hawkins, work 
                        best done in the dark. 

           Ben and Jim shake hands again, and Ben leans in close. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Tell you a secret. Has a little 
                        boat, does Ben. Hidden there. 

           Ben points to a cluster of rocks on the far side of the spit. 
           And then, silent as a ghost, he’s gone. 

                                 JIM
                        Ben. Ben! Damn it. 

           Jim turns back to the stockade, and makes his way to the 
           palisade. He’s thin enough to squeeze between the stakes. 

                                 RUTHIE
                        Who goes there?

                                 JIM
                        Jim Hawkins! It’s me Ruthie, don’t 
                        shoot. 

                                 RUTHIE
                        Jim! Hey, Jim’s back, Jim made it!

           Jim runs towards the stockade. Livesey is up, and out the 
           door when Jim RUNS INTO HIS ARMS and hugs him tightly. All 
           Livesey’s reserve and stand-offishness is gone.

                                 LIVESEY
                        Jim. You made it. Thank God.

           The Squire’s up now, as are Smollet and River. Livesey hugs 
           Jim a second time just to be sure. 

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           The Mutineers have made something of a little camp. Sail 
           cloth tents, blankets and a warm fire. 

           No one’s keeping watch. Ben Gunn appears at the tree line. 

                                 BEN
                        Where are ye, John?
           He creeps quietly down to the sleeping men, and draws his 
           dagger. He crouches over one MUTINEER, and cuts his throat. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That’ll do for you. 

           The next mutineer wakes up as the blade touches his neck. His 
           scream cuts off to a gargle, but it’s enough to wake Achille.

                                 ACHILLE
                        ALARUM! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

           Ben scurries off. Achille runs after him.

           EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

           Achille stalks the jungle. A million insects SING, and the 
           wet, moist undergrowth seems to be growing all around him. 

           He stops as he hears BRANCHES CRACKLING. FOOTSTEPS!

           In the night, shirtless, Achille blends with the dark. He 
           crouches in ambush. 

           A SHADOW BURSTS from the foliage. ACHILLE leaps onto it, 
           cutlass stabbing down into warm flesh - who did he kill?

           400lbs of tusked PIG. 

           Achille, covered in blood, doesn’t stop stabbing until the 
           pig is still.

           Ben watches from a shadows, eyes calculating this new threat.

           EXT. BEACH - MORNING

           CU: Achille pushes iron nails into the RAW PIG HEART!

           The TWO MEN BEN MURDERED are lying side by side. The rest of 
           Achille’s pig is roasting over the fire. 

           The others are pissed. Hungover, cold, and now ARMED TO THE 
           TEETH; they’re ready to kick some ass. 

                                 JOB
                        I’ll cut their eyes out for this. 

                                 SILVER
                        You Dick, will you stow that Bible, 
                        and do some proper killin’?

           BIBLE-DICK, 50, Scots, nods his head. 
                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        The Lord is a man of war.

           Achille is crouched by the stones of the fire, he’s made some 
           kind of small shrine; The RAW PIG HEART with a dozen NAILS 
           stuck into it, on a bed of red flowers. 

                                 SILVER
                        Achille, tell me, do your pagan 
                        gods favor us? 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Chango always favors war.

           Achille pours RUM over his entire offering as Silver turns to 
           his angry crew.

                                 SILVER
                        Then war it is.

           EXT. STOCKADE - MORNING

           Jim’s loading a musket out in front of the stockade. Using 
           the old cannon, and some logs that never made it to the 
           cabin, they’ve made a low firing-wall. 

           Jim sees a white shirt held up on a stick over the palisade. 

                                 JIM
                        Look!

                                 SILVER
                           (yelling)
                        Flag of truce. 

           Smollet looks up. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        All of you, stay low, arm 
                        yourselves. 

                                 SILVER
                        Cap’n Silver to come aboard and 
                        parley. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Captain Silver. Never heard of him. 

           Silver slips through a gap in the palisade. 

                                 SILVER
                        Cap’n Smollet. 
                                 SMOLLET
                        Be quick about it. 

           Smollet packs his pipe, and offers tobacco from his pouch to 
           Silver. Silver sees Jim and waves. 

                                 SILVER
                        Hell of a climb you made there, 
                        Jim. Glad to see you well.

           Jim turns a stony eye from Silver. Silver in turn packs his 
           pipe as he speaks. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a matter of the chart. 

           Smollet takes a seat in the sand, and puffs his pipe to life. 
           Silver lowers himself down, leaning against the firing wall. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        You came to parley; so parlez.

                                 SILVER
                        My offer is simple, and fair. Your 
                        lives for the map. You hand it 
                        over, I give you my affy-davy, here 
                        and now, no one will come to any 
                        harm. I’ll pack up Flints gold - 
                        which, by the by, I’ve more right 
                        to than any man here - and I’ll 
                        sail with you as my guests, 
                        dropping you at the first port we 
                        come to. 

           Smollet puffs away on his pipe. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Those are the terms? 

                                 SILVER
                        Handsome an offer as you’ll get. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        You can’t find the treasure, not 
                        without the map. There’s not a man 
                        among you can navigate, and you’re 
                        too good a sailor not to know it. 
                        So you’re trapped. Here’s my offer. 
                        Surrender, now, and I’ll see to it 
                        you get a fair trial.

                                 SILVER
                        You’re an arrogant man, Smollet, 
                        don’t be a fool as well. 
                                 SMOLLET
                        You have my terms. 

           Smollet stands, and brushes the dirt and sand from his pants. 

                                 SILVER
                        Give me a hand up, will you? 

                                 SMOLLET
                        No. No I don’t think I will. 

                                 SILVER
                        Give me a hand up, I says. 

           Smollet clambers over the defenses. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Who’ll help me? 

           Silver, on his arse, looks to Livesey, Ruthie, Jim. No one 
           will give him the satisfaction. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                           (ice-cold)
                        You know the kind of men I lead? 
                        This was a mercy, and here’s how 
                        you trade with kindness? 

           Silver neatly stands up, his good leg twice as strong as any 
           man’s, hardly using the crutch at all. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You see me, and all you see is 
                        what’s missin’. Have your laughs. 
                        ‘fore the hour’s out, you’ll laugh 
                        from the other side. Them that 
                        die’ll be the lucky ones.

           Silver makes his way back to the palisade. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - DAY

           The Mutineers wait at the Palisade, and Silver gives them the 
           signal, a PISTOL SHOT in the air. 

           Swarming through the gaps in the palisade, they CHARGE!!!

           River, now shirtless except for his chest plate, and face 
           painted, joins the firing line. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Glad you could join us. 
                                 RUTHIE
                        Had to put his party dress on.

           A dozen of the men, led by Bible Dick, RUN right at them. 

           WITH ACHILLE:

           Job, Achille, and three PIRATES ford the water, their pistols 
           held high.

           WITH THE SQUIRE:

                                 SQUIRE
                        Aim low!

           At fifty feet: 

                                 SQUIRE (CONT’D)
                        FIRE!

           Five MUSKETS FIRE -

           Five men drop, including Bible-Dick, who’s hit in the head! 
           Still the Pirates charge. 

           10 yards out, the Squire and his troops FIRE another volley-

           Young HARRY is hit dead center, falling down in agony!

           The surviving men stall, throwing themselves to the scanty 
           cover. Their pistols SNAP and BANG, but the shots go high, 
           and pepper the cabin. 

           Jim’s reloading a musket as the others pick up their pre-
           loaded guns, and pick off the others - 

           Jim sees Job and Achille charging from the left. 

                                 JIM
                        Captain!

           Ruthie turns, his weapon empty, and engages with Achille. 
           River blocks one lunge, only to have JOB attack at the same 
           time. 2 on 1, River is pressed to his very limit.

           The Doctor turns to the new threat. With his musket, he 
           parries a Pirates attack, and fights back. 

           A PIRATE scales the defenses, and leaps for the Doctor. The 
           Squire finishes him with thrust. 

           Ruthie and Achille trade blows- Achille is knocked down, 
           where he grabs a second sword, and comes up, fighting harder 
           than before.  
           In the narrow space between cabin and the wall, it’s a bitter 
           melee. The Squire takes a sword from a fallen man, and dives 
           in alongside River; engaging Job.

           A PIRATE trips Smollet, and is driving his blade down on 
           Smollet with both hands.  

           Jim raises the heavy musket but is bumped aside by Livesey as 
           he tries to get the courage up to shoot.

                                 SMOLLET
                        Shoot him!

           Jim aims again, he can’t miss, but HE HESITATES!

           Ruthie and Achille continue to fight, Achille takes a hard 
           HEADBUTT right in the face. Ruthie rears back to butt him 
           again, but ACHILLE BITES HIS NECK with his sharpened teeth! 

           Ruthie grunts in pain, and pulls back, and as he does, 
           Achille DRIVES HIS SWORD right through Ruthie’s side. 

           River knocks Job to the ground with the butt of his musket. 
           Only to have Achille barrel into him, and knock him to the 
           ground. 

           SMOLLET SCREAMS as the blade pushes into his shoulder, and 
           JIM STILL CAN’T FIRE!

           The Squire RUNS THROUGH the Pirate stabbing Smollet. The 
           Pirate cries a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM - Achille and Job realize 
           they’re all alone; they run.

           Livesey, River and the Squire CHEER as their opponents run. 
           Ruthie’s on the ground, his guts a bloody mess. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Ruthie!

           Livesey tears open Ruthie’s shirt. The wound is deep. 
           Livesey’s look to the Squire says it all. River kneels, 
           holding his friends hand. 

                                 SQUIRE (CONT’D)
                        Oh no. Not Tom. 

                                 RUTHIE
                        Can’t feel a thing. 

           Ruthie’s clearly lying. 

                                 RUTHIE (CONT’D)
                        Had some adventures together, 
                        haven’t we? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUTHIE (CONT’D)
                        Showed the Frenchies how it’s done, 
                        Austrians, them godless 
                        Maharattas... 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Showed them the King’s Colours.

                                 RUTHIE
                        Even made allies with the ‘eathans. 

           He smiles at River.

                                 RIVER
                        See you on the other side, brother.

                                 SQUIRE
                        Forgive me Ruthie. 

                                 RUTHIE
                        Would that be proper, sir, me 
                        forgivin’ you?

                                 SQUIRE
                        David, help him... 

                                 LIVESEY
                        I’m, sorry.

           When they look back, Ruthie HAS GONE. River and the Squire 
           shed unashamed tears. 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Under the shade of their sail-cloth tents, the pirates are 
           recovering their strength. Silver is carefully bandaging 
           Bible-Dick’s head.  

           Dick is feverish, hallucinating. 

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        Yer riches are corrupted!

                                 SILVER
                        Aye, maybe so, Dick, maybe so. 

           Silver looks over the other survivors. Morgan made it out, as 
           well as Job and Achille, there’s LOW (35), a victim of 
           jaundice, and JONES(40). Job is bandaging Achille’s arm where 
           a nasty wound festers.  

                                 JOB
                        He don’t shut up I’ll finish what 
                        that musket-ball started. 
                                 SILVER
                        His fever don’t calm down, you 
                        won’t have to. 

                                 JOB
                        Look what you’ve led us to, Silver. 

                                 SILVER
                        Oh clearly, it was me. Me blastin’ 
                        my gun for no cause. Me chasin’ 
                        Hawkins up a cliff. Me that turned 
                        and ran, when we all but had ‘em. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        We had no choice!

                                 SILVER
                        If I were half the man I was...

                                 ACHILLE
                           (challenging)
                        But you’re not. 

           Job finishes the bandage on Achille. Both of them stare 
           angrily at Silver.

                                 SILVER
                        You’re free men; you have your say. 
                        Is John your Captain still? 

           Morgan nods, Low and Jones look to Job and Achille. Job and 
           Achille stare long and hard at each other. Job breaks first.  

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Well?

                                 JOB
                        Cap’n. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Aye. 

           The others nod, going with the flow. 

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        Render unto Caesar...

                                 SILVER
                        I’ll take that for a yes. 

           They all nod grimly. 
           EXT. STOCKADE - AFTERNOON

           Five wounded Mutineers are slowly dying in the shade of the 
           cabin. Jim tilts water to Harry’s lips. Flies buzz on the 
           dried blood of his wounds. 

                                 JIM
                        I’m sorry, Harry.

                                 HARRY
                        S’alright Jim. 

           Livesey puts a last shovel-full of sand on Ruthie’s grave. 
           The Squire sinks Ruthie’s musket into the ground as a marker.

           Jim hands Smollet a cup. He takes it and swallows the water. 
           Jim dips the cup, and passes it to Livesey. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Just the three of you now. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        And Jim. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        I don’t account him for very much. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Easy Captain. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Easy? I’m run through cos of him. 
                        He knows it, and so do I. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        I bumped him before he could take 
                        the shot. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        I’ll tell it plain, the boy’s a 
                        coward. He had every chance- 

           Livesey loses his temper.

                                 LIVESEY
                        Enough, sir!

           He regains himself. 

                                 LIVESEY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve said quite enough. 
                                 JIM
                        You don’t have to defend me, 
                        Doctor. He’s right. I am a coward. 

           A bitter silence hangs in the air, a long, ugly moment. Jim 
           can’t look any of them in the eye. He puts the bucket down, 
           and walks off. Livesey gives the Captain a withering look. 

           EXT. SPIT - SUNSET

           Jim watches the sunset. He’s tearing apart a piece of 
           driftwood. He tosses each piece into the sea in front of him. 

           He watches the bark, and soon it becomes clear--- the current 
           takes all the pieces North. 

           The Squire silently sits beside him.

                        Ruthie joined my battalion when he 
                        was 17. Couldn’t find a uniform big 
                        enough for him. First time we had a 
                        scrap was in Holland. French let us 
                        have it. Christ what a debacle. I 
                        found Ruthie in a barn; he’d run 
                        away when the cavalry charged. 

                                 JIM
                        You don’t have to make me feel 
                        better.

                        River came to us, couldn’t have 
                        been more than 16. His father 
                        wanted him to grow up, so he 
                        scouted for us on the frontier. He 
                        was with me when the news came in 
                        that the Huron tribe had 
                        slaughtered everyone in his 
                        village. I suppose that’s the day 
                        he became a man.

           Jim keeps throwing wood chips into the water. 

                                 SQUIRE (CONT’D)
                        We all find ourselves coming to 
                        terms with growing up in different 
                        ways. But we all have one thing in 
                        common. 

                                 JIM
                        What’s that?
                                 SQUIRE
                        We come to it alone. You’re not a 
                        coward Jim. But you do have some 
                        growing up to do.  

           The Squire walks away stiffly, painfully. 

           Jim stares back out to the Hispaniola, then back at the trail 
           of driftwood heading North. 

           Hispaniola...driftwood - driftwood... Hispaniola: a plan 
           starts to form. 

           Jim stands up, brushing off the sand. His gaze rests on the 
           Hispaniola; resolution sets on him like a suit of armor.

           EXT. ROCKS - SUNSET

           Jim finds a small, goat-hide coracle (a small, round boat) 
           and a paddle right where Ben Gunn promised it would be. 

           He drops the lightweight boat into the water and clambers in. 
           Jim starts paddling out. He almost tips over as a small wave 
           comes his way, but manages to ride it out. 

                                 JIM

                        Bollocks. 

           He starts paddling out. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - EVENING

           Livesey comes out of the stockade, peering out across the 
           killing grounds. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        JIM? 

           He clambers up onto the firing wall, and looks around 360 
           degrees. 

                                 LIVESEY (CONT’D)
                        JIM?

           The Squire comes out of the cabin as well. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        What is it, David?

                        I haven’t seen Jim. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        He was down by the shore-

           Livesey walks towards the end of the spit, but it’s obvious, 
           Jim’s not there. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Jim, Jim where are you?

           Smollet, half drunk, bottle in hand, CHUCKLES darkly. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Thrown in with Silver, I bet. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        After being labelled coward by you, 
                        could you fault him for it?

                                 SMOLLET
                        He knows what he is. 

           Livesey gets right in Smollet’s face.

                                 LIVESEY
                        I shall nurse you to good health. 
                        I’ll see to it that shoulder heals 
                        perfectly; and once it does, it’s 
                        my sword you’ll answer to.

           River breaks the stand off, jogging back towards them. 

                                 RIVER
                        Someone’s coming, be ready. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT ANCHOR) - NIGHT

           As Jim paddles the small boat closer to the stern of the 
           Hispaniola, he can clearly see the open windows of Smollet’s 
           Cabin, and the bright light of many candles. 

           There’s movement in the cabin, but no one stops to look out 
           at the tiny coracle. 

           Jim paddles alongside the ship: she’s huge in the water next 
           to him. Jim grabs the anchor line, and tugs himself in close. 
           With his knife, he starts SAWING at the anchor line. 

           When the rope finally gives, Jim is holding the top side, and 
           the sudden LURCH of the freed ship, PULLS HIM OVERBOARD. His 
           boat capsizes, taking in water and sinking in seconds. 
           His pistol goes down with the boat, glinting as it falls 
           through the perfectly clear water. 

           Jim’s left, dangling from the anchor line. Like a real 
           pirate, he clamps his teeth around the blade, and hand over 
           hand, he climbs the anchor rope, up to the deck.

           EXT. PALISADE-LINE - NIGHT

           Silver and Bible-Dick have made it to the palisade. Silver 
           uses a small spyglass to peek in at the Stockade. 

           SPYGLASS POV: the torches are burning, and smoke comes from 
           the chimney, but there’s NO MOVEMENT. 

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        ..man and woman, young and old, 
                        smote with the edge of the sword.

                                 SILVER
                        Now you’re talkin’. 

           EXT. SPIT - NIGHT

           The Jolly pulls up onto the shore, and Achille lowers himself 
           out, and helps drag the boat ashore. 

           Morgan and Low ship the oars, and Job passes the crate of 
           grenades to Achille as he steps ashore. 

           Achille blows the lit match in his pocket to life. Each of 
           the pirates takes 2 grenades. 

                                 JOB
                        Looks quiet enough.

                                 ACHILLE
                        Attend. John said wait. 

                                 JOB
                        You always do what your master 
                        tells you? 

           Achille takes his time answering. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        I had a master. One night, I took 
                        my coutlas, and very quiet, I creep 
                        into the big maison. I cut the 
                        throat of his children, 4 of them. 
                        I kill his wife, with my hands. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ACHILLE (CONT'D)
                        When I finish’, I woke the master, 
                        to show him what I had done. 

                                 JOB
                        You kill him too? 

                                 ACHILLE
                        Non. Him, I left for the house 
                        slaves. He liked black girls, but 
                        they didn’t like him. He was the 
                        last master I ever will have. 
                        Comprends?

           Job is shocked to silence. 

           INT. SMOLLET’S CABIN - NIGHT

           The grenade made a real mess of Smollet’s tidy cabin. Israel 
           has slung a hammock across the cabin, and is lying back.

           Tom is sitting up on a pallet, one foot a SWOLLEN MESS from 
           being run over by a heavy cannon. 

                                 O'BRIEN
                        Foot’s throbbin somethin’ awful. 

           ISRAEL swivels out of the hammock, his bottle of rum empty.

                                 ISRAEL
                        Piss and moan, piss and moan.  

           Israel draws his knife, and lays it on Tom’s bruised and 
           swollen foot. 

                                 ISRAEL (CONT’D)
                        Won’t hurt no more if I cut it off. 
                        Seen the surgeons, I have, nothing 
                        to it. 

           O’Brien flinches as Israel presses the blade into the tender 
           skin. He knocks the knife away. 

                                 O’BRIEN
                        Just bring us a bottle, Issy. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Get it yourself. Gotta cut a slash. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT ANCHOR) - CONTINUOUS

           The ship is already turning in the current. Jim stops when he 
           hears footsteps, then slips into the main hold.
           INT. HISPANIOLA (AT ANCHOR) - NIGHT 

           There’s not much light down here, but Jim finds his way 
           around, quietly sneaking into the magazine. 

           INT. MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS

           Stacks of powder bags for the cannon, and crates of weapons 
           are opened, and tossed everywhere. 

           He takes a pistol from the deck and begins loading it. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT ANCHOR) - NIGHT 

           Israel senses the movement of the boat. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Hang about...

           He’s draws his pistol.  

           EXT. PALISADE-LINE - CONTINUOUS

           Dick fumbles to get his pistol out, and Silver has to help. 
           Dick’s hands are shaking like he’s got a palsy. 

                                 SILVER
                        You don’t have to hit anything, 
                        just make a racket. 

           Silver bangs away, followed by Dick, and they start going for 
           their next guns...

           EXT. STOCKADE - NIGHT

           In the darkness behind the cabin, Job, Morgan, Low and 
           Achille move slowly, quietly. 

           Achille aims his pistol around the corner of the cabin, and 
           sees no one. Low and Morgan boost Job up onto the thick-
           timbers of the roof. Achille aims at the door. He listens: a 
           light SNORING comes from within!

           Job touches the lit match cord to the fuse on the grenade, 
           and blows hard to fire the match’s cherry. The fuse IGNITES, 
           and Job drops the grenade down the crude chimney!

           The EXPLOSION is deafening - dust and smoke BLAST out of the 
           poor joins in the log structure: HOWLS of pain follow. 
           Achille rounds the corner, and slips through the front door 
           of the cabin...

           INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS

           The MUTINEER-WOUNDED had been left inside the cabin. Not one 
           of them had much of a chance; and now they’re all dead, save 
           Harry, who is screaming in pain. 

           By the light of the fire, the carnage is HORRIFIC.

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - CONTINUOUS

           Israel runs to the bow, and finds the severed anchor line. He 
           almost misses the wet footprints leading below-decks. Almost. 

           He’s dropping down into the hatch when there’s a click behind 
           him. ISRAEL turns slowly, and finds himself staring down the 
           barrels of two pistols. 

                                 JIM
                        Drop the gun. Down the hatch. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Easy there Jim, don’t want to hurt 
                        your old friend Issy now, do ya? 

                                 JIM
                        Drop it. 

           Israel drops the gun down the dark well of the hatch. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        See, nothing to be afraid of now. 

           Jim doesn’t see O’Brien behind him. Every step must be agony, 
           but he grabs Jim from behind with both arms. 

           Jim’s first reaction is to STOMP down on O’Brien’s foot. He 
           ROARS with pain, staggers back, and loses his balance. 

           Jim turns, and shoots. The shot catches O’Brien high on the 
           chest, and CARTWHEELS HIM over the side of the ship. Israel 
           runs to the gunwale, but the ship has a little headway in the 
           current, and O’Brien’s corpse is fast-moving out of sight. 

                                 ISRAEL (CONT’D)
                        Tommy!

           Jim levels the other pistol on Israel. 
                                 JIM
                        You’ll stay where you are, Mr. 
                        Hands. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Oh I will, will I?

                                 JIM
                        The ship would be easier to manage 
                        alone.

           There’s steel in Jim now, a real strength. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - NIGHT

           Harry’s all moans and groans. Bible-Dick is praying over him.  
           He’s burned badly, and the wound in his chest is awful.  

                                 HARRY
                        It hurts. 

           Job is shaken up by having killed four of his mates, and 
           critically wounded another. He wipes a tear from his eye. 

           Silver comes out of the cabin. 

                                 SILVER
                        I told you to look after the boy. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        We are. 

                                 SILVER
                        If this is what you call lookin’ 
                        after- never spend a care on me. 

           Silver draws his sword, and shuffles over to Harry. Harry, 
           insensible, never sees the blade that sinks through his neck, 
           ending it all. Silver is moved by this grim mercy.  

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You deserved better, son, if you’re 
                        lookin’ down; go easy on John.  

           The other’s stare at him in shock and shame. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Care to see what Harry’s life 
                        bought ya?

           Silver holds up the map. 
                                 ACHILLE
                           (suspicious)
                        Think about it, Silver. Why would 
                        they leave it? 

                                 SILVER
                        It’s a message. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        What message?

                                 SILVER
                        Could be they’re done fightin’; 
                        could be, they’ll be waitin’ for 
                        us.  

                                 JOB
                        So what do we do? 

                                 SILVER
                        Hope for the former, prepare for 
                        the latter.

           Sliver lays out the map for all to see.

           EXT. TREASURE ISLAND - SUNRISE

           The bleak light of morning shows the Hispaniola some way 
           North of the spit. 

           Jim and Israel are still at their uneasy detente. (Issy waits 
           for his moment) 

                                 JIM
                        Mr. Hands, I’d have the mainsail 
                        run out, if you please. 

                                 ISRAEL
                        Cap’n now, is you? 

                                 JIM
                        It’s about 400 yards to shore, can 
                        you swim it?

                                 ISRAEL
                        More like 450, and I’ll give you 
                        your sail, Cap’n. 

           Jim backs up as Israel un-cleats the line, and hand over 
           hand, draws down the mainsail. It catches the morning wind at 
           once.  
                                 JIM
                        Set us a course for that inlet. 

           Jim points to a narrow inlet in the distance. Israel walks to 
           the wheel, Jim keeping a safe distance the whole while. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - MORNING

           Job is the first one awake. He walks to the very edge of the 
           stockade to make his/her morning toilet. He’s squatting to 
           pee when he looks out over the bay. 

           Hold on. Something’s missing...

                                 JOB
                        Silver! SILVER!

           Job runs back to the cabin. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - MOMENTS LATER

           Silver and what’s left of his crew are gathered in a loose 
           line staring out over where their ship is supposed to be. 

                                 JOB
                        Now we’re proper buggered. No way 
                        to leave this bastard island, not 
                        so much as a ships biscuit to eat, 
                        no water- well done John, well 
                        bloody done. Useless old git. 

           If Silver’s surprised, we’ll never know, he hides it like a 
           champion poker player. 

                                 JOB (CONT’D)
                        Hold out your left hand. 

                                 SILVER
                        Don’t be daft.

           Achille steps in close, glowering at Silver. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        You know the rules-

                                 SILVER
                        I LEARNED you the rules. 

                                 JOB
                        Your hand, John Silver. 
           John holds out his left hand, and Job puts a folded piece of 
           paper into it. 

           The BLACK SPOT. It’s a crude version, ash smeared on a page 
           from Bible-Dick’s good book. On the back, a single 
           (misspelled) word. DEPPOSED.

                                 SILVER
                        I suppose you’re the Cap’n now?

                                 JOB
                        We had a vote. Achille is Cap’n. 

           Silver turns to Achille. 

                                 SILVER
                        Woulda been my first choice too. 
                        It’s steadiness you want in 
                        command.

                                 ACHILLE
                        First, water, then food. 

                                 SILVER
                        Most pragmatic.

           Silver folds the map, and slips it into his pocket. Mind 
           already planning his next move. 

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - MORNING

           The Hispaniola is heading for a small inlet, slowly but 
           surely, riding the winds inland. 

           EXT. QUARTER DECK/HISPANIOLA - MORNING 

           Israel pilots the ship into the Inlet, the tall sides of the 
           cliffs rob them of wind, and the ship DRIFTS onwards. 

           Up on the beach are the BONES of another ship. Stripped and 
           rotten, all that remains are the keel and a few ribs.

           Jim peers over the side to see how shallow the water’s 
           gotten.

           Israel makes his move. He draws his blade, wickedly fast, and 
           cocks his arm to throw. As he does, Jim catches the movement, 
           and aims to shoot!

           The Hispaniola SUDDENLY SHUDDERS as she runs aground!
           Jim staggers, and his SHOT GOES WILD! The bullet grazes 
           Israel in the left arm spoiling his throw; the blade misses 
           Jim by a hair’s breadth. 

           The Hispaniola’s mass and momentum drive her up onto the 
           beach, and she HEELS HARD OVER, the deck now a crazy angle. 

           Jim slides down the deck, and runs along the rail. Israel 
           stumbles to his feet. The wound in his arm bleeding freely.

           He swipes up one of the short clubs set into the woodwork of 
           the Quarter Deck, and runs after Jim. 

           Jim leaps into the rigging ladder, at the heeled over angle, 
           he scrambles up, out over the deeper water of the bay. 

           He clambers to the mast, and grips on tight with his legs, as 
           Israel comes up after him, moving slowly with his wounded 
           arm. But Jim has nowhere left to go. 

           He reaches into his shirt, and takes out a small bag. In it 
           he has a powder charge, and ammo. He drops half a dozen lead 
           balls, keeping only the one he needs. 

           The reload takes time. He pours powder in from a paper sheaf. 
           He places the ball, and starts ramming it down the barrel. 

           Israel is climbing closer. 

           Jim, opens the pan, slips in the rest of the powder, and 
           cocks the pistol - too late! ISRAEL knocks the gun away with 
           his truncheon, it splashes into the water below. 

           The next swipe almost takes Jim’s head off, but Jim lets 
           himself drop, catching a rigging line, and like a monkey, he 
           hand over hands to one of the spars, and shimmies up it. 

           Israel sees where Jim is going, and starts climbing up 
           himself. Jim gets himself to the crows nest, the highest 
           point on the ship, now dangling out over the bay. 

           Israel comes on, relentless. 

           Jim sets his feet as best he can, and draws his knife. 

           It’s time to stand and fight. 

                                 JIM
                        Lay-on, Israel Hands, I’m ready for 
                        you!

           Israel smiles through the clear pain he’s in, and pulls 
           himself around the ladder, and swings in to attack. 
           With his good arm, Israel grips at a rope, and swings the 
           truncheon with his weak-side. 

           Jim tries to stab at him, only to get his arm badly stunned 
           by the short wooden club. Israel follows along with another 
           short hacking shot that hits Jim in the ribs. 

           Jim KICKS out with his foot, and hits Israel in the chest, 
           but it’s not enough to loosen his grip. 

           But Jim’s learned something valuable. This time, when Israel 
           swipes at him, Jim DRIVES THE BLADE INTO ISRAEL’S FOREARM!

           Israel DROPS THE TRUNCHEON, but lightning fast, he reaches 
           for Jim’s throat. His 2 strong, bloody, fingers latch on 
           tight. Jim tries kicking again, but to no effect. 

           Israel leans in closer, and closer. Jim’s choking to death. 
           He reaches for the knife handle, and draws it from Israel’s 
           forearm. 

           The clutch on his neck never loosens even as the Pirate 
           SCREAMS in pain. 

           Jim CUTS THE ROPE that Israel’s good hand is holding. 

           Suddenly, the only thing holding Israel up is Jim’s neck. 

           Jim gives him one more mighty kick, and Israel falls. He 
           drops, pinwheels off the rigging, and hits the deck below 
           with an awful, bone shattering thud. 

           Jim wheezes to get air back in his lungs. He looks up, and 
           hanging a few feet above him, fluttering in the breeze, is 
           the black pirate flag. 

           Jim shimmies higher, and cuts the flag loose from the mast, 
           and throws it down to the water below.  

           Jim looks down at the blue water, almost a hundred feet below 
           him, and he LEAPS OUTWARDS, jumping down into the clear 
           waters of the bay...

           EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

           High up, following the rocks of a river, Ben Gunn clambers 
           ever onwards. 

           Following him, Livesey, The Squire, and Smollet. They are 
           heavily loaded with guns and what supplies they could manage.  
           Livesey helps both of them over a tricky section. 
                                 BEN
                        Hurry, hurry! Move slow you Lubbers 
                        does!

           River steps up next to him, silently. Ben jumps in shock.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Blerry quiet, matey, likes a ghost.  

           Ben prods River with a finger, as if making sure he’s there. 

           INT. BEN’S CAVE - DAY

           Ben has chosen a dry cave with a wide open mouth that looks 
           to sea. He’s decorated it with an old masthead, dozens of 
           colored bottles, some scraps of old sail cloth for a hammock.

                                 BEN
                        Ben’s home this is. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Tell me you didn’t drag us up those 
                        blasted rocks for a cup of tea. 

                                 BEN
                        No tea, milord. Deeper. 

           Ben points to the dark back of the cave. Livesey prowls in, 
           musket ready. 

           INT. BEN’S CAVE/STORAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The cave widens out after a narrow passage. A natural chimney 
           lets in light from above. 

           Livesey stares at HUNDREDS OF WOODEN CHESTS, stacked neatly. 
           He opens one on the floor. In orderly wooden racks, are 
           stacks and stacks of PESA D’OCHO silver coins. 

           Livesey holds one up, it’s bright as the day it was minted. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Pesa De Ocho’s. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Pieces of eight... 

           He looks around the room, in awe of the potential wealth. 
           Smollet crowds in, grabbing a handful of them!

                                 SMOLLET
                        Stone me dead.  
                                 SQUIRE
                        Surely not all of them? 

                                 BEN
                        No, no, gold in others.

                                 LIVESEY
                        How did you manage this? 

           Ben’s smile fades to that dangerous, unpredictable shade.

                                 BEN
                        Time runs slow alone. Days is like 
                        years, and years is like...

           Livesey looks around; thousands of chiseled tally-marks cover 
           the walls!

                                 LIVESEY
                        How long have you been here, Ben?

                                 BEN
                        Counted the days. Till all them 
                        marks fair laughed at me, ‘never 
                        going ‘ome’ Ben, ‘never going ‘ome’ 
                        they said. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        What year Ben, what year was it? 

                                 BEN
                        Can’t rightly say. We had just 
                        heard the British took Porto Bello 
                        off of Spain.

                                 BEN
                        And now? 

                                 SMOLLET

                                 BEN

                        18 years? 18?
           The anguish comes out of Ben in an ANIMAL HOWL. Livesey 
           reaches out to comfort him, as weeps for the time lost. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - DAY

           The heat of the afternoon has driven Silver and Bible Dick 
           into the shade behind the cabin. Dick’s fever is still bad, 
           and he’s mumbling as Silver tends to him

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        ...the fruits that thy soul lusted 
                        after are departed from thee, and 
                        thou shalt find them no more...

                                 SILVER
                        Don’t ye know any uplifting quotes 
                        from that damn book? Maybe 
                        something along the lines of “Ye 
                        shall have all the treasures ye 
                        seek, a gaggle of willing maidens, 
                        and a long and happy life besides.”

           Silver catches movement along the palisade-line, and watches 
           curiously as Jim comes running towards the cabin. 

                                 JIM
                        Doctor Livesey, Doctor Livesey!

           Jim runs straight into the cabin. 

           INT. STOCKADE - CONTINUOUS

           Blood covers the walls, flies have moved in en-masse, and the 
           place must stink, because Jim damn near throws up!

           Jim jumps as the doorway is filled with a familiar 
           silhouette. John Silver. 

                                 SILVER
                        No Doctor here, Jim lad. Only your 
                        old pal, John. 

                                 JIM
                        What have you done to them?

                                 SILVER
                        Done? We came here to finish our 
                        business, and they’d flown the 
                        coup. Lubbers, Jim, you can’t trust 
                        a one of them. They’ve taken the 
                        ship and scarpered. 
           Jim starts to laugh. 

                                 JIM
                        You’re right John. Can’t trust a 
                        lubber. Who was it hidden down in 
                        the apple barrel when you murdered 
                        Mr. Arrow? Who paddled out to the 
                        Hispaniola and cut her adrift? Who 
                        put a bullet through Tom O’Brien 
                        and kicked Israel Hands off the 
                        high mizzen? It was a lubber undid 
                        you, Long John Silver. It was I. 

                                 SILVER
                        All that? 

                                 JIM
                        And I’ll press upon your kindness 
                        for one last favor. 

                                 SILVER
                           (amused)
                        Anything you ask. 

                                 JIM
                        Speak well of me to the Doctor; let 
                        him know I died well. 

           Silver smiles. 

                                 SILVER
                        Come on out, I can’t abide the 
                        stink of death. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - CONTINUOUS

           He sits on an empty cask and packs his pipe. 

                                 SILVER
                        Well Jim, now I’ll lay to it on my 
                        side. You did your work well. I’m 
                        Cap’n no more. 

                                 JIM
                        Not Captain? 

                                 SILVER
                        Got the ship stowed away have you? 
                        Know this. Achille’s in command 
                        now. He learned the ways and means 
                        of pain in the pit. Hell on earth, 
                        and he clawed out. I can’t protect 
                        you from him.

                        He’s too much for me to handle. 
                        Might a been too much when I could 
                        still skip about. Trust me Jim, 
                        you’ll tell them where it is. 
                        You’ll beg to die before it’s over. 
                        You’d best run.

                                 JIM
                        But-

                                 SILVER
                        I won’t stop you. Liked you from 
                        the first, I did. You’re an honest 
                        lad, ‘smart as paint’; and look if 
                        I wasn’t right. 

           Sounds from the Jungle get their attention. The others are 
           returning, a goat slung on a tree branch between Morgan and 
           Low, barrels over Job and Achille’s shoulders for the water. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Too late. 

           Jim starts to panic. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Listen close now, we don’t have 
                        much time. I’ll save your life, and 
                        maybe you’ll save mine. 

           Silver spits in his hand, and holds it out to shake. Can Jim 
           trust him? 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the plot-

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. STOCKADE - MOMENTS LATER

           Job has Jim up against the wall, a pistol pressed into his 
           forehead. 

                                 SILVER
                        Job, don’t shoot the lad; we have 
                        an arrangement. 

                                 JOB
                        You’re not Cap’n no more, you got 
                        no claim to makin’ arrangements. 

                                 SILVER
                        You have me there. I’ll speak fast.
                                 ACHILLE
                        Speak. 

                                 SILVER
                        I have the map. Hawkins took it on 
                        himself to cut loose the ship last 
                        night, and he stowed it away, 
                        conveniently close to where the 
                        treasure is laid up -

                                 ACHILLE
                        The ship!

                                 SILVER
                        Aye, the ship. So this mornin’ the 
                        cry was “all is lost” now; “all is 
                        found.” So my proposal is this. You 
                        take back your black-spot, and John 
                        Silver leads this band. Hawkins 
                        jine’s with us, and leads us back 
                        to the ship. 

                                 JOB
                        Oh he’ll lead us to the ship, don’t 
                        you worry about that...

           The muzzle presses a harsh indent into Jim’s forehead.

                                 ACHILLE
                        I accept. 

                                 JOB
                        What!

           Achille and Job share a look, something John doesn’t miss. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        The gold, the ship, and us back at 
                        sea where we belong before sunset 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 SILVER
                        A bargain. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        If there’s no gold, by all the 
                        gods, you’ll get no black spot. No 
                        more articles. No more rules. 

           He draws his cutlass, and draws a thin line of blood on his 
           palm with it. He throws the blood on the ground between them. 

                                 ACHILLE (CONT’D)
                        Attibon Legba. (a voodoo curse)
           Achille’s eyes promise a painful death. Job releases Jim. 
           Silver favors him with a private wink. 

           EXT. STOCKADE - NIGHT

           The goat has been barbecued, the crew fed, watered and even a 
           thin ration of rum. 

           Morgan and Low are asleep. Bible-Dick is awake, propped up by 
           the fire. Achille and Job are no where to be found. 

           Jim sips from a cup of rum. His face contorts, before he 
           passes the mug on to John as he massages his stump of a leg. 

                                 SILVER
                        Feel it still, I do. Phantom pains 
                        they call it.

                                 JIM
                        How did it happen? I mean really. 

                                 SILVER
                        The true story? 

           Dick looks up, curious. 

                                 JIM
                        The true story. 

                                 SILVER
                        Ach, the lies are more interestin’. 

                                 JIM
                        I want to know. 

                                 SILVER
                        First thing that I should tell you; 
                        I’ll never repent my ways. Not like 
                        that rotten excuse for a pirate you 
                        seen hang in Bristol. Not me. See, 
                        I went to sea at 16, sailin’ the 
                        triangle. British goods, for 
                        African slaves, slaves for rum and 
                        sugar- an’ if that’s honest trade, 
                        I’ll be a liar, thank you kindly. 
                        When I caught on with Flint, I was 
                        proud to call myself a gentleman of 
                        fortune. A Pirate. I am what I am. 

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        Pride goeth afore destruction. 
                                 SILVER
                        And so it did, Dick. “Damn King 
                        George”, was Flint’s toast.

           Silver hoists his cup to shipmates long dead. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        “Damn King George” Says I one 
                        night, in a tavern on Trinidad. I 
                        was drinkin’ and setting a course 
                        to my other favorite occupation of 
                        the time; whoring. Only, I was 
                        overheard. A bastard privateer by 
                        the name of Webb. Called me out on 
                        my toast, he did. We went to 
                        swords, over the good name of the 
                        bastard German King of bastard 
                        England. 

           Silver SPITS rum into the fire, making it flare. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        It was a poor affair as duels go, 
                        He ran a gouge through my thigh, 
                        and I a cut across his cheek. 
                        Nothin’ much to it, really. Back 
                        inside I went, finished my 
                        drinkin’, and with a bandage on my 
                        thigh, went about my whoring. By 
                        the time I got to a doctor, 
                        gangrene had set in. ‘Nothing for 
                        it’ says he, and off it went. 

           It all sounds too pathetic to be anything but true. Silver 
           laughs at the stupidity of it all. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Now you see why I lie? 

           EXT. SPIT - NIGHT

           Achille and Job are walking the shore, the firelight distant. 

                                 JOB

                        the gold; he’ll be Captain of a

           Job nods, eyes out to sea.

           EXT. SPIT - MORNING

           The MAP - 

           Silver has it on the back of a barrel, the early morning mist 
           still thick about the island. His ‘crew’ are gathered around 
           him, even Dick is on his feet. 

           He points a grubby finger to the chart. 

                                 SILVER
                        Here, us at the stockade. There, 
                        the inlet where Jim beached the 
                        boat, and here, between the rocks 
                        of skeleton island and the three 
                        fingers on Lookout mountain...

           The note is clear: bulk of treasure here.

           EXT. TREASURE ISLAND - MORNING

           Jim works his way North for the second time. Only now, he’s 
           straining at the oars along with Morgan, Achille, and Low. 

           They pull onto a beach in a small cove. The boat is dragged 
           ashore, and Silver steps onto dry land. 

                                 SILVER
                        Job, fetch a length of rope, and 
                        bind up Jim. You can bet his 
                        friends are close by, and he’ll run 
                        for it, first chance he gets. 

           BETRAYED AGAIN. 

                                 JIM
                        But-
                                 SILVER
                        But what? You think because I told 
                        ye a story by the fire that I’d 
                        amend my ways? 

           Rage burns inside of Jim as Job binds his hands. 

                                 JOB
                        Trustin’ a single word that fell 
                        from his lips was your mistake. 

           Silver sets his compass.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - CONTINUOUS

           Job has one hand on Jim’s ‘leash’ and the other on a musket. 
           In front of them, Morgan and Low and Dick carry spades and 
           picks.  

           Achille and Silver are poring over the map. Through a break 
           in the tree canopy, there’s a clear vista to a mountain top 
           ahead: three dead trees like the claws of a dead hand. 

           On the map, an ink drawing of those same three trees is 
           marked ‘Three Fingers’.

                                 SILVER
                        There - you see it. 

           Silver resets his compass, and points them down hill. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Not far now. 

           A glint of light on a crag above gets Silver’s attention. He 
           checks to see if anyone else noticed. They didn’t. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get movin’. 

           He feels Job’s eyes on him, but when he looks back, the 
           glinting is gone.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CRAG - CONTINUOUS

           The glinting light is a SPYGLASS, held in Livesey’s hands, as 
           he scans the pirates below. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        They’ve got Jim. He’s a prisoner. 

           He looks back to Smollet in triumph: “I told you so”.
                                 BEN
                        Won’t be long till they get there. 
                        Won’t be ‘appy when it’s all gone. 
                        Not very ‘appy at all. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Ben, take the doctor and River. 
                        Don’t let us slow you down.

                                 LIVESEY
                        Are you sure? 

                                 SQUIRE
                        Run man!

           Ben scrambles away, Livesey and River drop their gear, taking 
           only their weapons.

           EXT. JUNGLE - LATER

           A broad, shallow, stream flows under the canopy. Hanging over 
           it from a thick tree branch is A SKELETON in an IRON CAGE.

           His arm was bound through the bars, pointing to a THIN PASS 
           between the cliffs on the far bank.

           Silver stops midstream, eye to eye with the corpse. Reaching 
           through the cage he pulls the jaw free, revealing GOLD TEETH. 

                                 SILVER
                        George Allardyce. You remember that 
                        rat-bastard, don’t you Job? 

           Job burns with anger at the very sight of it. 

                                 JOB
                        Who’s pretty now, Georgie?

           He spits onto the skull before dragging Jim across. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM - DAY

           Ben leads River and Livesey to the edge of a strong, rushing 
           stream as it cascades down. 

           Just a few hundred yards downstream, the stream becomes a 
           powerful, 400 foot WATERFALL! 

           Ben pulls a slimy, rotten rope from the ground, and tugs on 
           it. It’s tied off to either bank of the river. 
                                 BEN
                        Hold fast, chums. 

           Livesey hoists his gun and powder up high with one hand, and 
           grabs on with the other, and begins fording the torrent. 

           The tension on the rope lifts it from the mud at the other 
           end; it’s dangerously rotten, fraying against rocky anchors. 

           EXT. CLIFF BOWL - DAY

           Silver leads the others through the narrow pass and into a 
           natural, almost circular bowl in the rocks. 40 ft cliffs 
           surround them on all sides. 

           The mouth of a cave has been covered with the thick timbers 
           of a ship hull. Moss covered, the barrier is strong, with a 
           single, stout door set into it. 

           A stone cairn as been piled up in the center of the bowl, and 
           on it, the skeletal remains of half a dozen men are piled. A 
           dull sword is still stuck in the ground, right through the 
           rib cage of another, long-dead soul. 

                                 JIM
                        What happened here? 

                                 SILVER
                        Never was much for sharing, our 
                        dear old Cap’n Flint. 

           Achille stops Morgan, and points him back at the pass.  

                                 ACHILLE
                        Watch our back. 

           Silver takes the lock-pick from his hat, and starts fiddling 
           the lock. The others crowd around eagerly. 

                                 SILVER
                        Let me have some damn light!

           Silver strains with a lock that hasn’t been greased in 20 
           years. The pick BENDS dangerously, but Silver is patient, an 
           expert, and he jiggles and twists before trying again... with 
           a CREAK of rusty tumblers, the lock finally gives way. 

           John opens the door, and bows theatrically. Job and Low rush 
           in. Achille pats John on the back appreciatively as he goes. 

           Silver backs away from the door. Morgan is looking down the 
           pass only Bible Dick see’s Silver SLIP HIS KNIFE TO JIM. 
                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                           (whispered)
                        Once they find that gold, no one 
                        will be watching. You run for the 
                        Doc.

                                 JIM
                        The Doctor?

                                 SILVER
                        He’s followin’ behind. 

                                 JIM
                        How do you know?

                                 SILVER
                        Seen him. 

           Bible Dick lifts a palsied hand up, pointing to Silver.

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        Even thy brethren have dealt 
                        treacherously with thee!

                                 SILVER
                        Christ almighty. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM - DAY

           Livesey has crossed the stream intact. He takes River’s gear, 
           and helps him up the bank. The rope slackens and tightens 
           with each movement, the rotten-end close to giving way. 

           Ben, half-way across the river, suddenly slips, and all his 
           weight yanks the rope - it gives out, almost pulling River 
           in! Livesey hangs on tight, saving River’s life. 

           Ben is SWEPT DOWNSTREAM!

           Livesey hauls River up, and then runs the opposite bank to 
           see if he can find Ben. But he’s GONE. 

           Emerging from the water, pulling himself, hand over hand, Ben 
           climbs through the current. He slithers up onto a big stone. 

                                 LIVESEY
                        Ben, are you alright!

                                 BEN
                        Down the hill, cross the stream, a 
                        dead man points the way! Go. 

           Livesey and River collect their guns, leaving Ben behind. 
           INT. FLINT’S CAVE - DAY

           Job covers the tarred head of a torch with powder, and sparks 
           it to life with a Flintlock. Holding the light out in front, 
           he leads the way into the deep cave. 

           The follow it back, a slight incline up to a wide, sandy 
           area. It’s empty. 

           A glint gets Job’s attention. Sitting on top of a rock, a 
           SINGLE GOLD REALE - left as a taunt. 

           They don’t believe it. 

                                 JOB
                        Has to be another room, a secret 
                        chamber... something!

           Achille looks around the dark caves, and knows, there is 
           nothing else to find. 

                                 ACHILLE
                        It’s not here. 

                                 JOB
                        Can’t be!

                                 ACHILLE
                        Look around! There’s nothing. It’s 
                        gone. 

           Achille picks up the single Reale. He draws his sword.

           EXT. CLIFF BOWL - CONTINUOUS

           Silver makes a point of seeming to nurse Dick. Hand on his 
           forehead. 

                                 BIBLE-DICK
                        Deceiver of the world; cast out! 

                                 SILVER
                        That’s no way to talk to a friend.

           From the cavern, Job, Low and Achille emerge. 

                                 JOB
                        Silver!

           Job isn’t bothering to wait. He aims his pistol, and FIRES!

           Silver USES BIBLE DICK as a shield. Job’s shot runs true: 
           KILLING BIBLE-DICK with a headshot. 
                                 SILVER
                        HAVE YOU LOST YOUR BUGGERED MIND!

                                 JOB
                        It’s empty John! There’s nothin’ 
                        there, cleaned out!

                                 SILVER
                        What?

           Achille advances towards him, sword up. Silver stands, 
           drawing his own blade. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        This how you want it to go, mate? 

                                 ACHILLE
                        How else could it end?

           Morgan, who wasn’t watching the pass, is KNOCKED ASIDE BY 
           LIVESEY. River steps through, aims his MUSKET, and FIRES!  

           The bullet misses Achille by a HAIR! It RICOCHETS off the 
           cliff wall, WHIZZING across the bowl.

           River charges, bayonet and musket, right at Achille. 

           Livesey and Morgan are ENGAGED in a sword fight already. 
           Their blades clang and scrape with each pass.

           Job is reloading the pistol when Jim frees himself and TAKING 
           THE OLD SWORD from the ground, he charges in at Job. Job 
           reverses grip on the pistol, and draws his long knife, with 
           the other hand, fighting knife and club to Jim’s blade. 

           Low aims his pistol at River, waiting for a clean shot. 
           Silver knocks the barrel aside as he fires, and DRIVES HIS 
           CUTLASS THROUGH LOW - 

           River is the better fighter, despite Achille’s power. Using 
           the musket like a fighting spear, he blocks, strikes and 
           parries in a wicked exchange with Achille.

           Jim is SWASHBUCKLING across the bowl with Job, neither able 
           to get an advantage. Job twists away from a thrust, the point 
           catches in the stones of the cairn. With a hard blow, he 
           SHATTERS Jim’s sword with the butt of his pistol!

           The Doctor and Morgan tie up their blades, and Morgan tries 
           to knee him in the groin. Livesey PUNCHES out with the bell 
           guard. Once, twice, three times he batters Morgan’s face, 
           then RUNS HIM THROUGH. 
                                 LIVESEY
                        Bastard!!! 

           River stuns Achille with a blow from the stock, and tries to 
           drive the bayonet through him. Achille drops his sword, and 
           grabs the gun, pushing the point down into his own THIGH!

           He HEADBUTTS RIVER brutally, and with the shock, and the gun, 
           trapped by Achille’s thigh, River is momentarily stuck. 
           Achille CHOPS OFF HIS ARM, and with a GROWL OF PAIN, he pulls 
           the bayonet from his thigh. 

           River falls back, his arm severed above the elbow!

           Silver attacks Achille before he can recover his cutlass. 
           Achille ducks two attacks, giving ground as Silver attacks. 
           Achille times it right catching Silver’s sword arm, and KICKS 
           HIM TO THE GROUND. 

           Jim catches Job’s blade arm under his left. He tries to stab 
           out with the wickedly sharp point of the broken blade. 

           Job catches his wrist, and holds it back. They’re tied up. 
           Jim trips Job, they both fall, and as they do, Jim falls on 
           the hilt of his broken sword. It drives into Job’s ribcage!

                                 JOB
                        You go to hell, Jim bloody Hawkins!

                                 JIM
                        Ladies first. 

           Job’s eyes widen, and then go blank.

           Achille recovers his sword as Livesey attacks him. For a few 
           precious moments, Livesey has the upper hand. His precise 
           attacks and Achille’s wounded leg give him the advantage. 

           Until Achille grabs Livesey’s blade with his off hand, 
           shredding his palm. He knocks Livesey unconscious with the 
           pommel of his sword. 

           Achille never sees Jim coming - 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Doctor!

           Achille turns around in surprise, sword held high. Jim 
           plunges the knife toward his guts. Achille grabs Jim’s wrist 
           just as the blade penetrates. He tries to chop with the 
           sword, but Jim blocks his arm. 

           Achille’s grip is bloody, it slips, letting the blade in 
           deeper. He tries to back up, Jim follows him, step for step.
           Achille grimaces, tearing the blade free, and opening a deep 
           gash under his ribs. He throws Jim aside. 

           Jim bravely holds the knife out in defense. 

           He doesn’t have a chance.

           KRA-KA-KOWWW! 

           Silver has Job’s pistol in his hand, the barrel smoking.

           Achille looks down, a gaping hole in his chest. He falls. 

           OVERHEAD SHOT: LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN on the bowl, scattered 
           among the skeletons, the corpses of the newly dead makes for 
           a gruesome tableau. 

           Silver crawls to standing, and hops over to Jim. He doesn’t 
           notice the SQUIRE as he enters the bowl. Silver takes 
           Achille’s sword from his palm, and leans down to make sure 
           Jim’s alive. 

                                 SILVER
                        Jim-lad, you still with us? 

                                 JIM
                        I think so- where’s the Doctor?

           From the Squire’s perspective, it looks like Silver’s going 
           to kill Jim. He aims down his musket, and FIRES. 

           Silver is hit in the arm, and knocked down next to Jim.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        JOHN!

           Jim starts trying to tend to Silver as the Squire, Ben and 
           Smollet run over. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        What did you do?

                                 SQUIRE
                        I-

                                 JIM
                        He saved me!

                                 SQUIRE
                        You were his prisoner!

                                 JIM
                        No, you don’t understand!
           EXT. STOCKADE (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           We’re back to the handshake-

           Silver spits in his hand, and holds it out to shake. Can Jim 
           trust him? 

                                 SILVER
                        Here’s the plot- this ain’t gonna 
                        work unless they think I’ve turned 
                        on ye again. 

           EXT. TREASURE ISLAND (FLASHBACK) - DAY

           Rage boils as Job binds Jim’s hands. 

                                 JOB
                        Trustin’ a single word that fell 
                        from his lips was your mistake. 

           EXT. CLIFF BOWL - CONTINUOUS

           Silver opens his eyes as Jim finishes his tale.

                                 SILVER
                        Jim gamed it perfect. Right up to 
                        the wind. ‘Course he had a good 
                        teacher. 

                                 SQUIRE
                        It was a ruse?

                                 SILVER
                        I knew if you saw Jim in trouble, 
                        you’d come runnin’. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Why would you want us runnin’ in? 

                                 SILVER
                        Achille and Job had thrown in 
                        against me. I needed you.

           Silver stares hard at Ben. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        Ben Gunn? It can’t be!

                                 BEN
                        Wind in my sails yet, John.  
                                 SILVER
                        I’d give an arm and a leg to know 
                        where that gold was.

                                 BEN
                        Marooned for stealin’ a hundred 
                        guineas; now Ben has it all!

           Livesey comes over, and kneels next to Jim.  

                                 LIVESEY
                        Best let me take over, Jim. 

                                 JIM
                        Will he live? 

           Livesey cuts the clothes of Silvers wounded arm. Silver looks 
           up at Jim and smiles. 

                                 SILVER
                        Ain’t so easy to kill me Jim, don’t 
                        you-

           He passes out cold. 

                                 JIM
                        John! John wake up, wake up!

           Jim shakes his body, but there’s NOTHING!

           EXT. HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - DAY

           The bow of the ship crashes through the swell of a following 
           sea. 

           A good set of sails is run out, driving the ship onwards. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK/HISPANIOLA (AT SEA) - CONTINUOUS

           Smollet, his arm in a sling, is at the wheel. The Squire 
           reads a book in the shade of the mainsail. 

           Ben Gunn, hair-cut, shaved, in seaman’s trousers and 
           waistcoat, is happily eating from a big block of cheese.

           Livesey and Jim are laughing as they pull on one of the 
           halyards, hoisting another sail. 
           INT. BRIG - CONTINUOUS

           Lying in bed, arm bandaged, a thick lock on the door, Long 
           John Silver is making his final voyage. 

           CU: His HAT hangs on a hook by the door. 

           INT. MAIN HOLD/HISPANIOLA - CONTINUOUS

           Flint’s Fortune has been transferred aboard, chest upon 
           chest, racks of gold bars. 

           EXT. CURACAO - SUNSET

           The Hispaniola navigates its way into the Dutch colonial 
           harbour of Willemstad, on the tropical island of Curacao. 

           Super: Curacao

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           The Hispaniola is tied up to the docks at Curacao, distant 
           music from TAVERNS can be heard, with laughter, and singing. 

           INT. BRIG - NIGHT

           Silver is awake, reading by lamp light in his bunk when the 
           ships bell rings FOUR TIMES. Silver creeps to the door, and 
           listens closely. 

                                 SMOLLET (O.C.)
                        ...your watch, Jim...

           INT. HISPANIOLA, MAIN PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jim is making his way up to the deck, passing Smollet in the 
           hall. Smollet hands him a brace of pistols, which Jim loops 
           over his neck. 

                                 SMOLLET
                        Jim, I... I wanted to say that...

                                 JIM
                        Let’s leave it all on the island, 
                        Captain Smollet, what do you say? 

           Jim knuckles his forehead; Smollet extends a hand to shake. 
           Jim takes it, Smollet’s look says it all; Jim’s earned the 
           respect of his fellows. 
           INT. BRIG - CONTINUOUS

           Silver waits a beat, making sure it’s all clear, before he 
           takes his hat from the peg, and removes the LOCK PICK he 
           keeps hidden in the brim.

           He makes short work of the brig lock, and slips out into the 
           ship. 

           INT. MAIN HOLD - CONTINUOUS

           Silver fills a sea-bag with gold and silver, quickly and 
           quietly dumping the stacks of coins into the bag until it’s 
           almost too heavy to carry. 

           EXT. MAIN DECK, HISPANIOLA - NIGHT

           Jim hears Silver coming up, and draws one of the pistols. He 
           aims directly at Silver as he steals across the deck. 

                                 JIM
                        Hold it. 

           Silver turns to face Jim. 

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Where do you think you’re going?

                                 SILVER
                        Wherever the first ship that’s 
                        leavin’ here happens to be headed. 

                                 JIM
                        And you think I’ll just let you go? 

                                 SILVER
                        I thought we had an arrangement. 

                                 JIM
                        I kept my end-

                                 SILVER
                        Shipped home in irons? Then what? 
                        Admiralty court isn’t going to go 
                        sentence me to a ticklin’. 

                                 JIM
                        Why should they? 

                                 SILVER
                        I told you, Jim, I won’t apologize 
                        for what I am. 
                                 JIM
                        A pirate. 

           Silver nods, and slings his half-leg over the gunwale. Jim 
           fully cocks the pistol, walking closer.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll shoot. 

                                 SILVER
                        Will ye? Now’s the time, cos’ I’m 
                        not sailin’ for England. 

           Jim has tears in his eyes. 

                                 JIM
                        You counted on me being too weak. 
                        You used me. You used me from the 
                        start.

                                 SILVER
                        I counted on ye doing what’s right. 

           Jim releases the hammer on the heavy pistol, and sheathes it.  
           Silver’s about to move, and thinks better of it. 

                                 SILVER (CONT’D)
                        You’re a rich man now. Lotta rich 
                        men would buy a big house, and 
                        spend their days riding horses, and 
                        complainin’ they ‘can’t find good 
                        help nowadays’. Don’t you dare do 
                        it. Sea’s in your blood, Jim, go 
                        where she’ll take you. You’ve only 
                        got but one life; live it. 

                                 JIM
                        Hang king George.

                                 SILVER
                           (big wink)
                        Smart as paint. 

           Silver smiles and lower’s himself to the dock. There’s a 
           croak, a flutter of wings, and Cap’n Flint flies down from 
           the mast to John’s finger. 

                                 CAP’N FLINT
                        Up your arse. 

           Silver and Jim share a last grin. Then he turns and walks 
           away. Thump-step, thump-step. Jim watches him from the rail. 
                                   Blue (5/4/2015)

           Silver stops under the light of a tavern at the end of the 
           wharf. Nothing more than a silhouette, he waves one last 
           time, and fades into shadow. 

           THE END
