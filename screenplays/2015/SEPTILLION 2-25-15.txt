                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        America owes its existence to the 
                        lottery.

                                                   FADE IN:

           INT./EXT. MCLAREN 12C [DRIVING] - DAY

           A WOMAN flies down a two-lane dirt road in a $250k car that looks 
           like it might actually fly. She’s composed, confident... and not 
           about to slow down for the TRAILER she finds in front of her. 

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        Gambling is in our blood.

           Without checking, the woman swerves into the oncoming lane. She’s 
           racing towards a MACK TRUCK. Locks eyes with the driver. He’s half-
           pissed, half-terrified. She smiles a MEGA WATT SMILE -- and he’s 
           instantly disarmed. She pulls back easily in front of the trailer.

           You’ve just met JOY TAYLOR. Or you would have if she slowed down. 
           But that’s not really how she’s built.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Joy pulls into an ND lot. Steps out and surveys her surroundings. 
           She’s an exceptional figure in an unexceptional place.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        England held its first lottery in 
                        1612 -- in order to fund the first 
                        colony in America.

           AN AMERICAN FLAG, hanging from the store, flaps in the breeze. 
           Above it, a flag for the LONE STAR STATE. Joy strides past them --

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        In 1776, when Washington was 
                        outgunned and outmanned, what did 
                        he do? He held a lottery to pay for 
                        cannons and uniforms. It turned the 
                        tide of the war.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Joy enters. We see a LOTTO POSTER inside -- TEXAS MILLIONS.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        England won America with a lottery. 
                        And lost her with a lottery.
                        (beat)
                        Like I said, gambling’s in our blood.

           Joy steps up to the counter. Joy clocks the lotto poster. The 
           clerk clocks her clocking it.
                                 CLERK
                        How many you want?

           Joy once again flashes that MEGA WATT smile.

                                 JOY
                        All of them.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Joy shoves a GIGANTIC ROLL OF TICKETS into her car trunk. Then 
           another. And another. She slams the trunk shut.

           INT. JOY’S HOME OFFICE - DAY

           If you had a Beautiful Mind but bought everything on Etsy, you’d 
           get something like this place. There are charts and ledgers that 
           almost look like art objects.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        The lottery is the American Dream 
                        in miniature.

           Joy picks up one of the massive TICKET ROLLS. She holds it with 
           reverence, then sets it down on the floor -- like a wheel -- and 
           gives it a PUSH. The tickets unravel in a long line.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        An opportunity to hope for another 
                        life, a brighter future.

           Joy withdraws a vintage RABBIT’S FOOT from her pocket. She 
           massages it in her hand -- for luck, we assume -- as she slowly 
           walks down the line of tickets.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        And, like the American Dream, it 
                        takes work. It takes investment...

           Finally, she comes to a stop in front of ONE TICKET. She leans 
           down and detaches it from the line. Then begins to scratch it...

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        And, yes, it takes a bit of luck.

           One Armadillo. Then two. Three. Four. Five. In a row. It’s a GRAND 
           PRIZE WINNER. And then we see the amount -- $8 MILLION.

           How did she know? Who the fuck is Joy Taylor?

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        My job? My job is to make sure that 
                        little piece of the American Dream 
                        stays fair. To ensure that, even if 
                        the odds are long, they’re even. 
                        For everyone.
           EXT. SMALL CONVENIENCE STORY - AUSTIN, TEXAS - DAY

           We finally glimpse, CLARK, our narrator to this point. His last 
           name’s HAUSER -- but think Clark Kent. If he ditched the glasses, 
           got a haircut, and hit the gym for a week, Clark might turn in to 
           Superman. Clark is usually the smartest man in the room... and 
           doesn’t get why this bothers people.

                                 CLARK
                        People like you are why I get up in 
                        the morning.

           PAN to a TATTOOED CLERK, who’s been the audience for Clark’s 
           sermon. They’re leaning against a concrete wall, waiting... for 
           what we don’t yet know.

                                 TATTOOED CLERK
                        Who the hell are you?

           Clark flashes a badge: LOTTERY INSPECTOR.

                                 CLARK
                        Clark Hauser. Texas State Lottery.

           And then we FLASHBACK to how they wound up here...

           INT. SMALL CONVENIENCE STORE - FLASHBACK - MOMENTS AGO

           POV: A lottery card -- but the numbers are out of focus. It might 
           be three 6's -- or is one of them an 8? PULL BACK to REVEAL --

           An OLD MAN in a threadbare coat and thick glasses. It’s clear he 
           spends all his money on tickets -- and he can’t even read them. He 
           hands the ticket back to the TATTOOED CLERK.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Did I win?

           The Tattooed Clerk stares at the ticket, then the old man.

                                 TATTOOED CLERK
                        Sorry, old fella.

           The clerk tosses the ticket into the trash. The old man shuffles 
           out, defeated. The clerk stares after, then reaches into the trash 
           and POCKETS THE TICKET. He turns back to the counter to see -- 

                                 CLARK
                        (smiling politely)
                        Would you mind stepping out from 
                        behind the counter?

           EXT. SMALL CONVENIENCE STORE - PRESENT

           Clark and the Tattooed Clerk continue their uncomfortable wait.
                                 TATTOOED CLERK
                        Aren’t you gonna cuff me or read me 
                        my rights?

                                 CLARK
                        Don’t have the jurisdiction.

                                 TATTOOED CLERK
                        I thought you were a cop.

           Clark tries not to show how much this wounds him. 

                                 CLARK
                        We can just wait in silence.

           Finally, a POLICE CAR pulls up and a DICKHEAD LOCAL COP hops out.

                                 DICKHEAD COP
                        (Texas accent)
                        Well, well. A citizen’s arrest!

           It’s clear Clark and DICKHEAD have history. Dickhead starts to 
           cuff the clerk’s hands behind his back.

                                 CLARK
                        You cuff the first hand in front. 
                        It gives you maximum leverage.

                                 DICKHEAD COP
                        That something you picked up at 
                        Quantico?

           Clark bristles. Dickhead continues talking to the clerk -- but 
           he’s clearly aiming at Clark.

                                 DICKHEAD COP (CONT’D)
                        We don’t do scared straight down at 
                        County anymore, but we got the next  
                        best thing right here. See, Clark 
                        is a cautionary tale.

                                 CLARK
                        This is not appropriate.

           Clark reaches into his pocket and pulls out a TALISMAN that he 
           plays with compulsively when anxious. If we looked closer, we’d 
           notice it’s an FBI CHALLENGE MEDAL, awarded for his work on an op.

                                 DICKHEAD COP
                        Clark used to be FBI. Would stick 
                        his nose in our business, tell us 
                        how to do our jobs.

                                 CLARK
                        You need to complete the arrest and 
                        Mirandize him.
                                 DICKHEAD COP
                        Like that.

                                 CLARK
                        No, you actually need to complete 
                        the arrest and Mirandize him.

                                 DICKHEAD COP
                        Sure thing.

           Dickhead SMACKS the Clerk in the head.

                                 DICKHEAD COP (CONT’D)
                        (to Tattooed Clerk)
                        You have the right not to be a stupid, 
                        thieving piece of shit. Got it?

           Dickhead throws the Clerk into the backseat of his cruiser.

                                 DICKHEAD COP (CONT’D)
                        Being a cop’s not rocket surgery. 
                        Too bad you couldn’t hack it.

           Dickhead peels out, leaving Clark with a faceful of dirt and a 
           fist full of rage. Then Clark turns to his car. Old, brown, boxy. 
           There’s a name for cars like this: Piece of Shit. And adding 
           insult to injury, on the windshield is a PARKING TICKET.

                                 CLARK
                        (to the universe)
                        Oh, come on! I’m in a legal space.

           As MAIN TITLES roll --

           INT./EXT. CLARK’S CAR [DRIVING] - LATE AFTERNOON

           We see Clark drive through downtown Austin. In sharp contrast to 
           Joy’s speeding and weaving, he slows at every yellow light, yields 
           at every intersection.

           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           A cramped, but meticulously organized one-bedroom.

           We find Clark filing the parking ticket away -- next to two dozen 
           others he’s received in the past year. Curious for someone who so 
           diligently follows the rules...

           Clark stares at the clock. Like he’s waiting. And he is. Finally --

           KNOCKING. Clark answers the door, REVEALING MEGAN, Clark’s scary 
           smart 12-year-old daughter, carrying a backpack and a CELLO CASE.

           Clark lights up. In Megan’s presence, he’s noticeably gentler.

                                 CLARK
                        So?
           Megan looks down. Clark assumes the worst. Starts to comfort her.

                                 MEGAN
                        Kidding! I made first cut!

           She jumps up and down, wild with excitement. Clark hesitates, then 
           overcompensates, jumping with her.

                                 CLARK
                        Let me hear what you played.

           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Megan is finishing a piece of music with passion and fluidity -- 
           when she makes a small error. She starts to move on to the end --

                                 CLARK
                        Go back. We do things right --

                                 MEGAN
                        “Or people get hurt.”

           Clark nods, pleased. Megan goes back and plays. During this, 
           Clark’s PHONE RINGS. CALLER ID: MARSHAL’S OFFICE. Megan looks to 
           Clark -- should she stop? Clark shakes his head and sends the call 
           to VOICE MAIL. Megan continues and finishes with a flourish.

                                 CLARK
                        (beaming)
                        You are absolutely getting into 
                        that school.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad, there are like twenty kids 
                        auditioning for each spot.

                                 CLARK
                        So?

                                 MEGAN
                        So I only have a one-in-twenty shot.

                                 CLARK
                        That assumes everyone has an equal 
                        chance. And everyone deserves an 
                        equal chance... But not everyone is 
                        as talented as you.

           Megan smiles. It worked.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        So what shall we do this weekend to 
                        celebrate? LBJ Library? Olive Garden?

                                 MEGAN
                        Actually Nicholas Long is playing 
                        at Dallas Symphony this weekend.
           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark’s on the computer looking up seats. The cheapest left are 
           $175 each. Clark’s eyes widen. He tries to talk himself into it.

                                 CLARK
                        Nicholas Long’s your favorite, right?

           Megan reads the situation and shifts to take care of her father.

                                 MEGAN
                        I can watch him on TV. It’s better. 
                        They do close-ups on the hands. 

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t want you to miss out. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I only get to see you on weekends. 
                        I’d rather just hang out with you.
                        (beat)
                        And, you know, I’m not even sure I 
                        want to go to that school...

                                 CLARK
                        You’re sure. Don’t worry about the money.

           Megan’s clearly still worrying, but she soldiers on.

                                 MEGAN
                        C’mon, I know what we can do...

           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

           Clark and Megan watch an old episode of COLUMBO with rapt 
           attention. Megan hits pause right before the big reveal.

                                 MEGAN
                        It was the gardener.

                                 CLARK
                        Stakes?

                                 MEGAN
                        Dishes.

           They pinky-swear.

                                 CLARK
                        Butler. They showed him dusting in 
                        the library, but he was really 
                        hiding the murder weapon.

                                 MEGAN
                        No way.

           Megan un-pauses. Yep, Clark was right.
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        You really loved working on these 
                        types of cases, didn’t you?

           Clark tries to act nonchalant. He shrugs. But it means “yes.”

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Grandpa’s sorry about what happened.

                                 CLARK
                        He has told me several times that he 
                        is not. But he loves you. And, 
                        wherever she is, your mom loves you. 
                        And I love you. We all love you. 
                        That’s what matters. That and you 
                        doing the dishes tomorrow.

                                 MEGAN
                        After we watch three episodes of 
                        Columbo. Back-to-back.

                                 CLARK
                        Okay -- but I get to be the one 
                        facing the TV.

           Megan laughs, both with -- and at -- Clark.

                                 MEGAN
                        That’s dad humor.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s okay. I’m your dad.

           Megan curls up next to Clark. He covers her with a blanket.

           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT - EVEN LATER THAT NIGHT

           As Megan sleeps, Clark pulls out his phone. Stares at the voice 
           mail from earlier. He clicks PLAY.

                                 MARSHAL CAL FREDRICKS (V.O.)
                        Clark, thanks for applying for the 
                        United States Marshals Service. 
                        Again. Unfortunately, we cannot 
                        offer you a job interview. Again.
                        (beat)
                        It’s not that you’re “radioactive” per 
                        se, but we cannot be the source of 
                        your career rehabilitation. Feel free 
                        to resubmit if things turn around.

           Clark rubs his eyes. He really needs a fucking break.

           EXT. ORSON’S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

           A beautiful, old-money Texas mansion. And then into the frame 
           comes Clark’s POS car. Megan hops out.
                                 MEGAN
                        The next audition round is in two 
                        weeks. We can have parents --

                                 CLARK
                        I’ll be there. With bells on. Or 
                        something less noisy.

                                 ORSON (O.S.)
                        I like the idea of bells. Let’s 
                        people know to walk the other way.

           And that’s how we meet ORSON (60s), Clark’s ex-father-in-law. A 
           powerful state official and an intimidating presence. Think John 
           Huston in Chinatown.

                                 ORSON (CONT’D)
                        Go inside, Megan. Your mother’s on 
                        the phone.

           Megan’s eyes dart between the men in her life.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s okay. Go ahead.

           Megan gives Clark a little wave, then withdraws. Once she’s gone --

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        So how’s it going with her “running 
                        from responsibility” world tour?

                                 ORSON
                        It’s not responsibility she’s 
                        running from.
                        (changing the subject)
                        How do you intend to pay for 
                        Megan’s school?

                                 CLARK
                        I’ll pay for it.

                                 ORSON
                        How? It costs more than you make.

                                 CLARK
                        I used to make more.

                                 ORSON
                        And whose fault is that?

                                 CLARK
                        Yours, Mr. Texas Land Commissioner! 
                        And by the way, you wouldn’t know 
                        anything about these parking 
                        tickets I keep getting?
                                 ORSON
                        Are you sure you want to accuse me 
                        of something? How’d that work out 
                        for you last time?

                                 CLARK
                        Why are you proud of that?

                                 ORSON
                        Always be proud of winning. You 
                        remember that. And you teach it to 
                        your daughter -- or I will.

                                 CLARK
                        I’ll figure out the money. I’m up 
                        for a job. Something that would let 
                        me get back to real investigating --

                                 ORSON
                        There’s that foolish pride. I’ll 
                        pay for Megan’s schooling. 

           We feel the catch coming...

                                 ORSON (CONT’D)
                        Just drop your claim to custody.

                                 CLARK
                        I’ve given up a lot for Megan --

                                 ORSON
                        You’ve given up a lot for you. If 
                        you actually wanted the best for 
                        Megan, you’d stay out of her life.

           Orson walks off, leaving Clark a bit shaken. That can’t be true, 
           can it? Clark nervously fiddles with his FBI MEDAL.

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE - DAY

           The sort of office that explains why most people don’t want to be 
           government employees. No natural light, fluorescent overheads.

           Clark takes a seat at his cubicle.

                                 CLARK
                        Anything new?

                                 JIMMY
                        Is it possible the lottery is a 
                        tool of Red China?

           JIMMY, 25, is Clark’s worshipful deskmate and a fresh-faced 
           rookie. He’s all eagerness and enthusiasm --
                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Also, what makes China red? Is it 
                        cherry? I like cherry.

           And not much in the way of brains. It would be easy for an 
           experienced investigator to lose his temper with Jimmy, but then 
           you’d feel guilty -- like you just kicked a puppy.

                                 CLARK
                        What are you talking about?

           Jimmy play’s Clark’s voicemails. We hear a voice that seems a 
           bit... unstable.

                                 LANTERMAN’S VOICE
                        I have indisputable evidence that 
                        the lottery is being used to bring 
                        diabetes to the inner city.

                                 CLARK
                        Next.

                                 LANTERMAN’S VOICE
                        It’s Margaret Lanterman. I haven’t 
                        heard back. I’m not sure you’re 
                        getting these. Or my letters.

           We see the thick LANTERMAN FILE on Clark’s desk.

                                 LANTERMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I think the Jews could 
                        actually be helpful on this one --

                                 CLARK
                        Are they all her?
                        (off Jimmy’s nod)
                        Delete.

                                 JIMMY
                        She seems like a nice old lady.

                                 CLARK
                        She’s a conspiracy theory wackjob. 

           Clark looks around the office. It’s otherwise deserted.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        And the only person who cares about 
                        what we do. Where is everybody?

                                 JIMMY
                        Staff meeting starts in two minutes.

                                 CLARK
                        Shit. That dog-and-pony show.
                        (off Jimmy lighting up)
                        No, there won’t be ponies.
                                 JIMMY
                        I know, but maybe --

                                 CLARK
                        No dogs either.

           Clark heads for the conference room. Jimmy follows -- but a step 
           behind, mulling something Clark said a moment ago.

                                 JIMMY
                        You really don’t think Vivian cares?

                                 CLARK
                        She’s a career salesman. She only 
                        cares about one thing --

           Jimmy is hanging on Clark’s words -- no idea what’s coming next.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Selling tickets.

                                 JIMMY
                        Then why are we here?

                                 CLARK
                        I know what I did. No idea what 
                        you’re in for.

                                 JIMMY
                        If you find out, will you let me know?

                                 CLARK
                        (beat)
                        Sure thing.

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE / CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The room is packed with friendly-faced, SWEATER-WEARING MARKETERS. 
           Clark and Jimmy, with their dime store suits, stick out. At the 
           front of the room, their boss, VIVIAN WILKES (50). With her big 
           smile and mane of orange hair, she looks like a tabby cat -- but 
           really she’s a shark.

                                 VIVIAN
                        You know what time of the year is 
                        coming up? My favorite time...

                                 CLARK
                        Oh God.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Lotto Con!

                                 CLARK
                        (whispered)
                        Why is she acting like this is a thing?
           PAN to JIMMY, next to him, thrilled.

                                 JIMMY
                        (whispered)
                        Maybe I’ll get to be on a panel.

                                 VIVIAN
                        LottoCon is the premiere event of our 
                        calendar. I know in past years it’s 
                        just been held at a Hyatt, but this 
                        year we’re going to eventize it.

                                 CLARK
                        What does that mean?

                                 VIVIAN
                        We’re going to make it an event.

                                 CLARK
                        I was hoping for more than the 
                        literal definition of the word you 
                        just made up.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Well, someone woke up with an 
                        armadillo in his britches. By 
                        eventize I mean rather than have it 
                        at a Hyatt, we’re going to have it 
                        at the Grand Hyatt. In New Orleans! 
                        And we’re going to announce the 
                        biggest multi-state lotto ever.

           She pauses, looking for applause. The rest of the room gives it to 
           her. Vivian holds up a giant mock-up of the new GAME CARD.

                        As you know, we’re proud to be a 
                        G&T state. We’ve relied on G&T to 
                        print and distribute Texas’ game 
                        cards for the last decade. And 
                        we’ll be partnering with twelve 
                        other G&T states on this record-
                        setting new game.

           We see a MAP of the participating G&T states.

                        It’s called Overnight Success. And 
                        it’s going to have ten grand prizes 
                        of $20 million each.

           Jimmy applauds. She wasn’t looking for it... but she’ll take it.

                        The next month, leading up to the 
                        convention, is all about promotion. 
           Clark looks around, disappointed that this has set the room abuzz.

                                 CLARK
                        Last year, we sold over $3.7 
                        billion in lotto tickets.

                                 VIVIAN
                        (playing to her crowd)
                        It’s a good start, isn’t it?

           They pick up the cue and applaud.

                                 CLARK
                        Sure. But it’s also an incredible 
                        incentive for fraud and corruption. 
                        I’ve filed several reports--

                                 VIVIAN
                        And I will read those reports. At 
                        some point. Probably. But right now 
                        I need you to do background checks.

                                 CLARK
                        Background checks? For what?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Our new campaign! For our part of 
                        selling the multi-state, I want to 
                        choose one recent winner. An average 
                        Joe or Jane who struck it big. That 
                        stuff makes everyone believe they can 
                        be next. But before we put anyone on 
                        a poster, I want you to make sure 
                        they’re not kiddy diddlers or spouse 
                        smackers.

                                 CLARK
                        Did you just re-brand child 
                        molestation and spousal abuse?

                                 VIVIAN
                        No. I did that years ago. Anyway, 
                        Clark, your job is to vet these 
                        prospective poster people.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m an investigator. A former FBI 
                        agent. What you’re asking is not 
                        cracking down on crime -- it’s just 
                        serving the sales force.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Then we’re in agreement.

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE / CLARK’S CUBICLE - LATER THAT DAY

           Clark and Jimmy comb through photos and names of recent winners. 
                                 JIMMY
                        Plum assignment, eh?

           Clark doesn’t look up from the files.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I think I found our poster guy! Check 
                        this out -- a man redeemed a million-
                        dollar ticket after two years. 
                        Apparently he lost it -- and then he 
                        found it. It’s a nice story.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s not. It’s a scam.

                                 JIMMY
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLARK
                        People don’t forget to redeem 
                        winning tickets. And if they lose 
                        them, they don’t sit there in 
                        silence. They complain to us.

                                 JIMMY
                        What does that do?

                                 CLARK
                        Nothing. People still do it. But 
                        assuming the man didn’t file a 
                        complaint -- he didn’t, did he?
                        (off Jimmy’s head-shake)
                        Then he was waiting for potential 
                        heat to die down. Do your homework 
                        and you’ll find someone close to 
                        him worked at a store or at G&T. 
                        It’s a stolen ticket.

                                 JIMMY
                        Huh.

           Well, that was an impressive little Columbo moment. But we can’t 
           tell if Clark’s imagination is overactive -- or if he’s nailed it.

                                 CLARK
                        (seeing Jimmy’s spinning)
                        You haven’t done field interviews 
                        before, have you?

           Clark gathers Jimmy for his version of rallying the troops.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to be talking to some 
                        people who were incredibly lucky --
                        and that luck is about to ruin 
                        their lives.
                                 JIMMY
                        How can winning the lotto be bad?

                                 CLARK
                        Selling lotto is a money-making 
                        proposition because most people 
                        can’t calculate the enormity of the 
                        odds they face. Buying a ticket is 
                        not a sound financial decision. And 
                        the people who legitimately get 
                        lucky enough to win tend to continue 
                        making unsound financial decisions.

                                 JIMMY
                        What are financial decisions 
                        supposed to sound like?

           Ignoring him, Clark splits the stack of winner profiles in two.

                                 CLARK
                        Steel yourself. We’re about to see a 
                        mass of humanity at its most base.

           LOTTO WINNER MONTAGE

           We see highlights from Clark and Jimmy’s interviews --

           INT. COOKIE-CUTTER SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           So new it feels like there should still be tags on everything. 
           Jimmy sits across from a MAN with SILVER FINGER NAILS.

                                 JIMMY
                        What’s wrong with your nails? 
                        They’re silver. Did you paint them?

                                 SILVER NAILS
                        No, it’s just from the tickets.

                                 JIMMY
                        How many have you scratched off today?

                                 SILVER NAILS
                        I haven’t scratched off any in weeks.

           We go off Jimmy’s disturbed look, as we realize the man’s nails 
           have been permanently STAINED by lotto tickets.

           INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY

           Clark jots in a NOTEBOOK as he interviews a heavy, TACITURN WOMAN. 

                                 TACITURN WOMAN
                        I’ve finally been able to start my 
                        own business.

           There’s KNOCKING outside. The woman tries to ignore it.
                                 CLARK
                        You’re not going to get that?

           Still no reaction -- Clark goes to the window. Peers out. Sees 
           three SPEED FREAKS waiting.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        This is a mobile meth lab, isn’t it?

                                 TACITURN WOMAN
                        It’s not that mobile.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           Finally a decent looking home. And a decent looking guy. 

                                 JIMMY
                        So after two years -- where did you 
                        find the ticket?

                                 LUCKY FINDER
                        In my vegetable crisper. Would you 
                        believe that?

                                 JIMMY
                        Are you sure it wasn’t with your 
                        cousin who works at the Owl Mart?

           We read the Finder’s face. He’s caught. Clark was right.

           END LOTTO WINNER MONTAGE

           EXT. ROSALITA MAIN STREET - EARLY EVENING

           Clark arrives in front of VACANT STOREFRONTS. Seems like it will 
           be a challenge just to find some of humanity at its basest... And 
           then Clark notices one business that’s open. “MOM’S DINER.”

           INT. MOM’S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark enters and marches over to the WOMAN behind the counter. 

                                 CLARK
                        Mom?

                                 MOM
                        Son?

           Clark stares at her quizzically.

                                 CLARK
                        The sign outside says -- nevermind. 
                        I’m supposed to meet a woman --

                                 MOM
                        That’s what I was brought up to 
                        believe. But times are changing.
                                 CLARK
                        I’m supposed to meet a specific 
                        woman. In about an hour. Thought I 
                        might grab dinner first.

           Clark sees a sign behind the counter: “Ask about our specials.”

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What do you recommend?

                                 MOM
                        Being a grown-ass man who knows 
                        what he wants.

                                 CLARK
                        (getting with the program)
                        Meat loaf. Mashed potatoes.

                                 MOM
                        Have a seat.

           Clark starts to move towards an empty table when he notices a 
           booth with a man fast asleep -- and wearing a sheriff’s uniform.

           Clark sits across from the SHERIFF (70s, a polar bear of a man). 
           The Sheriff doesn’t notice Clark, so Clark picks up his COFFEE CUP 
           and brings it down on the table. LOUDLY. The SHERIFF instinctively 
           grabs his GUN and sticks it in Clark’s face.

                                 SHERIFF
                        (blinking awake)
                        Where’s my coffee?

           Clark slides it back in front of the Sheriff.

                                 CLARK
                        Would you mind lowering your 
                        weapon?

           The Sheriff blinks at Clark for a second before he realizes --

                                 SHERIFF
                        Fair enough.

                                 CLARK
                        You know anything about a woman 
                        named Joy Taylor?

                                 SHERIFF
                        She just won the lotto.

                                 CLARK
                        That much I know.
                        (flashing his badge)
                        Clark Hauser, Texas State Lottery. 
                                 SHERIFF
                        That come in a Cracker Jack box?

                                 CLARK
                        (pushing past)
                        Does Joy lead a clean life?

                                 SHERIFF
                        Are you asking a personal question? 
                        I don’t like personal questions.

           Clark sees he’s in rocky territory...

                                 CLARK
                        Anything at all you’re comfortable 
                        telling me about her?

                                 SHERIFF
                        I barely know Joy Taylor.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s unusual in a small town.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Not really. She works in 
                        construction. Travels a lot.

                                 CLARK
                        (making note)
                        Construction. May or may not lead 
                        clean life. Religious. Thanks.

                                 SHERIFF
                        What makes you think she’s religious?

                                 CLARK
                        She told me to meet her at church.

                                 SHERIFF
                        On a Monday night? That’s not 
                        ‘cause she’s religious...

           INT. ROSALITA COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER

           An apple-cheeked REVEREND (40ish) speaks from a stage.

                                 REVEREND
                        Matthew 25 speaks of a man who 
                        entrusted unto each of his servants a 
                        bag of gold. The first two invested 
                        wisely but the third replied, “Lord, 
                        I was afraid and hid thy gift in the 
                        earth.” The man replied, “Thou wicked 
                        and unprofitable servant. Cast ye 
                        into outer darkness!”
                        (beat)
                        And now, bingo.
           REVEAL CLARK in the audience, at a folding table. He’s one of 
           dozens of identical islands in this sea. 

                                 REVEREND (CONT’D)
                        And now, to call numbers, our lady 
                        of luck -- Joy Taylor.

           JOY enters to warm applause. She seems shy and overwhelmed by the 
           response. And then she breaks out that MEGA-WATT SMILE... and 
           Clark almost forgets where and who he is.

                                 JOY
                        Okay, everyone, first round of 
                        bingo cards is on me. Also the 
                        second. And the one after that.

           Even bigger applause. Joy makes her way down the center aisle of 
           the Church. People line up on either side of the aisle and wait 
           for her to hand them cards as she passes. She reaches the row 
           Clark is in and attempts to give him a card, but Clark demurs.

                                 CLARK
                        None for me.

                                 JOY
                        You come to bingo and you don’t 
                        want to play bingo?

                                 CLARK
                        I’m not here for bingo, I’m here 
                        for you.

           Well, that came out more intense than he meant it. Or maybe not.

                                 JOY
                        I consider marriage proposals and 
                        babies for blessing at halftime.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m Clark Hauser. From the Texas 
                        Lottery.

                                 JOY
                        Of course. I’m happy to speak with 
                        you, but I’m kind of in the middle 
                        of something. 

           A large man pushes his way in front of Clark, cutting the line of 
           people waiting for cards.

                                 CLARK
                        Excuse me, I was here.

                                 CUTTER
                        I just want my card.
                                 CLARK
                        I understand that you’re “jonesing” 
                        -- but it’s not your turn.

                                 CUTTER
                        You’re not even taking a card.

                                 CLARK
                        It could be construed as a bribe. 

                                 JOY
                        (trying to defuse)
                        Then you’re welcome to pay for it.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s against regulations for state 
                        employees to play games of chance.

                                 JOY
                        Life is a game of chance.

                                 CLARK
                        Not the way I play it.

                                 JOY
                        Perhaps you can participate another 
                        way --

           Before Clark can inquire, Joy addresses the whole room --

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        We’re joined tonight by Clark 
                        Hauser of the State Lottery and 
                        Bingo Commission. He’s gonna make 
                        sure there’s no funny business.

           The crowd applauds Clark. He waves, tries to roll with it.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        (playfully, to Clark)
                        Watch out. Some of these bingo 
                        bitties are vicious.

           INT. ROSALITA COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER THAT EVENING

           Joy and Clark sit on stage. The Reverend rotates the wheel, Clark 
           pulls the numbers, then hands them to Joy who calls them.

                                 JOY
                        (into mic)
                        I-26.
                        (to Clark)
                        I’ve never been vetted before.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s a thrill for me, too. 
           Clark passes a clipboard to her.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Can you sign these forms?

                                 JOY
                        Financial disclosures? Am I running 
                        for president?

                                 CLARK
                        Just need to know if you’ve 
                        declared bankruptcy, have crippling 
                        debt. Stuff like that.

           Joy thinks. Shrugs. Signs. Clark takes back the form.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever been arrested?

                                 JOY
                        You don’t know that already?

                                 CLARK
                        If I did, I’d still ask you. To see 
                        what you’d say.
                        (beat)
                        But, no, I can only see if you’ve 
                        been convicted of anything. I’m 
                        asking if you’ve ever been arrested.

                                 JOY
                        (trying to lighten the moment)
                        Never had the pleasure.

                                 CLARK
                        (too serious)
                        It’s not pleasurable. 

                                 JOY
                        (matching his tone)
                        I believe you.
                        (into mic)
                        0-74.

                                 CLARK
                        Do you play lotto a lot?

                                 JOY
                        I do.

                                 CLARK
                        How many tickets do you buy at a 
                        time?

                                 JOY
                        Sometimes a dozen. Sometimes more.
                                 CLARK
                        And why do you play?

                                 JOY
                        What do most people say?
                        (into mic)
                        G-56.

                                 CLARK
                        Fun. Hope. Addiction.

                                 JOY
                        They say addiction?

                                 CLARK
                        Sometimes.

                                 JOY
                        I guess I just like playing.

                                 CLARK
                        I’ll put you down for “fun.”

           Clark starts to write in his notebook.

                                 JOY
                        No. Hope.

           Clark changes what he’s writing. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe addiction.

           Clark looks up. Not happy.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re addicted?

                                 JOY
                        Maybe I’m just compulsive. Like you.

                                 CLARK
                        What makes you say that?

           Joy shoots him a look: “C’mon.”

                                 JOY
                        (into mic)
                        N-42.

           An OLD WOMAN yells out “BINGO” and rushes the stage.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        How’s it look, inspector?

                                 CLARK
                        Verified.
           The Reverend hands her a prize.

                                 REVEREND
                        Thanks for playing. That’s the last 
                        game of the night.

           The crowd starts filing out.

                                 CLARK
                        You know, 3% of all bingo revenue 
                        is to be remitted to the state.

                                 JOY
                        Most of these people are old, 
                        unemployed, or both. But if you 
                        want to put your hand into their 
                        pockets, go right ahead.

                                 CLARK
                        (his version of a compromise)
                        Make sure you record all winnings 
                        on your W-2.

           The winner doesn’t hear Clark, she’s too busy celebrating.

           Clark gathers his things. But as he goes, he notices MICHELLE 
           lingering. She’s staring at her card, fighting back tears.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You okay, miss?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I didn’t win.

                                 CLARK
                        Most people don’t...

                                 MICHELLE
                        But I had to. I just needed 
                        something to go right. 
                        (off Clark’s look)
                        We’re three payments behind. A lot 
                        of people around here are behind, 
                        but we got unlucky. Our bank got 
                        bought out by a bigger bank and 
                        that bank is taking our farm.

                                 CLARK
                        You don’t have the papers with you, 
                        do you?

           Michelle quickly snatches them out of her purse and hands them to 
           Clark. Clearly she hasn’t stopped obsessing over them.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Let me take a look.
                        (long beat as he reads)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        They haven’t produced the original 
                        note.

                                 MICHELLE
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLARK
                        What you signed originally. The new 
                        bank needs it to foreclose -- and 
                        they don’t have it. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Isn’t that a technicality?

                                 CLARK
                        The bank expects you to be bound by 
                        rules -- they should be, too.
                        (beat)
                        It’s not a permanent solution, but 
                        it will buy you time. A few weeks. 
                        Maybe longer. Is that long enough 
                        for you to --

           Clark doesn’t even finish the sentence. Already the tears she was 
           holding back are flowing. But now they’re clearly tears of joy.

           RACK FOCUS. We realize Joy, standing in the doorway on her way 
           out, has taken in the whole interaction.

           EXT. ROSALITA MAIN STREET - LATER THAT EVENING

           As Clark walks to his POS car, Joy catches up to him.

                                 JOY
                        You know why I keep playing, Clark? 

                                 CLARK
                        (quoting her)
                        “Fun. No hope. Maybe addiction.”

                                 JOY
                        Because of my father. He bought me 
                        my first ticket. It was something 
                        we could do as a family.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s a lovely story for a poster. 
                        It’s also a crime. You can’t play 
                        the lottery in the state of Texas 
                        until you turn 18.

                                 JOY
                        Rules are very important to you, 
                        aren’t they?

                                 CLARK
                        Rules are important to all of us.
                                 JOY
                        But in very different ways.

           She extends her hand. Clark shakes it. Then she leaves and he 
           turns around to find another unwarranted PARKING TICKET.

                                 CLARK
                        Come on, Orson!

           Clark climbs into his POS car. Carefully adjusts his rear mirror. 
           Then the driver’s side. As he adjusts the passenger’s he sees --

           JOY. Pulling alongside. In her McLaren.

                                 JOY
                        By the way, how did I do? With the 
                        vetting. How do I look?

                                 CLARK
                        Like a million bucks.

           Joy smiles and speeds off. As she goes, Clark snaps a PHOTO.

           INT. VIVIAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vivian is behind an imposing desk. And behind Vivian is a wall 
           covered with photos of her with a lot of famous assholes.

           She holds Clark’s file on Joy.

                                 VIVIAN
                        She’s the one.

                                 CLARK
                        Something’s off about her.

                                 VIVIAN
                        She plays the lotto. Of course 
                        something’s “off” about her.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s more than that.

                                 VIVIAN
                        You can have ‘til the end of the 
                        week to finish vetting her. After 
                        that, I call G&T and we start 
                        printing posters with this gorgeous 
                        face on them.

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE / BULLPEN - DAY

           Clark and Jimmy sit at their desks. Now Jimmy has the file, as 
           Clark keeps trying to put his finger on what’s off. 

                                 JIMMY
                        She’s hot.
                                 CLARK
                        She doesn’t fit the profile of most 
                        lottery winners.

                                 JIMMY
                        Because she’s hot?

                                 CLARK
                        Because she’s bright, articulate, and 
                        not nervous about being interviewed.

                                 JIMMY
                        So she’s too perfect for the poster?

                                 CLARK
                        Yes.

           Jimmy has started looking through her file. Holds up the PHOTO 
           Clark took of Joy in her MCLAREN.

                                 JIMMY
                        See right here? She bought a flashy 
                        car, that’s pretty typical.

           Jimmy looks more closely at the picture. Notices something weird.

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        Although it’s a couple years old.

                                 CLARK
                        You know about cars?

                                 JIMMY
                        (innocent)
                        You don’t?

                                 CLARK
                        (beat)
                        Cars are not my favorite.

           Clark looks at the photo again.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        But, wait, you’re saying she bought 
                        a used car. That’s prudent.
                        (beat)
                        Lotto winners are not prudent. 

           Clark’s wheels are turning.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Why would she have done that? Too 
                        much debt to buy a new car. Did we 
                        get her financials back yet?

           Jimmy opens his FILE DRAWER. Clark is aghast at the mess. 
                                 JIMMY
                        I have a system.
                        (combing through)
                        Here it is.

           Clark snatches it from Jimmy’s hands. Peruses quickly...

                                 CLARK
                        No debt. No liabilities. But she 
                        listed the car as an asset. Last year. 
                        She bought it last year.

           Jimmy, as usual, is a step behind.

                                 JIMMY
                        How could she afford that?

           Clark keeps paging through. Something catches his eye. He turns 
           around the file to Jimmy. We see a very large number.

                                 CLARK
                        Because three years ago she earned 
                        over $5 million!

                                 JIMMY
                        From what? Her job?

                                 CLARK
                        In construction? I don’t think so.

           Clark picks up his phone. Starts dialing a number. Jimmy starts to 
           ask what Clark is up to, but Clark waves him off.

           INT./EXT. CLARK’S CAR [DRIVING] - THE NEXT DAY

           As Clark cruises back down to Rosalita, we hear the phone 
           conversation that got us here...

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        Hello, Ms. Taylor? This is Clark 
                        Hauser. From the Lotto. You made the 
                        first cut for the ad campaign, and I 
                        had a few follow-up questions...

           EXT. DIRT FIELD - DAY

           Clark spots Joy on the edge of a DUSTBOWL FARM -- devoid of crops, 
           but packed with people. Clark pulls next to her and exits.

                                 CLARK
                        Is this your farm?

                                 JOY
                        No. It’s Michelle’s.
                        (off Clark’s blank stare)
                        From bingo. The one you advised 
                        about her mortgage.
           Joy points. Michelle’s in the distance, sitting on a TRACTOR. She 
           sees Clark and waves. He waves back.

                                 CLARK
                        How boring is this town? 

                                 JOY
                        Like a 7. But it grows on you.

                                 CLARK
                        Is there really a crowd gathered to 
                        watch her plow? 

                                 JOY
                        No. There’s a crowd gathered to 
                        watch her race.
                        (beat)
                        Mind if we walk and talk?

           As they fall into stride, approaching the crowd...

                                 CLARK
                        I wanted to ask you about your 
                        financial reporting. Ms. Taylor --

                                 JOY
                        You can call me Joy.

                                 CLARK
                        Joy --

                                 JOY
                        (warmly)
                        Say it enough you may even feel it.

           They’ve arrived at Joy’s McLaren... which a MECHANIC is currently 
           harnessing a plow to.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re racing Michelle. Is this a 
                        bucket list thing?

                                 JOY
                        No. It’s a bet. Michelle said my 
                        car was weak and for girls.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s strong -- and for girls.

                                 JOY
                        She said it was weaker than her 
                        tractor.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s definitely weaker than a 
                        tractor.
                                 JOY
                        Let’s just see how the bet goes. If 
                        I win, she gives me her tractor. 
                        She wins, I pay her $100k.

           Michelle pulls alongside.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Ready to lose?

                                 JOY
                        Not gonna happen!

           Joy climbs into her car.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Any more questions?

                                 CLARK
                        Are you going to buckle up?

           Joy smiles warmly, strapping herself in.

                                 JOY
                        Is that really what you came all 
                        this way to ask me?

                                 CLARK
                        Three years ago, you earned over $5 
                        million. What was the source?

           Joy turns the ignition. The crowd shifts, clearing a path.

                                 JOY
                        The source?

                                 CLARK
                        Where did it come from?

                                 JOY
                        Oh. I won the lotto.

                                 CLARK
                        You won a lotto jackpot before?

                                 JOY
                        Actually two. This is my third.

                                 CLARK
                        And why didn’t you mention that?

                                 JOY
                        You didn’t ask.

           And before Clark can follow up on that explosive revelation, 
           there’s an actual explosion as a STARTER PISTOL FIRES. Clark turns 
           and sees the SHERIFF with pistol in hand...
           Joy takes off, her car REVVING like a motherfucker, then 
           ACCELERATING smoothly, the plow coming along for the ride. 
           Michelle is well behind her. Is there a chance Joy might do this?

           Then, Joy’s plow digs in, the McLaren bucks up, and the SUSPENSION 
           SMASHES into the ground. SPARKS fly. And the BACK BUMPER SPLITS 
           OFF -- along with the plow.

           Joy SLAMS on the brakes and SPINS, barely avoiding flipping. 
           Michelle keeps chugging along. Slow and steady wins the race.

           As the crowd rushes to help Michelle celebrate, Clark heads for 
           Joy. She still hasn’t emerged. As Clark waits anxiously, he turns 
           over his FBI MEDAL in his hand. And then --

           The car door opens. Joy jumps out.

                                 CLARK
                        Are you okay?
                        (off her silence)
                        Ms. Taylor?

                                 JOY
                        Joy.

                                 CLARK
                        Joy --

                                 JOY
                        (smiling)
                        Are you feeling it yet?

           Clark can’t help laughing. Once it’s clear she’s okay...

                                 CLARK
                        Not to say I told you so, but -- 
                        you lost.

                                 JOY
                        (casual)
                        Yeah, it’s a shame.

           Clark clocks Joy, looking almost happy as Michelle celebrates. And 
           then it sinks in.

                                 CLARK
                        You took a bet you knew you’d lose?
                        (off Joy’s smile)
                        That’s not normal. And neither is 
                        winning the lottery three times.

                                 JOY
                        I got lucky.

                                 CLARK
                        Three times.
                                 JOY
                        Michelle got unlucky more times 
                        than that.
                        (beat)
                        Your bureaucratic loophole bought 
                        her some time, but she was going to 
                        lose the property eventually.

                                 CLARK
                        If you were going to throw money at 
                        the problem, why not just give it to 
                        her? That would have been easier. And 
                        more direct. And your car would still 
                        be in one piece.

                                 JOY
                        You’re very direct, Clark. Have you 
                        found that always works for you?

                                 CLARK
                        That has not been my experience, no.

                                 JOY
                        If I offered Michelle money, she would 
                        have refused. It would have embarrassed 
                        her. You inspired me to come up with a 
                        more creative solution.

           Then she says something that really gets him --

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        We’re not that different, Clark. We 
                        both believe justice is a virtue. I 
                        just don’t think patience is.

           And with that, Joy walks off, leaving one hell of an impression.

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE / BULLPEN - THE NEXT DAY

           Clark, back in business mode, has just finished updating Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        She’s won the lotto before?

                                 CLARK
                        This is the third time. In three 
                        different states.

                                 JIMMY
                        Wow. She must be really lucky.

                                 CLARK
                        Lucky? You know the odds of winning 
                        three jackpots? 

           Clark grabs a SCRATCHER TICKET off a pile on Jimmy’s desk. Clark 
           flips it over and points at the FINE PRINT.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        The odds of even one win are 100 
                        million-to-one --

                                 JIMMY
                        So it’s 300 million-to-one!

                                 CLARK
                        No. It’s 100 million times 100 
                        million times 100 million.

           Clark grabs a calculator and demonstrates. The result has a whole 
           helluva lot of zeroes.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        It’s more likely that you’d 
                        randomly type Hamlet. 

                                 JIMMY
                        Why would you randomly type Hamlet?

                                 CLARK
                        If you were a monkey.
                        (off Jimmy’s confusion)
                        You know that hypothetical where a 
                        room of monkeys typing forever 
                        eventually produces Hamlet?

                                 JIMMY
                        No, but I’d love to see it. Is a 
                        monkey playing Hamlet?

           Clark refuses to engage this line any further.

                                 CLARK
                        What she’s done is not possible.

                                 JIMMY
                        Then how did she do it?

                                 CLARK
                        (trying not to lose it)
                        By cheating.

                                 JIMMY
                        Right. Cheating. How?

                                 CLARK
                        That’s what I’m going to find out. 

           Clark walks off with confidence building. It’s almost a physical 
           transformation. He looks taller, stronger, sexier. We’re getting a 
           window into how he must have been at the FBI.

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE / HALLWAY

           As Clark walks, he makes a quick phone call...
                                 CLARK
                        Hello, Marshal Fredricks? I know 
                        you told me not to reapply until my 
                        fortunes have changed. I believe 
                        they’re about to.

                                 MARSHAL’S VOICE
                        (dry)
                        You win the lotto?

                                 CLARK
                        Sorta. I’m on to a major case. The 
                        kind that could generate good press.

                                 MARSHAL’S VOICE
                        How good?

           We can hear the shift in attitude. Clark has his attention.

                                 CLARK
                        A fraud case spanning multiple 
                        states and millions of dollars.

                                 MARSHAL’S VOICE
                        If you solve a multi-state fraud 
                        involving millions of dollars of 
                        cash... yeah, I can get you a job 
                        interview.

           INT. VIVIAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark enters, riding the wave of confidence.

                                 CLARK
                        We have to find someone other than 
                        Joy Taylor for this campaign.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Why? She’s perfect.

                                 CLARK
                        This is her third lotto win.

                                 VIVIAN
                        She won three times?!

           Clark is finally getting the reaction he’s looking for --

                                 VIVIAN (CONT’D)
                        She shouldn’t just be on a poster -- 
                        we should have her at the convention!

           Or maybe not.

                                 CLARK
                        What?! She’s clearly cheating.
                                 VIVIAN
                        Or she’s “The luckiest woman in Texas.”

                                 CLARK
                        You cannot possibly be serious. Do 
                        you have any idea how statistically 
                        insane this is?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Not really. But I know how insanely 
                        good she’ll look on the poster!

                                 CLARK
                        Why are you doubling down on this? Why 
                        would you invest in such a risky --

           Clark reads Vivian’s reaction and realizes --

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You’ve already submitted her as our 
                        official state choice.

                                 VIVIAN
                        And mocked up the poster and 
                        invited her to the convention.

                                 CLARK
                        Why would you have done that? I was 
                        supposed to have until the end of the 
                        week to finish vetting candidates.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Clark, it’s not that I don’t take 
                        your work seriously -- I just don’t 
                        really factor it into what I’m doing.

                                 CLARK
                        You have to uninvite her.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I am not embarrassing myself in 
                        front of those other states. 
                        (under her breath)
                        Especially those bitches from Oklahoma.

                                 CLARK
                        You know what the most common type 
                        of player fraud is?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Cheating?

                                 CLARK
                        (shaking his head)
                        It’s all cheating. The most common 
                        type of player fraud is facial 
                        manipulation.
           CLARK’S VISION OF THE CRIME

           For the first time -- but not the last -- we see Clark imagine how 
           Joy might have pulled it off.

           (Note: These sequences have a poppy, Instagrammed quality.)

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Joy sits at a makeshift workbench, like the one where you’d 
           picture Steve Jobs making the first Apple computer. 

           She examines a scratched-off lotto card under a microscope and 
           then, with a fine laser-pen, changes a “1” to a “7”. It’s 
           seamless. Joy examines her handiwork. She’s pleased.

           END CLARK’S VISION

           INT. VIVIAN’S OFFICE - PRESENT

                                 VIVIAN
                        So you don’t mean she manipulated 
                        her own face.

                                 CLARK
                        (beat)
                        No. The face of the ticket.

           Clark can see the technical route isn’t going to work.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        If you won’t uninvite her, at least 
                        send me to G&T. I’ll figure out how she 
                        did it before you print the posters.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Why do you want to go to G&T?

                                 CLARK
                        All her tickets were printed in 
                        states G&T handles.

                                 VIVIAN
                        So what? They handle half the 
                        states in the country.

                                 CLARK
                        And they’re handling the upcoming 
                        multi-state. Wouldn’t it be 
                        embarrassing if Joy Taylor spoiled 
                        this event that you’ve... eventized?

                                 VIVIAN
                        (on guard)
                        How would she spoil it?
                                 CLARK
                        If you featured her -- in front of 
                        everyone -- and she turned out to 
                        be worse than Thompson --

                                 VIVIAN
                        That spouse smacker!

                                 CLARK
                        If your poster girl turned out to 
                        be a giant cheater -- well, what 
                        would those Oklahoma --
                        (struggles with the word)
                        Bitches -- say then?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Fine. You can go to G&T 
                        headquarters. But Clark, these are 
                        important people. I don’t need you 
                        rubbing them the wrong way.

                                 CLARK
                        How would I do that?

                                 VIVIAN
                        By being you.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (PRE-LAP)
                        Hi. Howdy. Konichiwa.

           INT. WHITE EXPANSE - DAY

           We’re CLOSE ON the face of courtly cowboy SAM ELLIOTT (70).

                                 SAM ELLIOTT
                        That’s Japanese. We do business in 
                        Japan. Love isn’t the international 
                        language. Lottery is. That’s what 
                        we know here at G&T.

           We pull back to find Sam in a corporate dreamscape.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        Since 1982, G&T has been printing, 
                        innovating, and safeguarding the 
                        lottery across 24 states and 13 
                        countries. What do we mean by 
                        printing? Odds are if you buy a 
                        lottery ticket --

           Sam stops. Chuckles to himself.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        Odds are. Get it? Odds are, we 
                        printed it.
           Sam stops alongside a massive printing press, rolling off sheets 
           of shiny new tickets.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        What do I mean by innovation?

           One of those shiny tickets appears in Sam’s hand. Magical-like.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        Well, these little dream makers 
                        don’t grow on trees. Someone at G&T 
                        thought up each game for you.

           Sam walks on and stops in front of a closed white door.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        As for safeguarding, you see into 
                        that room behind me?

           No, we don’t.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        Good. Because that’s the Ice Box. 
                        That’s where a computer determines 
                        the winning tickets. It works off a 
                        secret, proprietary formula that 
                        not even the people here at G&T 
                        have access to. So you can be 
                        assured, this here lotto is as 
                        legit as they come.

           Sam has walked us back to the desk area. Seated on the edge of a 
           desk is JIM SANDERS. 50s. Salt-n-pepper fox in an impeccable suit.

                                 SANDERS
                        Hi. I’m Jim Sanders. CEO of G&T. 
                        And we’re committed to giving back 
                        more than just a good time. Take 
                        our home state -- Texas. Last year, 
                        7.4 million Texans bought nearly 
                        $1.5 billion -- that’s billion with 
                        a “b” -- scratch-off tickets. We 
                        printed all of ‘em. And Texas 
                        schools took home nearly $500 
                        million in the bargain. 

                                 SAM ELLIOTT
                        That’s some purdy ‘rithmetic.

           Awkward cut in the video. We’ve clearly leapt forward.

                                 SAM ELLIOTT (CONT’D)
                        Well, I should be going. I’m not 
                        saying to buy a lottery ticket, but --

                                 JIM SANDERS
                        I am.
           Some forced laughter between them.

                                 SAM AND JIM
                        Goodbye, now!

           We pull back to find --

           INT. G&T / RECEPTION AREA - SIMULTANEOUS

           Clark is seated in a waiting area, where he’s been watching the 
           G&T corporate video. Behind Clark, at a welcome desk, is a very 
           ENTHUSIASTIC MALE RECEPTIONIST. He speaks into his headset.

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTIONIST
                        (re: Clark)
                        He’s done. 
                        (beat)
                        I think he did like it. I’ll tell 
                        him you’re on your way.
                        (to Clark)
                        Mr. Hauser, Mr. Sanders --

                                 CLARK
                        Is on his way?

                                 ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTIONIST
                        (surprised that Clark intuited)
                        Yes!

           And like that Clark finds himself pulled into a tight handshake 
           with JIM SANDERS. Direct, friendly, corporate.

                                 SANDERS
                        Welcome to G&T. I want to thank you 
                        for bringing this matter to our 
                        attention. I assure you, security 
                        is paramount to us. I don’t take 
                        chances, I sell them.

                                 CLARK
                        I was told you could show me Joy 
                        Taylor’s other winning tickets.

                                 SANDERS
                        We keep excellent records of 
                        winners. Brunson will be able to 
                        help you.

                                 CLARK
                        Who?

           And that’s when Clark meets the man standing behind him.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Scott Brunson. Director of 
                        Security. You ain’t gonna find 
                        nothin’ that got by me.
           Clark laughs. BRUNSON (30s) is portly, proud, and stone-faced.

                                 BRUNSON (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious.

                                 SANDERS
                        I leave you in good hands.

           INT. G&T / TICKET VERIFICATION OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           What you’d picture if you thought of CSI: Lottery. A hub of phone 
           calls and forensic activity, with specialists at workstations. 

                                 BRUNSON
                        This is the department of ticket 
                        verification.

                                 CLARK
                        I thought we were the department of 
                        ticket verification.

                                 BRUNSON
                        That’s cute. We pulled and compared 
                        all three of the winning tickets.

                                 CLARK
                        Any signs of facial manipulation?

           Brunson produces a folder with copies of Joy’s winning tickets. 

                                 BRUNSON
                        We checked them before. We checked ‘em 
                        again. Each and every one genuine.

           Clark is more than a little disappointed.

                                 CLARK
                        If she didn’t alter the tickets, 
                        she must have infiltrated the 
                        printing or distribution process.

                                 BRUNSON
                        You assume she’s cheating. When you 
                        assume it makes an ass out of you --

                                 CLARK
                        And me.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Yes. You.

                                 CLARK
                        O-kay. You have a computer that 
                        determines the winning tickets. 

                                 BRUNSON
                        Yes. The Ice Box.
                                 CLARK
                        Were all the games Joy won 
                        determined by this Ice Box?

                                 BRUNSON
                        All our games are.

                                 CLARK
                        Who has access to the Ice Box?

           CLARK’S VISION OF THE CRIME

           EXT. G&T - NIGHT

           We see JOY, dressed like a cat burglar, casing the complex. She’s 
           fast, stealthy, and pretty damn sexy.

           INT. G&T / THE ICEBOX - MOMENTS LATER

           An empty, white computer room -- think MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. And 
           then one of the ceiling tiles slides as Joy lowers herself -- 
           Mission: Impossible style. As Joy winds up suspended, horizontal --

           END CLARK’S VISION

           INT. G&T / OUTSIDE THE ICE BOX - PRESENT

           Clark and Brunson have arrived outside the Ice Box’s door.

                                 CLARK
                        Can I see inside?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Nope. Essential personnel only.

           Brunson gestures to the security pad outside the door.

                                 BRUNSON (CONT’D)
                        But I can tell you all comings and 
                        goings are logged. And there’s been 
                        absolutely nothing suspicious.

           Brunson clearly means for this to end the conversation. Clark 
           can’t help asking the follow-up.

                                 CLARK
                        How does the Ice Box work?

                                 BRUNSON
                        It randomizes the tickets. 

                                 CLARK
                        Well, not randomizes. Scratch-off 
                        lottos aren’t strictly random. The 
                        grand prizes have to be distributed 
                        throughout the run. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        Because if they were all found 
                        within the first week of a run -- 
                        well, nobody would buy the rest of 
                        the tickets.

                                 BRUNSON
                        (chafing)
                        Mm-hmm.

                                 CLARK
                        So you use some sort of random 
                        number generator. Which, despite 
                        its name, isn’t truly random.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Are you here to ask questions or 
                        tell me things I already know?

           Clark realizes he’s falling into the patterns Vivian warned of.

                                 CLARK
                        Sorry. How do you ensure the 
                        computer runs algorithms as random 
                        as possible?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Shut up.

                                 CLARK 
                        Excuse me?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Just shut the hell up for a second.

           Clark shuts the hell up for a second.

                                 BRUNSON (CONT’D)
                        Hear that?
                        (Clark doesn’t)
                        That’s room tone. Every room has one 
                        based on size, shape, acoustics. 
                        That tone is one of a kind.

                                 CLARK
                        Like my fingerprint?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Like your voice. Only the tone of 
                        this room doesn’t make me want to 
                        piss down your throat.

                                 CLARK
                        Do you talk to everybody this way? 
                        Because that would make sense. You 
                        don’t know me. So it doesn’t make 
                        sense for it to just be --
                                 BRUNSON
                        It’s you.
                        (beat)
                        The computer takes an occasional 
                        audio snapshot of the room tone and 
                        uses the frequency to start 
                        sequencing.

           (NOTE: This is actual technology used by the lottery industry.)

                                 CLARK
                        (nods, takes it in)
                        Why is it just me?

                                 BRUNSON
                        I run security for the largest legal 
                        gambling operation in the world, and 
                        I don’t need some desk-humper 
                        looking over my shoulder.

           Clark responds with eerie calm.

                                 CLARK
                        Totally. Makes sense. What about 
                        the other tickets?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Excuse me.

                                 CLARK
                        Joy’s other winning tickets. She 
                        told me she’d buy dozens at a time. 
                        A committed lotto player like that 
                        isn’t just going to win jackpots. 
                        She’s also going to collect a bunch 
                        of smaller wins. And your boss just 
                        told me you keep excellent records 
                        of winning tickets, so -- what 
                        about Joy’s other winning tickets?

           Brunson pauses. Stares at Clark. We can’t tell if he wants to take 
           Clark’s head off or tip his hat. Maybe both.

           INT. G&T / SECURITY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           On a large WALL SCREEN, we see an outline of the United States -- 
           and several dozen small dots. These are the stores where Joy 
           purchased winning tickets. And they seem to radiate out in three 
           distinct lines -- like branches from a tree.

                                 CLARK
                        When you look beyond the jackpots and 
                        include all the smaller wins... it 
                        looks like there’s a pattern.
                        (pointing)
                        Do those lines correspond with 
                        distribution routes?
                                 BRUNSON
                        I have no idea.

                                 CLARK
                        Can you pull the distribution info?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Nope. It’s a double blind.
                        (off Clark’s look)
                        The tickets are printed locally at 
                        our regional distribution centers. 
                        Then the trucking companies pick 
                        them up. We don’t know which boxes 
                        are headed to which stores. And the 
                        trucking companies don’t know which 
                        tickets are in which box. 

           Clark looks deflated.

                                 BRUNSON (CONT’D)
                        So you see, Mr. Hauser, there’s no 
                        vulnerability for her to exploit.

                                 CLARK
                        So how do you explain her success?

                                 BRUNSON
                        I don’t have to. That’s your job.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m going to do my job. I’m even 
                        going to do yours.
                        (as Brunson fumes)
                        Have I rubbed you the wrong way? Is 
                        there some other way I should have 
                        rubbed you?
                        (beat)
                        I’m gonna go now.

           INT. CLARK’S CAR - DAY

           Clark’s on the phone calling his office.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m gonna stake out the stores. 
                        Look for a pattern myself.

                                 JIMMY
                        Can I help?

           Clark tries to be nice -- and get rid of him -- at the same time.

                                 CLARK
                        You already have.

                                 JIMMY
                        Awesome. How?
                                 CLARK
                        (beat)
                        Phone’s dying. Gotta go...

           STAKEOUT MONTAGE

           We see the same U.S. MAP that Brunson showed Clark at G&T. Each 
           location Clark visits is one of the dots on the map.

           Clark winds up in Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, etc. We see the 
           environs turn from rural to urban, dusty to snowy, rocky to lush.

           At each store, Clark waits patiently until he sees a TRUCK show up 
           and a DRIVER unload tickets. Clark carefully records a description 
           of each driver in his notebook.

           At the fourth store, we see a DRIVER we’ve already seen. 40ish. 
           Tall, broad-shouldered, facial hair. Clark eagerly records this.

           A couple of stores later, Clark sees him again. Is this our guy? 
           Clark waits until the driver leaves, then enters the 7-11 himself.

           Clark walks up to the desk clerk and flashes his credentials.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        The driver who was just here. 
                        What’s his name?

           The Clerk points to his delivery log-book. Just signed by... 
           THOMAS LINDEN.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE / CLARK’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Clark is poring over papers with Linden’s name all over them. In 
           the background, we hear the voice of the conspiracy theorist, 
           LANTERMAN, as she leaves another voice mail.

                                 LANTERMAN’S VOICE
                        ... it explains everything that 
                        happened with the Supreme Court 
                        since the Reagan administration...

                                 JIMMY
                        You sure you don’t want to pick up?

           Clark shoots him a look -- he’d rather hug his father-in-law.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m trying to focus. Thomas Linden. 
                        He’s Joy Taylor’s inside guy.

                                 JIMMY
                        But we haven’t found any link 
                        between them.
                                 CLARK
                        Keep looking. It’s there. 
                        Somewhere. I know it.

           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Clark is at his kitchen table, engrossed in the same papers, 
           looking for that link. In the background, we can hear Megan 
           playing. The music stops. A beat later, Megan enters.

                                 CLARK
                        Semifinal auditions are coming up.

                                 MEGAN
                        Two days.

                                 CLARK
                        I know. I’ll be there.

                                 MEGAN
                        I know. But right now I need a 
                        break. And I think you do, too.

           Megan opens the fridge.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s make cookies.

                                 CLARK
                        Can’t. Working.

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine. I’ll just eat cookie dough.

                                 CLARK
                        (aghast)
                        Do you know how many people 
                        contract salmonella every year?

                                 MEGAN
                        Six?

                                 CLARK
                        144,000.

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine.

           Megan closes the fridge. Clark realizes how that must have 
           sounded. His demeanor softens.

                                 CLARK
                        We can make cookies. As soon as you 
                        finish your homework.

                                 MEGAN
                        No homework. My teacher was sick.
                                 CLARK
                        With what?

                                 MEGAN
                        Salmonella.

                                 CLARK
                        (perking up)
                        That’s so validating.

           Clark stands, goes to the fridge. As soon as he opens it --

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine, I’ll go do my homework.

           Clark is floored.

                                 CLARK
                        You bluffed me?

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m sorry.

           But Clark doesn’t seem angry or even disappointed. Instead he 
           kisses Megan on the forehead and clumsily attempts to twirl her. 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad, what are you doing!?

                                 CLARK
                        Joy doesn’t know that I haven’t been 
                        able to find the link between her and 
                        the driver.

                                 MEGAN
                        So, what, you’re going to bluff 
                        her? I thought you never lied.

                                 CLARK
                        I never break the rules. But 
                        investigators are allowed to 
                        mislead -- if it’s in the service 
                        of something greater.

                                 MEGAN
                        So can I not do my homework in the 
                        service of something greater?

                                 CLARK
                        Absolutely not.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE / MISSOURI - DAY

           We PAN from the clean, recognizable lines of the GATEWAY ARCH -- 
           to a pile of rubble several miles away. An active construction 
           site. Clark finds Joy -- in her element in a hard hat.
                                 JOY
                        Fancy meeting you here.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s not fancy. It’s a construction 
                        site.

                                 JOY
                        I know. I work here.

                                 CLARK
                        I know. I called your boss. That’s 
                        how I tracked you down.

                                 JOY
                        I got your boss’ invite to that 
                        lotto convention. What should I 
                        wear? As far as skin-to-dress ratio 
                        -- is it more cocktail party or 
                        boat show? Wait, it’s New Orleans -- 
                        I could just rack up some beads.

                                 CLARK
                        I wouldn’t count on being there. We 
                        don’t usually feature thieves.

                                 JOY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CLARK
                        I know about you and Thomas Linden.

           Clark looks for her reaction, but Joy gives nothing away.

                                 JOY
                        Who?

                                 CLARK
                        He’s the driver who delivered tickets 
                        to the stores where you won. You were 
                        in it together. You paid him off.

                                 JOY
                        I have no idea who you mean.

           Clark won’t let it go. He pushes the bluff further.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re a very attractive woman --
                        (off her look)
                        Objectively. Your facial 
                        proportions are very close to the 
                        golden ratio of 1:1.6.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you?
                                 CLARK
                        And it would stand to reason that 
                        you might leverage those looks.

                                 JOY
                        Do you hear how that sounds like 
                        you just went from calling me 
                        attractive to calling me a whore?

                                 CLARK
                        No.
                        (a beat)
                        Okay, now I kinda hear it.

           Clark takes out his notebook. Again the MAP with her wins.

                                 JOY
                        I didn’t realize you were so artistic.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re the one making the patterns. 
                        (pointing to map)
                        These are your wins. Why are they 
                        spread this way?

                                 JOY
                        I travel for work. I buy tickets 
                        wherever I go.

                                 CLARK
                        In a geographically suspicious 
                        pattern?

           Joy looks at Clark and speaks earnestly, without judgment.

                                 JOY
                        You really believe life is a 
                        mystery, and if you can just put 
                        the pieces together, everything 
                        will be solved.

                                 CLARK
                        (quickly)
                        Yes.

                                 JOY
                        That must be a nice way of seeing 
                        things. Very simple. Very comforting.
                        (beat)
                        Can I borrow your pen?

           Joy draws a line through several of the dots on Clark’s map.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        That’s the Balcones fault line.
                                 CLARK
                        Huh?

                                 JOY
                        My job takes me along that fault. 

           As Joy draws more lines, connecting the dots better than Clark --

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Also the Humboldt. Long Point-
                        Eureka. And the Marianna.

           Clark looks around the building site. It’s not adding up for him.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re wearing a hard hat, but you 
                        have no tool belt. Don’t take this 
                        the wrong way, but aren’t you 
                        somewhere between a glorified Girl 
                        Friday and middle management?

                                 JOY
                        How could I take that the wrong way?
                        (beat)
                        I work with tools, Clark. Just not 
                        ones that go in a belt.

           Joy walks over and grabs an ORANGE, HARD-PLASTIC BRIEFCASE.

                                 CLARK
                        What is that?

           Joy opens it, revealing a control panel.

                                 JOY
                        A reflection seismograph. It sends 
                        a sound pulse into the ground to 
                        detect fault lines. Like sonar.

                                 CLARK
                        A reflection seismo--

                        I work at a construction site. But 
                        I’m a seismologist, Clark.

           Joy hands Clark her card: SEISMOLOGIST. VECTRONIX CONSTRUCTION.

                        You deal with earthquakes? What, 
                        you earthquake-proof buildings?

                        Part of my job is assessing seismic 
                        damage from fracking. Then there’s 
                        soil liquefaction -- a big concern 
                        in Texas.

                        Not to mention coastal subduction 
                        which is grossly misunderstood. 
                        That’s part of what I studied at

                        (off Clark’s look)
                        You know, earthquake-proofing.

           Clark is gob-smacked. And maybe also the tiniest bit turned on.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        So now that the pieces fit together 
                        -- how do you feel? Comforted?

           Clark shakes his head. No. Joy pivots the conversation.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not from Texas, are you?

                                 CLARK

           Clark looks at Joy. Surprised.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You’re fiddling with an FBI medal. 
                        You do that when you’re nervous.

           Clark looks down. Realizes she’s right.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Why aren’t you FBI anymore?

                                 CLARK
                        I picked a fight. I was on the right 
                        side. Turns out -- also the losing side.

                                 JOY
                        Then why’d you stay in Texas?

                                 CLARK
                        For my daughter. If I wasn’t going 
                        to live under the same roof, I was 
                        going to be as close as I could.

           This answer surprises Joy. And her genuine reply surprises Clark.

                                 JOY
                        She’s lucky to have a father like 
                        that. Someone willing to take a 
                        shitty job just to be near her.
                                 CLARK
                        It’s not always a shitty job. 
                        Sometimes I get to meet interesting 
                        people. Like you -- and Mr. Linden.

                                 JOY

                        I don’t know Thomas Linden. I 
                        didn’t conspire with him. And I 
                        didn’t cheat.

           Clark stares at her for a long beat.

                                 CLARK
                        I. Don’t. Believe. You.

                                 JOY
                        One of these days Clark, you’re 
                        going to wonder what it feels like 
                        to be on the winning side.

           STAKEOUT MONTAGE #2

           Clark zeroes in on Linden, tracking him during his day-to-day. We 
           see Clark in his car:

           - Begin following Linden outside Linden’s home in Colorado.

           - Watch Linden make deliveries across the map.

           - Observe Linden take his lunch at a truck stop. Alone.

           - Fiddle with his FBI medal -- a few times.

           - Follow Linden into a grocery store. After Linden makes a drop-
           off, he knocks a CAN off a shelf. A customer picks it up and holds 
           it out to him. Clark moves closer -- is this cover for a handoff? 
           Nope. It’s just a good Samaritan helping out.

           - Watch Linden take his lunch at a truck stop in Oklahoma. Alone.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. CLARK’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Clark is parked, looking through the diner window as Linden 
           lunches. Clark is tired, frustrated. His phone beeps. It’s an 
           ALARM. Megan’s semifinal audition is in four hours.

           Clark throws the car in reverse, looks over his shoulder, and 
           starts to pull out. But when Clark’s head swivels front again, he 
           sees someone joining Linden for lunch. Clark almost forgets to 
           step on the brakes when he realizes it’s SCOTT BRUNSON.

           INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark charges in, wagging his finger at Brunson.
                                 CLARK
                        J’accuse!
                        (off Brunson’s look)
                        It’s French.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Blow me! It’s also French.

                                 CLARK
                        You were the inside man. You 
                        facilitated all of this. Delivering 
                        the tickets to Joy and taking a 
                        nice fat cut. That’s why you were 
                        such a dick to me. Not because 
                        you’re incompetent but because 
                        you’re corrupt!
                        (beat)
                        Maybe also incompetent.

                                 BRUNSON
                        You are going to eat those words.

           INT. G&T / CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Clark sits on one side, across from Brunson, Sanders, and Vivian. 
           A dour lineup. Clark looks down at his words to Brunson. Printed.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Do it.

                                 CLARK
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 SANDERS
                        Do it.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m late for a very important--

                                 VIVIAN
                        You want to get there and still 
                        have a job? Do it!

           Clark thinks about Megan’s audition. Steels himself. Then CRUMPLES 
           THE PAPER... AND PUTS IT IN HIS MOUTH.

           Once Sanders sees Clark chewing -- and hating each bite -- he 
           slides a DOSSIER across the table.

                                 SANDERS
                        Brunson was just doing his job. 
                        After you expressed your suspicions, 
                        he came to me for permission to 
                        break the double-blind.
                                 CLARK
                        (still chewing)
                        So you weren’t colluding with 
                        Linden, you were --

                                 BRUNSON
                        Investigating him.

                                 CLARK
                        And?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Nothing!

                                 CLARK
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 BRUNSON
                        Because I didn’t have to. Because I 
                        didn’t want to. Because I had a hunch 
                        that your hunch was full of shit.

           Clark finally swallows the paper.

                                 CLARK
                        Maybe Linden checked out, but Joy 
                        doesn’t. There’s just no way.

                                 SANDERS
                        When you’re dealing with numbers 
                        this large, strange things happen.
                        (quoting himself)
                        Last year, in Texas alone we sold 
                        over 1.5 billion -- with a “b” -- 
                        tickets.

                                 CLARK
                        And the odds of this naturally 
                        occurring are one in eighteen 
                        septillion. With an “s”. You know 
                        how big that number is? In between 
                        it and the billion you’re so proud 
                        of is a trillion, with a “t”, a 
                        quadrillion and a quintillion, both 
                        with a “q”, and a sextillion, which 
                        despite the look on Brunson’s face, 
                        is not a sexy cotillion. 

           Clark stands. He holds up his hand as though he had something tiny 
           pressed between his thumb and forefinger. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        One in eighteen septillion. 

           As Clark speaks, we see the IMAGES he describes:
                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        Imagine planet Earth... 

           We see a SATELLITE IMAGE OF EARTH.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        ...was one, endless beach.

           The water is replaced by land. Sandy. White.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        It would contain about one 
                        septillion grains of sand.

           We plunge through the troposphere, towards that planet -- and a 
           beach which hits us like a WHITE OUT. 

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        Now imagine that somewhere on that 
                        endless beach there was a single 
                        grain of golden sand.

           Amidst the vast whiteness, we see a glimmering, GOLDEN SPECK. And 
           then a woman appears -- it’s JOY. And she’s dressed like she’s 
           with James Bond at a Monte Carlo casino.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        Imagine trying to find that speck. 
                        Impossible? Well Joy Taylor didn’t 
                        just imagine it. She did it.

           Joy’s hand traces along the sand.

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        Only her endless beach wasn’t the 
                        size of just one planet earth -- it 
                        was the size of eighteen of them. 

           We see EIGHTEEN SATELLITE IMAGES OF PLANET EARTH -- side by side. 
           Suddenly, they’re jammed together causing their own BIG BANG. 

                                 CLARK (V.O.)
                        One in eighteen septillion. Those 
                        are the odds.

           And on the other side of the explosion, we see JOY, holding that 
           single grain of golden sand -- pinched between her two fingers.

                                               MATCH CUT TO:

           Clark, in the conference room, making the same gesture. 

                                 CLARK
                        Or, you know -- maybe she’s just 
                        lucky.

           He looks around the table. It’s working. Time to bring it home...
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        And what if she’s not done yet? 
                        What if she’s planning to win your 
                        new lotto? The biggest one ever.

                                 VIVIAN
                        So what? Everyone wants to win.

                                 CLARK
                        But she’s proven that she can win. 
                        Over and over. Which is why you 
                        have to uninvite her.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I don’t. And I won’t. 

                                 CLARK
                        Then at least send me to the 
                        convention to keep eyes on her.

           Vivian, Sanders, and Brunson pass looks between them.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Fine, you can go. But I’m not paying 
                        for a plane ticket, you can drive. 
                        Remember to save your gas receipts.

           Finally a little light. Clark looks triumphant.

                                 VIVIAN (CONT’D)
                        And, Clark, remember that I was the 
                        only person in the state willing to 
                        take a chance on you. You piss off 
                        one more person --

                                 BRUNSON
                        Or piss me off again --

                                 VIVIAN
                        And you won’t be busting 7-11 
                        clerks, you’ll be one. 

                                 BRUNSON
                        And you know what the highlight of 
                        their day is? Getting shot in an 
                        armed robbery.

           INT. G&T PARKING STRUCTURE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark looks down at his phone. There’s twenty minutes ‘til Megan’s 
           audition time. His heart is pounding.

                                 CLARK
                        Maybe I can still make it.
           Clark hops into his POS and peels through the parking lot, weaving 
           around parked cars. He halts at the TICKET BOOTH at the exit. He 
           feeds his ticket to the automated machine. It spits it back out.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.

           Clark feeds the ticket back in. Again it’s spit out. Clark repeats 
           the process one more time -- finally the machine takes it -- but 
           then nothing happens. The MECHANICAL ARM won’t raise.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, c’mon.

           Clark looks at the booth -- no one’s there.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        (calling out to the universe)
                        Can somebody do they’re damned job!

           Nothing. No one. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Maybe there’s another way out.

           Clark throws the car in reverse, starts to pull back and then --

           -- RIP. POP. HISS. A series of horrible noises. We realize Clark’s 
           just driven over a set of SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE spikes. Clark 
           deflates along with his tires. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        That sucks.

           Clark turns to find the adenoidal ATTENDANT finally on the scene.

           EXT. TEXAS ACADEMY OF PERFORMING ARTS - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Clark’s behind the wheel of his car -- as it’s TOWED to where 
           Megan waits with cello -- and Orson.

                                 ORSON
                        She insisted on waiting for you. 
                        She doesn’t know when to give up on 
                        a loser. But one of these days -- 
                        she’s gonna figure it out.

                                 CLARK
                        (to Megan)
                        I am so, so sorry.

           Megan silently gets into the car. And they’re towed away...

           INT. CLARK’S APARTMENT / BEDROOM - LATER

           Clark is hastily -- and meticulously -- packing a suitcase while 
           Megan is on her laptop.
                                 CLARK
                        I’m so proud of you. You made the 
                        finals. That’s incredible. You are 
                        incredible. And I -- really wish I 
                        could have been there. I’ll make it 
                        up to you as soon as I get back.

                                 MEGAN
                        Or... maybe sooner.

           Megan spins her laptop around.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        You know who’s the paid corporate 
                        entertainment at this lotto 
                        conference? Nicholas Long.

                                 CLARK
                        I’d love to, but you’d miss Friday. 
                        (off Megan’s look)
                        That’s a school day.

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re right. Grandpa wouldn’t like it.

                                 CLARK
                        (”well played”)
                        We’ll have you back for Monday.

           EST. NEW ORLEANS - DAY

           Shots of the downtown skyline, the French Quarter, Jackson Square -
           - landing on the newly restored New Orleans Convention Center.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Clark neatly arranges his clothes on one side of the closet. On 
           the other side, Megan’s cello and a simple overnight bag.

           INT. NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION CENTER - SIMULTANEOUS

           A bustling convention floor -- company booths, demonstrators, 
           spokesmodels, and enthusiasts.

           Clark enters, with Megan in tow, and heads to the REGISTRATION 
           TABLE. He’s greeted by a grinning TABLE JOCKEY.

                                 TABLE JOCKEY
                        Welcome to the 2015 National 
                        Lottery Convention.

           Megan reads the poster next to the table.

                                 MEGAN
                        The Nicholas Long concert isn’t 
                        until tonight.
           Clark hands over his ID to the Table Jockey.

                                 CLARK
                        (no time for chit-chat)
                        When and where is the event with 
                        Joy Taylor?

                                 SWEATER VEST
                        The G&T presentation is in the Ford 
                        Room at 5pm. 

                                 MEGAN
                        (thumbing through a program)
                        Ooh, I think I’ll check out the 
                        Candy Crush-themed games in the 
                        meanwhile.

                                 CLARK
                        Better idea -- you go to the cafe 
                        and do schoolwork -- as if you were 
                        at school.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad --

                                 CLARK
                        And no talking to strangers.

                                 MEGAN
                        That’s everyone.

                                 CLARK
                        Yes, it is.

           Megan heads off for the LUCKY CAFE. Clark takes a step towards the 
           main floor, but he doesn’t get far before--  

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Clark Hauser?

           Clark turns to see a chubby, friendly 50ish REDHEAD -- with a 
           twinkle of crazy in her eyes.

                                 REDHEAD
                        How’s Jimmy? Did he get the 
                        materials I sent?

                                 CLARK
                        He’s fine. I have no idea. Do we 
                        know each other?

                                 WOMAN
                        I’ve left you a few voicemails. 147 
                        to be exact.

                                 CLARK
                        Oh no. You’re not --
                                 WOMAN
                        Margaret Lanterman.

           And there it is. Clark looks for an escape route. Lanterman leans 
           in confidentially.

                                 LANTERMAN
                        You can trust me. I’m on your side.

                                 CLARK
                        I--can’t discuss official business 
                        with civilians.

                                 LANTERMAN
                        But I’m part of the resistance.

                                 CLARK
                        Still. I need to have a look 
                        around. So, maybe we can--

                                 LANTERMAN
                        I’ll be your guide. 
                        (strangely)
                        I’ve been here since the very 
                        beginning.

                                 CLARK
                        (resigned)
                        There’s just no way this isn’t 
                        happening, is there?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        (plowing ahead)
                        The convention is organized like 
                        Dante’s Inferno...

           INT. NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION CENTER / MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           A walk-and-talk on the convention floor. Lanterman has an iron 
           grip on Clark’s arm. He looks ready to gnaw it off. She points to 
           different representative types as she speaks.

                                 LANTERMAN
                        Each concentric ring contains a 
                        different species of corruption. 
                        In the outer circle, you have the 
                        equipment salesmen. Next, the 
                        truckers and distributors. And 
                        finally, the ticket manufacturers. 
                        What do you think is at the center?

                                 CLARK
                        Joy Taylor?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        The pus-filled maw from which all 
                        corruption flows.
                                 CLARK
                        So I was close.

           Lanterman points to the center of the convention floor. Clark 
           follows the line of her hand to... a G&T CORPORATE LOGO. His 
           interest is actually piqued.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What are they doing that’s so 
                        awful?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        They bribe state officials with 
                        boats. They bribe foreign 
                        governments with soccer stadiums. 

           The corruption angle is drawing Clark in.

                                 LANTERMAN (CONT’D)
                        And they’re tunneling into Mexico 
                        in order to capture the chupacabra.

           And now she’s lost him. Just as Clark is trying to excuse himself, 
           a LOTTO ENTHUSIAST walks up and holds out a pamphlet to Lanterman.

                                 LOTTO ENTHUSIAST
                        Would you sign the latest?

           Lanterman politely signs a PAMPHLET.

                                 CLARK
                        What’s that you’re signing?

                                 LANTERMAN

                        Only thing I read.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s awful. Read books. 

                                 LANTERMAN
                        (to enthusiast)
                        Be well, Roger.

           The Lotto Enthusiast takes his leave.

                                 CLARK
                        Is that what you keep sending us?

           Lanterman pulls out a copy. He thumbs through it. Rantings. Wild 
           theories. And then at the back -- tables of information.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?
                                 LANTERMAN
                        I keep track of winners.

                                 CLARK
                        Why?

                                 LANTERMAN

                        just hand the newsletter out?

                        Is Joy Taylor a subscriber?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        No.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re sure?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        I have 714 subscribers. I’ve met 
                        and vetted each and every one.

                                 CLARK
                        And where do you get your info?

           A man in a REVOLUTIONARY WAR COSTUME walks up to Lanterman 
           carrying two enormous bags of garbage.

                                 REVOLUTIONARY
                        Got ‘em, Peggy.

                                 CLARK
                        Is that --

                                 LANTERMAN
                        Convention garbage? We’ve found 
                        some of our best intel this way. 

                                 CLARK
                        Okay. Thanks for the tour, 
                        Margaret. It’s been... eye-opening.

           INT. NEW ORLEANS CONV CTR / LA NOUVELLE BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark takes a seat next to Megan in the audience.

                                 MEGAN
                        Learn anything useful?
                                 CLARK
                        I’m gonna go with “no”.

           Without warning, the LIGHTS SNAP OFF. We’re in darkness.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What the why?

           And then we hear POUNDING MUSIC. We see SEARCH LIGHTS comb the 
           floor. It’s like the start of the NBA ALL-STAR GAME.

           A GLASS CYLINDER RISES in the center of the room, holding a MAN 
           surrounded by hundreds of flying PING-PONG BALLS.

           And then the cylinder’s wall comes down and the balls fly away. 
           The MAN -- G&T’S PRESENTER -- thrusts his hands up. Huge applause.

                                 G&T PRESENTER
                        We don’t do the ping-pong lotto. We 
                        don’t play around with balls. At 
                        G&T, we’re all about scratchers. 
                        Personal. Tactile. Where 1-in-4 
                        tickets is a winner. Where you all 
                        can feel the thrill of being a 
                        winner. Because you all are 
                        winners. Just like this woman --

           Joy enters. Dressed to the nines. Huge applause. Behind her is the 
           mock-up of the JOY LOTTO POSTER.

                                 G&T PRESENTER (CONT’D)
                        Joy Taylor! She’s won the lotto 
                        three times. She’s taken home 
                        almost $17 million. 

           The crowd gasps. On a PROJECTION SCREEN, we see dollar signs.

                                 G&T PRESENTER (CONT’D)
                        What have you done with all that 
                        money?

                                 JOY
                        Fast cars, big homes, jet skis -- 
                        and a little bit in savings.

                        Are you gonna buy one?

                                 JOY
                        (playing along)
                        I’d be crazy not to.

           The crowd laughs, loving her.

                                 G&T PRESENTER
                        (signalling her exit)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Joy Taylor!

           Joy gets exit applause. A few people break away to approach her. 
           Clark stands to follow.

           INT. NEW ORLEANS CONV CTR / BALLROOM / CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark and Megan approach Joy -- who is surrounded by her fans.

                                 MEGAN
                        Maybe your boss was right -- looks 
                        like she’ll sell some tickets.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m not worried about the tickets 
                        she sells. I’m worried about the 
                        tickets she buys.

           Clark and Megan have made their way to the front of the line.

                                 JOY
                        Well, hello again. And who is this?

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m his daughter, Megan.

                                 CLARK
                        What did I tell you about talking 
                        to strangers?

                                 MEGAN
                        She’s not a stranger, she’s the 
                        subject of your investigation.

                                 CLARK
                        Actually she’s the object of my 
                        investigation.

                                 JOY
                        Don’t call women objects in front 
                        of your daughter.
           Clark has no idea how to respond to this.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        (to Megan)
                        I like your hair.

                                 MEGAN
                        I like yours more! I can never get 
                        mine to braid like that.

                                 JOY
                        I can show you.

                                 CLARK
                        Not going to happen. I’ve been over 
                        your financials. You didn’t buy 
                        homes or jet skis.

                                 JOY
                        Just playing to the crowd.

                                 CLARK
                        Why do you live in Rosalita?

           The question catches Joy slightly off-guard.

                                 JOY
                        It’s my home.

                                 CLARK
                        You spend most of your time on the 
                        road. And you have $15 million -- 
                        you can afford something nicer.

                                 JOY
                        It’s not all about money, Clark. 
                        It’s a special place. A place where 
                        real folks live.

                                 CLARK
                        (not buying it)
                        Why do I feel like you’re “just 
                        playing to the crowd”?

           Joy smiles politely, gestures to the people behind Clark.

                                 JOY
                        You’re holding up the line, Clark.

           Clark and Megan head for the exit, but as they’re going, Clark 
           hears something that stops him --

                                 G&T PRESENTER
                        We’ve also introduced a number of 
                        operational changes, including our 
                        version of the big dig. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 G&T PRESENTER (CONT'D)
                        A new fiber optic cable system to 
                        transmit ticket info to regional 
                        distribution centers.

           ON PROJECTION SCREEN: A MAP of the US with a nettle of FIBER OPTIC 
           LINES drawn on it. Clark, surprised, flips open his notebook to 
           the page with the map of Joy’s wins. A lot of overlap.

                                 CLARK
                        Fault lines, my hairy ass.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad!

                                 CLARK
                        Sorry.

           INT. NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION CENTER / MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark and Megan are moving quickly across the floor. Clark has a 
           destination in mind -- but we’re playing catch-up.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad, I don’t want to be late for 
                        the concert.

                                 CLARK
                        We won’t be -- I just have to deal 
                        with -- this.

           Clark stops in front of Margaret Lanterman.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        (to Lanterman)
                        The conspiracy -- I mean the theory 
                        you described earlier, about G&T 
                        tunneling to Mexico, were you 
                        talking about their new fiber optic 
                        cable network?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        Yes. The cover story is that it 
                        connects their top secret super 
                        computer to distribution centers.

                                 CLARK
                        Do you know if --

                                 LANTERMAN
                        (directly to Megan)
                        But in actuality it allows G&T’s 
                        CEO to sneak in a personal army of 
                        Mexican counter-revolutionaries.

           Clark steps in front of Megan.
                                 CLARK
                        I’m trying to believe that you’re 
                        not crazy. Please help me here. You 
                        publish a lot of data in your 
                        newsletter. Does that include the 
                        fiber optic route?

                                 LANTERMAN
                        We’re trying to get it from the sub-
                        contractor G&T hired.

                                 CLARK
                        Subcontractor? Do they have a booth 
                        here at the convention?

                                 G&T PRESENTER
                        No, they’re not in the lotto 
                        industry. It was a construction 
                        company. Vectronix.

           Clark feels a hand pulling at his shoulder.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad, the concert.

                                 CLARK
                        Just one second, honey.

           Clark takes out the card Joy gave him. Same company. VECTRONIX.

           INT. LOUISIANA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA - EVENING

           A cavernous amphitheatre. NICHOLAS LONG (mid-40s, think Yo-Yo Ma) 
           is already doing his thing. He’s very good at it. In the audience, 
           Megan watches with rapt attention, her fingers involuntarily 
           mimicking the master’s.

           Clark, meanwhile, texts Jimmy: “Find out everything you can about 
           Joy’s involvement with Vectronix’s fiber optic...”

           Megan looks over at Clark. She’s not happy with his phone.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad, the light --

                                 CLARK
                        Sorry.

           Clark lowers the phone. Types a couple more words and hits send. 
           Hides the phone before Megan can glare at him.

           EXT. PHILHARMONIC / STAGE DOOR - POST-SHOW

           Clark waits on a long, slow-moving receiving line. At the front, 
           we can see Nicholas Long shaking hands, signing a few autographs. 
           Megan is on cloud nine.
                                 MEGAN
                        Did you notice what he was doing in 
                        terms of the pizzicato?

                                 CLARK
                        The man really knows how to use a bow.

                                 MEGAN
                        That was the part when he was plucking.

           Clark smiles sheepishly. Just then, a CUTTER joins his friend in 
           line in front of Megan.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m sorry I can’t allow that. 

                                 CUTTER
                        Excuse me?

                                 CLARK
                        My daughter has been waiting 
                        patiently, and you’re cheating.

                                 CUTTER
                        Chill out. I was in the bathroom. 
                        My friend was holding my spot.

                                 CLARK
                        We’ve been in this line the entire 
                        time... and you weren’t here. 
                        You’re cutting.

                                 CUTTER
                        What difference does it make? It’s 
                        like ten seconds out of your life.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s the principle.

                                 CUTTER
                        How about the principle of minding 
                        your own eff-ing business?

                                 CLARK
                        I think that principle is trumped 
                        at the moment.

                                 CUTTER
                        Well, I say I was here. Are you 
                        calling me a liar?

           Clark is now tensely playing with his FBI MEDAL.

                                 CLARK
                        That would be an apt description.
                        (off the guy’s “I dare you” look)
                        Yes. You’re a liar.
           And with that, the Cutter hauls off and PUNCHES Clark square in 
           the face. Clark slumps to the floor.

           CLARK’S POV: BLACKNESS. Followed by BLURRINESS. The only sound is 
           RINGING. As things normalize, the first thing we hear is --

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Exactly, then you just tuck that 
                        strand behind the other and --

                                 MEGAN (O.S.)
                        I think I got it!

           Clark turns around to find Megan on the floor with him... and JOY, 
           just behind, literally BRAIDING MEGAN’S HAIR to look like her own. 
           Megan notices Clark coming to and moves even closer.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad, are you okay?

                                 CLARK
                        Not in the least.
                        (to Joy)
                        Unhand my daughter.

                                 JOY
                        Okay, Galahad. Calm down.

                                 MEGAN
                        Dad, she was just --

                                 CLARK
                        She was just tunneling into our 
                        lives just like she tunneled into 
                        the G&T fiber optic network!

                                 JOY
                        I think you got hit harder in the 
                        head than you thought. I’m here 
                        because I’m a music fan. And I 
                        happen to love Nicholas Long. What 
                        he does with his pizzicato...

                                 MEGAN
                        I know! Dad wasn’t I just saying --

           Clark’s face says it all -- are you fucking kidding me?

                                 JOY
                        Clark, you’re bleeding.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s just a --

                                 JOY
                        From your eye.
           Clark puts his hand to his brow, realizes he’s been cut.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m going to go find a bathroom. 
                        You both stay here -- safe and 
                        preferably silent.

           Clark exits.

                                 MEGAN
                        I should go after him.

                                 JOY
                        The bleeding will stop. Eventually.

                                 MEGAN
                        He needs my help.

                                 JOY
                        You two really take care of each 
                        other. But does he always get so...

                                 MEGAN
                        Intense? Yeah.

                                 JOY
                        Has he always been that way?

                                 MEGAN
                        He was in a car accident when he 
                        was fifteen. 

           As Megan explains, we see quick images from that day:

           - Clark is 15. His brother 9. They climb into the backseat of 
           their parents’ car. Their parents call for them to buckle up. His 
           brother starts to, but before he can --

           - Clark SHOVES him. They start rough-housing. Normal kid stuff.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        He and his younger brother were 
                        fighting...

           - Their parents separate them. But they remain on guard -- and 
           UNBUCKLED.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        So they never got their belts on...

           - The car is T-BONED. Clark and his brother are both TOSSED.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        And his brother got badly hurt...

           - We see Clark’s landed on top of his brother, pinning his 
           shattered leg at an impossible angle.
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Since then... following the rules 
                        has been pretty important to him.

                                 JOY
                        (feeling guilty)
                        I really should not have invited 
                        him to that tractor pull.

           Megan spots Clark returning, holding a paper towel to his eye.

                                 MEGAN
                        Please don’t tell him I told you.

                                 JOY
                        (sincerely)
                        I won’t.

                                 CLARK
                        All right, let’s get you that 
                        autograph and then hit the hay.

                                 JOY
                        I’m not so sure about that plan.

           Clark turns to see that the line is gone -- and so is Long.

                                 CLARK
                        I am so sorry.

                                 JOY
                        Don’t worry. He’s just back in the 
                        VIP area. See this --

           Joy holds up her lanyard, pointing to a holographic sticker.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I am a very important person. 
                        C’mon, I can get us all back there.

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh my god! That sounds amazing!

                                 CLARK
                        That’s a very kind offer, but I’m 
                        afraid we can’t accept.

                       JOY
                                               MEGAN
                                                                      #
                                                                      #
           Why not?
                                      Why not?
                                                                      #

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        It could be construed as a bribe.

                                 MEGAN
                        What if you paid her back?
                                 CLARK
                        Still.

                                 MEGAN
                        What if I paid her back?

                                 CLARK
                        It’s not appropriate. 

                                 JOY
                        He’s right. I shouldn’t have offered. It 
                        was very nice to meet you.

                                 MEGAN
                        You, too.

           As Clark and Megan exit, Megan casts a backwards glance.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

           Clark is laying in the bath tub icing his face. We can hear the TV 
           blaring in the other room.

                                 CLARK
                        (yelling)
                        Megan, turn the TV off. It’s past 
                        your bedtime.

           No response. Clark dumps the ice and climbs out. We follow him.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry you didn’t meet him, but 
                        you got to see him play and --

           Clark enters --

           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -- to find Megan nowhere to be seen. Clark stops mid-sentence.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark peeks his head out. The hallway is empty. His stomach drops.

                                 CLARK
                        Oh no no no.

           The usually composed Clark begins to panic. He’s like a chicken 
           with his head cut off. He paces the room frantically, then grabs 
           his phone and dials Megan. Straight to voicemail. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Megan, call me immediately, you’re 
                        in a lot of trouble.

           Clark hangs up. Thinks. Dials Megan again. Once more to voicemail.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t not call me because I said 
                        you were in trouble. Although, 
                        let’s be clear, you’re in trouble. 
                        But call me. That’s top priority. 

           Clark hangs up. Now what?

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark rushes out to his POS car -- only to find a BOOT on it.

                                 CLARK
                        I just fixed that tire. I just 
                        fixed all the tires!

           Clark looks on the dashboard. Another ticket. CAR HAS BEEN 
           IMMOBILIZED FOR FAILURE TO PAY TICKETS. Clark calmly takes this in 
           -- then snaps and begins kicking the shit out of the booted tire.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Does Orson have influence in every 
                        asshole state?

           After he tires himself out, Clark picks up his phone and dials.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        This is all your fault --

           Is he calling Orson?

           INT./EXT. JOY’S CAR [DRIVING] - MOMENTS LATER

           Nope. Clark was calling Joy. And now she’s driving him around (in 
           a rented Porsche Panamera) as they search the French Quarter. 

                                 JOY
                        How is this my fault?

                                 CLARK
                        You made me look like a villain in 
                        front of my kid.

                                 JOY
                        I was just trying to be nice.

           Clark stares out the window at the drunken revelers. He has no 
           idea where Megan is in all the chaos. And that has him terrified. 
           We’ve seen Clark unnerved before, but this is something different. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure she’s fine. She’s a good 
                        kid. She has a good head on her 
                        shoulders. Besides, where would she 
                        go? Does she know anyone here?

           Clark pounds the dashboard, furious with himself.
                                 CLARK
                        (shaking his head)
                        If anything happens to her --

           Words start failing...

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I do this. I --
                        (beat)
                        I push people away. I don’t mean 
                        to. It usually doesn’t happen with 
                        Megan, but --
                        (beat)
                        This is my nightmare.

           Clark reaches for his FBI MEDAL, needing it more than ever. But -- 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Damnit. My medal. I can’t find it. 
                        I must have lost it when that ogre 
                        slugged me.

                                 JOY
                        Do you need it?

                                 CLARK
                        I got it for my first big FBI bust.
                        I was going to throw it away when I 
                        lost my job and things stopped 
                        making sense. Megan stopped me. 
                        Told me to keep it. To draw 
                        strength from a time when I could 
                        put things in order. 

           An awkward silence. Joy reaches out --

                                 JOY
                        That’s very mature of her. 

                                 CLARK
                        Sometimes I’m not sure who’s taking 
                        care of whom.

                                 JOY
                        At least somebody’s taking care of 
                        somebody. I would have killed for 
                        that when I was her age.

           Clark recalls their first conversation. Something doesn’t jive.

                                 CLARK
                        I thought your dad was buying you 
                        lotto tickets, filling you with 
                        hope. Or fun. Maybe addiction.

           Joy looks at Clark -- and lets her guard down. For the first time, 
           we feel that she’s dropping her pretenses and leveling with him.
                                 JOY
                        Okay, you want the truth? I barely 
                        knew my dad. That story I told you 
                        about how he bought me that ticket? 
                        It was the first weekend I had seen 
                        my dad in... years. And you know 
                        what he had planned? Nothing. He 
                        read and he wrote -- and then he 
                        yelled at me about what he’d just 
                        read and written. When we finally 
                        went out to the market -- because 
                        there was no food in his house -- 
                        the car died on us. We ran out of 
                        gas. Who does that happen to?
                        (beat)
                        We pushed the car to a gas station. 
                        And while we were waiting for it to 
                        fill up, he bought me that ticket.

           A long, awkward silence.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I hate how much I miss him.

           Another awkward silence. Clark feels like it’s his turn to fill 
           it, but he’s not sure how. He winds up blurting --

                                 CLARK
                        The divorce was pretty bad for Megan.

                        Your ex-wife give you a hard time 
                        about custody?

                                 CLARK
                        No. She disappeared, looking for... 
                        I don’t know what she’s looking 
                        for. Or if she’s ever coming back. 
                        (off Joy’s look)
                        My issue is with her father.

                        What did you do to his little girl?

                                 CLARK
                        Nothing.
                        (beat)
                        However, I did report him to the 
                        U.S. Attorney.

                                 JOY
                        Your own father-in-law?

                                 CLARK
                        I was an FBI Agent. He was a 
                        powerful official taking bribes. I 
                        did my job.
                                 JOY
                        So he went to jail?

                                 CLARK
                        No. He had a lot of friends.

                                 JOY
                        Bribery will do that.

                                 CLARK
                        I couldn’t get the charges to 
                        stick. But he was able to get me 
                        fired. And convince my wife to 
                        leave me.

                                 JOY
                        That must have been hard.

                                 CLARK
                        No. It was pretty easy. She thought I 
                        cared more about rules than family.

           Joy turns to look at him.

                                 JOY
                        Do you?

                                 CLARK
                        Do I what?

                                 JOY
                        Do you care about rules more than 
                        family?

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t care about anything as much 
                        as I care about family. And that’s 
                        why I follow rules. Megan is why I 
                        follow rules.
                        (beat)
                        Terrible things happen, you know. 
                        Every day. Murders, fires -- car 
                        accidents. You can’t prevent all of 
                        them, but you can put the odds in 
                        your favor. For the people you love. 
                        If you just follow the rules.

           Joy sees Clark struggle to articulate some deeply held belief. And 
           she finds it endearing.

                                 JOY
                        Listen, Clark, there’s something I want 
                        you to have. Reach into my pocket.

                                 CLARK
                        What? Why don’t you just --
                                 JOY
                        I don’t want to take my hands off 
                        the wheel. Just reach over and --

           Clark tentatively reaches over, getting closer to Joy than ever 
           before. His face is in her hair. And his hand is in her pocket.

                                 CLARK
                        What am I looking for?

                                 JOY
                        There, you have it.

           Clark pulls out a small --

                                 CLARK
                        Rabbit’s foot?

                                 JOY
                        Always brought me luck.

           We recognize it from the opening, when Joy was scratching off 
           tickets. Clark turns the RABBIT’S FOOT over in his hand. Smooth. 
           Old-fashioned. Clark clearly likes it, but starts to hand it back--

                                 CLARK
                        I can’t --

                                 JOY
                        (knows where he’s going)
                        I’m not giving it to you since that 
                        could be construed as a bribe. I’m 
                        just lending it to you for a little 
                        while. To replace your medal.

           Clark grasps the RABBIT’S FOOT tightly. It’s comforting. He slips 
           it into his pocket.

                                 CLARK
                        (genuine)
                        Thank you.

           Clark spots a girl ahead on the side of the road.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Slow down.

           Joy does. As they approach, they get a good look at --

           -- A HOMELESS TEENAGE GIRL. Clark wordlessly holds out a few 
           dollars to her.

           INT./EXT. JOY’S CAR [DRIVING] - LATER THAT EVENING

                                 CLARK
                        I think she’s a missing child and 
                        every moment is valuable. They can 
                        put boots on the ground and trace 
                        her last cell phone communication.

                        What kind of phone?

                                 CLARK
                        Uh... she has an iPhone.

                                 JOY
                        You know there’s an app that can 
                        tell you where she is.

           Clark did not know that.

           INT. JOY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re pulled over to the side of the road. Joy has the FIND MY 
           iPHONE APP up.

           Clark and Joy share a glance.

                        Anything else you can think of that 
                        might have meaning for her?

           Clark thinks for a long beat.

                                 CLARK
                        Try “COLUMBO”.

           JACKPOT! The phone unlocks and we see Megan’s location on a map.
           EXT. BLUE OYSTER BAR - LATER THAT EVENING

           Clark and Joy roll up in front of the neon lights of a music club. 
           The look between them says it all -- this is a rough place.

           INT. BLUE OYSTER BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark and Joy pass a crowd of musicians, jazzheads, and other 
           drunks. We hear “DEVIL WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA” played virtuosically 
           on a cello. As we approach the stage, we see the player --

           -- NICHOLAS LONG. And as he finishes the chorus, the tune is 
           picked up by another cello, and we quickly realize it’s --

           -- MEGAN. Locked in a competition with Long. Think “DEVIL” meets 
           the Walk-off scene from ZOOLANDER.

           Joy taps a couple of musicians on the shoulder.

                                 JOY
                        What’s happening?

                                 DRUMMER
                        One of the saxophones --

                                 BASSIST
                        Fuckin’ saxes --

                                 FRENCH HORN
                        -- said Nick couldn’t outplay the 
                        girl while drunk. So he wagered his 
                        cello on it.

           The song finishes. The circle erupts. Clark is caught between 
           pride and anger. He takes a step towards Megan -- who still hasn’t 
           noticed them yet -- but Joy grabs Clark by the hand.

                                 JOY
                        Give her a minute.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        So -- does she win my cello or not? 
                        Show of applause. Who’s for me?

           We hear a fair amount of applause.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG (CONT’D)
                        (disappointed)
                        Taking genius for granted. And 
                        who’s for Little Miss Mozart?

           The group explodes in applause. Megan clearly won.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG (CONT’D)
                        The mob has spoken.

           Long hands his cello to Megan.
                                 MEGAN
                        It’s been an honor playing with 
                        you, Mr. Long. You’ve been my idol 
                        since --

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        I’m old. I get it. Just take a bow 
                        and be gone.

           Megan, in order to bow, quickly puts the cello down -- and Long, 
           seeing how she does it, EXPLODES and snatches the cello.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG (CONT’D)
                        Never place a cello face down! 
                        You’ll dislodge the bridge. Where 
                        did you grow up? A barn where they 
                        don’t handle instruments properly? 
                        I bet it was just such a barn!

           Long demonstrates how to properly put down the cello.

           Megan is hurt. Clark starts to step in, but Joy beats him to it --

                                 JOY
                        (shouting)
                        Don’t speak to her like that! She’s 
                        twelve years old. You should be 
                        ashamed of yourself. 

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        When I was twelve, I was playing my 
                        third show at Carnegie Hall.

                                 JOY
                        And now you’re insulting a child 
                        while drunk at a lottery 
                        convention. Seems like you must 
                        have made a few mistakes yourself.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        So you must be the one who taught 
                        her to be a little bitch.

           Joy grabs the cello and holds it aloft, ready to SMASH it. Long 
           reacts like there’s a gun to his head.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG (CONT’D)
                        You’re crazy.

                                 JOY
                        No. I just believe in a little 
                        justice from time to time.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        What do you want?
                                 JOY
                        Let’s start with an apology.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        (awkward, halting)
                        All right. I’m sorry I--

                                 JOY
                        Not to me, idiot.

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        (to Megan)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JOY
                        For what?

                                 NICHOLAS LONG
                        Everything!

                                 JOY
                        Okay then. Now, given that the girl 
                        won the cello fair and square, I 
                        assume you’d rather see it making 
                        music in a good home than smashed 
                        to a thousand pieces, right?

           Off Long’s uncertain face --

           INT. JOY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON the CELLO. In the backseat. Cradled in Megan’s arms.

           The car pulls up in front of Clark’s hotel. It’s clear they’ve 
           been driving in silence the entire time. Megan finally breaks it --

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m sorry, Dad, that got way --

                                 CLARK
                        (snapping)
                        What were you thinking? If we hadn’t 
                        been there, do you realize what could 
                        have -- Do you see what happens when 
                        you don’t follow the rules?

           Megan nods, cowed. Clark feels guilty.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Go inside. To the lobby. And wait 
                        there. In full view. 

           Megan nods, thanks Joy, and heads inside.

           Clark stares after. Uncertain. In his hand is his new talisman -- 
           the RABBIT’S FOOT.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

                                 JOY
                        We wouldn’t have found her if you 
                        didn’t know that password. If you 
                        weren’t a good father.

                                 CLARK
                        Thank you. And I’ll calculate the 
                        monetary value of the gas you spent 
                        and compensate you accordingly.

                                 JOY
                        Whatever gets you through the night.

           Clark climbs out of the car. Turns back around. 

                                 CLARK
                        I have to say something. I am 
                        incredibly appreciative of 
                        everything you’ve done tonight --

                                 JOY
                        But that’s not going to stop you 
                        from coming after me.

           Something in Clark shifts. He’s back to investigator mode.

                                 CLARK
                        The fiber optic network. Your 
                        company. The routes. How you 
                        weaseled yourself into this 
                        convention and into our lives -- 
                        I’m gonna figure it all out.

                                 JOY
                        I really enjoy these conversations, 
                        Clark.

           And with that, she’s off. And Clark heads inside to Megan.

           EXT. ORSON’S HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING NIGHT

           Clark pulls up in his POS car. 

                                 CLARK
                        Listen, Megan, I’m sorry I yelled 
                        at you, but you really have to --

                                 MEGAN
                        Follow the rules. I know.

                                 CLARK
                        I was going to say “be safe.” I 
                        don’t know what would happen to me 
                        if something happened to you.
           Megan sees how vulnerable Clark is. She leans over and hugs him. 
           Clark hugs her back tightly. After a long moment, they break. 

           Megan climbs out and heads inside. Orson is standing at the door. 
           Clark smiles wanly. Orson gives him the finger. Nice moment over.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - NEXT MORNING

           Clark is speaking to a mustachioed FOREMAN from Vectronix. Behind 
           them, a work crew is cutting a trench alongside the highway and 
           laying fiber optic cable.

                                 FOREMAN
                        G&T hired us to lay 2000 miles of 
                        secure fiber-optic cable.

                                 CLARK
                        How secure is it?

                                 FOREMAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLARK
                        Is there any way to pick up what 
                        they’re transmitting? Siphon off 
                        information or upload a virus?

                                 FOREMAN
                        Not without physically tapping in 
                        to the cable. That’s damn hard even 
                        if you knew where they are -- and 
                        they’re buried out in the middle of 
                        nowhere. You’d never find them 
                        unless you knew exactly what you 
                        were looking for.

                                 CLARK
                        Who had access to the plans?

                                 FOREMAN
                        Only personnel working on the 
                        project.

                                 CLARK
                        You have a list?

           The Foreman proffers his project notebook. Clark scans...

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        No “Joy Taylor.”

           The Foreman shakes his head.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for your time.
                                 FOREMAN
                        No problem. Got plenty of it now 
                        that the project’s basically done. 
                        Took forever.

                                 CLARK
                        (an inkling)
                        How long?

                                 FOREMAN
                        Seven years.

           Spanning back to when Joy won her first lotto!

                                 CLARK
                        During that time, were those fiber 
                        optic lines used at all?

                                 FOREMAN
                        Sure. Plenty of beta testing.

           Clark nods. So close. He turns to go -- when one last question 
           occurs to him.

                                 CLARK
                        Why did it take so long to install? 
                        What was the hold up?

                                 FOREMAN
                        Permits. Texas was the worst. Land 
                        Commission needs to approve lines 
                        that cross multiple counties. 

                                 CLARK
                        Texas Land Commission? You mean 
                        Orson Cromwell’s office?

                                 FOREMAN
                        (trying to recall)
                        Cromwell? Yeah, that sounds right. 
                        Nothing gets done there unless you 
                        grease the wheels. And even then --

                                 CLARK
                        Did you submit your plans to 
                        Orson’s office?

           The Foreman nods. Then his cell phone goes off.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Gotta’ take this. 

           The Foreman walks off. Clark stands there processing. Is it 
           possible Orson’s part of this?
           INT. CLARK’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           Clark and Jimmy are going through boxes of records.

                                 JIMMY
                        What are we looking for?

                                 CLARK
                        Any evidence linking Joy and Orson.

                                 JIMMY
                        Like sexually?

                                 CLARK
                        (caught off-guard)
                        What? No. Maybe. I was thinking 
                        more like phone calls, bank 
                        transfers--

           Jimmy holds up a sheet of paper.

                                 JIMMY
                        Campaign contributions?

           Clark grabs it and reads -- then kisses Jimmy on top of his head.

           INT. G&T / CONFERENCE ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Clark is back at the site of his earlier humiliation, again across 
           from Brunson, Sanders, and Vivian. 

           Clark is tense, holding his replacement talisman -- the RABBIT’S 
           FOOT that Joy gave him.

                                 CLARK
                        She worked for the same vendor that 
                        installed your fiber-optic network. 
                        And I believe she accessed the layout 
                        plans through a corrupt official at 
                        the Texas Land Commission.

           Brunson is silent, considering.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You have to admit it’s a troubling 
                        coincidence.

                                 BRUNSON
                        So is the resemblance between your 
                        ass and your face.

                                 CLARK
                        The timeline matches up. This is 
                        how she’s beaten you. Three times. 
                        And she’s about to do it again. For 
                        a record-setting jackpot.
                                 SANDERS
                        We can work with the construction 
                        company. Check for any places she 
                        tapped in.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s 2000 miles. Ripping that up 
                        would take months. We need to focus 
                        on what she was accessing.
                        (beat)
                        We need to run a full diagnostic on 
                        the Icebox.

           A long beat. We can see Sanders wrestling with this option --

                                 BRUNSON
                        Jim, you can’t be considering this. It 
                        violates all our security protocols.

                                 CLARK
                        Joy Taylor has violated your 
                        security protocols.

                                 SANDERS
                        (waffling)
                        There’s a chance it’s all coincidence.

                                 BRUNSON
                        There’s a chance it’s all this 
                        asshole’s paranoia.

                                 CLARK
                        (a callback to Sanders)
                        I thought you didn’t take chances -- 
                        you sold them.

           INT. G&T / OUTSIDE THE ICEBOX - LATER

           All our players plus a TECHIE wait outside the door.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Leave your cell phones or pagers in 
                        this tray.

                                 CLARK
                        Who has a pager anymore?

                                 BRUNSON
                        I do, smartass. Only thing left in 
                        this world that doesn’t run Google.

           Clark empties his pockets. He deposits the phone, then slips the 
           rest -- wallet, keys, rabbit’s foot -- back in his pocket.

           Brunson opens the door to the ICEBOX. And as they enter, we see --
           INT. G&T / ICEBOX - CONTINUOUS

           An all-white room. Small and simple. A desk with a server, a 
           smaller box, and a monitor. The Tech does a physical sweep.

                                 TECHIE
                        No physical intrusions.

                                 CLARK
                        (whispering)
                        Are you sure we should be talking 
                        in here? What about the room tone?

                                 TECHIE
                        That just feeds a random starting 
                        point to the computer. Few things 
                        are more random than the human 
                        voice. Talk all you want.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Please don’t.

                                 CLARK
                        What about the software? If she 
                        accessed the main frame, read the

                        This diagnostic will tell us.

           The tech plugs a cord into a server and the other end into a heavy-
           duty military grade laptop.

                                 SANDERS
                        How long is this going to take?

           We watch the bar begin to creep. 2% complete.

           As Clark waits for the results, he strokes the RABBIT’S FOOT. Just 
           as Joy did in the opening scene.

           INT. G&T / ICEBOX - TWO HOURS LATER

           The Tech eyes the screen. Clark eyes the Tech. The bar hits 100%. 
           Clark jumps up, jolting Sanders who’s started to doze.

                                 TECHIE

                                 CLARK
                        Irregularity! That’s it. The... 
                        teraflops. That’s her!
                                 TECHIE
                        That? No. That’s a regular 
                        irregularity.

                                 CLARK
                        What are you saying?

                                 BRUNSON
                        He’s saying you’re wrong. Joy Taylor 
                        never accessed the Ice Box. You just 
                        wasted all our time. Again.

                                 CLARK
                        (to the Tech)
                        You can’t be saying that.

                                 TECHIE
                        (trying to be polite)
                        Not in those words, but...

                                 CLARK
                        Run it again.

                                 TECHIE
                        I did. Actually I ran it four times.

                                 CLARK
                        It doesn’t make any sense.

                                 BRUNSON
                        We’re done here.

                                 CLARK
                        This isn’t right. Your diagnostic 
                        must be faulty. 

                                 TECHIE
                        (suddenly firm)
                        It is not.

                                 CLARK
                        Or you’re not understanding how she  
                        did it.

                                 BRUNSON
                        Or maybe she didn’t do it.

           Clark locks eyes with Brunson. Can Clark let it go?

           INT. G&T / OUTSIDE THE ICEBOX - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark can’t let it go...

                                 CLARK
                        We need to start digging up the 
                        fiber optics. Inspect by hand.
                                 SANDERS
                        You said that would take months.

                                 CLARK
                        So what? If we don’t do it that 
                        way, people get hurt. In the 
                        meanwhile, you need to cancel 
                        Overnight Success. We’re vulnerable 
                        and we don’t even know how.

           No one is going for it.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You can’t just let Joy get away 
                        with it!

           This doesn’t sound quite right.

                                 VIVIAN
                        “Joy”? Clark, how personal has this 
                        case become?

                                 CLARK
                        Every time someone cheats, lies, 
                        steals, it is personal for me. Why 
                        isn’t it for you?

                                 VIVIAN
                        (to Sanders)
                        I’m sorry we’ve taken up so much of 
                        your time.

                                 CLARK
                        The evidence that she’s cheated -- 
                        and that she’s going to do it again 
                        -- is overwhelming. People buy 
                        tickets thinking they have a fair 
                        shot. Do they? Technically. But not 
                        this time. They have a right to 
                        know. And if you’re not going to 
                        suspend the game -- well, people 
                        need to know.

                                 SANDERS
                        What are you suggesting?

                                 CLARK
                        If you don’t shut down the game, 
                        I’ll go to the papers.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Clark, you’re not just playing with 
                        your career, now you’re inviting a 
                        lawsuit your grandkids will feel.
                                 CLARK
                        How can you all be so blind -- 
                        unless you want to be. 

                                 SANDERS
                        I’ve put up with this long enough.

                                 CLARK
                        (crossing the last line)
                        Are you in on it, too? Maybe you 
                        like that Joy is winning. Maybe you 
                        think it will drive ticket sales. 

                                 SANDERS
                        You’re fired.

                                 CLARK
                        You can’t fire me. I work for the 
                        state.

                                 VIVIAN
                        You’re fired.

           And there it is.

           INT. CLARK’S CAR - SEVERAL DAYS LATER

           Clark is sitting in a parked car. He looks worn. Unshaven. He’s on 
           the phone with Megan.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        Grandpa says you’re going to need 
                        to move again. 

                                 CLARK
                        I’m looking at some options. May be 
                        a little farther away, but --

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        He said you might have to move in 
                        with your parents. Back east.

                                 CLARK
                        Why would he -- no. That’s not 
                        going to happen.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        Good.

           Clark pauses. Not sure how to say this.

                                 CLARK
                        I wish I were in a position to do 
                        more for you, Megs.

                                 MEGAN
                        You do plenty for me, Dad.
                                 CLARK
                        Do you like staying with your grandpa?

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        You’ve never asked me that before.

                                 CLARK
                        No. I think I was afraid of the 
                        answer. How is it?

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        (trying to be gentle)
                        It’s a nice house.

                                 CLARK
                        You don’t have to take care of me.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        (leveling with him)
                        He’s usually pretty busy. But he 
                        likes to read to me. History books. 
                        Killing Kennedy, Killing Lincoln...

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t know if those are history 
                        books, but it’s nice he does that.

           An awkward pause. Megan hears some ambient noise.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        Where are you?

                                 CLARK
                        Just trying to keep occupied.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        The finals for Texas Performing 
                        Arts are on Saturday. I’ll see you 
                        there at 4pm, right?

                                 CLARK
                        That’s the same day the lotto 
                        jackpot goes on sale.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        Dad, you have to stop obsessing.

                                 CLARK
                        (snapping out of it)
                        Of course I’ll be there.

           Clark hangs up. And then, a beat later -- we see Joy emerge from a 
           gas station mini-mart, and we realize that Clark has been staking 
           her out this whole time!

           Joy gets in her car and drives away. Clark makes a NOTE of her 
           activities. We see his notes are already extensive.
                                 JOY (O.S.)
                        You’re bad at this.

           Joy has swung around and pulled her car up next to Clark’s. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Your car is noticeable. And it was 
                        outside my hotel last night and my 
                        work site this morning.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m not trying to hide anything. 
                        Just wanted to let you know I was 
                        watching. And when you buy your 
                        next ticket, I’ll be there.

                                 JOY
                        Well, I’ll be back in Rosalita next 
                        week. But then Santa Fe the week 
                        after. Are you going to follow me 
                        around all day or do you have to 
                        get back to the office?

                                 CLARK
                        No. I don’t have to go back to the 
                        office. I was fired. One more way 
                        in which you’ve RUINED MY LIFE!

           Joy weathers the onslaught and takes a beat.

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry. I know you cared about 
                        that job a lot and --

                                 CLARK
                        You don’t care about me or my job 
                        or my family. You’re not a kindred 
                        spirit trying to do good in your 
                        own way. And I bet you made up all 
                        that crap about your father.

           Something shifts in Joy. She doesn’t get angry, just icily polite.

                                 JOY
                        You do understand that without 
                        color of law, your following me 
                        constitutes stalking -- do I have 
                        to call the police? 

           A long beat.

                                 CLARK
                        No.

                                 JOY
                        Okay, then. Take it easy, Clark.
           Joy pulls away, and as she does, Clark clocks something across the 
           street. It’s JOY. On a POSTER. For the LOTTO. Insult meet injury.

           INT. CLARK’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Clark’s in his pajamas making a drink with exacting measurement. 
           Is it a cocktail? Nope. It’s Ovaltine. Spiked with Schnapps.

           Clark grabs a newspaper. Goes to unwrap it. On the outside is an 
           advertisement page... for the lotto. Joy’s face beams at him.

           Clark slugs his drink. Tosses the paper. Then hears KNOCKING.

           INT. CLARK’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark answers the front door, revealing --

           JIMMY, holding a box of Clark’s office stuff.

                                 CLARK
                        Thanks, Jimmy. They have you on the 
                        case now?

                                 JIMMY
                        I don’t think we’re allowed to 
                        discuss --

                                 CLARK
                        You’re right. Good catch, Jimmy.

                                 JIMMY
                        But no. The lottery is tomorrow. 
                        Pretty sure the case is dead. Do 
                        you want some company? 

                                 CLARK
                        Thanks anyway, Jimmy.

           Jimmy nods and leaves. Clark closes the door, puts down the box, 
           and is just returning to the couch when there’s another KNOCK.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy, I said I was okay.

           But it’s not Jimmy. Clark opens the door to find --

                                 TALL MAN
                        Are you Clark Hauser?
                        (off Clark’s nod)
                        You’ve been served.

           Clark signs and tears open the package. As Clark reads, he gets 
           too angry for words. He tosses the papers. They land on the box 
           Jimmy brought. On top of a picture of Clark and Megan. We ZOOM IN 
           on the words: CUSTODY DISPUTE and scan over to LACK OF EMPLOYMENT.

           PRE-LAP: The sound of KNOCKING.
           EXT. ORSON’S HOUSE - LATER THAT EVENING

           Orson answers the door to find Clark. Looks him up and down.

                                 CLARK
                        I want to see my daughter. Right 
                        now. You’re not taking her away 
                        from me.

                                 ORSON
                        Jesus, Clark. Are you drunk?

                                 CLARK
                        No. 0.03. I breathalyzed myself. 

                                 ORSON
                        I have people over. Important 
                        people. You can see Megan at the 
                        finals. Tomorrow. In public.

           Orson tries to shut the door. Clark sticks his foot in. A 
           gentleman with a BOLO TIE comes up behind Orson.

                                 BOLO TIE
                        You need a hand?

                                 ORSON
                        My loser ex son-in-law was just 
                        leaving.

                                 CLARK
                        I am not a loser. I was set up. And 
                        if you’re not here to help, stay 
                        out of my way.

                                 ORSON
                        Clark Hauser, meet Cal Fredricks --

                                 CLARK
                        U.S. Marshal for West Texas?
                        (off the Marshal’s nod)
                        So about my most recent application...

                                 MARSHAL FREDRICKS
                        I printed it directly into the trash.

                                 CLARK
                        Okay then.

           MARSHAL FREDRICKS walks away.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        The whole world is against me.

                                 ORSON
                        Can you blame the world?
                                 CLARK
                        I know what you did. You -- and Joy 
                        Taylor.

                                 ORSON
                        I have no idea who that is.

                                 CLARK
                        Like hell you don’t. She funneled 
                        you a bribe through your official 
                        campaign fund -- and in return you 
                        gave her the plans to G&T’s fiber 
                        optic network. Then you had her 
                        lure me to a staged scene to 
                        provoke me into making an 
                        accusation that would get me fired.

           Orson looks at Clark with... is that pity?

                                 ORSON
                        First, no one would funnel a bribe 
                        through my official campaign. They 
                        would do that through my PAC. 

                                 CLARK
                        (”hmm”)
                        And second?

                                 ORSON
                        It’s not that hard to get you 
                        fired, Clark. Trust me.

           Orson SLAMS the door in Clark’s face.

                                 CLARK
                        That was remarkably convincing.
                        (thinking aloud)
                        This whole time I’ve thought Joy 
                        had an inside man. That she was 
                        working with someone at G&T or in 
                        state government. What if that’s 
                        what she wanted me to think...

           Clark KNOCKS again. Orson answers. Furious.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What if Joy wasn’t working with 
                        G&T? What if she was working 
                        against them?

                                 ORSON
                        I’ve called the actual police.

                                 CLARK
                        Orson, I want to thank you. For 
                        once, you’ve advanced the cause of 
                        justice. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        Oh, and here’s my reply to your 
                        custody suit. You want to take me 
                        to court, bring it. I will destroy 
                        you.

           Clark hands Orson back his legal complaint. He’s pasted a reply 
           made with cut-up parking tickets: EAT SHIT, OLD MAN.

           INT. CLARK’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clark’s PHONE ALARM wakes him up and reminds it’s the day of the 
           lotto -- and Megan’s final audition. It’s 6am. Clark jumps out of 
           bed and starts getting dressed.

           INT. COURTHOUSE RECORDS - DAY

           Clark has gotten to the records room as soon as they open. A 
           clerk, who hasn’t seen the light of day in years, lifts his head. 

                                 CLARK
                        I want all of the lawsuits filed 
                        against G&T.

           INT. READING ROOM - HOURS LATER

           Clark is at a dimly lit desk, deep into reading. We can see from 
           the growing discard piles and the coffee cup graveyard that 
           Clark’s been at it for a while. 

           The Clerk drops off another box of papers. 

                                 CLARK
                        More?

                                 COURT CLERK
                        Guess they made a few enemies.

           Clark tosses a useless brief aside and massages his eyes. Then he 
           opens another brief: “Graff vs. G&T.” 

                                 CLARK
                        “Lewis Graff, professor of statistics 
                        at Texas A&M, asserts that G&T is 
                        guilty of intellectual property theft 
                        and patent infringement.”
                        (beat)
                        A&M? That’s where Joy went.

           INT. PATENTS DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Clark is at the front desk speaking to a pudgy PATENT CLERK.

                                 CLARK
                        I need patent number--
                        (checking his notes)
           INT. PATENTS DEPARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The PATENT CLERK returns holding a thick filing, labeled “1513.” 

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        In 1982 G&T was issued a patent for a 
                        lottery algorithm. Looks like it took 
                        just six months from application.

                                 CLARK
                        I thought getting a patent takes years.

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        The application must have been fast-
                        tracked.

                                 CLARK
                        But there was a dispute?

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        Lewis Graff came forward. He 
                        presented evidence that he was 
                        first to invent.

                                 CLARK
                        If Graff was first, why didn’t he 
                        get the patent?

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        Texas A&M assumed authority over 
                        his claim.

                                 CLARK
                        How?

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        Technically, universities have a 
                        right to any IP created by their 
                        professors. As a courtesy, they 
                        usually don’t exercise that right --

                                 CLARK
                        But in Graff’s case they weren’t 
                        feeling courteous.

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        Guess not.

                                 CLARK
                        But wait -- then shouldn’t Texas 
                        A&M have the patent?

                                 PATENT CLERK
                        They voluntarily dropped the claim. 
                        In favor of G&T.

           That strikes Clark as odd. Why would the school do that for G&T?
           EXT. TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY - DAY

           We pick up Clark, as he walks past the George H.W. Bush 
           Presidential Library, on the phone with Megan.

           In the background, we periodically see more JOY LOTTO POSTERS. 
           Clark notices them -- but averts his eyes.

                                 CLARK
                        Today’s the big day. You ready?

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        Dad, about the custody stuff --

                                 CLARK
                        Don’t worry about any of that. Just  
                        practice and prepare.

                                 MEGAN’S VOICE
                        See you at four.

                                 CLARK
                        See you at four.

           Clark looks at his watch. 10am. Plenty of time.

           INT. TEXAS A&M LIBRARY - DAY

           Clark is walking through cavernous stacks. He checks the index 
           card in his hand, then scans the shelves until he finds the VOLUME 
           he was searching for.

                                 CLARK
                        “A Multiplicative Congruential 
                        Algorithm for the Generation of 
                        Pseudo-Random Numbers...”

           He flips through a few pages filled with impenetrable mathematics.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Might as well be in Swahili.

           Clark starts to put the volume back on the shelf, but then thinks 
           better of it. He flips to the last page of the book, which lists 
           the names of people who previously checked it out. The first name 
           on the list is “Joy Taylor.”

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch.

           Clark then moves his finger down to the last name on the list: 
           “Xian Xudong.”

           INT. TEXAS A&M DORM / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark looks very out of place. He walks down the hall, reading the 
           names posted on each door until he finds -- XIAN XUDONG. 
           Clark KNOCKS. XIAN, an 18-year-old Chinese beanpole with a clipped 
           accent and razor sharp wits, answers. 

                                 CLARK
                        Would you like to make fifty bucks?

           INT. DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark sits with Xian, Graff’s thesis in front of him.

                                 XIAN
                        It’s an iterative function using 
                        modular arithmetic.

           Clark stares at him blankly. Xian tries to explain by scribbling a 
           note on a napkin. “X2 = f(X1) mod M.”

                                 CLARK
                        Nope. Still nowhere.

                                 XIAN
                        It’s a method for generating random 
                        numbers. You start with a seed, 
                        something randomized you feed in as 
                        a starting point --

                                 CLARK
                        Like room tone.
                        (off Xian’s nod)
                        How complicated is this? Would a 
                        seismologist understand?

                                 XIAN
                        Seismologist work with statistics 
                        all day every day. 
                        (off Clark’s look)
                        Seismology is a predictive science. 
                        You use past information to predict 
                        future events, so...

           Clark is floored.

                        I thought seismology was the study 
                        of earthquakes. 

                                 XIAN
                        Those are the events they predict.

                                 CLARK
                        Right. Okay. So if someone -- let’s 
                        say a seismologist -- read this 
                        paper and knew the algorithm, but 
                        didn’t know the seed number, could 
                        she predict future events?
                                 XIAN
                        Possibly. She’d need two things.

                                 CLARK
                        What are they?

                                 XIAN
                        A large data set of past events.

                                 CLARK
                        And?

                                 XIAN
                        Information about the functional 
                        form of f(X).

                                 CLARK
                        That’s not in the paper?

                                 XIAN
                        Graff said he’d publish it as 
                        follow-up, but I couldn’t find it. 
                        I don’t think it was ever released.

           Clark gets up and starts walking away.

                                 XIAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, what about my fifty bucks?

           INT. DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark is counting out crumpled bills and change.

                                 XIAN
                        Is this your laundry money?

                                 CLARK
                        Not anymore. $47.50. Best I can do.

           INT. TEXAS A&M PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Oak and red carpet. Clark enters and speaks to the SECRETARY.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m trying to get some information 
                        about a professor here by the name 
                        of Lewis Graff. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        One moment.

           As the Secretary quietly types, Clark stares at a PORTRAIT behind 
           her of University President Burroughs.
                                 CLARK
                        Nothing like staring at a portrait 
                        of yourself.

                                 SECRETARY
                        It looks like Lewis Graff was 
                        terminated in 1982. 

                                 CLARK
                        Any information about where he went?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Let me see if I can find an address.

                                 CLARK
                        Thanks.

           Clark waits, looking again at the photographs on the wall. One 
           catches his eye. He leans in to look at it. It shows the 
           University President shaking hands with JIM SANDERS.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Is this Jim Sanders, the CEO of G&T?

                                 SECRETARY
                        President Burroughs and Jim are old 
                        friends.

                                 CLARK
                        Does he donate to the university?

                                 SECRETARY
                        You’re standing in Sanders Hall.

           Clark nods. The wheels are turning.

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Found the address. It’s 112 
                        Sycamore Lane. Rosalita.

           Clark blinks at her. Did she just say --

                                 CLARK
                        Rosalita?

           INT./EXT. CLARK’S CAR [DRIVING] - LATER THAT DAY

           Clark passes a ROSALITA SIGN. Checks his phone. 2pm. Still time. 

           EXT. GRAFF’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark pulls up in front of the address. 112 Sycamore.

           Clark knocks on the front door. No answer. He walks around the 
           side of the house. Looks through the window. No one’s home.
           One of the windows is open. Clark moves closer to the window. 
           Ventures a tentative sniff -- then enters.

           INT. GRAFF’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark is in the study. Bookshelves filled with math textbooks and 
           leather notebooks. He flips through one -- filled with equations. 

           Clark starts rifling through file cabinets until he hits the 
           jackpot -- an entire cabinet filled with LANTERMAN’S LOTTO LOGS. 
           Clark takes out a handful. The data tables are circled in red pen.

                                 CLARK
                        And there’s the large data set.

           CLARK’S VISION OF THE CRIME

           It’s a series of quick hits.

           - We see Joy, discovering Graff’s paper in the A&M library.

           - We see her driving out to Rosalita, meeting with him.

           - We see them conspiring together, going through Lanterman’s Lotto 
           Logs and Graff’s papers to figure out the ticket patterns.

           But Clark is pulled out of this scenario when he hears --

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Put that down. And put your hands up!

           END CLARK’S VISION

           Clark turns around to find the aged SHERIFF with his gun drawn.

                                 CLARK
                        We have to stop meeting this way.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Wait... ain’t you the lotto guy?

                                 CLARK
                        Yes. Formerly.

                                 SHERIFF
                        What are you doing breaking and 
                        entering into people’s homes?

                                 CLARK
                        I only entered. I didn’t break.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Trespassing then?

                                 CLARK
                        The window was open and I smelled 
                        gas. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        According to Texas code, a citizen 
                        can enter private premises where 
                        there’s threat of fire.

           The Sheriff finally holsters his weapon.

                                 SHERIFF
                        If you wanted to raid Joy Taylor’s 
                        house without a warrant, you should 
                        have just asked me.

                                 CLARK
                        Joy Taylor’s house? 

           As Clark looks around, we see the desk -- and recognize it from 
           the opening. It’s Joy’s Etsyfied home office.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I thought they were only working 
                        together -- I didn’t realize she 
                        was also sleeping with him.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Sleeping with whom? What are you 
                        talking about?

                                 CLARK
                        Lewis Graff lives here, right?

                                 SHERIFF
                        Not since he died.

           Clark feels one more piece click into place.

                                 CLARK
                        Let me guess. About 7 years ago?

                                 SHERIFF
                        Something like that. The place was a 
                        mess. Graff was something of a 
                        hoarder. But Joy walked through, saw 
                        the boxes, and bought it anyway.

           Clark nods. The world is making sense again. But there’s still a 
           pretty big problem.

                                 CLARK
                        I need to find Joy. Now. Any way 
                        you can put out an ABP? She could 
                        be in a dozen states. And I don’t 
                        know how big a head start she has.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Not much. I just passed her on Route 
                        Two when I was starting my patrol...
           INT./EXT. CLARK’S CAR [DRIVING] - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark looks at his watch. 3pm. Shit. Still time -- but cutting it 
           close. And then he finds JOY’S MCLAREN. Just off of ROUTE TWO --
           parked in front of the local Rosalita minimart.

           INT. ROSALITA MINI-MART - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark arrives at the front counter where he finds JOY, holding a 
           just-purchased lotto ticket.

                                 CLARK
                        I knew it.

                                 JOY
                        Clark, I don’t think you understand 
                        what’s going on here.

                                 CLARK
                        I’ve done a lot of traveling the 
                        past day. The state patent office, 
                        Texas A&M, your house.

                                 JOY
                        You broke into my--

                                 CLARK
                        Not technically. I know you got 
                        Graff’s algorithm from that house. 
                        And you combined it with a library of 
                        data from Lanterman’s newsletters. 
                        And now -- I got you! I got Joy 
                        Taylor. The most, conniving, 
                        manipulative, exploitative --

                                 JOY
                        It’s not what it looks like.

                                 CLARK
                        Like hell it isn’t. You worked me. 
                        Set me up to lose my job. Tried to 
                        deflect me from what was really 
                        going on. You did even worse to 
                        Graff, some poor schmuck screwed 
                        over by G&T -- and you pick over 
                        his bones and screw him over again.

                                 JOY
                        I would never do that. Lewis Graff 
                        wasn’t some poor schmuck -- he was 
                        my father.

           Clark wasn’t expecting that.

                                 CLARK
                        What?
                                 JOY
                        Growing up I thought he was just 
                        this paranoid drunk. Always ranting 
                        about what had been taken from him. 
                        After he died, I looked up his work 
                        and you know what I found --

                                 CLARK
                        He wasn’t so paranoid.

                                 JOY
                        G&T ruined him. Sanders was an A&M 
                        alum. He stole my father’s work. 
                        And when my father wouldn’t play 
                        ball, they buried him. I thought 
                        you’d understand. 

                                 CLARK
                        Understand what? That you thought 
                        that bit of bad luck entitled you 
                        to commit theft? To steal millions?

           Joy eyes Clark, then the TICKET she’s still holding. She pulls out 
           a quarter. Starts to scratch it off. Gradually, the icons become 
           visible. One star, two stars, and then... a rain cloud. 

           NO MATCH. 

           Clark is astonished.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        That. Isn’t. Possible.

           And just then, we hear a woman SCREAM from elsewhere in the store. 
           Is someone hurt or in danger? Nope --

                                 SCREAMING WOMAN
                        I won!

           Clark sees the woman jumping up and down, holding a lotto card. 
           Clark, wheels turning, squares off with Joy --

                                 CLARK
                        How did she get your card?

                                 JOY
                        I guess my luck’s wearing off.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re too precise to botch the end 
                        game. You must have a stash of 
                        other tickets somewhere --

                                 JOY
                        (magician gesture)
                        Nothing up my sleeves.
                                 CLARK
                        In the trunk of your car then, or 
                        in a safety deposit box--

           Clark halts as he spots something on the TV BEHIND THE COUNTER. 
           It’s on MUTE, but there’s a BANNER about the lotto.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        (to the store clerk)
                        Turn the volume up.

           We see a FIELD REPORTER standing in front of a 7-11 with a woman 
           hyperventilating with excitement.

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        We’re in Little Rock with a woman 
                        whose life just changed. She won 
                        $20 million in the record-setting 
                        Overnight Success. She’s not the 
                        only one. From Georgia to Illinois 
                        to Connecticut, we have reports of 
                        five grand prize winners already -- 
                        on the first day of the game.

           Clark’s trying to make it compute. It won’t.

                                 CLARK
                        Scratch-off lottos don’t work like 
                        that.

                                 JOY
                        Why not? It’s all random. Can’t 
                        there be five winners in the first 
                        day? Can’t a monkey write Hamlet?

                                 CLARK
                        No. I mean -- no, they’re not 
                        random. The winners are spaced out. 
                        Some at the beginning, some at the 
                        middle, more at the end. Five of 
                        ten total grand prizes -- found on 
                        the first day? It’s impossible. 
                        Inconceivable.

                                 JOY
                        (a la Princess Bride)
                        I don’t think that word means what 
                        you think it means.

           Clark knows she’s toying with him, but before he can reply -- an 
           ALARM goes off. Clark realizes it’s his phone. It’s 3:30. If he’s 
           going to get to Megan’s audition, he’s gotta go now.

                                 CLARK
                        I have to go to Megan’s audition.

           Clark isn’t sure what to do next. He’s forced to improvise --
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You’re coming with me. I’m not 
                        letting you out of my sight until I 
                        get to the bottom of this.

                                 JOY
                        You have no authority to apprehend 
                        me. You’re not a cop. You’re not 
                        even a lotto inspector.

                                 CLARK
                        (hurt by the low blow)
                        Maybe not. But I’m still a citizen. 
                        I’m making a citizen’s arrest.

                                 JOY
                        You’ve been watching too much 
                        Columbo.

           Clark recognizes the absurdity of his position, but leans into it.

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t have you on fraud, but--
                        (wheels turning)
                        You’re loitering in front of a 
                        convenience store.

                                 JOY
                        That’s a misdemeanor. At best.

                                 CLARK
                        In Texas, citizens can arrest for 
                        misdemeanors that lead to a breach 
                        of the public peace, which that --

           Clark gestures to the still screaming winner. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        -- certainly does.

           A long beat as they both stand there. Finally, Joy gives in.

                                 JOY
                        Enough with the Mexican standoff. 
                        I’ll come with you. But just to 
                        hear Megan play again. I could 
                        listen to her all day long. You -- 
                        not as much.

           INT./EXT. CLARK’S CAR [DRIVING] - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark dares to hit the speed limit as they race to Houston for the 
           final audition. Clark breaks the silence --

                                 CLARK
                        How did that other woman have your 
                        ticket?! And why are you so calm?
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARK (CONT'D)
                        (realizing)
                        You’re in on it together. You 
                        thought it’d be too suspicious to 
                        claim another prize. Damn! Why 
                        didn’t I realize that sooner?

                                 JOY
                        You have to stop thinking I have 
                        all these partners. I’m a loner, 
                        Clark. Like you.

           They drive pass a Joy lotto BILLBOARD. They both clock it.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re on billboards.

                                 JOY
                        You’re the one that put me there.

                                 CLARK
                        I did not. But I should speak with 
                        the woman who did.

           Clark makes a phone call.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy, can you put Vivian on. It’s 
                        an emergency.

                                               INTERCUT WITH

           INT. TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           TIGHT ON JIMMY with his phone.

                                 JIMMY
                        It’s an emergency here, too.

           WIDEN TO REVEAL the office in pandemonium. 

                                 JIMMY (CONT’D)
                        I think something’s wrong with the 
                        lotto. We have seven winners already.

                                 CLARK
                        That’s impossible.

                                 JOY
                        Not impossible.

                                 CLARK
                        Can you put Vivian on. I know who’s 
                        responsible.

           We see Vivian in the background, berating her crying minions.
                                 JIMMY
                        Now’s not a good time. If you want 
                        to know more, listen to the news. 
                        That’s where I get my news. You 
                        know, because they’re the --

           CLICK. Clark’s already hung up. He tunes the radio in to the news.

                                 RADIO NEWSCASTER
                        ... and with additional jackpot 
                        winners in Sioux Falls, Baton 
                        Rouge, and Raleigh-Durham, they’ve 
                        now found all ten grand prizes. 
                        Today is the day a lot of people 
                        became overnight successes.

                                 CLARK
                        This is impossible.

                                 JOY
                        You keep saying that and yet --

                                 CLARK
                        (firm)
                        No. It’s really impossible. That’s 
                        eleven grand prize winners.

                                 JOY
                        We were at seven. He found three 
                        more. We’re at ten.

                                 CLARK
                        Plus the woman in Rosalita. They 
                        weren’t counting her. They must not 
                        know about her yet. That’s eleven. 
                        And that’s impossible.

           That mysterious smile creeps across Joy’s face.

                                 JOY
                        There aren’t eleven winners. By the 
                        time they’ve finished counting, 
                        there will be over a thousand.

           As Clark and Joy continue speaking, we INTERCUT shots of JOYOUS 
           WINNERS across the country: SOCCER MOMS screaming in their 
           minivans. OLD FOLKS crowing in a retirement home. A SCHOOL TEACHER 
           storming out of his classroom. Etc.

                                 CLARK
                        At 20 million a piece? What’s the 
                        point? There won’t be enough ticket 
                        sales to cover that. No one will 
                        get paid.
                                 JOY
                        G&T is on the hook for manufacturer 
                        errors. I think this qualifies. 
                        They’re liable for the whole amount. 
                        And when they can’t pay it --

                                 CLARK
                        They’re bankrupt. 

           Joy’s true motive finally occurs to Clark. 

           He turns to her. His voice is almost a whisper.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        This was never about winning money. 

                                 JOY
                        I just wanted to hit G&T the only 
                        place I knew they’d feel it.

           Clark is trying to put it together.

                                 CLARK
                        How did you break into the icebox?

                                 JOY
                        I didn’t. You did. 

           Clark is reeling.

                                 CLARK
                        Excuse me?

                                 JOY
                        There was no way I could get 
                        anywhere near the Ice Box... 

                                 CLARK
                        No...

                                 JOY
                        Until you walked me right inside.

           And now we see the first in a series of flashbacks. Similar visual 
           style to Clark’s imagining of the crime -- but this time, we’re 
           seeing what really happened:

           We see Clark in the Ice Box, doing his diagnostic. But we now go 
           inside his pocket, which houses the RABBIT’S FOOT Joy gave him.

                                 CLARK
                        The rabbit’s foot!

           Back at LottoCon, we see Joy conferring with the CUTTER. Slipping 
           him money. Then we see the CUTTER punching Clark -- and pocketing 
           Clark’s FBI MEDAL. Creating the need...
           In the hotel parking lot, we see Joy paying a MECHANIC to put a 
           BOOT on Clark’s POS car. Creating the opportunity...

           Then we move to Joy’s car. A scene we’ve already watched. Joy 
           giving Clark the rabbit’s foot.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        What was inside that rabbit’s foot?

                                 JOY
                        A little tech I had re-purposed. 
                        It’s supposed to detect seismic 
                        activity--

           Back to Joy’s construction site. Another scene we’ve already 
           watched. We see Joy opening her ORANGE, HARD-PLASTIC BRIEFCASE.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        But the sound pulses can also alter 
                        room tone.

           Clark’s head is spinning.

                                 CLARK
                        You altered the room tone?

                                 JOY
                        No. You altered the room tone. You 
                        locked the computer in a repeating 
                        pattern.

           Clark’s still trying to put it all together.

                                 CLARK
                        How could you know I would wind up 
                        in the Ice Box? How could you know 
                        how far I’d push this?

           In her Rosalita home, we see Joy reading about Clark’s attempt to 
           take down Orson.

                                 JOY
                        You went after your own father-in-
                        the-law to the point of ruining your 
                        career. I knew if you suspected he 
                        was mixed up in this that you would 
                        carry it all the way. I guess I kind 
                        of lied when I said I didn’t have a 
                        partner. Thank you, Clark.

           Clark’s face darkens. He knows he’s lost. But then something 
           occurs to him --

                                 CLARK
                        Don’t thank me so quickly.
           Clark abruptly SWERVES, pulling into the parking lot of Texas 
           Performing Arts. He slams on the brakes, then rounds on Joy.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        If G&T is liable for manufacturer 
                        errors, that only applies to errors 
                        committed by their employees. This 
                        wasn’t their fault. It was mine. And 
                        I am not a G&T employee.

                                 JOY
                        (unsettled)
                        Clark, let it go.

                                 CLARK
                        To stop one of the largest 
                        financial crimes in history, all I 
                        have to do is turn myself in, and 
                        hand over the evidence -- that I 
                        have right here.

           Clark pulls out the RABBIT’S FOOT. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        And I plan to do that right after 
                        Megan’s audition.

           Clark climbs out of the car. 

           EXT. TEXAS PERFORMING ARTS PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           As Clark walks towards the school, Joy chases after him.

                                 JOY
                        Clark! Wait! G&T is corrupt. They 
                        stole from my dad. They bribe state 
                        officials. They’re the real 
                        criminals. Not me. 

                                 CLARK
                        Their misconduct can’t absolve you.

                                 JOY
                        The old “two wrongs don’t make a 
                        right” speech? Save it.
                        (beat)
                        All you’ve ever done is follow the 
                        letter of the law. And where has it 
                        led you? Fired by the FBI. Fired by 
                        the Texas Bureau of No One Cares. 
                        And now your asshole father-in-law 
                        is taking your daughter away. And 
                        you’re letting him? Why? ‘Cause you 
                        always have to follow the rules?

           Clark is stoic. Joy presses harder.
                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I once told you, Clark, we’re not 
                        that different. We want the same 
                        thing -- justice. Help me get it.

                                 CLARK
                        I can’t. It’s not right. I follow 
                        the law -- or people get hurt.

                                 JOY
                        Sometimes people get hurt because 
                        you follow the law.

                                 CLARK
                        There’s nothing I can do about 
                        that. And I’m not going to stand 
                        here and --

                                 JOY
                        What do you stand for, Clark?

           Clark stares at her. He doesn’t have an answer. He looks at the 
           clock. 4:15. Shit. Clark opens the door and enters --

           INT. TEXAS PERF. ARTS ACADEMY / BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Clark scans the backstage area. A row of students, accompanied by 
           parents, are sitting and waiting to audition -- but no Megan. Did 
           he already miss her? Then he spots Orson. Clark runs over to him.

                                 ORSON
                        (sarcastic)
                        Father of the year.

                                 CLARK
                        Where is she?

           Orson gestures. Megan is already on stage. Just starting her 
           audition. Clark peeks into the auditorium. Family, coaches, 
           teachers. And in the front row -- the ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE.

           Megan looks offstage, spotting Clark. A moment between them. 
           Happiness. Relief. She starts PLAYING. It’s a difficult piece. But 
           she has her Nick Long cello -- and now she has Clark. She plays 
           beautifully. Clark is so incredibly proud. 

           Joy creeps inside the stage door. She watches from the back.

                                 ORSON
                        Born winner. She gets that from me.

                                 CLARK
                        She gets nothing from you... except 
                        money.
                                 ORSON
                        Does that mean you’re willing to 
                        drop your claim to custody?

                                 CLARK
                        (through gritted teeth)
                        I’m thinking about it.

           Clark watches Megan play, pondering what’s best for her, thinking 
           she deserves more. And then... she plays a WRONG NOTE. She stops.

                                 MEGAN
                        Sorry.

                                 ORSON
                        (grimacing)
                        She’s not supposed to do that.

                                 CLARK
                        I know.

           She goes back a few bars to try that section again... but she 
           makes the same mistake. Again she stops.

                                 MEGAN
                        Sorry. I mean sorry I -- sorry.

           Megan tries the section again... and hits the same glitch. She 
           stops. Looks at Clark, apologetically. Humiliated. Frozen. 

                                 ORSON
                        And this is what she gets from you. 

           Clark, impulsively, calls out from the wings.

                                 CLARK
                        It’s okay. Just move on.

           One of the Admission Committee members sternly SHUSHES Clark.

           Megan shakes her head. Clark pauses -- then runs out on stage. The 
           STERN ADMISSION JUDGE stands and scolds clark.

                                 STERN JUDGE
                        Parents and coaches are not allowed 
                        on stage during the auditions.

                                 CLARK
                        I know. Just -- one minute, please.

           Clark continues to Megan and kneels next to her. They whisper.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m sorry, dad.

                                 CLARK
                        What are you sorry for?
                                 MEGAN
                        You told me to get it right. And I 
                        didn’t.

                                 STERN JUDGE
                        Sir, get off the stage. You’re 
                        interfering with the audition. This 
                        is against the rules!

           That strikes a chord. And as Clark sees his daughter caught in a 
           familiar perfectionist/OCD loop, something in him snaps. Clark 
           lets out a small laugh. And then, in a very Un-Clark gesture --

                                 CLARK
                        Well, then -- fuck the rules. 

           Boom. The judge sits. Shocked. Clark turns back to Megan.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Megan. For a long time, I’ve been 
                        afraid of the world and its 
                        unpredictability. And I made you 
                        afraid, too. And I’m sorry. I am so 
                        very, very sorry.

           Megan sees how emotional Clark is. She reaches out to touch his 
           shoulder, but he stops her. Clark grabs her hand. Holds it tight.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        It’s not your job to be an adult. 
                        It’s not your job to save me. It’s 
                        your job to be a kid. To be 
                        reckless. To eat cookie dough and 
                        possibly give yourself Salmonella. 

           Megan half-smiles at this.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Now I want you to forget everything 
                        I ever told you -- and just play. 
                        For the love of it. Don’t worry 
                        about wrong notes. The only wrong 
                        note is no note at all. In fact, I 
                        hope you mess up -- in the best way 
                        possible. Just put your hands on 
                        the cello, close your eyes, and 
                        take a chance. I love you.

                                 MEGAN
                        I love you too, Dad.

           Clark turns around. Addresses the admission committee.

                                 CLARK
                        Sorry about before. Please don’t 
                        hold this against my daughter. She 
                        deserves a chance.
           Clark walks off-stage. Megan, alone, picks up the cello. She 
           closes her eyes -- and starts playing. It’s her moment. And she 
           shines. She plays, if not perfectly then beautifully. 

           Clark takes it in. Proud. And then he turns to Orson --

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. About that custody thing -- 
                        she needs her father.

           Orson nods. Maybe defeated -- maybe in agreement, then walks away.

           EXT. TEXAS PERFORMING ARTS PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Clark pushes through the stage doors into the parking lot behind 
           the theatre. Groups of parents are gathered there, gossiping. 
           Clark listens in closely. Are they talking about his daughter? 
           Nope. They’re talking about all those lotto winners!

           Joy approaches.

                                 CLARK
                        Over a thousand winners by the time 
                        this is over?

                                 JOY
                        1513 to be precise.

                                 CLARK
                        1513? 
                        (beat)
                        I’ve seen that number somewhere --

                                 JOY
                        It may or may not be the number of 
                        the patent G&T stole from my father.

           QUICK FLASHBACK to Clark at the patents office. The patent clerk 
           hands him a thick filing, labelled “1513.”

                                 CLARK
                        You know, most criminals don’t go 
                        for style points.

                                 JOY
                        It’ll be something to remember 
                        fondly while I’m hammering out 
                        license plates. Do they still do 
                        that in prison? Doesn’t matter.
                        (nodding to the theatre)
                        I’m just glad I got to hear Megan 
                        one last time before you cart me to 
                        jail.

                                 CLARK
                        You’re not going to jail. 
           Clark reaches into his pocket and hands Joy the RABBIT’S FOOT.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        (off her look)
                        You did say you were just lending 
                        it me for a little while.

                                 JOY
                        You realize this is the only 
                        evidence --

                                 CLARK
                        Yes. Yes, I do.

           Joy looks at Clark thankfully. Then she reaches into her pocket 
           and hands Clark his FBI MEDAL.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I thought this was lost.

                                 JOY
                        I know how much it means to you.

           Clark thinks for a moment. Then hands it back to her.

                                 CLARK
                        Keep it. I’m not a cop anymore. 
                        It’s time I moved on.

           Joy starts to say something, but Clark cuts her off.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        You don’t need to say anything 
                        else. You said it in the car. 
                        There’s more than one set of rules.

           Joy leans in. Grabs Clark. KISSES him closely on the cheek.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you.

           And with that, she’s gone. A beat later, Megan walks up. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Was that Joy? Will we be seeing her 
                        again?

                                 CLARK
                        I don’t know.

                                 MEGAN
                        So, she was innocent after all?

                                 CLARK
                        It’s complicated.

           Megan holds up a lotto ticket.
                                 MEGAN
                        I found this in my cello case. Do 
                        you know how it got there?

           Clark looks down. One star. Two stars. Three stars. It’s a winner.

                                 CLARK
                        (can’t help smiling)
                        No idea.

                                 MEGAN
                        Since you don’t work for the lotto 
                        anymore, couldn’t you redeem this?

                                 CLARK
                        A little redemption would be nice.

                                 MEGAN
                        Maybe our luck’s changing.

                                 CLARK
                        You never know.

           CHYRON: SIX MONTHS LATER

           INT. RAMSHACKLE OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE on CLARK filing paperwork in an office more dilapidated than 
           his old digs. For a moment, it seems life may actually have gotten 
           worse. Then, from the background, we hear:

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        The FBI’s expanding probe of the 
                        lottery industry claimed another 
                        victim today as Orson Cromwell, the 
                        powerful Texas land commissioner, 
                        resigned amidst bribery charges. 

           Clark looks up from his paperwork to see Orson, on TV, shielding 
           his face from local news reporters.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        The FBI probe has already engulfed 
                        top brass at G&T, including CEO Jim 
                        Sanders, who was indicted...

           The TV shows Sanders exiting G&T in handcuffs. Then a shadow falls 
           across the screen. Clark looks up to see--

           MEGAN, in her new school uniform. Surprised and delighted, Clark 
           greets her with a big hug.

                                 CLARK
                        Hey! Not that I’m complaining, but 
                        it’s not my weekend.
                                 MEGAN
                        Well, grandpa wasn’t home.

                                 CLARK
                        I’m supposed to feel bad about 
                        that, right?

           Megan shrugs.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        How did you even get here?

                                 MEGAN
                        I got a ride from a friend. 

                                 CLARK
                        You have friends that can drive? 
                        Not sure I like the sound of that.

                                 MEGAN
                        She said to give you this.

           Megan hands Clark a piece of paper. He unfolds it and realizes... 
           it’s a TAB from JOY, listing all the money Clark owes her.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I think you can afford it.

                                 CLARK
                        I think so, too.
                        (calling over his shoulder)
                        Can I take off a bit early, boss?

           We PAN OVER to the Sheriff, fast asleep at his desk, and we 
           realize that we’re in Rosalita. Clark is now a cop there.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        I should wake him. According to the 
                        deputy sheriff’s manual, it’s 
                        against regulation to clock out 
                        without verbal consent.

           The Sheriff begins snoring loudly. Megan gives Clark a look. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        We follow the rules or... we make 
                        our own.

           Megan and Clark nod at his new saying. They exit to find --

           JOY waiting in her McLaren. And with her, the hope of a new 
           family. Off this unconventional trio, we --

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

                                THE END
