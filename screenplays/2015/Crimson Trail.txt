           The SOUND of BUZZING FLIES.

           A PIG CARCASS

           Lies in the mud. Meat hacked from its bones. Entrails 
           scribbled on the ground. Flies swarm.

           The carcass lies in the dog trot of a--

           EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY

           --which sits in a small clearing ringed by dense forest. 
           Smoke leaks from the chimney. Cicadas drone.

           TITLE:

                                 KENTUCKY. 1799.
                              THE WESTERN FRONTIER.

           A shoeless MAN (30), FREDERICK STUMP, his face plain and 
           friendly, walks out of the forest and stops in the clearing. 

           He carries a string of fish, a plucked turkey, and under his 
           armpit, a fiddle. He walks toward the sagging cabin and 
           spots the dead pig. Frowns. 

           He readjusts his fiddle -- a nervous gesture.

           He approaches the cabin and KNOCKS. After a beat--

           The door opens and a YOUNG WOMAN appears, late teens, 
           delicate features drawn in tension. Stump bows his head.

                                 STUMP
                        Ma'am. Name's Frederick Stump. Ya 
                        new here, right? First time I seen 
                        this chimney smokin' since the 
                        Osgoods. 

           The woman doesn't return Stump's smile. She eyes his food.

                                 STUMP (CONT'D)
                        Brought ya a turkey and some 
                        freshwater drum. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        I'm ya neighbor. 

           From inside--

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE (O.S.)
                        Open the door.
           The woman opens the door, revealing a dark room.

           At the table in the back lurk TWO SILHOUETTES. The first, a 
           giant, meaty man, curls over a bloody meal.

           The second, a wiry fellow, leans back in his chair.

           TWO OTHER WOMEN, early twenties, sit in the corner. The 
           taller, sturdier of the two breastfeeds an infant. Her 
           sister, angled and distant, cradles another newborn. 

           A BABY CRIES. The young woman at the door rushes to a cloth-
           strewn pallet. Picks the baby up. Three women, three babies.

           The GRAVELLY VOICE belongs to the big silhouette--

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        Come in.

           Stump enters the--

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           The young woman exits with her CRYING BABY. The other women 
           follow, leaving Stump alone with the two men. 

           Stump steps forward and offers a hand.

                                 STUMP
                        Frederick Stump. Pleasure.

           No reaction. 

                                 STUMP (CONT'D)
                        Always welcome my neighbors with a 
                        little fiddlin'. Long as you don't 
                        look for any notes what go missin'.

           Stump CHUCKLES. But his laughter dies quickly. Then--  

                                 STUMP (CONT'D)
                        Brought ya a turkey and some 
                        freshwater--

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        We heard.

           Awkward silence. Stump can tell he's not wanted here. He 
           lays the food on the table.  

                                 STUMP
                        Well. Reckon I'll be off. 
                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        You brought a fiddle... and you're 
                        not going to play it? 

                                 STUMP
                            (
                             stumbles
                                    )
                        Oh. I'm... I thought you... I 
                        didn't want to interrupt.

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        What did you say?

                                 STUMP
                        Said I didn't mean to interrupt.   

           "LITTLE HARPE" (29), reedy with a snarl of red hair, stands 
           and walks past Stump to close the door. As he does, the big 
           man continues-- 

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        A knock on the door is, in point of 
                        fact, an interruption.

                                 STUMP
                        I'm... I wanted to offer a welcome 
                        is all.

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        Then welcome us.

           Silence. Stump slowly raises the fiddle. And plays. His 
           jittery hands render the MUSIC discordant. 

           The big man knifes a hunk of red meat into his mouth. He 
           shoves his plate across the table. It falls to the floor. 
           The gesture alarms Stump, and he stops playing.  

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Food went cold. 

                                 STUMP
                        I'll let you to it. I've, I've got 
                        some logs need choppin'. 

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE
                        Is that really what calls you?

           The man slides a Cherokee tomahawk from his rope belt. Hands 
           it to Little Harpe, who pulls a whetstone from his pocket. 
           SCRAPES it across the blade. Sharpening it.

                                 GRAVELLY VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Are you an honest man?
           Stump frowns, at a loss. Little Harpe LAUGHS, shrill.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        You smoked him, Mick.

           Stump eyes Little Harpe sharpening the blade. Backs away.

                                 STUMP
                        I ain't a liar, Mister, if that's 
                        what's asked.

           The big man stands. Six feet four inches. He moves toward 
           Stump. FOOTSTEPS BOOMING.

           Light from the window catches him. Close-cropped, jet black 
           hair. Dry peeling lips that rictus over yellowed teeth. Ink-
           drop eyes. This is “BIG HARPE" (31). 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Then why do you want to leave? Be 
                        honest.

           Little Harpe returns the sharpened tomahawk to his brother. 
           Stump swallows. And finally--

                                 STUMP
                        Because I'm... Because I'm afraid.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        See? That's honest.

           Stump moves toward the door. Little Harpe blocks him. 

                                 STUMP
                        I'll be takin' my leave now.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I think not.

           Stump swallows.

                                 STUMP
                        Why?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Because you knocked on our door.

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           The three women, each with their baby, sit on a fallen 
           hickory, fifty paces from the cabin.

           Behind them, Stump bursts out the door.
                                 STUMP
                        Help! Heeeeelp!

           Little Harpe runs after Stump and tackles him. Big Harpe 
           lumbers after, tomahawk in hand.

           The women don't look back. They talk as if they don’t hear 
           Stump's PANICKED SCREAMS behind them. SUSAN -- the taller, 
           sturdier one (24) -- speaks first. 

                                 SUSAN
                        “The Sun Was Sunk Beneath the 
                        Hill"?

           Her younger sister, BETSEY (22), angled and distant--

                                 BETSEY
                        Too sad for my likin'. Sal, you 
                        pick.

           The young woman who opened the door for Stump, SAL (19, 
           short for Sally) sings--

                                 SAL
                        Soldier, soldier will you marry me/
                        With your musket, fife and drum?/

           The others join in--

                                 HARPE WOMEN
                        Oh, how can I marry such a pretty 
                        girl as you/ 
                        When I have no hat to put on?

           In the BACKGROUND, Little Harpe holds a SHRIEKING Stump down 
           as Big Harpe buries his blade in the man's belly.  

           ON THE WOMEN as Stump SCREAMS OFF SCREEN. 

                                 HARPE WOMEN (CONT'D)
                        Off to the haberdasher she did go/ 
                        As fast as she could run...

           CLOSE on Sal, eyes locked with her baby’s, singing as loud 
           as she can to drown the SCREAMS. The SOUND carries us to--

           EXT. KENTUCKY WOODS - DAY

           The hush of the forest. Wind billows the leaves. 

           A grimy hand pulls a branch aside, revealing MOSES STEGALL 
           (27), built like knotted wood, eyes that could start a fire. 
           Buckskin shirt pooled with sweat. He looks out into a--
           FIELD

           Where a doe grazes in the grass. 

           Moses draws a long rifle from a holster on his back. Moving 
           slowly, he aims. And FIRES. 

           The round hits. The doe goes down, flailing. 

           Moses jogs toward his prey. But something else moves in the 
           grass. A--

           PACK OF TIMBER WOLVES

           Pounces on the doe.  

           Moses breaks into a run. He stops twenty paces shy of the 
           wolves tearing at the doe's flesh. Moses pulls out a belt 
           ax. Launches it at one of the wolves. 

           The ax cracks a wolf in the head. It collapses with a YELP. 
           All but one wolf scatters. The lone wolf -- the biggest -- 
           faces Moses, bloody muzzle snarling. Alpha. 

           Moses unsheathes a small hunting knife. Ready. Moses YELLS 
           and charges. The wolf runs at him.

           WIDE SHOT of the two clashing in the field. Moses falls on 
           the wolf, stabbing viciously. 

           MOSES

           Rises out of the grass, neck grazed, face blood-flecked. 

           At his feet, the wolf, bleeding out. IT WHINES. Suffering. 
           Moses stares. Eyes like ice. As the WOLF SUFFERS, he 
           sheathes the knife.  

           LATER

           Moses WHISTLES, carefree, as he ties the deer carcass to the 
           back of his aging black horse. 

           Moses vaults into the horse's saddle. He rides across the 
           field and nears the dying wolf. Hears its WHISPERED WHINING. 

           Moses stops. Scratches under his slouch hat. 

                                 MOSES
                        Whattya think, Smudge?

           The horse ignores him. Moses hops off. Takes out his knife. 
           With a quick stroke, Moses ends the wolf's suffering.  
           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Moses rides on a thin, barely-trod dirt road that winds 
           through the countryside. 

           A spindly, WHITE-HAIRED MAN (49) runs along the road from 
           the other direction. Desperate. 

                                 MOSES
                        Hey, whoa. You all right?

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                            (
                             breathless
                                      )
                        Squar McBee... Do ya know... where 
                        he is? The justice a' the peace?

                                 MOSES
                        Silas? He's over there. 

           Moses points at a two story log cabin a quarter of a mile 
           off the road. The man runs in that direction.  

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Knock loud, now!

           INT. SILAS MCBEE'S HOME - DAY

           HIGH ANGLE looking down on a stout, fleshy man, lying 
           unconscious in a pool of his own vomit.  

           POUNDING on the door. 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN (O.S.)
                        Squar McBee! Squar McBee!  

           Silas's eyes flutter open. He raises his head. One side of 
           his bristle-bearded cheek caked in retch. He winces at the 
           incessant POUNDING on the door. This is SILAS McBEE (45).

                                 SILAS
                        Sammy!  

           A black OLD MAN enters the room. He doesn't bat an eye at 
           Silas's condition.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Sir?

                                 SILAS
                        Shut that man up. 
           INT. SILAS'S BEDROOM - DAY

           A woman lies in bed. Bandages cover her head and chest. She 
           breathes faintly. 

           Silas, still a mess, stands at the foot of her bed. His eyes 
           teary at the sight of her. 

                                 SILAS
                        She stir? 

           A young lady, the ATTENDANT, sits in a chair at the woman's 
           side. She shakes her head. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        No, sir. More red in her cheeks, 
                        though. Good a sign as any.

           The old man enters the room. Silas turns to him. 

                                 SILAS
                        Is he gone?

                                 OLD MAN
                        He say he got business for you, 
                        sir. Say he found a body. 

                                 SILAS
                        How far?

                                 OLD MAN
                        Gonna be a ride.

                                 SILAS
                        Christ.

           Silas pivots, looking for something.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Right here, sir. 

           The old man holds up a silver flask. Silas smiles a thanks 
           as he takes the flask, unscrews it, and drinks. 

                                 OLD MAN (CONT'D)
                        May I suggest you clean your face, 
                        sir? 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Moses rides toward a two story cabin -- the only building in 
           sight. The SOUND OF A CRYING NEWBORN carries us to--
           INT. STEGALL HOME - DAY

           CLOSE ON A WAILING NEWBORN, lying in a waist-high bassinet.

           MARY STEGALL (25) -- radiant despite sleepless eyes, her 
           linsey-woolsey dress glowing in the sun that finds her 
           through the window -- stands by a boiling pot at the stove.

           In a strainer on top of the steaming pot, some flowers. As 
           she shakes the strainer, she rocks the bassinet.

                                 MARY
                        Shhh, little one. I'm right here...

           The door opens and Moses walks in. He leans over the 
           bassinet. Regards his crying son.

                                 MOSES
                        If I understood you, Abraham, I'd 
                        abide your sermon.

                                 MARY
                        He's saying, “Get out of my face, 
                        Pa. I'm hurtin'."

                            (
                             to baby
                                 MOSES
                                   )
                        Was it her cooking?

           Mary swats her husband. She notices the blood on his neck. 
           Pulls his collar down, revealing a shallow bite mark. 

                                 MARY
                        God above, Moses. 

                            (
                             playful
                                 MOSES
                                   )
                        Got you dinner, didn't I? You wanna 
                        thank me, I'll take it lying down.

                            (
                             smiles
                                 MARY
                                  )
                        You'll take nothing of the sort 
                        whilst your son's caterwauling.  

                                 MOSES
                        I can spare some grains of niter.

                                 MARY
                        We're not giving gunpowder to a 
                        baby. 
                            (
                                                     )
                             re: herbs in the strainer
                        I got winter savory in the steam -- 
                        better for colic anyhow.
           Moses picks up the CRYING BABY and lays a calloused hand 
           over the baby's tiny head.

           Almost instantly, the BABY QUIETS. Moses looks at Mary. 

                                 MOSES
                        I got the Lord's touch. 

                                 MARY
                        I want to smack you right now. 

           EXT. STEGALL HOME - DAY

           The baby sleeps in a bassinet tucked in the shade of the 
           cabin. Mary leans against the hitching post. A Bible in her 
           hands. Moses packs provisions into his saddle bag. 

                                 MOSES
                        “There is nothing concealed that 
                        will not be disclosed, or hidden 
                        that will not... be revealed?” That 
                        ain't right.

                                 MARY
                        That is not right.

                                 MOSES
                        That is not right. Look it up, now. 
                        Matthew--

                                 MARY
                        Matthew ten-twenty six.

           Mary flips through the pages. Movement catches Moses’ eye. 
           He turns and sees--

           A GIRL IN A MUDDY WHITE DRESS. Six, seven years old. Walking 
           away from him, through the grass.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Here it is.

           Moses snaps out of his reverie. Turns to Mary as she reads--

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        “... there is nothing hidden that 
                        will not be made known.”

           Moses looks back. THE GIRL IS GONE. Moses’ imagination.

                                 MOSES
                        Not be made known. Not be made 
                        known. Not be made known.
                                 MARY
                        Moses, don’t worry about getting 
                        the quote right. Speak from the 
                        soul. The rest will-- 

           Moses grabs Mary and pulls her into a kiss. Passionate. He 
           breaks away. Smitten, Mary holds up a sack. 

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Earned yourself a journey cake. 

           Moses tucks the sack into his saddle bag. Climbs onto his 
           horse. Mary places a hand on Moses' leg.

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        You can change this land.

                                 MOSES
                        Not the land needs changin'. 

           Moses winks at her. Gallops off. 

           EXT. KENTUCKY WILDS - DAY

           Moses rides east across the Kentucky wilderness.  As he 
           travels we see more signs of civilization: cabins, dirt 
           roads... the beginnings of a settlement.

           EXT. CLEARING - DAY

           Late afternoon. Moses trots into a clearing where a new 
           wooden CHURCH stands. In front of the church, two trestles 
           hold a giant beam of wood. 

           One man, HUDGENS (61), stout as a barrel with cloudy white 
           hair, stands on top of the beam, cutting it with one end of 
           a giant saw. A cross around his neck. Good-natured smile.

           Moses dismounts.

                                 MOSES
                        Hope you're givin' Gilmore a turn 
                        outta the saw pit, Hudgens.

                                 HUDGENS
                        It suits him down there.

           Holding the other end of the saw, inside the pit beneath the 
           beam, is GILMORE (44). Jovial face. An angry musket ball 
           scar mars his neck -- he's a mute.

           Moses leans down close to Gilmore.
                                 MOSES
                        You toleratin' this roustabout?

           Gilmore smiles. Points up at Hudgens and rolls his eyes.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Don't I know it.
                                      )
                            (
                             to Hudgens
                        Your ears burning? We're chatting 
                        about your shortcomings.

           Moses rises. He steps into the--  

           INT. CHURCH - DAY 

           Simple room with plain cut pews and stairs leading to a 
           pulpit. Moses looks down. Stamps his feet.

                                 MOSES
                        Good, level flooring. Nice beading 
                        on the boards. 

           Hudgens appears in the doorway, catching his breath.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Few of the roof slats are cracked. 
                        We could swap them before tomorrow, 
                        if we're swift. 

           Moses studies the roof. 

                                 MOSES
                        No rain tomorrow. Roof'll hold. The 
                        roof will hold. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Listen to you, minding your 
                        diction. You'll be a wonder behind 
                        that pulpit, Moses.  

           Moses walks to the doorway. Looks out at the woods.

                                 MOSES
                        If anybody comes. 

           Gilmore walks up the stairs. Stops half way up. Picks up a 
           caterpillar crawling along the step. Sets it on the ground, 
           out of harm's way. Hudgens and Moses watch him. Then--

                                 HUDGENS
                        They'll come. All plants grow 
                        toward the light.  
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The white-haired man holds a burning torch in the middle of 
           the black woods. Shadows dance as he walks.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        It's over here in the--

           The man hears the SOUND OF URINATION. He turns and sees--

           Silas peeing on a tree. The man waits as Silas finishes. The 
           justice of the peace stumbles forward, drunk.

                                 SILAS
                        Don't lemme stop ya. 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        I was sayin', it's... he's over 
                        here in the crick. 

           The man takes a few more steps toward the sound of MURMURING 
           WATER and BUZZING FLIES. He covers his mouth. 

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
                        Jesus.

           Silas grabs the torch. Walks forward. 

                                 SILAS
                        Jesus ain't in Kentucky.

           Silas steps forward. He lowers the torch to illuminate a--

           BLOATED CORPSE at the edge of the creek. The remains of 
           Frederick Stump.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN (O.S.)
                        Lookit the belly.

           Silas does. A large opening in the abdomen, voided of 
           organs. Maggots. An awful realization hits Silas.

                                 SILAS
                        Damnation.

           Silas removes the flask from the inside of his coat. 
           Unscrews it and drinks.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        Let me a draw, Squar?

           Silas ignores him, finishes the flask, and returns it to his 
           pocket. Silas speaks with authority for once--
                                 SILAS
                        Tried to sink him with rocks. Been 
                        in the water a day, two at the 
                        most, judging by the bloat. Looks 
                        like Frederick Stump, poor devil.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        I hope he warn't alive when them 
                        organs was stole.

                                 SILAS
                        He was.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        Howdya' know?

                                 SILAS
                        Go home now. Stop for no travelers 
                        and latch your doors fast.

                                 WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                        What for?

                            (
                             fearful
                                 SILAS
                                   )
                        The Harpes are here. 

           (Harpes sounds like Harps.) 

           INT. STEGALL HOME - NIGHT

           Mary holds a sleeping Abraham. As slowly and gently as she 
           can, she sets him down in the bassinet. He stirs. Mary 
           freezes. Abraham sleeps. She exhales, relieved. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           She wets her hands and face from a bowl of water.  
           Somewhere, a BABY CRIES. Mary stands suddenly. Listening. 
           She throws a look at Abraham. He's still sleeping. 

           EXT. STEGALL HOME - NIGHT

           Mary opens the door and looks out. Hears CRICKETS and 
           KATYDIDS. And again, a baby CRYING. In the woods. Mary 
           strains her eyes, focusing on the sound.  

                                 BIG HARPE (O.S.)
                        Beautiful evening, ma'am.

           Mary starts. She turns to see the HARPES, silhouetted by 
           moonlight, at the corner of her house. 

                                                        CUT TO BLACK.
           SOUNDS of a HORSE GALLOPING.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Silas, his face slicked with sweat, rides out of the woods 
           toward his home. His servant hobbles up to him, panicked.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Neighbor's house! It's burnin'!

           Silas wheels. Though a thick copse of trees, a FIRE.

                                 SILAS
                        The Stegalls.
                             nods at his cabin
                                             )
                            (
                        Catherine?

                                 OLD MAN
                        Hasn't woke. But she safe. You just 
                        find out who done it, sir.  

           Silas stares at the fire.

                                 SILAS
                        I know who done it.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Sun shines warmly on the wooden church.

                                 MOSES (V.O.)
                        Thank you for coming...

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Moses stands in front of a dozen frontier folk -- each of 
           them rapt. Hudgens sits in the back, watching. No sign of 
           Gilmore. Moses is a commanding presence. 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        ... for today we bless this Church. 
                        Christen it as a home of God.  
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        I stand before you a sinner. We--

           The GIRL IN THE MUDDY WHITE DRESS walks down the aisle, away 
           from Moses. He watches. Then shakes off the vision. 

                                 MOSES
                        We are all sinners. Some of us sin 
                        in the light. Others in the dark. 
                        But there is nowhere you--
           Gilmore enters and accosts Hudgens. Hudgens WHISPERS 
           heatedly as Gilmore gesticulates. Moses pauses for a moment, 
           watching the two, before resuming-- 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        ... But there is nowhere you sin 
                        that He does not see. “There is 
                        nothing concealed that will not 
                        be--"

           Moses stops again as Gilmore and Hudgens continue their 
           debate. Heads turn to the back of the church to look at the 
           exchange. Moses stares at them. 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Gentlemen?

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Moses follows Gilmore out into the sunshine. Hudgens trails 
           them both.

                                 HUDGENS
                        I'm sorry, Moses. This isn't worth 
                        the interruption. 

                                 MOSES
                        What is it?

                                 HUDGENS
                        He says something bad's in the air. 
                        I can't smell it, but he's got a 
                        nose like a hunting hound.

           Gilmore climbs a tree. Stands on a branch looking out. 

                                 MOSES
                        Something's wrong, ain't it, Gil?
                            (
                             quiet, to himself
                                             )
                        Isn't it, Gil?

           Gilmore wiggles his fingers at Hudgens -- their own code.

                                 HUDGENS
                        He can make out smoke, right so.

           Hudgens points. Moses follows the gaze. 

                                 MOSES
                        West. Mary.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Could be Cherokee signals, could be 
                        chimney smoke...
                                 MOSES
                        That far out? Got to be one big 
                        chimney fire. 

           Hudgens ushers Moses toward the church.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Moses, it's nothing. Your 
                        congregation awaits. 

           Moses looks at the church. Several frontier folk have 
           gathered at the doorway, watching. Moses looks back west. 
           Deciding. Then to the congregation--

                                 MOSES
                        I'm sorry. Next Sunday. 

           Moses jumps on his horse and rides out, leaving a 
           disappointed Hudgens. 

           Gilmore runs to his horse to follow. 

           EXT. STEGALL HOME - DAY

           ON A HEAP of blackened, smoldering logs and joists. All that 
           remains of the Stegall home.

           Across from the pile stands Silas, begrimed and hungover.

           The GALLOP of a HORSE draws his attention to--

           MOSES 

           Who rides up. Silas rushes to intercept him.

                                 SILAS
                        Moses--

           Moses leaps down from his horse, runs around Silas, and 
           makes for his home.  

                                 MOSES
                        Mary! Maaaary!

           Silas wraps two arms around Moses and stops him.

                                 SILAS
                        There's nothin' left, Moses. 

                                 MOSES
                        Where is she? Where'd she go? Mary! 
                        Maaary! Where's Abraham?!
                                 SILAS
                        They're gone, Moses. They're gone.

           Moses SCREAMS. And collapses.

           LATER

           CLOSE ON Mary's Stegall's burned corpse, lying amid the 
           blackened house. THREE KNIVES stick out of her front.

           Moses kneels by her, knees on the charred timber, praying. 
           Haloed by smoke. His face a mess of tears and snot.

           Watching him, hats in their hands: Silas, Hudgens, and 
           Gilmore, who gestures for all the men to turn their backs. 
           Give Moses his privacy. The men turn.

           Moses finishes his silent prayer. He pulls one of the knives 
           out of his wife's belly -- buried so deep it is UNTOUCHED BY 
           THE FIRE.

           Something catches his eye. He moves a board from a pile of 
           ash resembling a bassinet. He finds--

           A tiny, charred skull. 

           Moses picks up the skull. As he did a day ago, he lays a 
           calloused hand over the top of the skull.

           LONG SHOT of Moses amid the ruins, seen from within the--

           EXT. KENTUCKY WOODS - DAY

           Big Harpe looms in the FOREGROUND. Watching Moses. Little 
           Harpe sits at his side.  

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Moses is alone.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Call that alone?

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        This our chance to rush him, is my 
                        meanin'. 
                            (
                             off Big Harpe's silence
                                                   )
                        What then? What's our aim?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Nothing changes. We go to the Cave. 

           Big Harpe stands. Walks back toward the horses.
                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Get the women. We're riding. 

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        What about Moses?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        He'll have his time with us yet.  

           EXT. STEGALL HOME - DAY

           CLOSE on a small grave. SOUNDS of a shovel hitting dirt.

           REVEAL Moses digging a grave for his wife next to his 
           newborn's grave. 

           Moses' eyes catch Silas, who receives a bottle of spirits 
           from Sammy, his servant. Sammy kicks his horse and trots 
           off. Silas approaches Moses, refilling his flask.

                                 SILAS
                        Moses. Three men here. We can make 
                        this chore go faster.

           Moses doesn't answer. He digs. Silas continues--

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        I believe this devil's work to be 
                        that of the Harpes. Micajah and 
                        Wiley. Soulless brothers.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        You heard of 'em?

           Moses stops digging. His face pales. He looks up at Silas.

                                 MOSES
                        Thought the Harpes were in 
                        Danville.

                                 SILAS
                        They escaped this Spring. 
                             off Moses' look
                            (
                                           )
                        Governor Garrard priced their heads 
                        at three hundred dollars. We're 
                        gonna ride on ‘em. You fit to come 
                        with?

                                 MOSES
                        I'm not riding with you.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        You're riding with me. 
                                 SILAS
                        These are slippery men, Moses. I 
                        heard they allied themselves with 
                        the most vile redskin savages, and 
                        they'll vanish among 'em if we 
                        tarry. 

           Hudgens comes over and pulls Silas away by the elbow. He 
           speaks low, so Moses can't hear.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Squire McBee, is it? Let the man 
                        bury his kin in peace, as the Lord 
                        would have it.   

                                 SILAS
                        You want peace? Take your hand off 
                        my goddamn elbow.
                             to Moses
                            (
                                    )
                        We depart now. Afore the trail goes 
                        cold.

                                 MOSES
                        Harpes can run as long as they 
                        like. They will not be spared their 
                        justice.

                                 SILAS
                        What makes you so certain?

                                 MOSES
                        Because I'm coming for them.

           OFF Silas's look...

           LATER

           ON TWO GRAVES, marked with a stone each.

           Hudgens and Gilmore stand by the graves, hats in their 
           hands, paying their respects.

           Moses sifts through the sack with Mary's journey cake in it. 
           He removes a white handkerchief with "MS" stitched in the 
           corner. He touches the "MS."   

           The SOUND OF HOOF BEATS. Moses sees--

           JOHN LEIPER (28, sounds like Leeper), blue-eyed rogue with a 
           coonskin cap and a mouth that won't quit smirking, astride a 
           white Mustang horse. Silas escorts him. 
                                 SILAS
                        Moses, this is John Leiper. We are 
                        fortunate his path crossed with 
                        ours.   

           Moses tucks the handkerchief in his pouch. 

                                 MOSES
                        Are we.

                                 SILAS
                        Leiper says he had a run-in with 
                        the Harpes years back.

                                 LEIPER
                        To know 'em is to want 'em dead. 
                        And I can't say the reward coin 
                        won't fit in my pocket.

                                 MOSES
                        What better way to make a profit?

           Leiper says nothing.

                                 SILAS
                        Leiper's a dead shot.

           Leiper draws a long rifle. Aims at a distant tree. FIRES. 

           In the distance, a goose falls to the ground.

           Leiper levels a gaze on Moses, who doesn't flinch.

                                 MOSES
                        We're not hunting geese.

                                 LEIPER
                        Everythin' kill the same.

           Moses glances at his family's graves.

                                 MOSES
                        We'll find out. 

           Moses mounts his horse. Then-- 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Let's run ‘em down.

           EXT. KENTUCKY COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           The posse rides, five-strong -- a heroic tableau.
           EXT. KENTUCKY PLAINS - DAY

           Moses examines the ground among some tall grass. 

                                 MOSES

                            (
                                            )
                        Hoof tracks. Dirt's not packed high 
                        at the heel -- they ain't--
                             corrects himself
                        --they are not moving fast.

                                 SILAS
                        Then let's go.

                                 MOSES
                        There's more. Three other souls on 
                        foot.

           Moses points to the ground behind them: bare footprints. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Prisoners? 

                                 SILAS
                        Harpes don't take prisoners.

           Moses puts his horse into a trot. As the others follow--

                                 HUDGENS
                        Did I miss something? Who’s heeling 
                        them in bare feet?

                                 LEIPER
                        Their women. Three of 'em they 
                        share like they's passin’ a jug of 
                        corn whiskey.

           Gilmore spits on the ground.   

                                 HUDGENS
                        Why on Earth would any women 
                        consort with those monsters?

                                 LEIPER
                        We catch ‘em, I'll ask ‘em for ya.

           Gilmore rides up next to Silas. Gestures at him. Hudgens 
           translates the gestures.

                                 HUDGENS
                        He wants to know why you don't wear 
                        a badge. 
                            (
                             off Silas' look
                                           )
                        If you're law, where's your badge?
           Silas rides on without answering. Hudgens looks at Gilmore.

                                 HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                        Maybe he doesn't like the sound of 
                        your voice.

           Silas rides next to Moses.

                                 SILAS
                        Moses, I know a man who has tracked 
                        the Harpes before. He's called 
                        Trabue. Colonel Daniel Trabue. He 
                        lives not too far afield from this 
                        very trail...

                                 MOSES
                        The path I'm on leads to the 
                        murderers of my family.  

           Silas says nothing.

           EXT. KENTUCKY WOODS - DAY

           Sal breastfeeds as she trudges along, exhausted. Beside her, 
           Betsey and Susan plod forward on tattered moccasins.

           Sal stops and leans a shoulder against a tree. She picks a 
           large splinter from her bloody heel.

           Little Harpe turns to look back at them.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        No stallin’!

                                 SAL
                        Sorry, Wiley.

           Sal continues after the horses, trying to keep up. Betsey, 
           holding her baby, walks next to Sal.

                                 BETSEY
                            (
                             whisper)
                        I heard Mick say there’s regulators 
                        on us. Again.

           Sal nods. She heard the same thing. Betsey walks closer.

                                 BETSEY (CONT'D)
                        My baby won't latch. My feet is 
                        bruised. I am at my end. 

                                 SAL
                        Keep your voice down.
                                 BETSEY
                        Why? Let ‘em hear me. Let ‘em bleed 
                        me. It’d be a mercy.

                                 SAL
                        What do you think will happen to 
                        our children if Mick and Wiley came 
                        down on us?  

           Betsey looks down at her infant. Then--

                            (
                             whisper
                                 BETSEY
                                   )
                        You hear about that Ann Lee? She 
                        set up camp in Pleasant Hill. She'd 
                        take us in--

                                 SAL
                        Ann Lee's dead. 

                                 BETSEY
                        Not all the Shakers is. You can 
                        midwife; we can make a living for 
                        ourselves--

                                 SAL
                        What about Susan?

                                 BETSEY
                        She got no time for anybody but 
                        them two. 

                                 SAL
                        Them two who sired our children.

                                 BETSEY
                        You want your child raised by those 
                        butchers?

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Know the greatest butcher of all? 

           Sal and Betsey turn, surprised to see Susan walking directly 
           behind them. Close.

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        It's He who saw fit to put 
                        sufferin' in this world. Ain't 
                        nobody crueler than Him. Which make 
                        these two? Mick especial? His 
                        finest creations. You ask me.

           With that, the conversation ends.
           WITH BIG AND LITTLE HARPE

           Little Harpe, agitated.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Mick, we got the press a’ time on 
                        on us. Posse's closin’ in even now. 
                        Mick.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        The women need mounts. It's like 
                        walkin' with fish barrels tied to 
                        our ankles.

           Big Harpe holds up a hand. Shush.

           Ahead of them, a field of grazing buffalo.

           Big Harpe looks back at their hoof prints in the ground. He 
           holds out a hand to his brother.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Rifle.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           On a rolling plain checkered with trees, the posse, astride 
           their horses, are at a standstill. Waiting. 

           ON MOSES, his features dark with anger. He swats a bug.

           ON SILAS, peeing on a tree. The posse waits. Long pee.

                                 LEIPER
                        He waterin' just the one tree, or 
                        the field entire?

           Silas finishes and walks toward his horse with an inebriated 
           gait. He marks Moses' expression.

                                 SILAS
                        If we left when I said, we woulda 
                        had the Harpes in sight by now, so 
                        spare me the ugly eyes.

           Moses watches Silas drunkenly mount his horse. And then-- 

           A SHOT RINGS OUT. The horses startle.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Sounded close.

           Hudgens looks at Gilmore, who gestures.
                                 HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                        Gil puts the report half a mile 
                        out. From yon woods.

           Moses prods his horse, but the horse agitates, trotting back 
           and forth.

                                 MOSES
                        What is it, Smudge?

           Moses turns his head, hearing something... something faint.

           He notices a pebble on the ground, vibrating.

           Moses shields his eyes from the sun and looks out. 

           Silas pulls out a BRASS FIELD TELESCOPE. Looks through it.

           SILAS'S POV - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

           In the distance, above the trees, dust rises.

           SILAS

           Lowers the telescope. Looks at Moses.

                                 MOSES
                        Stampede.

           THE BUFFALO STAMPEDE

           A maelstrom of brown buffalo thunders through the trees.

           WITH THE POSSE

           Moses points to sheer limestone cliffs abutting the field, a 
           hundred paces to their right.

                                 MOSES
                        Move to the cliffs!  

           They take off. Silas's horse rears back and Silas, drunk, 
           slips off. His head claps into a rock. His horse takes off, 
           chasing the posse. Silas doesn't move.  

           Galloping, Moses looks back and sees Silas's horse, 
           riderless. The posse reaches the cliffs as Moses jumps off 
           his horse. He hands the reins to Gilmore.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Here.

           Moses draws his rifle as he runs toward Silas.
                                 HUDGENS
                        Moses! Don't! 

           But Moses is already out of earshot, sprinting through the 
           tall grass. He arrives at Silas. Tugs at his shirt. 

                                 MOSES
                        Silas! Get up! 

           Silas moans. His eyes flutter. He stirs. 

           The rumbling is deafening. The wave of buffalo crashes out 
           of the trees and spills onto the plain ahead. A line of 
           death heading their way. 

           Moses kneels. Aims his long rifle at the coming stampede--

           And fires. The ball splashes into the earth. No effect.

           The stampede, thirty seconds away.

           Moses pulls a powder horn off his belt. Powders the muzzle.

           Twenty seconds.

           He retrieves a ball and cloth from another pouch. Slips them 
           in the muzzle.

           Ten seconds.

           Silas awakes. Sees the stampede. He SCREAMS. 

           Moses slides his ramrod off the barrel. Stuffs the round in. 
           Pulls the cock back.

           No time to aim. He fires into the air.

           The report spooks the buffaloes in front and they split--

           HIGH ANGLE 

           Of the buffalo stampeding around Moses and Silas, like a 
           river breaking on a stone, missing them by feet.

           ON THE POSSE

           Pressed against the cliff as the stampede rumbles away 
           across the field and fades. Dust swarms the air. 

           SILAS

           Breathing in panicked bursts. Clutching his heart. A hand 
           appears in front of his face.
           Moses stands over him. Silas takes the offered hand. Moses 
           pulls Silas to his feet. 

                                 MOSES
                        Can you walk?

           Silas, breathless, touches his head. Nods. In a daze--

                                 SILAS
                        I... I fell off.

           Moses leans over and picks up Silas's dropped flask. Hands 
           it to him.

                                 MOSES
                        You dropped this. 

           Moses pats Silas on the arm and walks back toward the cliff. 
           Silas watches him go, bewildered.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Moses strides toward the others. The posse looks at him with 
           wide eyes. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Well don't that beat all fire and 
                        thunder? Ya got flint, Moses. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        The wicked flee, but the righteous 
                        are bold as a lion. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Don't reckon a lion would sit tight 
                        for a stampede. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Ten dollars says it was the Harpe 
                        devils what started it.

                                 HUDGENS
                        What manner of men would attempt 
                        murder with a herd of buffalo?

                                 LEIPER
                        Ones we're doggin'.

                                 MOSES
                        This wasn't a murder attempt.  

                                 SILAS (O.S.)
                        What was it then?

           Silas hobbles toward them, still catching his breath. 
           Moses points to the ground, pockmarked with hoof prints.

                                 MOSES
                        Covered their tracks.

           The posses takes in the mess of hoofprints. Gilmore 
           whistles, as if to say, this is going to take awhile.

           LATER

           The sun droops low in the sky. The men stand on the ground, 
           about ten paces apart each, poring over the hoofprints.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Can we not follow the buffalo 
                        tracks to their point of origin and 
                        recover the trail there?  

           Leiper wanders close.

                                 LEIPER
                        Harpes is smart as whips. They 
                        likely doubled back and altered 
                        their course. 

           They sift through the grass for another moment.

                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        How'd you meet your friend there, 
                        Hudgens? Gabby Gilmore?

                                 HUDGENS
                        War. He lost the powers of speech 
                        taking a musket ball for me in the 
                        neck. Which is why I frown on 
                        strangers making sport of his 
                        condition. 

                                 LEIPER
                        You make sport of it. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        I'm his familiar. You're not.

           Gilmore nudges Hudgens. Gesticulates. Leiper sees this.

                                 LEIPER
                        What's the dumbshow?

                                 HUDGENS
                        He says you can make sport of him. 
                        So long as you don't mind him 
                        calling you an idiot. 
           Leiper smirks.

                                 LEIPER
                        If the shoe fits.

           WITH MOSES AND SILAS

           As they comb through the grass. Moses is intent on his task, 
           Silas stumbles along, casually looking at the ground.

                                 SILAS
                        This could take days.

                                 MOSES
                        The way you're looking it will.

                                 SILAS
                        Moses... Back there... 

           Moses looks at Silas, who struggles for the words. 

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        I owe you my... What I mean to say 
                        is--

                                 MOSES
                        You lost your grip. Happens to us 
                        all. 

           Silas swallows, relieved. Moses looks at the confusing 
           medley of tracks and grass. 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Think your friend would help us? 
                        Colonel Trabue, was it? 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Big and Little Harpe stand inside the woods, looking out at 
           the posse. At Moses.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        If we want to get to the Cave, we 
                        shouldn't waste no more time. 

           Big Harpe's eyes follow Moses, who mounts his horse. The 
           others follow suit.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Didn't you say we need mounts?

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

           THE MOON disappearing behind dark clouds. We are in--
           EXT. DEAD FOREST - NIGHT

           THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning sparks the clouds. The posse 
           travels through a woods of leafless trees -- a dead forest.

                                 SILAS
                        Col. Trabue rode in Ballenger's 
                        posse against the Harpes, after 
                        they fled Danville. He knows the 
                        Harpes better'n any man alive.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Am I the only one unnerved that all 
                        these trees are dead?

                                 MOSES
                        They've been girdled.

                                 LEIPER
                        Girdled? Ain’t that a fashion 
                        reserved for the womenfolk?

                                 MOSES
                        Old farming technique. Score the 
                        trunks around, kill the tree. Lets 
                        in sunlight so you can crop without 
                        clearing the land. 

           Gilmore, riding in back, hears something. He turns around. 

           Nothing but a hall of barren trees. 

           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           In the dim orange light thrown from the windows, Moses and 
           the others tie their horses to a hitching post.

           Silas knocks on the front door.

                                 SILAS
                        Hello the house! Callin’ for 
                        Colonel Daniel Trabue!

           The cabin's door opens. COL. TRABUE (50s), a stooped man 
           with scars crawling out of an untamed white beard, eyes them 
           warily for a beat. He lights up when he registers--

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Silas McBee! Father above, look 
                        ‘atcha. Yer only meanta have one 
                        dinner a night, ya know that, 
                        soldier?

           Trabue LAUGHS as he slaps Silas’s ample gut. 
                                 COL. TRABUE (CONT'D)
                        How's Catherine and the ankle 
                        biter? 

           Silas flinches at the words. Moses notices. 

                                 SILAS
                        We have somber business, Daniel.
                                 Trabue’s look)
                            (
                             off 
                        We’re trackin’ the Harpes.

           Trabue’s levity vanishes.

           A sudden THUNDER CRASH carries us to--

           INT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           The SOUND of RAIN HAMMERING the log walls mingles with the 
           CRACKLES of the FIRE in the hearth.

           Trabue plucks a burning ember from the flames with metal 
           tongs and lights his clay pipe with it.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Nowhere the Harpes go what 
                        sufferin' don’t follow. You men 
                        thirsty?

           Leiper, Hudgens, and Gilmore, sitting around the kitchen 
           table, look at each other.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Throat could stand a watering.

                                 LEIPER
                        Amen.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Johnny!

           An angled boy of thirteen, JOHNNY, climbs down from the loft 
           above. Good posture on this young man. Eager to please.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Tankards all around? Whiskey or 
                        ale?

                                 SILAS
                        Rye whiskey? 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Corn. Aged it myself in the charred 
                        oaks out front. Technique outta'

                                 (MORE)
                                 COL. TRABUE (CONT'D)
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Only the best for the hunters of 
                        Harpes.

           Silas grins at the prospect. Then touches the back of his 
           head, remembering.

                                 SILAS
                        I... I will have water.

           Moses looks at Silas, surprised. As does Col. Trabue.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        For Silas McBee? You hit your head?

                                 SILAS
                        I did, so it happens.

           Trabue shrugs. Points around the room. 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Who's got hair on their chest?

                                 MOSES
                        I'll take a water.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Huh? What kind of posse welcomes 
                        the evening hours with water?

           Moses says nothing. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Water suits us fine, doesn't it?

           Gilmore nods. Leiper looks around, feeling pressured. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Hellfire, I'll take a water too.

           Silas nods his thanks to the men. 

           Col. Trabue shakes his head, mystified. 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Well. Water’s wet where it counts, 
                        reckon. Johnny, fetch these men 
                        their drinks.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Yes sir.

           Johnny, pitcher in hand, runs out the back. 
           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Rain pours. Johnny pops the lid off a wooden barrel. He 
           reaches down to fill the pitcher. Barely any water.

           Johnny looks in the direction of the forest. He looks down 
           at his pitcher. 

           INT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           The men have gathered around Col. Trabue.  

                                 SILAS
                        Danny, we're hopin' you might have 
                        insight as to where our quarry is 
                        headin'.

           Trabue puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Well. 
                            (
                             thinks
                                  )
                        Given the direction they came from, 
                        and the direction you says they 
                        goin', only one place they's 
                        headin'. Cave-In-Rock. 

           This catches Moses' attention.

                                 SILAS
                        Cave-In-Rock. That's Samuel Mason's 
                        hole. 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Only they don't call him Samuel 
                        Mason. They call him--

                                 MOSES
                        The Captain. 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        That's the one. 

                                 SILAS
                        Then we have to reach the Harpes 
                        afore they make it there. Else 
                        they're good as gone. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        What is the significance of Cave-
                        In-Rock?
                                 SILAS
                        It's home to the worst low lifes 
                        around. Robbers, murderers, 
                        rapists...

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        And the Captain's their master. 
                        He'd shame King Herod hisself. But 
                        he's a songbird next to the Harpes. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Enlighten us, Colonel. Who are 
                        these people? The Harpes?

           Trabue settles into a chair. Puffs on his pipe. Then--

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        I rode agin’ ‘em with “Devil" Joe 
                        Ballenger. Four days on their trail 
                        till we realize their tracks went 
                        one way, and they the other. Don’t 
                        know when they slipped us, or how. 
                        But I do know it warn’t anger I 
                        felt when we lost ‘em. It was 
                        relief, sure as rain.
                            (
                             puffs on pipe
                                         )
                        We found one a' their victims in 
                        their wake. Slave boy. Not eight 
                        years ol'.

           Silence as Trabue finds the words.

                                 COL. TRABUE (CONT'D)
                        Belly tore op’, guts on the ground. 
                        Head smashed to gruel. We thought 
                        it mighta’ been the wolves... but 
                        warn’t nothin’ ate.
                                 )
                            (
                             then
                        The thing about killers, ya know, 
                        is they all got their reasons. 
                        Robbers want yer money, soldiers 
                        follow orders, injuns want their 
                        land. But the big one? Big Harpe 
                        they call him? No reason about him. 
                        He got a thirst for anguish and 
                        killin’ like nobody outside a’ 
                        circle nine a' Hell itself.

           Moses stares at the back door, where Johnny left.

                                 MOSES
                        How long does it take to get water?
                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Eh, the hogshead's low, I'd wager. 
                        Johnny can refill at the river 
                        faster than a gnat could shit.

           Moses says nothing, but continues staring at the door. 
           Trabue returns to his story.

                                 COL. TRABUE (CONT'D)
                        After I quit the hunt, I heard 
                        Ballenger and them caught up with 
                        the Harpes in May. Surrounded the 
                        two, dead to rights. But...

           Col. Trabue puffs his pipe.

                                 HUDGENS
                        But what?

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Their rifles misfired. 

                                 LEIPER
                        All their rifles misfired?

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        To a man. 

           The men look at each other. 

                                 LEIPER
                        “Devil" Joe Ballenger? Hope they 
                        took away his nickname after that.

           Trabue looks at Leiper, unamused.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        I think it suits him. How many men 
                        you know stared into the devil's 
                        eyes and lived to see the sunrise? 

           On Leiper's face--

                                 COL. TRABUE (O.S.)
                        Think you can do better?

           EXT. DEAD WOODS - NIGHT

           Driving rain. Pitcher in hand, Johnny runs among the trees.

           He stops at a rushing river, swollen by the storm.

           He leans down and fills the pitcher with fresh water. He 
           stands and makes his way back into the woods when--
           The SOUND OF A CRYING BABY stops him. Huh? 

           He walks along the river, toward the sound.

           EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

           Johnny pushes a branch aside and sees--

           Betsey trying to get her FUSSY NEWBORN to latch to her 
           breast. Sal, with her own baby tied to her midriff, kneels 
           by Betsey’s baby, trying to help. 

           Susan watches them. 

           All heads turn to Johnny.

           Johnny stares for a moment, before manners prompt him to 
           avert his gaze from Betsey’s exposed breast.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Do you need help?

           Sal shakes her head no. But it’s not a look that answers his 
           question. It’s a look that says get away.

           Johnny doesn’t get it. He steps forward.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Do you need shelter?

                                 BIG HARPE (O.S.)
                        You from that cabin yonder?

           Johnny turns to see Big Harpe standing amid the trees behind 
           him, blending in with the trunks.

                                 LITTLE HARPE (O.S.)
                        Lotta horses hitched at that 
                        cabin...

           Johnny turns again to see Little Harpe walking out of the 
           woods. Johnny’s features tighten with realization.

           He runs. Little Harpe LAUGHS as he tackles Johnny...

           INT. COL. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Trabue still holds court. But Moses isn’t paying attention. 
           He's still looking at the back door, where Johnny left. 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        ... their father -- Harper at that 
                        time, William Harper-- 
           Moses crosses the room and goes out the back door.

           EXT. COL. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Moses exits into the rain. Listens. Nothing but the wet.

           EXT. DEAD WOODS - NIGHT

           Moses jogs through the rain and leafless branches.

                                 MOSES
                        Johnny! Johnny Trabue!

           In the distance, the SOUND of a RUSHING RIVER.

           Moses walks toward the sound.

           WIDE ON MOSES

           From a distance, approaching the river. In the FOREGROUND, 
           lying on the leaves, a shivering, terrified Johnny Trabue. 
           Standing above him--

           Big Harpe, who slowly places his torn, moccasined foot on 
           Johnny's face.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Please... Please--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Shhhhh. Face in the mud, now. Go 
                        on.

           Weeping, Johnny turns his face to the ground. Big Harpe 
           raises his foot--

           CLOSE ON MOSES

           Who arrives at the river where Johnny filled his pitcher.

           He kneels. Finds traces of footsteps in the mud, already 
           filled with water. He sees which direction they go.

                                 MOSES
                        Johnny!

           EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

           Moses emerges into the clearing. Looks around. And sees--

           JOHNNY 

           On the ground. Moses runs over to him... and stops.
           The body of Johnny Trabue lies on his belly, HIS HEAD CAVED 
           IN. For a fraction of a second, Moses’ face contorts in 
           pain. And anger. And then, Moses runs.

           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           The Harpe brothers are quietly leading three horses away 
           from the hitching post as--

           MOSES 

           Bursts out of the woods. Sees the Harpes. 

           Moses aims and FIRES, the SOUND of the shot DROWNED BY A 
           CRACK OF THUNDER.

           The shot misses, digging into a tree in a burst of bark.

           INT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           The SOUND of the GUN SHOT through the THUNDER alerts Leiper. 
           Leiper looks at the others. They did not notice.  

           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           THUNDER CRACKS. Moses, advancing on the Harpes, flips his 
           rifle and catches the barrel, wielding the gun like a club.

           LITTLE HARPE 

           Scrambles for his rifle as Moses strides toward him. Little 
           Harpe aims his rifle but he’s too late--

           Moses slugs him across the jaw with the butt of his rifle. 
           Little Harpe goes down.

           BIG HARPE 

           Lumbers up behind Moses, who grabs Little Harpe's rifle--

           And spins, rifle trained on Big Harpe. 

           But before Moses can pull the trigger-- 

           Big Harpe swats the rifle out of Moses’ hands. 

           Moses springs forward, swinging. He catches Big Harpe on the 
           cheek. No effect. Big Harpe--

           Grabs Moses by the throat. Moses, struggling, choking, tries 
           to pry Big Harpe’s fingers loose.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        This isn't honest.
           LEIPER

           Comes up behind Big Harpe. Wraps his arms around Big Harpe's 
           chest and pulls him away as--

           Moses collapses to the ground, GASPING. 

           Big Harpe twists free of Leiper's grip. 

           Leiper backs up, swinging his rifle around him. 

           Aims at Big Harpe's throat. Pulls the trigger.

           The cock falls into the pan and--

           Nothing. Misfire. 

           Leiper hesitates. Then drops the rifle and unleashes a 
           volley of brick-splitting punches into Big Harpe's jaw, 
           drawing blood. 

           But Big Harpe keeps coming. Draws a knife. Plants one hand 
           behind Leiper's back and forces his knife toward Leiper's 
           chest with the other.

           Leiper has both hands on Big Harpe's knife arm, trying with 
           all his might to keep the blade away. 

           The blade moves closer to his chest. 

           Big Harpe looks Leiper in the eyes. And with that look, 
           Leiper knows: he is going to die.

                                 SILAS (O.S.)
                        Drop it!

           Big Harpe turns to see--

           SILAS 

           Standing in the rain, his rifle sighted on him. Behind him, 
           Hudgens, Gilmore, and Col. Trabue rush out of the cabin.

           WIDE SHOT

           On this tableau, with a row of distressed horses standing 
           between the posse, rifles up, and Big Harpe.

           Little Harpe rises woozily. 

           BIG HARPE 

           Releases Leiper, who falls to the mud. 
           Big Harpe looks at Moses. Places his hand on the only black 
           horse of the group -- Smudge. In a sudden motion, Big Harpe 
           buries his knife in Smudge's gut.

                                 MOSES
                        No!

           SMUDGE BRAYS and rears back on his hind legs as--

           The SOUND and MOTION of the horse makes Silas PANIC FIRE. 
           The shot THUDS into Smudge, who tumbles over as--

           Big Harpe tosses the knife at Hudgens. The blade caroms off 
           Hudgens’ rifle. He FIRES, the shot going astray.

                                 SILAS
                        Hold your fire! 

           Big Harpe leaps on one horse and Little Harpe on another. 
           They slap the reins and the horses take off as--

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        Now!

           Gilmore and Trabue answer with a THUNDER of GUNSHOTS. One 
           ball grazes Big Harpe’s shoulder, tearing a hole in his 
           shirt. But he doesn’t slow.

           MOSES 

           Furious, yanks out his belt ax and launches it. It spins 
           through the air and--

           GLANCES off the leg of Big Harpe's horse. He rides on.

           Moses runs to the SCREAMING Smudge and silences him with a 
           fast knife in the neck. In the same motion, Moses leaps on 
           another horse and races off in hard pursuit.

           Silas and Gilmore climb on the remaining mounts and follow, 
           leaving the others behind.

           EXT. DEAD WOODS - NIGHT

           RAIN. LIGHTNING. THUNDER. The Harpe Brothers ride through 
           the woods, branches scratching their cheeks.

           EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

           The Harpes and their horses SPLASH across the twenty foot 
           torrential river.

           Big Harpe’s horse stumbles, the wash threatening to sweep 
           him away. But the horse swims to the opposite bank.
           Sal and Betsey, both astride one of the two horses from 
           before, and Susan on the other, await them. Babies slung to 
           their chests.

           Sal sees Big Harpe's bloodied face.

                                 SAL
                        Micajah--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Ride! Ride!

           The Harpes scream past the women, who kick their horses into 
           a gallop. They disappear into the night.

           WITH THE POSSE

           ON MOSES, teeth gritted, as his horse--

           SPLASHES headlong into the river.

           LIGHTNING FLASHES.

           Silas and Gilmore storm into the water behind him. Gilmore’s 
           horse slips, her front legs buckling. Gilmore flips into the 
           river. The current carries him as--

                                 SILAS
                        Gilmore!

           Silas leans over to catch Gilmore. Misses.

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        No!

           The current throws Gilmore against the bank, where his HEAD 
           KNOCKS INTO A ROCK. His body goes limp.

           Moses’ horse clambers out of the torrent on the far bank. He 
           turns to see--

           SILAS 

           Leap from his horse, into the water, and grab Gilmore.

           With his free hand, Silas clasps a reed. His grip slipping.

           MOSES 

           Throws a look into the woods, where the Harpes went.

           Moses looks back at the men. He yanks a HANGMAN’S ROPE out 
           of his saddle bag.
           ON SILAS 

           His grip weakening as--

           The loop of the hangman's rope lands around a tree stump on 
           the bank. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals--

           MOSES

           Rope in hand, diving into the water. He collides with Silas 
           and Gilmore and holds them fast as--

           The rope goes taught.

           Arm over arm, Moses pulls the mass of men ashore. Then--

                            (
                                      )
                                 MOSES
                             breathless
                        Turn him on his side.

           Silas complies. He slams his fist on Gilmore’s back, causing 
           the drenched mute to vomit water. He breathes.

           Silas slumps to the mud, relieved. 

           Moses looks across the river, into the night that covered 
           the Harpes’ escape.

           The sound of TRABUE WAILING carries us to--

           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Trabue, CRYING, kneels over the corpse of his son. 

           Leiper, Moses, and Silas stand behind him, hats off. The 
           rain has stopped and the air is foggy.

           CLOSE ON LEIPER, eyes gazing at nothing. 

                                 MOSES
                        Lord, in the midst of our sorrow 
                        and loss, remind us of the glorious 
                        eternal reunion that is waiting for 
                        us. 

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        What if I ain’t goin’ ta Heaven? 
                        What if I ain’t deservin’? Then 
                        I'll never see my boy.

                                 MOSES
                        God will see fit to reunite you 
                        with your son.
                                 COL. TRABUE
                        God share His plan with you, did 
                        He?

           Moses says nothing. His eyes find Smudge, lying on the 
           ground. Trabue wipes his snotty face.

           Seeing this, Moses takes out Mary's white handkerchief. He 
           holds it out, ready to offer it. But thinks better of it. 
           Tucks it back in his pouch.

           INT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Moses enters to find Gilmore, woozy, sitting at the table, 
           with Hudgens wrapping a bandage around his friend's head. 
           Candles flicker.

                                 MOSES
                        How’s he faring?

                                 HUDGENS
                        He has no brain to hurt.

           Gilmore swats Hudgens.

                                 MOSES
                        I’m glad for your help, Gilmore. 
                        But you should quit the hunt. And 
                        rest.

           Gilmore gesticulates wildly.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Easy, Gil. He’s trying to save that 
                        ugly head of yours.

           Gilmore gestures angrily. Moses watches for a beat.

                                 MOSES
                        You can have my share of the reward 
                        money, if that's--

           Gilmore smacks Moses with a mug.

                                 HUDGENS
                        He doesn't shine to interruptions.

                                 MOSES
                        Gil--

                                 HUDGENS
                        He says he's not quitting.
                                 MOSES
                        Doesn't matter anyway. Harpes took 
                        two of our mounts. Killed a third. 
                        Takes three off our party.

           Gilmore gestures to Hudgens, who interprets.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Gilmore says he saw a pen out 
                        back--

                                 MOSES
                        I’m not taking horses from a 
                        grieving man. Leiper and I can ride 
                        two-up and--

                                 LEIPER (O.S.)
                        I ain't comin'. 

           Leiper stands in the doorway. Eyes downcast.

           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Moses follows Leiper to his Mustang -- one of the two 
           remaining horses. 

                                 MOSES
                        What's spooking you? Leiper? 

                                 LEIPER
                        Rifle misfired. Had him square 
                        and... and she misfired.

                                 MOSES
                        It was raining.

           Leiper's only answer is to scramble onto his horse. Moses 
           holds the reins, preventing Leiper from going.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        What about your reward money?

                                 LEIPER
                        Won't be the last bounty. 

           Leiper tugs the reins free of Moses' hands. 

           Moses watches Leiper ride away. Then--

                                 MOSES
                        Leiper.

           Leiper stops. Turns. Moses flips a coin at Leiper, who 
           catches it. He looks at it.
                                 LEIPER
                        Silver dollar.

                                 MOSES
                        At least you made your profit.

           Leiper tosses the coin back. It lands on the ground. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Buy yourself a Bible.

           Leiper turns and rides into the fog. And he's gone. 

           The sound of an AX SPLITTING FLESH AND BONE carries us to--

           LATER

           Moses chops the remains of his horse into pieces. Blood 
           stains his hands and arms.

           Silas walks up. He looks haggard and sunken.

                                 SILAS
                        Is this necessary?

                                 MOSES
                        Meat'll draw the wolves.  

           Moses chops another piece.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Small pieces bury quicker. 

                                 SILAS
                        You want to leave now? Or in the 
                        morning? 

           Moses looks at the shivering Silas. 

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        Danny gave us an extra mount. Said 
                        we could quarter here, too, long as 
                        ya don't talk God to him. Says he 
                        ain't on speakin' terms with God.

           ON the Colonel, who sleeps leaning against a tree. A jug of 
           spirits in his hand. Moses nods.

                                 MOSES
                        We'll ride sunup. Harpes need to 
                        rest, sure as we do. You could use 
                        some rest yourself. 
                                 SILAS
                        I could use a nip. 

           Moses shrugs. Resumes his chopping. Silas watches for a 
           beat. Then walks off.  

           Moses chops another piece. He stops, resting.

           The sound of a SECOND AX chopping flesh. Moses turns to see 
           Silas at his side, working another ax.   

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        Can't sleep anyhow.

           Silas doesn't look up. Only chops.

                                 MOSES
                        May I ask you something?
                             off Silas's silence
                            (
                                               )
                        What happened to your wife and 
                        child?

                                 SILAS
                        What makes you think something 
                        happened to my wife and child?

                                 MOSES
                        You don't have to talk about it.

           Silas takes another swing at the horse. Then--

                                 SILAS
                        They was shot by a hunter's rifle. 
                        Round pierced my son's throat. 
                        Landed in my wife's chest. We lost 
                        little Vardry. And Catherine, 
                        she... she's in a sleep she ain't 
                        wakin' from. 

                                 MOSES
                        I'm sorry. 

                                 SILAS
                        Was a Shawnee hunter. Comin' down 
                        from the north. He say it was an 
                        accident. He say he won't violate 
                        no treaty. But I know the truth. He 
                        saw the chance to kill some white 
                        folk. And he took it. Them reds is 
                        monsters. If I had a rope long 
                        enough, I'd hang 'em all.

           Moses renews his chopping. As he does--
                                 MOSES
                        As Christ suffered, so shall we. 

                                 SILAS
                        Thought Christ suffered so we 
                        didn't have to. 

                                 MOSES
                        Always be the burden of suffering. 
                        But I believe God chooses who bears 
                        it. 

                                 SILAS
                        Then why'd He choose us?

                                 MOSES
                        Because we're strong enough. 

           Silas thinks on the words. Then, he and Moses bring down 
           their axes in unison. The SOUND of the CHOP carries us to--

           LATER

           Moses stands in front of Smudge's burial site, marked by a 
           mound of fresh dirt and two bloodied axes. 

           In Moses' hands, the char-free knife.

           INT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           GILMORE lies on the bearskin rug, SNORING.

           On the floor a few feet away, HUDGENS sleeps fitfully.

           Silas lies in the corner.

           Moses stands in the doorway. Looking at them.  

           Deep in thought. 

           EXT. TRABUE CABIN - NIGHT

           Trabue leans against the tree, SNORING.

           Moses sits next to him and gently nudges him awake. Trabue, 
           exhausted and still drunk, slurs his words.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        He was back... for jus' a second, 
                        he was back...

           Moses nods at the stable near the cabin. 
                                 MOSES
                        You got any more mounts in that 
                        stable?

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Mare. Piebald. And a mule for 
                        haulin'.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Mare was a gift to Johnny for his 
                        thirteenth.

                                 MOSES
                        I want to buy them.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        How much you offerin'?

                                 MOSES
                        All of my reward money.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Reward money? For killin' them 
                        Harpes? You'd sooner get money from 
                        Judas hisself.

                                 MOSES
                        I will kill them. Sell me your 
                        horses, give me a full posse, and I 
                        can guarantee it.

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        My son’s horse ain't for sale.

                                 MOSES
                            (
                             after a beat
                                        )
                        "Whoever is generous to the poor 
                        lends to the Lord--"

                                 COL. TRABUE
                        Don't quote that book to me. S'got 
                        the ring of a false coin.  

           Silence. Finally, Moses rises.

                                 MOSES
                        I understand.

           Moses walks away. Then pauses. Sees Smudge's burial site.

           He walks back to Trabue. Doesn't sit this time. There is 
           danger in Moses' words. Gone is the preacher's diction--
                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        I don’t mean to press on a fresh 
                        wound, but your son ain't usin' his 
                        mare no more. 

           Trabue reaches for his bottle, but Moses steps on the 
           bottle. Leans down. Gets in Trabue's face. Scary.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Give me the rides I need, and I 
                        swear to Jesus, I'll destroy those 
                        scum what caved in your son's skull 
                        like he was a dog in the woods.

           OFF Trabue's shock--

           EXT. DEAD WOODS - DAY

           The sun rises behind a blue-fogged woods as--

           The posse rides on horses, to a man. Gilmore rides on the 
           mule. Hudgens LAUGHS.

                                 HUDGENS
                        An ass for an ass, isn't that a 
                        fitting sight!

           Gilmore ignores Hudgens, who pulls up alongside him. Throws 
           an arm around his shoulders and WHISPERS into his ear--

                                 HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                        Stay behind me at all times, hear? 
                        I'll keep you safe.

           Gilmore nods.

           Silas looks back at the cabin. 

           Trabue watches them, a pale face in the window.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           The posse makes it across the tamed creek.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The horses stand still as Moses leans down, studying a tree.

                                 MOSES
                        Blazes in the bark here.
                            (
                             to Silas
                                    )
                        Direction of Cave-In-Rock. 
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Big Harpe's horse limps through the brush. He leans over and 
           checks the hindquarters -- leaking blood from where Moses' 
           ax grazed it. 

           Big Harpe leaps off the horse. Little Harpe and the three 
           women pull up short, watching. Big Harpe says nothing to 
           them. He walks to a bush and urinates.

           Little Harpe examines the horse's wound.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Mount's no good. Bullet graze?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Ax. Moses. 

           Big Harpe finishes up. Walks to Susan. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Get off. You're ridin' with Wiley.

                                 SUSAN
                        Yes, Micajah. 

           Susan gets off. Whispers seductively to Big Harpe--

                                 SUSAN (CONT'D)
                        I'm hungry.

           Big Harpe stares at her. Takes out a tomahawk. Hands it to 
           her. Gestures to the wounded horse. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Eat up.

           Susan smiles. She takes the tomahawk.

           ON BIG HARPE as Susan cleaves the horse's skull OFF SCREEN.  

           Sal averts her gaze as the horse flops to the ground. She  
           hears a WHIMPER behind her. Turns to see Betsey WITHHOLDING 
           TEARS, grabbing her breast. 

                                 SAL
                        Betsey?

                                 BETSEY
                        Sal. It hurts.  
           MOMENTS LATER

           ONE NEWBORN lies on the ground, FUSSING. Susan sits in the 
           grass, nursing the other two newborns, one on each breast.

           Little Harpe sits next to her, feeding her a piece of horse 
           meat. She opens her mouth and receives it. She chews.

           ON BETSEY, sitting on a fallen tree, weeping. Sal moves the 
           cloth of Betsey's torn blouse aside, revealing her breast. A 
           bulbous red welt covers the nipple. Infection.

           Sal brandishes a long, silver KNITTING NEEDLE.

           Betsey WHIMPERS.

                                 SAL
                        Look away.

           Betsey does. OFF SCREEN Sal lances the welt with the needle. 
           Betsey SHRIEKS.

           Big Harpe looks over, annoyed.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Stop the wailing.

           Betsey covers her mouth.

                                 SAL
                        Here.

           Sal rubs some herbs onto a moist cloth.

                                 SAL (CONT'D)
                        This is a poultice a' sorrel n' 
                        yellow lily roots. Should help with 
                        the pain and it'll make the red go 
                        away.

           Sal gives Betsey the cloth. Betsey presses it to her breast. 
           She manages a smile.

                                 BETSEY
                        Thank you.

           WITH BIG HARPE

           Looking at something off in the distance.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Wiley.

           Little Harpe leaves Susan's side and comes over. 
           Big Harpe nods. Little Harpe looks.

           On a distant plain, a line of NATIVES riding on horseback.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Cherokee.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Lower Cherokee. Chickamauga. Movin' 
                        north.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Think any of ‘em would remember us?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Heard of us, at least.

           Little Harpe looks at his brother, who watches the Cherokee.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Don't think on ‘em, Mick. We got to 
                        get to the Cave, and you know them 
                        shiny teeths is ridin' on us right 
                        now.

                                 SAL (O.S.)
                        Micajah?

           Big Harpe turns to see Sal Harpe walking up.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Are we movin' yet or what?

                                 SAL
                        Yes, but Betsey will need some 
                        food. 

           Big Harpe looks at the dead horse, which has been hacked 
           apart. FLIES BUZZ around it. 

                                 SAL (CONT'D)
                        Food she can keep down.  

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Don't bother me none.

           ON SUSAN, blood leaking out of her mouth, two babies still 
           pressed to her breasts.

                                 SAL
                        Well, Betsey ain't Susan. 

           Big Harpe sighs, annoyed.
                                                             CUT TO:

           EIGHT EGGS SIZZLING IN A SKILLET

           A hand with a pewter spoon stirs the eggs.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The hand belongs to a GRIZZLED MAN (40s) with short, stringy 
           gray hair and slate blue eyes. Dirt flecked but formal 
           attire. He doles out the eggs to the plates of--

           The EIGHT OTHER PEOPLE of his party: a STOUT WOMAN (30s), 
           three teenagers -- two boys and a girl -- an older man and 
           woman, and a black man and his eight-year-old, slaves both.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Little bites. Chew slowly now.

           The group sits in front of a horse-drawn covered wagon 
           parked on a dirt trail snaking through the woods.

           The Grizzled man spoons the egg remnants onto his own plate 
           when he hears a NOISE IN THE WOODS. He looks. 

           Opposite him, Big Harpe, half concealed by leaves. Rifle 
           trained between the man’s eyes.

           The black man moves to grab something from the back of the 
           covered wagon... but can’t find it.

                                 LITTLE HARPE (O.S.)
                        Already got it.

           The black man turns to face Little Harpe, who levels a rifle 
           at him. Little Harpe taps the rifle.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        ‘S right here.

           The black man grabs his eight-year-old and guides the boy 
           behind him, protective.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        We're taking your food.

           The Grizzled Man holds up calming hands. He nods at his 
           wife, who gathers the three children and two elders and 
           holds them close. The Grizzled Man faces Big Harpe. Noble.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Eggs, bags a' flour, tobacco, jerky 
                        in the wagon. Yours.
           Big Harpe nods to somebody in the woods. In response, Sal 
           steps out. She takes the Grizzled Man's plate. One by one, 
           she scoops the eggs from the plates back onto the one.

           She stops at the black boy's plate. Leaves his food alone.

           She sets the plate down in the back of the wagon and begins 
           collecting the provisions.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN (CONT'D)
                        Take your food and leave us in 
                        peace.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Thank you for your orders, sir.

           Sal, sack and plate in her hands, walks by Big Harpe. 
           WHISPERS in his ear--

                                 SAL
                        Please leave them, Mick.

           Big Harpe regards Sal. Without looking at his brother--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Wiley?

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Yeah.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Tie them up. Tight enough so they 
                        won't make themselves a hindrance 
                        to our ends.
                                  )
                            (
                             a beat
                        But not so tight as they can't 
                        twist themselves out after a piece.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        They gonna peach on us.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Tie them.

           Sal nods a thanks to Big Harpe.

           LATER

           Little Harpe cinches a rope around the wrists of the 
           Grizzled Man, the rest of his party already trussed.

           Two of the teenagers, the girl and one of the boys, CRIES. 
           The STOUT WOMAN, presumably their mother speaks up, icy.
                                 STOUT WOMAN
                        Addie. Jed. Look at me.

           The children do. The Stout Woman shakes her head. Don't make 
           a fuss. It will be okay.

           The black man calmly strokes his son's back -- small 
           movements with his restrained wrists.

           Little Harpe finishes his task.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        We’re takin' them steeds, ain't we?

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        No!
                            (
                             off Little Harpe's look
                                                   )
                        We'll be stranded without ‘em.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        You're stranded now.

           Little Harpe turns to Big Harpe, but Big Harpe has his eyes 
           on a spear tip mounted on the side of the wagon.

                                 BIG HARPE
                            (
                             to Grizzled Man
                                           )
                        Officer's spontoon. Where were you 
                        stationed?

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Hudson Valley. Under Arnold.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Arnold the fighting general.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Brave a man as ever lived.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        You see Burgoyne's surrender?

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Held his sword in my hand.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        What did you do with the loyalists? 
                        Tho ones who bled with the Torries?

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Hanged ‘em on the first tree.

           Silence as Big Harpe runs a calloused hand over the blade of 
           the spontoon.
                                 BIG HARPE
                        Blade's gone dull. We'll whet it 
                        for you.

           Big Harpe hands the spontoon to Little Harpe, who removes 
           the whetstone from the pocket of his greatcoat. Starts 
           sharpening the blade.

           The family eyes Little Harpe anxiously.

           Sal presses a hand on Big Harpe's arm.

                                 SAL
                        We should travel.

           Big Harpe doesn't take his attention off the Grizzled Man.

                                 BIG HARPE
                            (
                             to Grizzled Man
                                           )
                        My pap fought at King's Mountain.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        A just battle.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Not for him.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                            (
                                  )
                             unsure
                        You... lost him?

           Big Harpe nods.

                                 GRIZZLED MAN (CONT'D)
                        My condolences to you. He served 
                        his country well by a grand sight.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        He wasn't fighting for your side.

           The Grizzled Man says nothing. Little Harpe finishes 
           sharpening the blade. Hands it back to Big Harpe. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        And he didn’t die in battle. The 
                        victors -- your allies -- poured 
                        him over with boiling tar. 
                        Feathered him. Marched him around, 
                        dancing to his screams.

           Big Harpe pauses, staring in the woods, recollecting.
                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Then they bayoneted pappy's belly 
                        till his guts spilt.

           Big Harpe sits on the ground, uncomfortably close to the 
           Grizzled Man and his wife.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        I watched the whole thing. Twelve 
                        years old.
                                 )
                            (
                             then
                        Pappy used to say Wiley and I 
                        weren’t honest. He’d bloody our 
                        lips for lying, even when our 
                        mouths were closed. Remember that, 
                        Wiley?

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Pappy’s hugs had knuckles in ‘em.

           Big Harpe runs his thumb along the edge of the spontoon.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I laughed when pappy died. Laughed 
                        when I saw his belly open. Know 
                        what I thought then? There's your 
                        honesty, Pap.
                            (
                             then, to Grizzled Man
                                                 )
                        You want to see honesty?

                                 GRIZZLED MAN
                        Please. Take our horses, our wagon, 
                        our clothes... Please don’t hurt 
                        us.

           Big Harpe flashes gritty teeth.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        There's no word more honest than a 
                        scream.

           EXT. KENTUCKY PLAINS - DAY

           Silas and Moses ride side by side, with the others behind.

           Moses reins to a stop. He holds a hand up. The posse quiets. 
           In the distance, barely audible--

           SCREAMS.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Coyotes?
                                 MOSES
                        No.

           Moses kicks his horse, riding fast. The posse races after.

                                                             CUT TO:

           A VISION OF HELL

           The source of the SCREAMS. PAINED and DESPERATE.

           Big Harpe, blood-soaked, rapturous, a spontoon in one hand 
           and a tomahawk in the other, walks among a writhing pile of 
           bodies tangled in severed limbs and viscera.

           ON THE THREE HARPE WOMEN, their backs to the slaughter. Sal 
           looks at her baby. She sings--

                                 SAL
                        Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave 
                        me/
                        How could you use a poor maiden 
                        so...

           The others join in--

                                 HARPE WOMEN
                        Remember the vows/
                        That you made to your Mary...

                                                           SMASH TO:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           BRANCHES WHIPPING BY. 

           ON MOSES, riding fast, jaw clenched, teeth gritted. 

           Moses GASPS. 

           He pulls up, stopping. The posse rears up behind him as dust 
           roils up. 

           Silence.

           Moses gets off the horse. Moses walks among-- 

           Mangled, bloodied bodies. All of them SCALPED.

           Moses kneels down, checking pulses. Silas is furious.

                                 SILAS
                        Scalped. Just like the goddamn 
                        reds.
           Moses ignores him, emotional. Hudgens' mouth hangs open.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Who... who would do this?

           And then--

           ANOTHER SCREAM. Farther away. 

           Moses runs to his horse. Rides off. 

           EXT. ESCARPMENT - DAY

           Moses descends a grade that leads to a pit closed in on 
           three sides by sheer, fifteen foot limestone cliffs. 

           Moses stops. Jumps off the horse and runs to-- 

           The Grizzled Man, lying in the pit against the cliff wall, 
           holding his intestines. HE SCREAMS. 

           Moses drops to his side as the others arrive behind him. 

                                 MOSES
                        Easy. We're gonna help.
                             calling back
                            (
                                        )
                        Silas.

           Silas leaps off his horse and rushes over to Moses. He pulls 
           the Grizzled Man's hands off his belly. 

           The Grizzled Man SCREAMS, half from pain, half from despair. 

           Silas looks at the terrible wound across the man's belly. 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Save him. 

           Silas can only shake his head. 

           Moses looks at the rest of the posse.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Somebody save him! 

           Hudgens clambers off his horse, drawing a Bible from his 
           saddle bag. He rushes to the man's side--  

                                 HUDGENS
                        Do you accept the Lord--

                                 MOSES
                        No. Save him. 
           Hudgens looks at Moses, at a loss.

           BELLOWING in fury, Moses unsheathes his knife and SINKS IT 
           INTO THE GRIZZLED MAN'S NECK, silencing him. Then-- 

                                 BIG HARPE (O.S.)
                        Moses Stegall!

           Moses looks up. Up top stand Big Harpe, Little Harpe, and 
           Susan, rifles trained on the posse. A trap.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Rifles on the corpse. Or we'll drop 
                        you all like timber.

           Moses looks at Silas. Nods. 

           The posse members lay their rifles down. 

                                 MOSES
                        It's me you're after, ain't it?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        You're chasing us. Not the other 
                        way around.  

                                 SILAS
                        Because of what you filth did to 
                        Stegall's family. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        And everybody between there and 
                        here.

                                 MOSES
                        If you want me, then shoot me. But 
                        leave these men be. 

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        And they'll let us be? You goin' to 
                        swear on a Bible?

                                 MOSES
                        You'll have a head start, least.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Why don't you tell them who you 
                        are, Moses?

           The rest of the posse looks at Moses. He opens his mouth to 
           speak when--

           A SHOT RINGS OUT. 
           A ROUND CAROMS off Big Harpe's rifle, and the gun falls from 
           his hands. Little Harpe and Susan spin to see--

           JOHN LEIPER

           Riding on them as he tosses his spent rifle to the ground. 
           He grabs another RIFLE from his back. Aims.

           LITTLE HARPE

           FIRES at Leiper. Misses. 

           He runs to the horses where Sal and Betsey wait. They mount 
           their horses as--

           IN THE PIT

           --the posse grabs their guns except-- 

           MOSES

           Who climbs onto his horse's back, and launches himself up. 
           He grabs ahold of a groove in the cliff wall. 

           He pulls himself up to the-- 

           TOP OF THE PIT

           Where Susan ATTACKS him, pounding him, biting him. Feral. 

           Moses kidney-punches her. Tosses her off.  

           He scrambles to his feet. Then--

                                 LEIPER (O.S.)
                        Moses! Duck!

           Moses ducks as--

           LEIPER

           FIRES. The round--

           HITS LITTLE HARPE'S HORSE in the head. The horse falls, 
           pinning Little Harpe to the ground.   

           Little Harpe struggles to get out from underneath his dead 
           horse. He reaches out a hand for Big Harpe.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Help me! 

           Big Harpe turns and sees-- 
           JOHN LEIPER and MOSES advancing. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Goddammit!

           Big Harpe kicks his horse into a run. Sal rides behind as 
           they disappear into the brush.

           Little Harpe grabs Betsey's leg. 

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Help me, you bitch! 

           Betsey pulls at Little Harpe--

                                 LEIPER (O.S.)
                        Don't exert yourself. 

           Betsey spins to find Leiper, long rifle in one hand, 
           flintlock pistol in the other.

                                 LEIPER
                        I'd be more'n happy to lend him a 
                        hand. 

           HOOF BEATS. The posse rides up, with Gilmore leading Moses' 
           horse. Silas dismounts. Tosses the rope to Moses, who begins 
           tying Little Harpe's hands.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                            (
                                  )
                             pained
                        Get this off me! 

           Moses slams a fist into Little Harpe. Knocks him out. 

           As Hudgens and Gilmore tie the women--   

                                 LEIPER
                        Couldn't stomach the reward money 
                        goin' to you sons a' libertines. 
                        How dya' like my timin', Squar?

                                 SILAS
                        Impeccable. Moses, we'll get Big 
                        Harpe after-- 

           But Moses is on the move again. He jumps on his horse. Takes 
           off like a gunshot.

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        Moses!
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           ON MOSES' HORSE, panting with effort. Moses kicks his heels 
           into his horse's side. It runs faster.

           The leaves BLUR BY. 

           ON MOSES, eyes straight ahead. 

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Moses BURSTS out of the trees into a field of long grass. 
           Rising on a far hill are--

           BIG HARPE AND SAL. Moses shakes the reins. The horse runs as 
           fast as his legs will go. 

           Moses closes in on Big Harpe.

           But the HORSE WHEEZES and starts to slow.

                                 MOSES
                        Come on!

           Big Harpe and Sal ride faster. Soon, they will disappear 
           into a thick woods.  

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        No.

           Moses pulls the horse to a stop and in the same motion, 
           jumps from the saddle. Swings his rifle out. Aims.

           MOSES' POV

           At the end of the rifle's barrel, Big Harpe speeds toward 
           the woods. The barrel follows him...

           MOSES

           FIRES. 

           ON BIG HARPE as the bullet smacks into a tree right as he 
           disappears into the woods. 

           ON MOSES, breathing hard. 

           EXT. HILL - DAY

           Moses leads his WHEEZING HORSE back to the posse. 

           Little Harpe, his hands trussed and his mouth gagged, sits 
           slumped on Silas's horse. He GROANS, waking up. 
           Betsey and Susan, gagged as well but allowed to hold their 
           babies, sit together on their own horse. 

           Leiper tips his hat at Moses.

                                 LEIPER
                        Think I earned that dollar.

                                 MOSES
                        My horse needs to rest.

                                 LEIPER
                        Think the words you's lookin' for 
                        is thank and you.

                                 MOSES
                        You saved our lives. Thank you.

                                 LEIPER
                        I'll take it. Even though ya' made 
                        a face like you was shittin' a 
                        pinecone sideways. 

           Moses looks at Little Harpe and the two Harpe women.

                                 MOSES
                        We leave them here. We go after Big 
                        Harpe. 

                                 SILAS
                        And let highwaymen set these 
                        criminals free? 

                                 MOSES
                        Nothing matters without Micajah.

                                 SILAS
                        It all matters. We're gonna turn 
                        these three in at Greenville. Only 
                        fifteen miles out.

                                 MOSES
                        And lose two days? 

                                 SILAS
                        I'm not givin' up the ride.

                                 MOSES
                        No, you're losing it.

                                 SILAS
                        You afraid a' losin' the trail? Or 
                        of what Wiley's gonna spill when I 
                        loose his gag? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                            (
                             off Moses' look
                                           )
                        "Why don't you tell them who you 
                        are?" Big Harpe's words. Then you 
                        lay out Wiley afore he can shine 
                        light on that mystery.  

           Moses looks at Little Harpe, who stares back with red eyes. 
           Moses yanks out a knife. Walks to Little Harpe. He SLASHES 
           at Little Harpe and--

           SLICES off the gag. 

                                 MOSES
                        Go ahead, Wiley. Tell 'em.

           Little Harpe works his jaw. Looks at Moses. Smiles.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        They don't know, do they?

                                 SILAS
                        Don't know what?

           Little Harpe LAUGHS a shrill laugh. 

                                 MOSES
                        Out with it.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Legend tells a' two Harpes. When it 
                        should tell a' three. Ain't that 
                        right, Moses? 

           Silas looks at Moses, confused.

                                 MOSES
                        He's my brother. 

                                 SILAS
                        What?!

                                 LEIPER
                        You're a... Harpe?

           All men, speechless. 

                                 MOSES
                        My mother took me away when the 
                        Revolt started, when I wasn't three 
                        years old. Nine years back, not 
                        long after my mother passed, the 
                        Harpes tracked me down in 
                        Knoxville. Told me we shared a 
                        father.
                                 SILAS
                        And how long did you convoy with 
                        these butchers?

                                 MOSES
                            (
                             after a beat
                                        )
                        Seven years, before I met Mary.

           Silas pulls another length of rope out of his bag. Begins 
           coiling it. He speaks slowly, deliberately--

                                 SILAS
                        And what crimes did you commit?

                            (
                                 MOSES
                             eyeing the rope
                                           )
                        I will answer for my sins after we 
                        capture Big Harpe.

                                 SILAS
                        It's not your sins I'm talkin' 
                        about. It's your crimes. And you 
                        don't get to choose when you answer 
                        for 'em.   

           Hudgens SHOUTS as Little Harpe yanks the flintlock from 
           Hudgens' belt. Despite his trussed wrists, Little Harpe 
           grabs Hudgens' hair and presses the pistol into his cheek. 

           The men freeze. Except Hudgens, who grabs at the flintlock. 
           Little Harpe pulls the trigger -- CLICK. No shot. 

           Silas, Gilmore, and Leiper rush over. Silas pulls Little 
           Harpe off the horse and rains blows upon his head. 

           As Moses runs over to help, Hudgens intercepts him. Pulls 
           him aside.

                                 MOSES
                        Hudgens, you all right--

                                 HUDGENS
                        'Course I am. I took the powder out 
                        of the pistol. 

                                 MOSES
                        What?

                                 HUDGENS
                        I needed to get Silas away before 
                        he arrested you.
                            (
                                           )
                             off Moses' look
                        I want to be sure you are 
                        considering your opportunity, here.
                                 MOSES
                        Opportunity.

                                 HUDGENS
                        Whatever you did... you needn't 
                        confess to this man. God will 
                        forgive you. Silas won't. 

                                 MOSES
                        I am not a liar.

                                 HUDGENS
                        How can you preach from a cell? You 
                        have been given a gift. The gift of 
                        renown.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        The brother of infamous murderers 
                        forsakes his blood for the Light. 
                        He captures his kin and saves their 
                        souls. 

           Silas has finished tightening the ropes around a now 
           bloodied Little Harpe. Hudgens continues, quickly.

                                 HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                        You want people to come to your 
                        sermons? This is how. This is how 
                        we will spread the Word.

           Moses says nothing. Thinking.

                                 SILAS (O.S.)
                        Well? Your confession? 

           Moses turns to Silas. But something catches his eye. 

           Behind Silas, in the woods, the GIRL IN THE MUDDY WHITE 
           DRESS. Walking away, into the woods.  

                                 SILAS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm talkin' to you. 

           Moses snaps to. Looks at Silas. Then at Hudgens, who sweats.

                                 MOSES
                        The Harpes didn't start their 
                        career as murderers till after we 
                        parted company.
                             then
                            (
                                 )
                        I have no crimes to confess, 
                        Squire.

           Moses walks to his horse, leaving Silas casting a wary look 
           at Hudgens.
           EXT. KENTUCKY WOODS - DAY

           With a SCREAM OF FRUSTRATION, Big Harpe slices a branch off 
           a passing tree with his tomahawk. Sal rides beside him, her 
           baby FUSSING. Sal looks at Big Harpe. After a beat--

                            (
                             sharp
                                 BIG HARPE
                                 )
                        Something wrong with your head? It 
                        keeps turning this way.

                                 SAL
                        We're goin' west. 

           Sal's baby continues FUSSING. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Hush that thing or I will. 

           Sal makes SHUSH SOUNDS to the baby. After a beat-- 

                                 SAL
                        We're not goin' to Cave-In-Rock, 
                        are we?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Not without Wiley.  

                                 SAL
                        And Betsey and Susan. And the 
                        children--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I don't abandon family. 

           The baby KEEPS CRYING. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Shut that fucking thing up!  

                                 SAL
                        You're tryin' to find the 
                        Chickamauga.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I saw them on the move. Another 
                        fifteen miles and we'll see--
                            (
                             re: fussing baby

                        Shh-shhh-shh.

                             to Big Harpe

                        I thought they were treatied now. 
                        Lower Cherokee don’t fight no more, 
                        do they?
                            (
                             off Big Harpe's silence
                                                   )
                        Mick--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Don't tell me your mind, or I'll 
                        knock it out of your skull. Quiet. 
                        Both of you. 

           The baby WAILS.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        I said--

                                 SAL
                        I know, I'm tryin'--

           Big Harpe jerks the reins a stop. Swings his legs off the 
           horse. Grabs the baby out of Sal's hands.

                                 SAL (CONT'D)
                        No. Micajah, I'll quiet her--

           Big Harpe, holding the baby by the legs, walks to a tree. 
           Sal scrambles off the horse to follow.

                                 SAL (CONT'D)
                        Noooo! Nooooooo!

           LONG SHOT

           Concealed by the leaves in the FOREGROUND, Big Harpe SWINGS 
           THE BABY AGAINST A TREE.

           The BABY'S CRYING stops immediately as Sal SCREAMS 
           HYSTERICALLY. She crumples to the ground. 

           CLOSE ON SAL

           As she kneels by the OFF SCREEN corpse of her infant. Big 
           Harpe walks back to his horse.

           EXT. LOWER CHEROKEE VILLAGE - DAY

           A Chickamauga village, half-built. Ten circular, dome shaped 
           structures that look like upside-down baskets -- called 
           asi -- dot the grassy hills.
           A group of sinewy men, painted, feathered, scarred, their 
           arms caked with earth, build a larger asi out of saplings 
           and mud. Their townhouse. These are the LOWER CHEROKEE.

           The men turn to see--

           BIG HARPE AND SAL 

           Riding in. Sal is in utter shock. Dazed eyes regard the 
           Chickamauga men and women, who stop to stare at the new 
           arrivals. Sal's eyes catch on a mother cradling an infant.

           Big Harpe calls out, speaking in Cherokee, subtitled--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I will speak to the chief!

           LATER

           Five Chickamauga stand before Big Harpe and Sal. An older 
           CHIEF (50s) in front, younger WARRIORS behind. Hands on 
           their rifles and tomahawks, coiled and ready to spring.

           Big Harpe stands tall, not to be cowed.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Chickamauga warriors. I am Micajah 
                        Harpe. My brother and I fought with 
                        your Chief John Watts during the 
                        attack on Buchanan's Station. We 
                        bled with your brothers in the war 
                        against the white invaders.

                                 YOUNG WARRIOR
                            (
                             to Chief
                                    )
                        He speaks like he does not know the 
                        color of his own skin.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I know the color of my skin...

           Big Harpe removes a BLOODY BURLAP bag from his saddle bag. 
           He upends it, dumping out a pile of human scalps. Taken from 
           the family he butchered.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        But I am not like them.

           The Lower Cherokee stare at the scalps. 

           The chief looks at Big Harpe, unmoved.
                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        A posse of white men has captured 
                        my brother and my women. They mean 
                        us harm. Fight with me to bleed 
                        these dogs.

                                 CHIEF
                        We have made peace with white men.

           Silence. Big Harpe lifts his shirt, exposing his bare chest, 
           criss-crossed by scars. He points to one.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        From the Battle of Blue Licks, 
                        where we fought with white men. 

           He points at another. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        From the Cumberland Raids, where we 
                        fought with white men. 

           He points at another.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        From the blade I took for Chief 
                        Dragging Canoe. A blade from a 
                        white man.
                                 )
                            (
                             then
                        I do not know peace. And neither do 
                        you. No matter what it says on a 
                        piece of paper.

           The Chief regards Big Harpe.

           EXT. PATH - DAY

           Silas leads his horse with Little Harpe on it. The women and 
           the posse follow on horse behind. 

           Bringing up the rear is Moses, looking distant. 

           Gilmore and Hudgens walk their horses close to Moses. 
           Gilmore gesticulates.

                                 HUDGENS
                        He says you're not a Harpe. 
                            (
                             watching Gilmore
                                            )
                        He says you're still his friend. 
                        Speaking for myself, I cannot 
                        disagree. 

           Gilmore isn't finished. He continues gesturing.  
                                 HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                        Lord, he's still going.
                            (
                             watching Gilmore
                                            )
                        He says he'll ride with you if you 
                        want to chase after Big Harpe now. 

           Hudgens lowers his voice--

                                 HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                        Gil's got a point, Moses. I don't 
                        see any advantage in waiting for 
                        Silas to lead you closer to the 
                        gallows.

           Moses considers Hudgens' words. Then--

                                 MOSES
                        I won't bring in Big Harpe without 
                        Silas. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Why not? Because he's a lawman?

                                 MOSES
                        Because he's a good man.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Better than me, anyhow. 

           Off Hudgens' look... 

           EXT. LOWER CHEROKEE VILLAGE - DAY

           The sun sets. At the edge of the Chickamauga camp, Big Harpe 
           leans against a rock. Forest behind him. Sal sits on the 
           ground, in a stupor.

           From a distance, Big Harpe watches the Chickamauga warriors 
           engage in heated discussion with the Chief.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        The Chief doesn't like me. He's 
                        useless. But his son... I could 
                        tell he was thinking the right 
                        thoughts.

           Sal watches the leaves. 

           Slowly, Big Harpe lays his giant hand on top of Sal's head. 
           Turns her head so that she's facing him. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        It's just a baby.

           Sal looks at Big Harpe with empty eyes. 
           APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Big Harpe turns. Smiles. 

           The Young Warrior and three other Cherokee warriors stand 
           before them. 

                                 YOUNG CHEROKEE
                        Where are they?

           EXT. KENTUCKY FOREST - NIGHT

           The posse makes camp. Hudgens struggles to light a pile of 
           wood and grass with a flint and steel. As Moses passes--

                                 MOSES
                        Too much cattail.

           Hudgens gets a spark and the FIRE WHOOSHES up immediately. A 
           startled Hudgens scrambles back and trips. Gilmore silently 
           laughs, slapping his knee, enjoying the spectacle.  

           LITTLE HARPE, SUSAN, AND BETSEY 

           Sit back to the same tree. Silas pulls a rope tight around 
           them, securing them to the trunk. 

           Betsey and Susan's hands are free to hold their babies, 
           which both CRY. 

           Leiper eyes Susan and nudges Silas.

                                 LEIPER
                        This is the drab I cooked the 
                        sheets with. 

           Silas is aghast. 

                                 SILAS
                        You... "knew" this woman?

                                 LEIPER
                        Them Harpe brothers set her up 
                        to't. Tryin' to rob me blind. Or 
                        naked.  
                            (
                             pointed, at Little Harpe
                                                    )
                        Didn't work though, did it? I 
                        didn't have a bent shillin' to my 
                        name.
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        But the real reason they's mad as 
                        spitfire, you ask me, is she like 
                        it. 

           Susan spits on Leiper's foot. Leiper LAUGHS.
                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        She didn't spit last time.  

           Little Harpe ignores Leiper, choosing to stare at Moses, who 
           stares back. 

                                 MOSES
                        This a vengeance spree? With you 
                        and Mick? Bleeding those who 
                        wronged you?  

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        No. Mick gets his blood up, he 
                        needs a release, is all. 

                                 MOSES
                        Is that why you knocked on my door? 
                        For release?

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        We wanted ta give ya one last 
                        chance ta ride with yer brothers. 

                                 MOSES
                        I'm not like you.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        That's beyond yer choosin'. 

           Moses gives no response. The BABIES begin to CRY. Moses 
           turns his attention to them.  

           Betsey latches hers to her breast -- much less infected 
           since Sal treated it. The baby nurses. 

           But Susan can't get her baby to quiet. 

           Moses holds his hand out to the baby. Susan looks at him, 
           murder in her eyes.

                                 MOSES
                        I won't hurt him. 
                             a small smile
                            (
                                         )
                        Like to think I got the Lord's 
                        touch. 

           Susan says nothing. Finally, she lets Moses lay a hand on 
           the CRYING BABY'S head, as he did with his own son. 

           But the BABY CONTINUES WAILING. 

           Moses frowns. Removes his hand. Then--
                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. It worked on mine.

           Moses steps away.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Gilmore whittles a piece of wood. Moses sits at the fire. 
           Silas next to him.  

                                 SILAS
                        Why are you givin' them comfort?
                            (
                             off Moses' look
                                           )
                        With the infant back there?

                                 MOSES
                        I didn't. Baby had a mind to cry.

                                 SILAS
                        Same difference.

           Moses stares at the fire.

                                 MOSES
                        Why are you a justice of the peace?

                                 SILAS
                        Lord knows. Infernal job. 
                             after a silence
                            (
                                           )
                        Stamp out evil, reckon.

                                 MOSES
                        If I was a squire? I wouldn't be 
                        stamping out evil. I'd find what's 
                        good. And I would protect it.  

           Gilmore finishes whittling the piece of wood. He tosses it 
           to Silas, who catches it.

           It's a WOODEN SHERIFF'S BADGE. Silas looks up. 

           Gilmore smiles at him. Silas doesn't smile back.

                                 SILAS
                        A Harpe brother who protects the 
                        good things. That's a new angle.

                                 LITTLE HARPE (O.S.)
                        Tell 'em what you did, Moses.

           The posse turns around to look at Little Harpe, who grins.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Tell 'em or I will.
           Silas rises. Approaches Little Harpe. 

                                 SILAS
                        You know of Moses' crimes? 

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        I wouldn't likely call 'em crimes.
                            (
                                 )
                             grin
                        But you might. 

           Silas leans down and gags Little Harpe with a rope. Ties it 
           tight around his mouth. 

           Moses watches the proceeding. Silas returns.

                                 SILAS
                            (
                             to Moses
                                    )
                        If you committed crimes, they are 
                        yours to confess. Not his. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Till then, you can protect the good 
                        things.

           Moses looks at Hudgens, who shakes his head. Say nothing. 

           The FIRE POPS. Moses stares into the flames. Then--

                                 MOSES
                        I killed a family. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Moses, you don't know what you're--

                                 MOSES
                        Quiet. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Think about what you're saying.

                                 MOSES
                        I am. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Silas, he's not under oath--

                                 MOSES
                        Quiet!

           Hudgens silences. All eyes on Moses. Except Silas. 

           He toys with the wooden sheriff's badge in his hand. 
                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Mick and Wiley joined the 
                        Chickamauga tribe.   
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        For a time, I... I joined 'em too. 
                        For one raid, least. It was... they 
                        took on a town of about twenty 
                        people. In the Cumberlands. Twenty 
                        souls. They waited till nightfall. 
                        And they moved in. 
                                 )
                            (
                             then
                        We moved in. Mick and Wiley killed 
                        I don't know how many of 'em. I got 
                        to a home that was smartly defended 
                        by a man with a fowler. He fired at 
                        me. But he was too far away. Grazed 
                        my shoulder. And then I shot him in 
                        the chest. I had no rounds left for 
                        his wife. So I cut her down with a 
                        belt ax. I was just... I was 
                        watchin' myself do it. Wasn't 
                        thinkin' nothin'... just 
                        watchin'...
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        I wouldn'ta' killed their son, but 
                        he was tryin' to strangle me. Nine 
                        year ol' boy. And their daughter... 

           Moses looks up and sees the GIRL IN A MUDDY WHITE DRESS 
           stumbling away from him. 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        She walked away into the woods. 
                        Didn't run. Just kinda stumbled, 
                        like. I followed her.

           Moses watches his vision of the GIRL IN THE MUDDY WHITE 
           DRESS disappear into the woods.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        She never turned 'round. She never 
                        saw me. Just kept trippin' through 
                        the woods, like she was 
                        sleepwalkin'. Soon as she stops 
                        walkin', I thought, I'm gonna 
                        finish what I started. But she... 
                        she never stopped walkin'. Not till 
                        she came to a cabin in the 
                        mountains. Preacher family. Most 
                        beautiful woman I ever seen took 
                        her in. All I did was watch. I just 
                        watched.
           Moses has fallen into colloquial speech without his 
           attention to diction--

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        I was sick at the thought a' what I 
                        done. I turned myself in. But them 
                        marshals... they didn't put me in 
                        jail. They wanted me to stay with 
                        the tribe. To peach on 'em. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        So that's what I did. That's how 
                        come Buchanan's Station turned out 
                        so well for the whites. They called 
                        me a hero. Kilt a family, and I'm a 
                        hero. 

           Silas takes out his flask. Unscrews it.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        I left my brothers. Tracked down 
                        that woman I seen. And I married 
                        her. 'N I vowed she'd never find 
                        out who I was. Only... only the man 
                        she made me.

           Silas drinks, relishing it. Then he downs the rest of his 
           flask. His eyes bloodshot, angry.  

                                 SILAS
                        You bloody your hands with them 
                        reds. 'N that red just don't wash 
                        off. 

                                 HUDGENS
                        Silas, you heard the man. He has 
                        paid for his infractions. 

                                 SILAS
                        He hasn't paid nothin'. But he 
                        will.

                                 MOSES
                        Reckon so. 

           Moses looks over at the tree with Little Harpe and the two 
           women. Little Harpe stares intensely at Moses. Unsettling. 

           Moses turns. Sees a shadow of somebody in the woods. He 
           draws his rifle...

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Hey.

           Silas reads the tension in Moses' voice. Looks up to see--
           FOUR CHICKAMAUGA WARRIORS 

           Burst out of the woods. Blades in their hands.

                                 SILAS
                        No!

           HUDGENS 

           Spins as a warrior brings the tomahawk down. Hudgens--

           Rolls to the side as the tomahawk sinks into the earth.

           Another warrior hurls his tomahawk at Moses' head.

           Moses BATS THE BLADE aside with his rifle's butt plate.

           MOSES FIRES, hitting nothing. The FLASH illuminates the 
           chaos as the warriors fall on the posse members.

           SCREAMS in the night.

           A Chickamauga warrior tackles Moses. They both go down.

           SILAS

           FIRES his rifle, dropping one of the warriors. Another 
           attacks him from the side, slashing his cheek with a knife--

           LEIPER 

           Presses his rifle's barrel to the head of the warrior 
           attacking Silas. But the warrior whirls and disarms him--

           HUDGENS

           Tears a vicious warrior off Gilmore, to find that the 
           Chickamauga took Gilmore's EAR OFF. Hudgens picks his rifle 
           off the ground and aims it at the warrior who--

           STEALS THE RIFLE from Hudgens, spins it, and aims it at 
           Hudgens' face. The warrior hesitates--

                                 HUDGENS
                        Dear God, please--

           The warrior FIRES.

           GILMORE

           SILENTLY SCREAMS as his friend collapses, dead.
           MOSES

           Fights the warrior in the dark, rolling across the dirt, 
           clawing, jabbing. They near the glowing embers of the fire.

           Moses rolls on top of the warrior, his fingers finding the 
           warrior's neck. The light of the embers illuminates the 
           warrior's face, revealing a-- 

           TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY

           Moses hesitates. In that moment, the boy PRODUCES A KNIFE 
           and jabs at Moses neck. Moses grabs the boy's wrist, 
           stopping the blade from piercing his throat...

           WITH SILAS AND LEIPER

           The warrior stands over the dis-armed Leiper. The warrior 
           raises his blade when--

           A knife LANDS IN THE WARRIOR'S NECK. 

           Silas looks... the knife was thrown by Moses, who stole it 
           from his twelve-year-old attacker.

           GILMORE

           Falls upon the warrior who killed Hudgens. He grabs a HUNK 
           OF BURNING EMBER from the campfire and--

           JAMS it into the warrior's mouth. The WARRIOR SCREAMS as 
           Gilmore pummels him with his singed hand.

           Gilmore looks up to see--

           MOSES

           Mercilessly twist the boy's neck, breaking it. 

           Gilmore turns to see--

           HUDGENS

           His head a mess of skull, blood, and brain.

           Gilmore looks to the tree where Little Harpe, Betsey, and 
           Susan were tied. They're gone. 

           His eyes rest on a wooded bluff overlooking their campsite. 
           Gilmore makes out--

           TWO FIGURES 

           DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS. 
           Gilmore sprints toward them.

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Gilmore runs after the retreating figures. Breathing in 
           sobs. Blood pouring from where his ear should be.

           Gilmore slows. Spins. Sees nobody.

           Long silence. Deep shadows.

           Arms reach out of the black. Grab Gilmore. Pull him back to 
           the trunk of a tree.

           Gilmore flails as--

           BIG HARPE 

           Pins Gilmore against the tree. Little Harpe curls rope 
           around him.

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        This is the one what can't talk...

           Big Harpe backs up. Regards the still-flailing Gilmore. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Or scream.

           Big Harpe takes out his tomahawk...

           EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Moses, scuffed and bruised, stares at--

           THE POSSE'S HORSES

           Lying in the ground, slashed. Dead.   

                                 SILAS (O.S.)
                        Hudgens is gone.

           Moses walks to Hudgens' corpse.  

           Silas, ice cold. 

                                 SILAS
                        Chickamauga, Moses. Friends a' 
                        yours.

           Ignoring Silas, Moses wheels--

                                 MOSES
                        Where's Gilmore?
                                 LEIPER
                        I saw him run thataway.

           Moses rushes off. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Moses jogs through the woods, rifle at the ready. In the 
           moonlight, he sees ropes crudely tied around a tree. 

           Moses slows his advance.

                                 MOSES
                        Gil?

           Moses walks around the tree. Stops.  

           Tied to the tree, Gilmore. Head tilted to the side, 
           lifeless. His arms and legs, HACKED FROM HIS HIS BODY. Only 
           his torso remains.

           Moses totters backward. Stunned. 

           Silas and Leiper run up to Moses' side. Silas stares.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           Moses walks among the carnage. In a daze. Defeated.  

           Behind him, Silas nooses a rope. 

                                 SILAS
                        Your people. 

           Moses turns and faces Silas. Silas nods at the fallen 
           Chickamauga warriors.

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        Your kindred.
                             then
                            (
                                 )
                        This hunt is over. Trail's cold. 

           Silas, drunk, tosses the hangman's rope over a branch.

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        But I'm hangin' a Harpe afore 
                        sunup, God help me. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Silas, you ain't an executioner--

                                 SILAS
                        Dead or alive. Tha's what the 
                        warrant says. 
           Leiper aims his rifle at Silas. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Drop the knife. 

           Silas looks Leiper square in the eye.

                                 SILAS
                        Better hope you drop me in one 
                        shot. 

                                 MOSES (O.S.)
                        It's all right, Leiper. 
                            (
                             off Leiper's look
                                             )
                        Let Silas do what he aims to.

                                 LEIPER
                        He's talkin' smoke. We wouldn't be 
                        here if we'd chased Big Harpe like 
                        you said--

                                 MOSES
                        Let him!

           After a beat, Leiper lowers his rifle.

                                 SILAS
                        None of us'd be here if Moses 
                        didn't companion with murderers. If 
                        he weren't a murderer himself.

           Silas faces Moses.

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        You wanna walk, or you want me to 
                        make you?

           Moses looks at the hangman's rope. 

           He walks through the carnage of the camp. 

           Passes Hudgens. Stops at the rope. 

           He pulls out Mary's white handkerchief.

           Walks to Leiper. Hands it to him.

                                 MOSES
                        Keep it clean. 

           He walks to the rope.

           After a beat, Moses puts his head through the noose.
                                 LEIPER
                        Moses--

           Silas grabs the other end and leans down with all his 
           weight, lifting Moses, GAGGING, into the air.

                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        Hell you doin', Squar?

           Moses GAGS. Flails. Interminable.

                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        This is murder, Silas. No other way 
                        about it. 

           ON SILAS, his face flushed. Shaking. Then--

           HE SCREAMS and releases the rope. 

           Moses collapses to the ground, GASPING. 

           Silas slumps. Panting. Exhausted. 

           With shaking hands, Moses slips the noose off his neck. 

           Silas, eyes wet, grabs his rifle. Aims it at Moses.

                                 SILAS
                        I ever see you again, I'll bleed 
                        you like a hog. Go.

           Moses tries to talk, but he has no voice. He rises to his 
           feet unsteadily. He falls back down. 

           Breath coming in LOUD RASPS, Moses rises again. Pulls his 
           saddle bag off his dead horse.

           He shuffles into the woods, dragging his bag. 

           Silas and Leiper watch him go. 

           EXT. OHIO RIVER - DAY

           An expansive river glows white under an overcast morning. A 
           flatboat sweeps down the current, oared by two BEARDED MEN. 

           Arranged on their boat: dress goods, leather boots, saddles, 
           and harnesses. A floating store.

           The taller of the two nudges the other. Gestures at the bank 
           up ahead, where three women stand. Two of them wave their 
           arms, flagging them down. 
                                 TALL BEARDED MAN
                        They in trouble?

                                 SHORT BEARDED MAN
                        Could be a honey trap.

                                 TALL BEARDED MAN
                        Look like the one's got a coupla' 
                        infants.  

                                 SHORT BEARDED MAN
                        Shinier the lure, the bigger the 
                        fish. Keep it movin'. 

                                 TALL BEARDED MAN
                        If they need help, we're givin' it. 
                        Keep your pistol in your lap, if it 
                        makes ya feel better.

           ON THE RIVER BANK

           Sal holds the two babies so Betsey and Susan can wave their 
           arms at the flatboat.

                                 SUSAN
                        It's workin'! They're comin'!

           Sal looks at a single story BROKEN DOWN CABIN -- inside, the 
           Harpe brothers hide. Sal WHISPERS to Betsey--

                                 SAL
                        Betsey, I been thinkin' about your 
                        words. From before. About runnin'? 
                            (
                             off Betsey's look
                                             )
                        We'll find a fort down south to 
                        take us in. I could midwife, I 
                        could earn us a living.

                            (
                             whisper
                                 BETSEY
                                   )
                        I am so sorry about what happened 
                        to your baby, Sal. Susan and I... 
                        we're in pieces.

           Susan, who can't hear their conversation, nudges Betsey.

                        back for us, Sal. 

           ON SAL'S FACE, heartbroken. 

                                 TALL BEARDED MAN (O.S.)
                        Halloo! You all right?

                                                             CUT TO:

           THE DEAD BEARDED MEN

           Adrift, carried away in the river's current. We're on the--

           EXT. FLATBOAT - DAY

           ON SAL, sitting at the boat's side, staring at the water. 
           The Harpes row.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Hands up. We're comin' up on the 
                        Cave now. 

           EXT. CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           The flatboat, with Big and Little Harpe standing at the fore 
           deck, and the women behind with their hands raised, floats 
           toward the bank of Cave-In-Rock.

           The mouth of a forty-foot cave opens in an imposing seventy-
           foot-high cliff wall.

           Shabbily clothed OUTLAWS stand at the cave's entrance. Two 
           of them stand on a ledge that lines the cliff wall.

           Two more stand on top of the cliff. They have flintlocks, 
           fowler shotguns, and long rifles aimed at the flatboat. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        We're the Harpes! 

           A wave of ANXIOUS WHISPERS sweeps across the outlaws. 

           A man (60) limps from the cave: smartly dressed in a 
           tasseled coat. Long grey hair swept back beneath a brimmed 
           hat. He carries no gun. Samuel Mason, aka, THE CAPTAIN.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Zachary, pull them in.
           One of the men wades out into the river and pulls the 
           flatboat ashore. Big Harpe jumps down, followed by his 
           brother. Nobody helps the women climb down.

           Big Harpe walks up to the Captain. He towers over him. But 
           the Captain only pops a quid of tobacco in his mouth. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        I don't recall our last interaction 
                        ending with an invitation for your 
                        return. Much to the contrary, in 
                        fact.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Law's on us. We'll stay here till 
                        they give us up. Then we'll move 
                        north and disappear.   

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You didn't answer my question.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Didn't hear one.

           Big Harpe hands Mason a small sack of JANGLING COINS.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        For quarters. 

           Mason considers the money in his hand. Smiles.

           The Captain walks into the cave. Big Harpe follows.

           INT. CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           Big Harpe walks through a narrow corridor at the base of the 
           cavern, which climbs into a yawning space littered with 
           detritus, spent bottles, and torn clothes.

           A grimy outlaw defecates in an overflowing chamber pot, 
           while others nap fitfully. Less a fortress than a sad 
           shelter for derelicts and criminals.  

           All of them freeze when they see Big Harpe.

           As the Captain walks in front, he calls out to the men.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        The last time Micajah Harpe and his 
                        two brothers haunted this cave -- 
                        or were they half brothers? 
                        Cousins? They killed one of our 
                        own.  
           The Captain walks backward, talking to Big Harpe.

                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        Do you remember this? You tied him 
                        to his own horse. Ran him right off 
                        the cliff here to meet his end 
                        after a hundred foot fall. And what 
                        did you do, Micajah? 
                                           )
                            (
                             off his silence
                        You laughed.

           The Captain arrives at the back of the cave, one hundred and 
           forty feet back, where a crude wooden staircase leads up to 
           an opening in the roof -- daylight bleeds down.

           The Captain places the sack of money Big Harpe gave him in a 
           chest that he locks. He's still talking--

                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        That moment made plain to me a 
                        simple truth: you and I do not 
                        share the same sense of humor. 

           The Captain nods. A group of outlaws rush out of a side room 
           in the cave and push Big Harpe to his knees. One of them 
           holds a knife to his throat. 

           AT THE ENTRANCE

           Two outlaws converge on Little Harpe, aiming rifles at his 
           chest. A single outlaw covers the women. 

           WITH THE CAPTAIN

           The Captain stands tall over Big Harpe.

                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        I used to haunt ordinaries and inns 
                        like Hamlet's ghost. And I got in 
                        many fights. 

           The Captain wipes Big Harpe's hair out of his eyes. Tender. 

                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        Myself, I earned a reputation for 
                        winning these fights. Know my 
                        secret? It's simplicity itself: you 
                        gouge the eye. You do it with the 
                        thumb.

           Big Harpe watches the Captain, unimpressed. 

           The Captain displays his thumb. The thumbnail has been 
           carved to a point. 
                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        Always keep it sharp. Never know 
                        when I need to mark an occasion 
                        with a good eye gouge. 
                             holds thumb up
                            (
                                          )
                        Next thing you do is spear it in to 
                        the face, where the eye meets the 
                        nose. Then you hook and pull. 

           As the Captain slides his thumb onto Big Harpe's cheek-- 

                                 THE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                        I vowed that if any of you three 
                        Harpes returned to this cave, I'd 
                        blind you all. And then bleed you 
                        all.  
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        Now. Here's the game: on a three-
                        count, Jedidiah here is gonna spit. 
                        We'll see if I can't dangle that 
                        big eye of yours before his snot 
                        hits the sand. Ready? One. Two...

           Big Harpe's head whips to his right. He BITES the wrist of 
           the man holding the knife to his neck. Pulls off a chunk.

           The MAN SCREAMS as Big Harpe yanks a hand free, grabs the 
           knife, and holds it to the Captain's belly.

           An outlaw presses a flintlock to Big Harpe's cheek, but he 
           ignores it, focusing on the Captain.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        You want your insides in the dirt?

           The Captain, sweating, nods to his men. They back away from 
           Big Harpe, who rises. Easily a head taller than the Captain.

           He angles the point of the knife near the Captain's eye.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        We'll be leaving soon. But until we 
                        do... the Cave is mine.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Raggedly breathing, Moses totters through the woods, still 
           dragging his saddlebag. 

           He stops. Drops into a sitting position. Stares vacantly.

           He roots in his bag.

           Pulls out the flat journey cake Mary made him. He smells it.
           He takes a bite. It crumbles. He chews it. Swallows.

           Tears drip from his eyes. He sets the cake beside him.

           He pulls a flintlock pistol and powder horn from the bag. 

           He powders the pan of his flintlock. 

           Pulls the cock back. 

           Stares into space. 

                                 MOSES
                        Mary.

           Moses places the barrel into his own mouth.

           Squeezes his eyes shut. Steeling himself.

           Pulls the trigger.

           The cock falls with a loud CLICK. Misfire.  

           He SCREAMS. Hurls the pistol into the brush. 

           Collapses to the ground, weeping. 

           An idea strikes him. He pulls from his rope belt--

           The char-less knife. 

           He points the blade to his belly -- where Mary took it.

           Slowly he looks up, his face mired with dust and tears.  

           In front of him, the GIRL IN THE MUDDY WHITE DRESS, 
           stumbling through the woods.

           Moses watches for a moment. 

           He struggles to his feet. And follows the girl.

           ON THE JOURNEY CAKE, as ants swarm on it.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

           Silas, caked in dirt, digs a grave with his bare hands. He 
           hasn't gotten very far.  

           Leiper sits on a tree stump, loading one of several rifles 
           lying on the ground before him. 

           Silas stops. Watches Leiper.
                                 SILAS
                        You startin' a war?   

                                 LEIPER
                        Finishin' one. 

           Leiper stands and walks off, holstering his rifle behind him 
           and tucking a flintlock into his belt.

                                 SILAS
                        Harpes are in the wind.

                                 LEIPER
                        We know where they're goin'.

                                 SILAS
                        Cave-In-Rock?! Outlaws'll skin you 
                        alive.

           Leiper keeps walking. 

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        That's after you get past the Ohio. 
                        Three hundred foot a' current.

                                 LEIPER
                        Ya don't gotta come.

           Silas watches, incredulous, as Leiper treks into the woods.

                                 SILAS
                        You fancy the reward that much?

                                 LEIPER
                        Good ridin' with ya, Squar. 

           ON SILAS

           Who regards the destroyed campsite. And then... 

           He leans over, and pulls the wooden sheriff's badge from the 
           dirt. Gilmore's gift.

           Silas thumbs the wooden token. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The GIRL IN THE MUDDY WHITE DRESS stumbles through the 
           woods. Moses follows, in a fugue state.

           Alarmed, Moses stops too. The girl crumples to the ground. 
           As Moses watches, another figure approaches her. 

           Mary. 
           She leans down and cradles the exhausted girl. After a 
           moment, Mary rises, pulling the girl to her feet. She 
           escorts the girl a few more steps. 

           Moses follows them out onto the--

           EXT. BANK OF THE OHIO RIVER - DAY

           The overcast sky reflects a wash of bright light into Moses' 
           eyes. He squints. 

           Downstream, across the wide expanse of the river--

           Cave-In-Rock. 

           Moses turns around and sees Mary and the girl in the muddy 
           white dress, holding hands. Regarding Moses quietly. 

           Moses nods. 

           He draws from his rope belt the char-free knife. 

           He takes his coat off. Drops it to the sand at his feet. 

           Rips his shirt off. Uses it to tie the knife to his forearm.

           He stares at the river. Then turns back...

           But Mary is gone. Moses looks around for her. 

           Nothing. Tears well in his eyes.

                                 MOSES
                        Goodbye. 

           Without hesitation, Moses wades into the Ohio. 

           And starts to swim. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Leiper trudges through the woods. 

           Silas catches up to him. After a silence-- 

                                 LEIPER
                        Moses walked this way. 

                                 SILAS
                        I can see his prints, well as you.

           They continue in silence.
           EXT. TOP OF CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           Sal sits at the cliff's edge, directly over the cave, 
           staring out at the river. Big Harpe walks up behind her.  

                                 BIG HARPE
                        We're not stayin' here. 

           Sal doesn't answer.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        It's best for you and the women. 
                        We'll leave tomorrow.

                                 SAL
                        I'm not goin'. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I'm not asking.

                                 SAL
                        I said I'm not goin'. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                            (
                             after a beat
                                        )
                        This on account a' your baby?

                                 SAL
                        It's on account a' you. 

           Big Harpe pulls Sal up by her arms.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I'll gut you right here.

                                 SAL
                        You already have.

           Big Harpe lets go. He looks down. Sees how close Sal stands 
           to the edge. Then, nicer--

                                 BIG HARPE
                        We're goin' to that lake up in 
                        Illinois Territory. Remember? The 
                        one near the blackberry brier. 
                        We'll settle. Wiley and I'll roll 
                        us a cabin. You'll be happy. 

                                 SAL
                        And how many people need to bleed 
                        to keep you happy?

           Big Harpe steps closer to her. Dangerous.
                                 BIG HARPE
                        I didn't mean to quiet that baby. 
                        But how was I supposed to think?

                                 SAL
                            (
                             after a silence
                                           )
                        I like to imagine you in the 
                        furnace of hell, shoulder deep in 
                        boilin' blood. The sound of your 
                        screams'd be as sweet as a 
                        bluebird's call--

           Big Harpe vice-grips her neck. She GAGS. He holds her face 
           close, his face taut with fury. 

           He leans forward slightly, as if he's going to shove her 
           over the side. But then he lessens his grip. Backs away.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        At least you're honest.

           He turns and leaves her.

           EXT. BANK OF THE OHIO RIVER - DAY

           Silas and Leiper stand at the spot where Moses was. Silas 
           leans over and picks up tattered fabric on the bank. 

                                 SILAS
                        Moses' shirt. 'N pouch. 
                            (
                                 )
                             then
                        What ya' see?

                                 LEIPER
                        A big cave.

                                 SILAS
                        Eyes like a lynx. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Cave-In-Rock's a shit name for a 
                        cave.
                            (
                             seeing something
                                            )
                        Holy... Gimme that spyglass. 

           Silas hands Leiper his telescope. Leiper extends it and 
           looks through. 

                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        Hell's highway. Moses is almost 
                        across. 

                                 SILAS
                        In what?
                                 LEIPER
                        In nothin'. He's catfishin' his way 
                        across like he got gills.  

           Leiper tosses the spyglass to Silas, who looks across.

                                 SILAS
                        Goddammit, Moses. 

                                 LEIPER
                        Can't get to him in time. 

           Silas looks around. He spots the cabin up stream -- the same 
           place where the Harpes hid before killing the two boaters.

                                 SILAS
                        Not swimmin', we can't. 

           AT THE CABIN

           Silas and Leiper stand before the rotted cabin.

           Silas walks forward and lifts up a section of the fallen 
           roof. Leiper helps. 

           EXT. OHIO RIVER - DAY

           Sunlight leaks through a break in the clouds as Silas and 
           Leiper carry a chunk of the log cabin wall -- their raft. 
           They set it in the water. 

           Silas draws his field telescope. Looks through it.  

           SILAS'S POV - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

           CLOSE ON one of the outlaws climbing out of the hole in the 
           cave to the wooded land on top. 

           SILAS

           Passes the telescope to Leiper.

                                 SILAS
                        Look' like the mouth ain't the only 
                        way in and out. 

                                 LEIPER
                            (
                             looking through telescope
                                                     )
                        Ayuh. Egress at the back, there. 

           Silas looks at the cliff the cave is set into. His eyes 
           follow the wall of the cliff up river.  
                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        What's the plan, Squar?

                                 SILAS
                            (
                             after a beat
                                        )
                        Moses. Save Moses. 

           Silas pushes their raft into the water. 

           EXT. UP THE OHIO RIVER - DAY

           Moses, GASPING, wades in the shallows, having swum the width 
           of the river. A sloping cliff wall faces him -- he's 
           upstream from the Cave. 

           Moses holds out his forearm. The knife is still tied to it.

           Without hesitating, he grabs a tree root clinging to the 
           sloping wall. Begins to climb... 

           EXT. TOP OF CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           Sal stands at the precipice, taking in the river. 

           Behind her, an outlaw ambles into the woods. Pees. Sal 
           ignores him. 

           She inches closer to the precipice. 

           Closer. Seconds from jumping. And then--

           A SOUND catches her attention. A percussive WET SOUND. 
           Hurried and repeated. 

           She walks into the woods, toward the SOUND. And freezes.

           Before her, Moses kneels over the outlaw, STABBING HIM 
           REPEATEDLY in the chest with his knife. 

           Moses stops. Slowly, his head rises. 

           Sal takes a step back, stricken when she sees: Moses, wide-
           eyed. Rivulets of blood trailing down his chest. 

           Moses holds up a red finger to his mouth. Shh. 

           Sal says nothing. But she nods. 

           Moses rises. Takes a step toward her, knife in hand. 

                             whisper
                                 MOSES
                                   )
                            (
                        Help me.
           Sal hears something DRIPPING. She looks down. Blood from 
           Moses' knife drips on her boot.

                                 SAL (PRELAP)
                        Mick.

           INT. CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           Big and Little Harpe sit at the mouth of the Cave. Big Harpe 
           chews on a hunk of bread. 

                                 SAL (O.S.)
                        Mick. 

           Big and Little Harpe turn to see Sal. 

                                 SAL
                        Need to speak with you.

           Little Harpe stands.

                                 SAL (CONT'D)
                        No. Only Mick. 

           Little Harpe turns to Mick. Who finally rises.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Big Harpe follows Sal as she climbs the wooden staircase in 
           back. He grabs ahold of her, noticing something. 

           He moves aside the hem of her dress, revealing the spot of 
           blood on her boot. He wipes his finger across the blood. 

           He looks up at her. After a beat--

                                 SAL (CONT'D)
                        It's nothin'.

           EXT. ABOVE CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           Sal walks through the woods. Big Harpe follows. His eyes 
           darting around. Finally, he stops. 

           Pulls a flintlock pistol on Sal. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        If you're planning on surprising 
                        me... get to it.  

           Sal turns. She points farther into the woods.

                                 SAL
                        I need to show you something. 
                                 BIG HARPE
                        Quiet. 

           Big Harpe cocks his head to the side, listening.

           ON MOSES, hiding behind a tree just a few paces away. Knife 
           at the ready... 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Where is he?

           ON SAL, not knowing what to say. And then--

           Moses rushes out of his hiding spot. Straight for--

           Big Harpe, who aims at Moses but--

           Doesn't fire. He smiles as--

           Moses brings the knife down. Big Harpe catches his wrist, 
           the knife tip inches from Big Harpe's face. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Hell of a preacher. 

           Sal SCREAMS and--

           SLAMS a rock across Big Harpe's face. 

           He goes down. 

           Moses readjust his knife -- from a stabbing grip to a 
           slitting grip -- and kneels by Big Harpe when--

           A SHOT RINGS OUT. A round thuds into Moses' leg. 

           He YELPS as he falls backward. 

           ON SUSAN, who lowers her smoking rifle.  

           Little Harpe runs up and punches Sal in the face. 

                                 BIG HARPE (PRELAP)
                        My intention with you has not 
                        changed.

           EXT. CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           A sweating, pain-stricken Moses kneels on the sand. An 
           outlaw stands on either side of him, holding an arm.

           In the sand next to him: Sal, trussed and bruised.

           Big Harpe, blood dried to his forehead, kneels by Moses.
                                 BIG HARPE
                        My intention is to give you a 
                        choice. And the choice is this: 
                        ride with us. Or pray to God... 

           Big Harpe inserts a finger into Moses' bullet wound. Moses 
           SCREAMS. Little Harpe laughs his SHRILL LAUGH. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        ... while I make you suffer. And 
                        this?

           Big Harpe sticks his finger in deeper. Moses SCREAMS again.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        This is nothing. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        But if you ride with us... 

           Big Harpe withdraws his finger.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        Who knows. Maybe one day you can 
                        kill us all. 

           Moses' glassy eyes find Big Harpe. 

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        You want revenge. That's your only 
                        chance for it. So choose. God. Or 
                        blood. 

           Moses' eyes roll back -- he's about to faint. But he 
           swallows. Summoning strength. And then-- 

                                 MOSES
                        As Christ suffered... so shall I. 

           Silence. Big Harpe shakes his head. Stands. 

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Lay him flat. 

           The men do. Big Harpe pulls out his tomahawk. Tenderly sets 
           the blade on Moses' midriff. Then--

                                 MOSES
                        Wait.

           Big Harpe's black eyes glide to Moses'. 

                            (
                             quiet
                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                                 )
                        I'll, I'll ride with you.
                                 BIG HARPE
                        Didn't make that out.

                                 MOSES
                            (
                             louder
                                  )
                        I'll ride with you. 

           Big Harpe grins. Slides his tomahawk back into his rope 
           belt. Stands tall over Moses, who is utterly defeated.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Welcome back.  

           Movement catches Moses' eye. At the top of the cliff--

           JOHN LEIPER

           Aims a rifle down. And FIRES AS--

           MOSES 

           Faints.  

                                                       SLAM TO BLACK.

           BLACK SCREEN

           SHOUTING. RIFLE FIRE. SCREAMS. And then--

           BLISSFUL QUIET. 

                                 SILAS (V.O.)
                        Moses.

           SILENCE.

                                 SILAS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Moses.

           EXT. CAVE-IN-ROCK - DAY

           Moses opens his eyes to see--

           Silas and Leiper standing there. Breathless. Tattered. 

           They have been through hell and back. 

                                 MOSES
                        Did you get them? The Harpes?

                                 SILAS
                        They ran. 
                                 LEIPER
                        Captain too. Scattered like 
                        cockroaches. 

           Silas offers a hand. Moses takes it. He rises to his feet. 

           And sees that Sal is still trussed. 

           WINCING, Moses picks up his char-free knife from the ground. 
           And uses it to cut Sal free. 

           She climbs to her feet unaided.  

           Moses wipes sand off the blade.

                                 MOSES
                        You see which way Big Harpe went?

           Silas nods.

                                 SILAS
                        Mounts hitched up top.

           Moses takes a step on his bad leg and SUCKS IN AIR through 
           his teeth. 

           Silas moves in to help. But Moses shakes him off. 

                                 MOSES
                        Don't touch me.

           Silas looks at the dried blood on Moses' arms and chest. At 
           Moses' intense, crazed eyes. 

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        I want blood.

           OFF SILAS'S LOOK...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Moses, Leiper, Silas, and Sal ride fast through underbrush, 
           ducking leaves and leaping over fallen logs. 

           They BURST onto a--

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           And see the Harpes. Riding ahead.

           ON BIG HARPE

           As he turns around to see his pursuers. He shakes the reins.  
           ON LEIPER

           Who rides toward a tree in the field. He balances on the 
           saddle of his galloping horse and--

           Grabs onto the tree branch. Swings up for a better vantage. 

           He takes aim with his rifle and CLICK. Misfire. 

           Leiper draws another rifle. Aims.

           BIG HARPE 

           Rushes toward a thick canebrake, seconds from vanishing.

           LEIPER 

           Fires. 

           THE ROUND

           Lands in the small of Big Harpe's back as he disappears into 
           the canebrake.

           LITTLE HARPE

           Sees the hit. Aghast. To Susan and Betsey--

                                 LITTLE HARPE
                        Don't follow, into the trees!

           The three of them veer off and vanish into the forest. 

           MOSES 

           Ignores Little Harpe. Rushes into the--

           EXT. CANEBRAKE - DAY

           Moses follows Big Harpe's trail through the claustrophobic 
           reeds. Slows his horse. 

           Light up ahead through the canebrake. Moses moves the reeds 
           aside and exits into a-- 

           CLEARING

           A small creek runs through the field. Next to it lies--

           BIG HARPE 

           Blood dotting the corners of his mouth. Brittle breaths.

           Moses dismounts as Silas catches up. Leaps off his horse. 
                                 SILAS
                        I'll do him, Moses. 

           He holds a hand out for Moses' rifle. But Moses doesn't take 
           his eyes off Big Harpe.  

                                 MOSES
                        How many? How many you kilt?

           A trace of a smile on Big Harpe's lips.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        How many flies you swat? 

                                 MOSES
                        Mary and Abraham weren't flies.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        You wanna know how they went?

                                 SILAS
                        Don't listen to this, Moses. Let me 
                        put an end to this monster.

           Leiper runs up, breathless. Grins when he sees Big Harpe.

                                 LEIPER
                        Not so scary now, is he?

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Your family's last moments belong 
                        to me. I can give ‘em to you. 

                                 MOSES
                        Repent. Repent for what you done.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Stop playin' at preachin'. It ain't 
                        honest. I have no regrets anyhow.
                                       )
                            (
                             cough cough

                        God's wounds, put a bullet in this 
                        cretin.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        I did your babe first. It was the 
                        cryin'. Couldn't get my sleep. 
                        Couldn't think. I slit its neck ear 
                        to ear.

           ON MOSES, listening. 
                                 BIG HARPE (O.S.)
                        Mary didn't know at first. She 
                        asked what my secret was to keep 
                        him so quiet. 

           Big Harpe COUGHS. Continues, faint.

                                 BIG HARPE
                        Wiley and I took turns with the 
                        knives. Last thing I told Mary was 
                        that you were our kin.  

           Tears streak Moses' cheeks, drawing paths in the grime.

                                 BIG HARPE (CONT'D)
                        She was still been breathin' when I 
                        torched the place.

           In a jerk of motion, Moses has the long rifle aimed at Big 
           Harpe's head.

                                 LEIPER
                        Finally.

           A curious expression threads Big Harpe's features: anxiety. 

           Reflexively, if slowly, he moves his head to the side, out 
           of the way of the gun's barrel.

                                 LEIPER (CONT'D)
                        Lookit. Yella'. For all his talk, 
                        yella'.

                                 SILAS
                        Let me, Moses.

           Moses' finger finds the trigger.

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        Moses!

           Moses looks at Silas. 

                                 SILAS (CONT'D)
                        You told me to find what's good. 
                        And protect it. 
                            (
                             then
                                 )
                        I found it.       

                                 MOSES
                        There's nothin' hidden that will 
                        not be revealed.
                                 SILAS
                        Moses. Give me the rifle.

           Silas holds a hand out for the rifle. After a beat, Moses 
           passes it to him.

                            (
                             to Leiper
                                 MOSES
                                     )
                        Fetch him some water.

                                 LEIPER
                        He's dyin' anyhow.  

                                 MOSES
                        Do it!

                                 LEIPER
                        Christ, okay. 
                             looks around
                                        )
                            (
                        With what?

                                 MOSES
                        Keep pressure on his wound. Raise 
                        his feet.

           Moses limps away.

                                 LEIPER
                        Ah, hellfire.

           Leiper grabs a dirty moccasin off Big Harpe's foot. Walks to 
           to the creek and fills the shoe with water. 

           EXT. CANEBRAKE - DAY

           Eyes set, Moses hobbles through the reeds. 

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           He finds Sal astride her horse.

                                 MOSES
                        You will want to see this.  

           EXT. CLEARING - DAY

           Silas stares as Leiper clumsily lets Big Harpe drink from 
           his own shoe. 

           Moses, followed by Sal, walks over, KNIFE IN HAND. 

                                 MOSES
                        He still breathin'?
                                 SILAS
                        Yes.

                                 MOSES
                        Stand aside.

           Leiper does. Moses displays the knife for Big Harpe.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        You buried this so deep in Mary's 
                        belly the blaze didn't touch the 
                        handle.

           Big Harpe has no energy left to respond. Except to stare at 
           the knife.

           With effort, Moses rolls Big Harpe over onto his belly. Sits 
           on his back, straddling it. Holds Harpe's head by the hair. 
           He puts the knife to Big Harpe's neck. 

           Big Harpe WHIMPERS.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        What's that? What's that noise yer 
                        makin'?

                                 SILAS
                        Moses. Please...

           Moses kneels down. Mouth to Harpe's ear.

                                 MOSES
                        You want honesty, brother?

           Big Harpe makes a panicked, THROATY SOUND.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                        Let's be honest together.

           Moses places the knife at the side of Big Harpe's neck. 

           AND BEGINS TO SAW. 

           But he's not slitting the throat. He's SEVERING THE HEAD.

           Big Harpe grimaces, determined not to scream, but the pain 
           overwhelms him. 

           He SQUEALS, an awful sound filled with terror and anguish.

           ON MOSES, jaw set, sawing. 

           Severing Big Harpe's head centimeter by centimeter.
           Big Harpe SHRIEKS. And SHRIEKS.

           Silas and Leiper look away.

           But Sal doesn't. She watches every second.

           Blood covers Moses' arms and hands. He saws. 

           Making it last.

           Big Harpe's SCREAM PITCHES UP as a vocal cord is severed. 

           He is silenced as all cords are cut.

           Big Harpe's arms thrash. Death throes.

                                 MOSES (CONT'D)
                            (
                             whisper
                                   )
                        You can hide in hell. But I'll find 
                        ya' there.

           Moses RIPS Big Harpe's head off. 

           He turns, eyes crazed. Severed head in hand.

           He drops the knife.

           Plucks a burlap bag off his horse's saddle.

           Drops the head into the bag. 

           Sal reaches for it. 

                                 SAL
                        I'll carry it.

           Moses hands her the bag. Climbs onto his horse.

                                 SILAS
                            (
                             quiet, empty
                                        )
                        What about the body?

                                 MOSES
                        Leave it for the wolves.

           Moses rides off.

           ON SILAS, watching him go.

           EXT. KENTUCKY WILDS - DAY

           Moses leads Silas, Leiper, and a stone-faced Sal, carrying 
           the bloodied bag on her horse. 
           Moses looks like a corpse.

           A SERIES OF TITLES:

                        The posse received its three hundred 
                        dollar reward. 

           The SOUND of a MALLET HITTING A SPIKE carries us to--

           EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

           As Moses HAMMERS a nine-inch spike into a low-hanging branch 
           of an oak. Behind him, Silas, Leiper, and Sal watch as--

           Moses takes the severed head out of the bag. 

           With both hands, he SLAMS the head down on the spike.

           Big Harpe's lifeless black eyes stare at them.

           Moses looks off -- at what we can’t see.

                                 MOSES
                        Let it rot.

           Is he referring to the head? Or something else... ?

           EXT. CLEARING - DAY

           Betsey and Susan, each carrying babies, stumble through the 
           woods, alone.  

                        The Harpe women were arrested and 
                        tried for murder. They were 
                        acquitted.  

           EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

           Sal stares at the displayed head of Big Harpe. 

                        Sal remarried. She changed her name 
                        so her descendants would not know of 
                        her connection to the Harpes. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           A distraught, panicked Little Harpe runs through the woods.

                        Wiley Harpe eluded the law for four 
                        years. He was caught in Mississippi 
                        and hanged. 
           EXT. SILAS MCBEE'S HOME - DAY

           LONG SHOT of Silas walking toward his cabin. Waiting at the 
           door, a woman. Catherine. Silas runs to her. They embrace.

                        Silas McBee became one of the first 
                        representatives in a state 
                        legislature. His years were long and 
                        successful.

           INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

           Moses downs a tankard of ale in a crowded saloon. By the 
           looks of him, he is very drunk.

           A man in the bar shoves his way past Moses, who doesn't take 
           to the shove. Moses SLAMS his mug against the man's head and 
           tackles him. 

           Moses pounds on the man's face. Again. Again. Again.

           FREEZE FRAME

           On a furious Moses, his bloodied hand in mid-air.

                        Moses Stegall never preached. In 
                        1806 he tried to elope with a woman. 
                        Her brother shot him dead.  

           EXT. TREE - DAY

           It rains in sheets upon the bleached skull -- all that 
           remains of Big Harpe -- still nailed to the tree.

                        The skull remained on the tree for 
                        years. The spot became known as 
                        Harpe's Head. 

           MOVING CLOSER to the the skull, we can see what's beyond... 
           what Moses was looking at when he said, "Let it rot"--

           HIS CHURCH

           Decayed. Overgrown with weeds. 

           Boards dangle in the wind, the wood grey and rotting in the 
           Kentucky rain.

                        It still bears that name today.

                                                           FADE OUT.

                                       THE END.
