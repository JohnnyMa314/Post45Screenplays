           EXT. THE VAST OPEN OCEAN – NIGHT 

           We’re UNDERWATER, 20 yards below the surface, looking up at 
           a graceful figure swimming in perfect rhythm.  

           DIANA NYAD, 62. We’ll get to know her, but for now it’s dark 
           and all we can see is the red LED light on her swim cap.  

           We stay with her a few beats. It’s quiet and peaceful; a 
           woman alone in the great darkness. And then...  

           As we push in closer to the surface, 15 yards now, we catch 
           a glimpse of a thin, phosphorescent TENTACLE floating past 
           camera. And then another. And another. We pass Diana and—   

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA – CONTINUOUS  

           Burst out of the water and get our bearings. She’s not alone 
           at all. Three boats carry her CREW of 35 people.  

           Two kayakers paddle along each side of her, 10 feet apart. 
           Navigators steer the boats. A nutritionist preps her next 
           meal. Handlers track her progress in notebooks.  

           We’ll get to know these people too. What’s important now is 
           that they’re all wearing the same blue t-shirts that read 
           “Xtream Dream”. And they’re all focused on Diana.  

           We’re in the Florida Straights, 15 miles north of the Cuban 
           coastline, middle of the ocean.  

           A title card reads: September 23, 2011. 8:12 pm. 

           BONNIE STOLL, 59, kneels at a boat’s edge, watching Diana 
           like a hawk. Diana’s best friend and head coach. Masculine 
           shoulders and arms. A jovial drill sergeant.  

           She looks over at DAVID MARCHANT, head navigator.  

                                 DAVID 
                        Water’s perfect. Couldn’t have done 
                        better than this. 
                            (Bonnie nods) 
                        Let’s just hope it holds for three 
                        days.  

           Bonnie gives him a nervous smile. Next to her --  

           MARK SOLLINGER, 50, Operations Chief, writes in a small 
           notebook: “Mile 5, glassy water, freestyle.” And then: 

                                 DIANA (O.S.) 
                        Ooooow! Bonnie!  
           Bonnie’s eyes dart back to Diana --  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Did she stop? Diana?? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Wooooow! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 
                        Intense intense intense.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Stop the boat! 

                                 MARK 
                            (into walkie talkie) 
                        All boats stop, all boats stop. 
                        Check the drogues.  

           Everything stops, everyone looks at Diana. She’s counting 
           numbers again, treading water, taking loud deep breaths.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana? Was it jelly fish?  

                                 DIANA 
                        YES! Many of ‘em! C’mon!  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jon!  

           JON ROSE, 29, is quickly throwing on flippers and a snorkel. 
           He grabs a small towel and jumps in near Diana.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Fire fire fire!  

           Thin tentacles cover Diana’s neck and chest and right 
           forearm. Jon does his best with the towel to wipe them off.   

                                 JON 
                        Oh yeah, she’s got it all over her. 
                        Shit, it just touched me.  

           Bonnie grabs a full-body swim suit and holds it out. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Put this on.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Fire fire fire fire— 

                                 MARK 
                        She still has something on her. 
                                 JON 
                        Where? I can’t see. 

                                 MARK 
                        Right there, by the armpit.  

                                 DIANA 
                        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10— 

                                 JON 
                        Ok, that’s it. They off? 

           Diana’s eyes still look crazed, but she nods her head -- 
           “Yes, they’re off” –- and Jon gets back on the boat.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana, just relax for a minute and 
                        catch your breath. Put this on. 

           Diana’s body helps get the suit on, but her eyes are miles 
           away, wide open and terrified. She mumbles incoherent.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                            (to Jon) 
                        Do you know what it was? 

                                 JON 
                        It fucking sucks. Gotta be box 
                        jelly.   

           Bonnie watches Diana again, in enormous pain, still treading 
           water. She looks panicked, barely holding it together.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Do you want to get out?  

                                 DIANA 
                            (between deep breaths) 
                        NO! 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay. Keep breathing. Just breathe. 
                            (no response) 
                        Diana? 

           Diana rolls onto her back. We push in tight on her face. 
           It’s taking everything she has to cycle through this, and 
           she might not. Her eyes close, on the verge of passing out.   

                                 BONNIE (O.S.) 
                        Diana? Diana!

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER (1978) 
                        Today, at the age of 26, marathon 
                        swimmer Diana Nyad broke the world 
                        record for fastest swim time around 
                        the Island of Manhattan. She did it 
                        in 7 hours 57 minutes...

                        ...a name for herself with these 
                        monster swims, completing Lake 
                        Ontario last year, making the 28 
                        mile trip in record time, and now 
                        prepping for the English Channel.  

           NEXT:  

           Diana on The Tonight Show, 1978. Johnny Carson and Ed 
           McMahon greet her on stage. 

           She’s 29 here; short hair, athletic, undeniably pretty. 
           Confident and poised, no fear of live TV.  

                                 DIANA 
                            (to Johnny) 
                        I’m glad to meet you. I was 
                        wondering how many times I’d have 
                        to do your show before I met you.  

           The audience “oooohs” and giggles. Johnny looks embarrassed. 
           Diana smiles at him. He winks and points at Ed. 

                                 JOHNNY CARSON 
                        Ed had to wait five years. 

           Big laugh from the audience.

                        mile swim from Ortegasa, Cuba to 
                        Key West, Florida today. 

           FOOTAGE of Diana, 29, standing on the Cuban beach, 
           stretching and making last minute prep for the swim.  
                                 MALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
                        Nyad will follow the rules of the 
                        World Professional Marathon 
                        Swimming Federation. No flotation 
                        devices. No sleep during the 60 
                        hours of swimming. No hanging onto 
                        boats. And only a bathing cap, 
                        goggles, two swim suits, and some 
                        grease to protect her body.  

           FOOTAGE of Diana swimming in the belly of a large boat, 
           shark cages below her and on each side, a small crew of 15 
           on the boat watching her. 

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
                        After 41 hours of battling eight 
                        foot swells and veering hopelessly 
                        off course, her crew had to pull 
                        Nyad from the water. It took them 
                        five minutes to convince her the 
                        swim was impossible. 

           See Diana, treading water, vomiting. Looking devastated now 
           as the crew pulls her onto the boat.  

                                 DIANA (FOOTAGE) 
                            (through tears) 
                        What will it take? I know I can go 
                        at least another 30 hours. What 
                        will it take??

           INT. RENTAL CAR – DAY 

           A tight shot of EYES in the rearview mirror. They’re weary, 
           surrounded by wrinkles and tan leathery skin.  

           They belong to DIANA, now 60. Short, surfer-tossed hair. 
           Broad shoulders. Strong face, crocodile tough. Still pretty.  

           Title card reads: 2009 

           She pulls at the skin around her eyes, trying to flatten the 
           creases. It isn’t working.  

           The car behind her honks; the light’s turned green.  

           EXT. FT. LAUDERDALE AIRPORT, FLORIDA – DAY 

           Diana drives into the arrivals section. BONNIE, her coach 
           from the opening scene, is waiting with a small bag.  
                                 BONNIE 
                        Hey kiddo.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Thanks for coming.  

           INT. FT. LAUDERDALE GROCERY STORE – DAY 

           Diana pushes a shopping cart. Bonnie peruses options.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        What the hell do you get for 
                        something like this? D? 

           She looks over at Diana, who’s not paying any attention.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Fuck it. I’m getting Wheat Thins.  
                            (throws ‘em in the cart) 
                        We don’t have to talk.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I just keep thinking. She was 82. 
                        I’m 60.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah? 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’ve got 22 more years? That’s it?  

           Bonnie thinks. Puts her hand on Diana’s shoulder.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Maybe. Yeah.  

           What the fuck? Diana was hoping for more. But that’s Bonnie.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        C’mon, we’re late.  

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX COURTYARD – DAY  

           A post-funeral luncheon. Twenty or so people, dressed in 
           black, eat cheese and drink cheap wine. Diana holds the 
           hands of her AUNT CHERYL, 80’s.  

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        Your mother had a good heart. Just 
                        weak. I never liked that husband.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I know, Aunt Cheryl.  
                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        What about you, honey? Are you 
                        married?  

           Bonnie stifles a laugh.  

                                 DIANA 
                        No. I don’t think it’s for me.  

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        Why not? You’re pretty. Maybe grow 
                        your hair out.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m gay, Aunt Cheryl. I like women.  

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        I know. So what? There’s a woman.  

           She’s motioning to Bonnie.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        We’ve tried it before, Cheryl. 
                        She’s a pain in my ass.   

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        Well, that’s life.  
                            (to Diana) 
                        So what’re you doing now? I saw you 
                        on TV with that Michael Phelps boy. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah I’ve been with NBC Sports 
                        awhile now. Just reporting. 

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        Are you still swimming?  

                                 DIANA 
                        Not in 30 years.  

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        Never?? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Not once.  

                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        That’s a shame. Lucy was always 
                        talking about your swims.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Really?  
                                 AUNT CHERYL 
                        She still has all your medals.  

           INT. LUCY NYAD’S APARTMENT – LATER 

           Reception over. Everyone’s cleared out and Diana and Bonnie 
           are boxing up Lucy’s stuff. 

           Diana opens a cabinet in the hallway and sure enough, 
           there’s a cache of medals and trophies.  

           CU on a few of them: Florida State High School Championship 
           100 Yards, Pine Crest. Another at 200 yards, one in 
           Freestyle, one in Backstroke. And then: 

           A scrapbook of press clippings. Diana’s amazed.  

           She flips through pages of articles from the 70’s: her 
           Manhattan Island record time, a swim from the Bahamas to 
           Florida in 1979, and finally... 

           Her failed swim attempt from Cuba to Florida. Numerous 
           articles about this: “Marathon swimmer comes up short” and 
           “Nyad calls it quits on Day 2”. She looks up at Bonnie.  

                                 DIANA 
                        What’re we doing? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What do you mean? We’re boxing up 
                        all her shit.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I mean we’re 60— 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Hey, I’m 57.  

                                 DIANA 
                        And what’s the last thing we did 
                        that meant something??  

           She flashes the scrapbook at Bonnie. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I used to take chances. I was a 
                        maverick, a fucking spark plug. Now 
                        look at me. WHAT AM I DOING? 

           Bonnie comes over, sits next to Diana. 
                                 BONNIE 
                        You’re getting older, honey. 
                        Nothing wrong with that. At least 
                        you’re still in good shape.  

           She points at a picture of younger Diana. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        You’d probably kick her ass. 

           Bonnie gets up. Diana closes the book. A fuse has been lit. 

           INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE – DAY 

           Diana steps onto the shuttle. It’s totally full, not a seat 
           open. She leans against the wall and reads the map. 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.) 
                        Ma’am? Ma’am? 

           Diana finding her terminal on the map --  

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (O.S.) 
                        Excuse me, ma’am? 

           -- and now realizing the “Ma’am” is directed at her. She 
           looks over at the YOUNG WOMAN (20’s): 

                                 DIANA 
                        Me?  

                                 YOUNG WOMAN 
                        Hi, yes. Do you want my seat? 

           Diana’s confused. And then she gets it. Ouch. 

                                 DIANA 
                        No. I’m fine. Thanks. 

           The young woman just smiles at her -- “Good for you” -- and 
           goes back to her phone. Diana stares daggers at her. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                            (under her breath) 
                        Ma’am?? 

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           Diana in a one-piece bathing suit, swim cap and goggles. 
           Stands before an open lane in the big public pool, 
           stretching her arms and neck.  

           She checks the giant clock near the chairs: 5 PM.  
           Takes a deep breath and dives into the water.  

           CUT TO BLACK.  

           Still in darkness, we only HEAR the sound of sleeping 
           children. Then, footsteps down the hall, coming closer. 
           BOOM, door open, light flipped on and now -- 

           INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM – NIGHT 

           -- we’re close on a girl’s face, asleep in bed. DIANA, 6 
           years old. Florida, 1955.  

                                 MAN (O.S.) 
                            (Greek accent) 
                        Diana. Diana! Wake up.  

           A hand enters frame and shakes her shoulder. Her eyes 
           flutter open. She rubs them, looks at him.  

           ARIS NYAD, 30’s. Her father. Greek-Egyptian. Passionate, 
           intense, wildly handsome. Thick accent.  

                                 ARIS 
                        Happy birthday, darling. 

                                 DIANA 
                        What time is it? 

                                 ARIS 
                        Time to wake up! The moonlight on 
                        the ocean looks like a Rembrandt 
                        painting. I have to show you. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Now?  

                                 ARIS 
                        Right now.  

           Diana looks over at her younger BROTHER, 4, and SISTER, 3, 
           both still asleep. Aris waves them off.  

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                        They’re too young to know the 
                        difference. C’mon.   

           He pulls Diana out of bed, a little too hard. They turn to 
           find Diana’s mother LUCY, 28, standing in the doorway; half 
           asleep and confused. Lucy’s French, thick accent of her own. 

                                 LUCY 
                        Aris? What’re you doing?  
                                 ARIS 
                        It’s for Diana. Go back to sleep. 

                                 LUCY 
                        They have school tomorrow. 

                                 ARIS 
                        This is more important than school. 

           We can’t tell if he’s drunk or just excited. Either way a 
           little scary. He pushes Lucy aside and we CUT BACK TO:  

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           PRESENT. Diana bursts up and grabs the pool’s edge, taking a 
           big deep breath, like she’s been sprinting. Takes her a few 
           beats to calm down. She looks over, where --  

           The LIFEGUARD reels in the lane divider next to her.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Hey. Excuse me. I’m not done.  

                                 LIFEGUARD 
                        Sorry, the pool’s closing.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Why? It’s only— 

           Diana looks at the big CLOCK again. It’s 6 PM. Holy shit. 
           She notices there’s no one else in the pool.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        What the fuck? 

                                 LIFEGUARD 
                            (with a smile) 
                        You’ve been swimming for an hour.  

           Diana’s stunned; she isn’t tired at all. 

           INT. EQUINOX GYM – DAY 

           Bonnie rides a bike machine, newspaper in front of her, 
           phone pressed against her ear.  

                                 BONNIE (ON PHONE) 
                        D. It’s Bonnie.  

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           We find Diana in the same pool lane she was in before, but 
           this time there’s a big chalk board in front of it:  
           “Lane closed for private swim, 12 – 2 PM.”  

                                 BONNIE (V.O.) 
                        I’m at the gym. Where are you?  

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           New day, cloudier now. Lane closed again. Diana in a blue 
           swimsuit this time. Same chalk sign, but this time it reads: 

           “Lane closed for private swim, 12 – 5 PM.”  

                                 BONNIE (V.O.) 
                        At the gym. Again. WHERE THE FUCK 
                        ARE YOU?  

           We track Diana’s face underwater now, stroke after stroke, 
           determined, fluid motions.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - BAJA, MEXICO – DAY  

           Diana’s driving, arm out the window. Passes a sign for Baja.  

           Title card: 1 month later 

           EXT. BEACH - BAJA, MEXICO – DAY 

           Diana stands on the shore, swim gear on, stretching.  

           A Mexican teenager, PABLO, wades past her, going to his 
           small boat nearby. In Spanish, subtitled.  

                                 PABLO 
                        How many hours?  

                                 DIANA 
                        Eight hours.  

                                 PABLO 
                        Eight? Really? 

                                 DIANA 
                        I hope.  

           Pablo shrugs, “If you say so,” and climbs into his boat.  

           Diana steps deeper into the water, and we CUT TO: 

           EXT. FLORIDA BEACH – 1955 - NIGHT 

           Aris and Diana (6) stand on the shore watching the waves. 
           The moonlight is gorgeous over the water. Aris was right.  
                                 ARIS 
                        Six years I’ve been waiting till 
                        you’re ready to tell you this. 

           He removes a paperback Webster’s dictionary from his pocket 
           and hands it to her.  

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                        You will go to your school tomorrow 
                        and you will ask the other kids if 
                        their name is in the dictionary and 
                        they will say no. But you can say 
                        YES. Look up our name.  

           Diana sifts through the book, but it’s dark and she’s tired 
           and it’s taking her a minute. Aris rips it out of her hands.  

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                        C’mon! Here, look: Naiad. In Greek 
                        mythology, these were the nymphs 
                        that swam in the lakes and the 
                        rivers and oceans to protect for 
                        the Gods. And darling read this, 
                        the modern definition. Read it.  

                                 DIANA 
                            (reading, nervous) 
                        Girl or woman champion swimmer. 

           Aris pulls her into his hip, a sweet, but forceful embrace.  

                                 ARIS 
                        Happy birthday, darling. This is 
                        your destiny.  

           She looks up at her father, watching the waves, proud and 
           smiling. He has an idea. Looks down at her, excited: 

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                        Show me!  

                                 DIANA 
                        What?  

                                 ARIS  
                        That you’re a “Naiad”. C’mon! 

           He motions to the water. Intense eyes still on her. 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN – BAJA, MEXICO - DAY 

           PRESENT. Aerial shot looking down on Diana. She’s treading 
           water and shivering a bit.  
           The boat is stopped and Pablo is spreading a thick glob of 
           peanut butter on a cracker. He leans and hands it to her.  

                                 PABLO 
                        It’s okay?  

                                 DIANA 
                        Perfect. Thank you.  

                                 PABLO 
                        And you?  

           She’s cold and starving, and we CUT TO: 

           EXT. FLORIDA BEACH – 1955 - NIGHT 

           Aris motions to the water. Intense eyes still on Diana. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Now?  

                                 ARIS 
                        Yes, now. 

                                 DIANA 
                        But it’s cold. 

                                 ARIS 
                        It’s not that cold!  

           He grabs her hand and pulls her into the waves, laughing, 
           excited energy. Diana’s shaking. Doesn’t know whether to 
           laugh or cry. Too scared to pull back. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Dad... 

                                 ARIS 
                        C’mon, show me!  

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN – BAJA, MEXICO – DAY 

           PRESENT. Diana pops up out of the water, shaking, teeth 
           chattering. Pablo stops the boat.  

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s too cold. Too cold. I’m done.  

           She swims up to the side of the boat. Pablo has to help her 
           over and wraps a big towel around her.  

           She can barely move. Lets her head fall back, disappointed.  
           INT. MARINA CAFÉ – BAJA, MEXICO – LATER 

           A mariachi band plays in the corner of a large open room. 
           Diana sits alone, wrapped in towels and a blanket, sipping 
           hot tea, still trying to warm up.  

           Her hair’s a mess, eyes wrinkled, shoulders hunched over, 
           feeling and looking every bit like a woman in her sixties. 
           She stares at the ocean out the window, lost in thought.  

           EXT. POOL CLUB - LOS ANGELES – DAY 

           A mid-day pool party. About 40 people, mostly women. Diana 
           mingles, talking to everyone. She sees Bonnie come out.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        What is all this?  

                                 DIANA 
                        You’ll see.  

           EXT. POOL CLUB – LOS ANGELES – LATER 

           Diana stands in front of the pool addressing the crowd, 
           microphone in hand. Bonnie watches, nervous.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Last year I turned 60, and I was 
                        PISSED OFF.  
                            (the crowd laughs) 
                        I don’t want to be 60. I feel 
                        young, I feel powerful. And I know 
                        we have to move forward and we 
                        shouldn’t look back. But there are 
                        some things worth going back for.  

           Diana pauses. Her friends hang on every word.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Thirty two years ago, I tried to 
                        swim from Cuba to Florida and I 
                        failed. This time, I won’t.  

           An audible gasp goes through the crowd. Bonnie’s stunned.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        This summer, when I walk up on that 
                        beach, the whole world will see me 
                        and say, “Sixty IS the new forty!”  

           The crowd cheers and her friends whoop and high-five her. 
           Bonnie’s too surprised for that. She overhears a couple 
           women gossiping nearby:  
                                 WOMAN #1 
                        How far’s this swim? 

                                 WOMAN #2 
                        Like 100 miles. 

           Woman #1 gives her a “Are you fucking kidding me?” look. 

                                 WOMAN #2 (CONT’D) 
                        Yeah, she’s outta her mind. 

           EXT. POOL CLUB – LOS ANGELES – LATER 

           Party’s wrapping up now. Diana and Bonnie, alone in the 
           jacuzzi, sit across from each other; a stand off.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Why didn’t you tell me first? 

                                 DIANA 
                        I figured you’d talk me out of it. 
                        Tell me I was crazy. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You are goddamn crazy. No one has 
                        ever done this swim. Ever. You 
                        haven’t swum in 30 years and now 
                        you’re gonna do it?  

                                 DIANA 
                        I’ve been swimming almost every day 
                        the last two months.  

           Bonnie goes quiet, looks hurt; gives an indignant chuckle. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Sorry. I didn’t want to say 
                        anything until I was sure.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Sure of what? 

                                 DIANA 
                        That I could do this. I can do 
                        this, Bonnie. But not without you. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Bullshit. Yes you could.  

                                 DIANA 
                            (shrugs) 
                        Yeah. But I wouldn’t want to. Let’s 
                        do this. Together.  
           Bonnie thinks. She hasn’t seen Diana this excited about 
           anything in awhile.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        How?  

           INT. POOL GYMNASIUM – HUNTINGTON BEACH – DAY 

           Diana and Bonnie walk by a water polo practice, high school 
           boys splashing and whipping the ball around. 

           Diana spots the coach, 50’s and gives him a big hug.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie, Steve Munatones. 
                        International Swimming Hall of 
                        Fame. Long distance world champion. 
                        Marathon swim expert.  
                            (Bonnie shakes his hand)  
                        Steve, this is Bonnie Stoll, my 
                        head trainer.  

                                 STEVE 
                        Bonnie, yeah. Hell of a racquet 
                        baller, weren’t you?  

                                 BONNIE 
                        I ranked 5th in the U.S. Now tell 
                        her why she can’t do this. 

           Steve’s a bit taken aback. Diana’s used to it. 

                                 DIANA 
                        We’re just here to go over the new 
                        rules, not get his permission. 

                                 STEVE 
                        Well...now that she brings it up.  

           Now Diana looks at him, her smile fading.  

           INT. STEVE’S OFFICE – LATER 

           They sit in chairs across from Steve’s desk.  

                                 STEVE 
                        Of course you may do it. Assuming 
                        you can even get the visas from 
                        Cuba at this point, no one can stop 
                        you from actually trying. But 
                        things have changed since the 70’s. 
                        You’ve changed. Do you know what 
                        you’re going up against?  
                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah, I do.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        I don’t. Tell me.  

                                 STEVE 
                        103 miles. That’s five English 
                        Channels. All through an absolutely 
                        awful current and the most 
                        dangerous animals in the ocean. 
                        Sharks, sting rays, box jellies— 

                                 DIANA 
                        Box jellies aren’t in those waters.  

                                 STEVE 
                        They are now. Migrated in the last 
                        ten years for the warmer weather.  
                        They kill more people every year 
                        than shark bites. A good sting can 
                        cause hemorrhaging, cardiac arrest, 
                        paralysis; people die within 2 - 5 
                        minutes. They call that stretch the 
                        Havana graveyard. And you want to 
                        do it without a shark cage. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        That’s what I said. Why not just 
                        use a cage? 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s been done. The cage helps with 
                        drafting. But no one has ever done 
                        an open swim like this.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Why not pick a different place? 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s gotta be Cuba.  

           Bonnie shakes her head. Looks at Steve like “Help me.” 

                                 STEVE 
                        Okay, forget about the animals for 
                        a second. Only 116 people have ever 
                        swum over 24 hours straight. Only 
                        12 people over 48 hours. You’re 
                        talking about 60 to 70 hours.   

                                 DIANA 
                        I’ve done that before. 
                                 STEVE 
                        30 years ago. None of those people 
                        were over the age of 50. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Well. I will be.  

           INT. POOL GYMNASIUM – LATER 

           Diana kneels by the pool’s edge, talking with the water polo 
           team. She’s charismatic and the boys are eating it up.  

           Bonnie and Steve watch her from his office door.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        I’m with you. It’s a terrible idea. 
                        But could she do it? Honestly.   

                                 STEVE 
                        Honestly, I don’t think it’s 
                        humanly possible.  
                            (beat) 
                        But... 

                                 BONNIE 
                        But what? 

                                 STEVE 
                        It’s Diana.  

           Bonnie looks at Diana again. She has a ball now and stands 
           and launches it across the whole pool. The guys cheer.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah. She’s a tough mother. 

                                 STEVE 
                        She’ll need to be. Open water 
                        swimmers have to go to the edge. 
                        They always say that about 
                        athletes, but it normally just 
                        means to push yourself harder; jump 
                        high, run fast. It’s not life and 
                        death. This is. People have died 
                        from this. If she does it, I think 
                        she’ll have to come close.  

           Diana, clothes on, jumps into the pool and starts playing 
           with the guys. They’re clapping and hollering. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Goddamnit, D.  
           EXT. POOL GYMNASIUM – LATER 

           Diana, still wet, walks with Bonnie to her car.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        So Steve is pretty supportive.  

                                 DIANA 
                        He’s a friend. He’s just worried.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Well what the fuck am I? I’m not 
                        worried?  

                                 DIANA 
                        Then come with me. Train me. 
                        Nothing bad can happen if you’re 
                        watching me.  

                                 BONNIE 
                            (thinking it over) 
                        Diana, can you really do this?  

                                 DIANA 
                        I have to.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Why?  

           Diana ponders how to answer that. Turns away. Has an idea: 

                                 DIANA 
                        Come with me to Puerto Morelo for 
                        the next training swim. You don’t 
                        want to do it after that, fine.  

           Bonnie thinks. She can see Diana’s not budging. 

           EXT. PUERTO MORELO BEACH, MEXICO – DAY 

           Diana in her gear, walking with Bonnie to the shore--  

                                 DIANA 
                        Wherever you want me to go, I want 
                        you to square your shoulders and 
                        make a chopping motion like this, 
                        straight in that direction.  

           She shows Bonnie the motion.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        We said I was just watching today. 
                                 DIANA 
                        You are. I’ll stay next to the 
                        boat, you won’t have to do much. 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN – PUERTO MORELO – LATER 

           Diana swims, but she’s drifting far away from the boat. 
           Bonnie does the chopping motion like crazy.   

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana! Diana!! 

           Finally Diana stops and looks up at her. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Why’s the boat so far away from me? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You’re going too close to the reef!  

           Diana, frustrated, nods and keeps swimming. 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN – PUERTO MORELO – LATER 

           Again, Diana is at least 30 yards from the boat. 

                                 BONNIE  
                        Diana!  
                            (Diana looks up) 
                        You are too far away! Bring it in!  

           Diana slaps the water. Starts swimming for the boat. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I don’t know what’s happening. I’m 
                        right next to the boat and then I 
                        look up and I’m 40 yards out. 

           Bonnie holds a spoonful of peanut butter out for her. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah, we’ll have to work on that.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Just don’t get frustrated with me. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What’d you expect? You asked me to 
                        come, remember?  
                            (feeding Diana) 
                        Sorry. You’re doing great. Really.  
           EXT. OPEN OCEAN – PUERTO MORELO – LATER 

           Diana, now about 10 yards from the boat, in perfect rhythm. 
           Bonnie watches her, awed by the robot like consistency.  

           She checks the timer on her watch: 8 hours, 32 minutes.  

                                 BONNIE (V.O.) 
                        Today was the first time I saw you 
                        do what you were put on this earth 
                        to do. And that’s swim.  

           EXT. PUERTO MORELO BEACH – DUSK 

           They sit on the beach watching the sunset, Diana wrapped in 
           towels and Bonnie keeping her warm.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        But this is different, D. It’s 
                        gonna take everything you have. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I know. I’m ready for that. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        That’s what I’m worried about. 
                            (off Diana’s look) 
                        You’re not a kid anymore. Sometimes 
                        I think your heart is stronger than 
                        your body, and it’ll try to bring 
                        the rest of you where it’s just not 
                        supposed to go.  

           Diana opens her mouth protest. Stops. Looks at the ocean and 
           thinks. Then turns to Bonnie. 

                                 DIANA 
                        How many regrets have you had, your 
                        whole life?  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Ah don’t give me one of your 
                        motivational speeches. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie, listen. How many regrets? 
                        Hundreds? Thousands? 
                            (beat) 
                        I have one.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        This Cuba swim?? C’mon.  
                                 DIANA 
                        It’s not the swim. It’s about 
                        fighting. About being strong. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You are strong. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I wasn’t strong enough. I should’ve 
                        fought more. Done something.  

           Bonnie’s ready to argue back, but stops. Realizing... 

                                 BONNIE 
                        We’re not talking about the swim. 

           Diana smiles at her: No, they’re not.  

           And Bonnie’s got her answer. She leans her head against 
           Diana’s and looks at the water. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        This is gonna be a motherfucker. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I know. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Where do we start? 

           EXT. DIANA’S HOUSE, BACK PATIO – DAY 

           They’ve set up a big dry erase board and Bonnie stands in 
           front of it with a pen. Diana sits with a notebook.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Navigators, at least two. I read 
                        about one guy, David Marchant.  

           EXT. DAVID’S BOAT – DAY 

           We see DAVID, 40’s, steering his boat, navigating on the 
           radar screen. We recognize him from the cold open.  

           Title card: David Marchant, Head Navigator 

                                 DIANA (V.O.) 
                        Out of St. Maarten. Supposed to 
                        know the gulf better than anyone.  

           EXT. DIANA’S HOUSE, BACK PATIO – CONTINUOUS 

           Bonnie’s writing on the board.  
                                 DIANA 
                        Shark divers. That’s big. There’s 
                        an Australian guy, Luke something.  

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN – DAY 

           LUKE, 30, kayaking along the choppy water. 

           Title card: Luke Tipple, Marine Biologist, Shark Diver  

           He reaches into his kayak and throws fresh CHUM 10 yards 
           out. Within seconds there’s movement around him.  

                                 DIANA (V.O.) 
                        He’s got these Shark Shield 
                        devices. They produce a field of 
                        electricity at a certain pulse and 
                        it messes with the sharks’ sonar. I 
                        mean they hate these things. They 
                        swim away just like that. 

           A FIN pops up. Then another. They’re getting closer.  

                                 BONNIE (V.O.) 
                        Holy shit. It really works? 

                                 DIANA (V.O.) 
                        Every time. 

           Luke reaches underneath for the device and throws a switch.  

           Nothing.  

           The sharks move closer. Bloody chum surrounding him now. He 
           doesn’t flinch, just annoyed. Sharks closer... 

                                 LUKE  
                            (Aussie accent) 
                        C’mon you fucker. 

           He flips it again and this time we can hear a slight pulse 
           go through the water.  

           Every shark around him instantly disperses. He smiles. 

           EXT. DIANA’S HOUSE, BACK PATIO – CONTINUOUS

                        Just in case. I won’t need it. 

                                 BONNIE (V.O.) 
                        You fucking better not. What else? 

                                 DIANA (V.O.) 
                        Well we’ve gotta have Mark. 

           EXT. SANTA BARBARA – DAY 

           MARK, 50, rides a trek road bike through a narrow passage of 
           the Santa Barbara hills. We remember him from the open too. 

           Title card: Mark Sollinger, Chief of Operations 

           Mark keeps pedaling, sweating his ass off. He grabs a small 
           walkie talkie from the handle bar: 

                                 MARK (INTO WALKIE) 
                        How far back? 

           We pan over his shoulder and look down the mountain to see a 
           group of younger bikers a ways back. 

                                 MAN (FROM WALKIE) 
                        Quarter mile. Slow down, Mark. 

           Mark smiles. Speeds up. 

           EXT. DIANA’S HOUSE, BACK PATIO – CONTINUOUS

                        Damn. We’re up to...35 people. How 
                        much you think we need to raise?

                        Thousand? Dollars?? 
                                 DIANA 
                            (nonchalant)  
                        Yeah. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jesus. 

           And she writes it on the board. 

                                 DIANA 
                        We’ll get sponsors. I’ve got some 
                        contacts from the broadcasting 
                        days. We’ll get there. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Good. Don’t go broke on this. You 
                        know how you get. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I won’t. Whadya mean how I get? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Where’s your wallet? 

                                 DIANA 
                        In my bag. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Can I see it? 

           Diana sighs. Goes through her bag. Starts to panic. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Shit.  

           Bonnie reaches out of her own bag and throws it to her. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You left it on the goddamn counter 
                        at Jamba Juice. That’s how you get. 

           Diana frowns. Bonnie goes back to writing.  

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 

           Diana’s in the aisle seat, ice pouch on her left shoulder. 
           She looks somber, lost in thought. CUT TO: 

           INT. POOL GYMNASIUM, 1958 – DAY 

           A Swimmeet about to start. Diana, 9, stands at her lane, 
           other girls on each side of her. 
                                 SWIM JUDGE 
                        Swimmers, ready. 

           The girls get in their stances, focused on the water.  

           Diana turns her head to the side. Finds her mom Lucy on the 
           bleachers. Empty seat next to her. No Aris. 

           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP! –- the girls dive in, and we CUT TO: 

           INT. AIRPLANE – PRESENT - DAY 

           Diana’s watch beeps -- the alarm. She shuts it off. 

           There’s a bag of M&M’s on her tray table divided by colors. 
           She eats all the RED ones. Resets her watch.  

           A little BOY across the aisle from her is fascinated.  

                                 BOY 
                        What’re you doing? 

           Diana looks over at him. Treats him like an adult. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I divided the length of the flight 
                        by the total number of M&M’s. I’m 
                        eating them at intervals. My goal 
                        is to finish the last group by 
                        exactly the time we land.  

                                 BOY 
                        Why? 

                                 DIANA 
                        It helps my training. And to keep 
                        me calm. I think I have OCD. 

                                 BOY 
                        What’s that? 

                                 DIANA 
                        It means like thinking about 
                        something so much, you become 
                        obsessed about it. 

                                 BOY 
                        Is it bad?   

                                 DIANA 
                        I don’t know. It could be.  
                                 (more) 
                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        But I don’t know when wanting 
                        something so much became a bad 
                        thing. It’s good to want things. 
                        Isn’t it?   

           The boy thinks. He opens his own pack of SKITTLES and starts 
           to separate them by color too. Diana smiles. 

           EXT. ST. MAARTEN MARINA – DAY 

           Diana and Bonnie walk out on the dock towards a small boat. 
           In it, at the wheel is -- 

                                 DIANA 
                        David! Good morning. 

           DAVID MARCHANT gets off his boat to greet them.

           Diana swims through choppy water. Bad current today. Bonnie 
           talks to David while he steers. 

                                 DAVID 
                        What went wrong? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        In ’78? Biggest problem was the 
                        waves. Brutal whitecaps for 42 
                        hours. She couldn’t make it. How do 
                        we get around that? 

                                 DAVID 
                        We do our best to time the weather. 
                        And then we hope for the best. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Hope? We’re gonna have to do better 
                        than that. 

                                 DAVID 
                        Sorry, but the Florida Straight is 
                        pretty much the worst stretch of 
                        currents in the ocean. The Gulf, 
                        the cross-tides, the roiling 
                        eddies. Nature’s fighting her most 
                        of the way.  
           They watch Diana; she rolls onto her back for a minute and 
           stretches out her left shoulder, wincing. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D) 
                        And this.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        That shoulder’s been a problem for 
                        years. Ligament damage. 

                                 DAVID 
                        Well, we can’t stop for more than 
                        4, maybe 5 minutes at a time. Tops. 
                        She’s only swimming 2 miles an 
                        hour. We’ll get pushed off course, 
                        end up in the Bahamas. 

           Diana takes a deep breath and resumes swimming, slowly. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D) 
                        Would she— 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (already knows) 
                        No, she won’t. Has to be Cuba. 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – LATER 

           They’re stopped. Bonnie’s helping Diana get onto the boat. 
           She’s really struggling, totally exhausted. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Can you get your leg over? 

           Diana gingerly does. She can’t help drool when she says: 

                                 DIANA 
                        The other day. I had it left. 
                        Today. I’ve got nothing left. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Well c’mon, sit down. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Hold on. 

           She leans over the boat and pukes. And again. Salt water 
           pour out. She turns back around-- 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Okay. 

           --and sits down, spent. Bonnie wraps her in a towel.  
           EXT. DIANA’S HOTEL ROOM BALCONY – NIGHT 

           Bonnie brings a cup of tea out to her. They watch the ocean. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (cheer up) 
                        It was your first 12 hour.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I was sure I’m in good enough shape 
                        to do a 20-hour swim. I’m not.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Not yet. But you will be. 

                                 DIANA 
                        We’re 3 months out, Bonnie. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I know. 

           Beat. Diana’s decided something. 

                                 DIANA 
                        We’re going again tomorrow. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        No we’re not. One day’s rest. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie. We’re going tomorrow. 

           Bonnie rolls her eyes and goes inside. Diana sips her cup.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Thanks for the tea.  

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – DAY 

           Title card: 3 months to Cuba 

           Diana swimming through currents. She’s way too far from the 
           boat again. Bonnie’s air-chopping like crazy. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana! 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – NIGHT 

           Bonnie and David can’t see Diana in the darkness, only hear 
           the lapping of the water.  

           Title card: 12 hour swim, 89 days to Cuba 
                                 BONNIE 
                        Shit. I can’t even see her.  

           David looks, he can’t either. 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – DAY 

           Diana treading water, frustrated, 20 yards from the boat. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I don’t know what the problem is! 
                        If I can’t see you, I can’t— 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Listen! We’re swimming THIS way. 
                            (big arm motions) 
                        THIS way. Got it?? 

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – NIGHT 

           Diana’s in darkness again, but her swimcap now has the red 
           LED light on it.

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – DAY / NIGHT 

           Our TRAINING MONTAGE continues now. We see various shots of 
           Diana swimming all over St. Maarten, and we’ll cut each 
           scene after about two strokes.  

           Day, day, night, day, night, day, day, night; Diana looking 
           more comfortable every time.  

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / DAVID’S BOAT – DAY 

           Diana swimming, as graceful as we’ve ever seen her.  

           We pan around the boat to find it’s now FULL, about a dozen 
           people, including the guys we saw Bonnie and D assembling: 
           Dr. Michael, Mark Sollinger, Luke Tipple. 

           Title card: Last training swim, 24 hours, 1 month to Cuba 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Look at her. She could go on 
                        forever, just like that. 

           Mark’s looking at his watch: 

                                 MARK 
                        5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Last training swim 
                        completed! 
           The whole crew starts to clap and cheer: “Hell yeah, Diana!”  

           Diana stops swimming and rolls onto her back to catch her 
           breath. She peeks over at Bonnie and just nods slightly. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        She’s ready. 

           As the clapping and cheering continues, we CUT TO: 

           EXT. KEY WEST AIRPORT, FLORIDA – DAY 

           Diana and Bonnie exit the airport, luggage in each hand.

                        Hey Jenifer, it’s Diana again. 
                        We’re looking for 3 good days. 
                        What’re you seeing? 

           INT. CLARK HOUSE – SAME 

           On the other end of the phone, JENIFER, 40’s, studies a 
           satellite image of the Gulf on her computer.

                                 JENIFER 
                        She’s a tricky one. But right now 
                        this weekend is looking pretty 
                        calm. Low swells. 

                                 DIANA (V.O.)(PHONE) 
                        How low? I can deal with 1-foot 
                        waves. 3-feet is murder. I can’t 
                        make any progress in that. 

                                 JENIFER 
                        Hang on a sec. Dane?  

           Across the room, her husband DANE looks at his own computer. 
           Jenifer holds the phone out to him.

                        Water should be warm. Friday and 
                        Saturday look okay. May not be this 
                        good for awhile. But it’s a crap 
                        shoot at best.  
           INT. KEY WEST HOTEL ROOM – DAY (SAME) 

           Diana has them on speakerphone. Bonnie’s taking notes. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Okay. Thank you guys.  

           She hangs up. Looks out the window. Beautiful, sunny day. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        So? 

                                 DIANA 
                             (beat) 
                        I say we go for it. 

           Bonnie smiles. Claps.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Alright then. 

           EXT. VARIOUS CITY STREETS / AIRPORTS – DAY 

           Quick shots of the 35-person team assembling: crew members 
           race out of their houses and apartments, get in cabs, board 
           planes. We can feel a frenetic excitement.  

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – HAVANA HARBOR - DAY 

           Title card: Havana, Cuba 

           Cuban flags and salsa music playing on the boat. The crew 
           dances and pours mimosas. Diana toasts with a Gatorade.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I just want to thank all of you for 
                        the last few months, and for taking 
                        this journey with me. Let’s go and 
                        make history!  

           They all cheers! And off their clinking glasses, we CUT TO: 

           EXT. HAVANA HARBOR – NEXT DAY 

           The worst tropical storm Cuba has seen in years. Torrential 
           rain, wind, and roiling eddies, and we find--  

           INT. HAVANA HARBOR LODGE – SAME 

           Diana, with her crew, watching the awful weather outside.  

                                 MARK 
                        David? 
                                 DAVID 
                        It’s blowing 15 knots of wind. 6-
                        foot seas out there. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Let’s just wait for it to pass. Try 
                        again in a couple days. 

           Diana is heartbroken. Bonnie puts a hand on her shoulder. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        It’s only a couple days. 

           INT. DIANA’S HOTEL ROOM – DAWN 

           New morning. Diana throws the curtains open! And...it’s 
           still pouring rain.  

           EXT. HAVANA BEACH – DAY 

           New day. Diana stands on the shore. Heavy winds shake the 
           palm trees and whip her hair around. Ominous clouds above. 

           EXT. HAVANA POOL CLUB – DAY 

           New day. Raining again. Diana swims alone in a local pool.  

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – HAVANA HARBOR - DAY 

           And now sits alone, watching more rain pummel the ocean. She 
           closes her eyes and we CUT TO: 

           INT. DIANA’S BEDROOM, 1961 – NIGHT 

           Diana, 12, ear pressed against the door, listening for any 
           movement in the hallway. Doesn’t hear anything.  

           She opens the door slowly and peeks her head out. Nothing.  

           She can see the KITCHEN down the hall. CU on the WATER 
           FAUCET, dripping one slow drop at a time.  

           She holds a cup, licks her lips. Makes her way carefully 
           down the hall. Until –- 

           ARIS turns the corner in the kitchen, going for the fridge.  

           Diana freezes. Begins backing up slowly... 

           INT. DIANA’S HOTEL ROOM – PRESENT - DAWN 

           Diana wakes up in a panicked sweat. Jumps out of bed. 
           EXT. DAVID MARCHANT’S HOUSE – MORNING 

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! She pounds on the front door. Waits a 
           second. Knocks again. Finally the door opens: 

           A very tired, but not surprised, David Marchant holds his 
           iPad and turns it to show her. It’s a live weather MAP of 
           the Florida Straights, mostly highlighted in RED (danger). 

                                 DAVID 
                        Today was your last window. 

           Diana reads the map and her face falls. 

                                 DIANA 
                        How bad? 

                                 DAVID 
                        Water temperature dropped to 77 
                        degrees. Way below your threshold. 
                        That water, over that long...  

                                 DIANA 
                        Is it possible? 

                                 DAVID 
                        You’ll get hypothermia. 

           She knows he’s right. A sad beat, nothing to say. 

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – HAVANA HARBOR - DAY 

           Diana, Bonnie, David, Mark, and Luke Tipple are packing up 
           everything on the main boat. The others are somber; Diana is 
           pissed off, muttering, slamming gear into boxes. 

                                 DIANA 
                        This was our year! I got in better 
                        shape than my 20’s. I was ready. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You’ll be ready next year.

                        I can’t ask everyone to do this all 
                        over again, and just— 
                                 BONNIE 
                        I already did that. We all talked 
                        about it. Everyone’s in. 

           Diana finally stops, looks at Bonnie, then the others. 

                                 DIANA 
                        You are?  

           They all nod. Diana starts to cry, releasing all of it.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                            (through tears) 
                        Thank you. 

           The group hugs her. They’re in this together.

           Diana swims into frame and pulls up to grab the wall. She 
           rubs her left shoulder, wincing. It’s killing her.  

           INT. PRIVATE DOCTOR’S OFFICE – DAY 

           And now sits on the exam table of a beautiful, expensive 
           office. An older male DOCTOR shows her some x-rays.  

                                 DOCTOR 
                        Your shoulder has a tear in the 
                        biceps tendon, right here. I think 
                        you should stop for awhile. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I can’t stop. Cuba’s in 3 months. 

                                 DOCTOR 
                        Cuba? Diana. I think that’s out of 
                        the question. I don’t know how 
                        you’re even swimming laps on this. 
                        Doesn’t it hurt?  

                                 DIANA 
                        Like hell sometimes. So?  

                                 DOCTOR 
                        Lay down here. Show me your stroke. 

           Diana lays forward and pretends to swim. She winces. 
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D) 
                        It’s that angle right there. You 
                        could separate the whole tendon. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Well what can I do? 

                                 DOCTOR 
                        Don’t do the swim. Sorry. You’ll 
                        never make it on this shoulder. 

           Diana sits up, undeterred. Points at the x-rays. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Can I keep those? 

           INT. SMALL DOCTOR’S OFFICE – NEW DAY 

           She’s in a very different office now: half the size, half 
           the money. A plaque on the desk reads: Dr. Karen Sharma. 

           KAREN, the young Indian Doctor, examines Diana’s shoulder. 

                                 KAREN 
                        He’s right. The tear’s significant.  

                                 DIANA 
                        But can I still do it?  

           Karen almost answers. Stops. Thinks a beat.  

                                 KAREN 
                        Why’d you come to me? There’re 
                        plenty of...better known 
                        Orthopedists in L.A. 

                                 DIANA 
                        You swam in high school, right?  

                                 KAREN 
                        How did you— 

                                 DIANA 
                        And you grew up in Reseda. Anyone 
                        think you’d ever become a doctor?  

                                 KAREN 
                        I did. 

                                 DIANA 
                        That’s why I came to you. How can I 
                        do this swim on this shoulder? 
           Karen thinks. She grabs Diana’s arm and raises it at a 
           different, lower angle. 

                                 KAREN 
                        Does that hurt? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Not really. 

                                 KAREN 
                        So, change your stroke. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’ve had this stroke all my life. 
                        It’s what got me those records. 

                                 KAREN 
                        You asked how. This is how.  

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           Diana’s doing more laps, slower, trying out the new stroke. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.) 
                        There’s too much pressure on your 
                        AC tendon. Lower your shoulder, 
                        raise your elbow. 

           Diana reaches the wall and stops. Rotates her left shoulder 
           around a few times, stretching it out. 

                                 DIANA (V.O.) 
                        That’ll slow me down. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.) 
                        It’s not a race, right?  

           Diana takes a couple deep breaths and --  

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           -- swims on. New day, new stroke. Slow going at first. 

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           Diana swimming again, looking more comfortable, and she -- 

           EXT. ROSE BOWL AQUATICS CENTER, PASADENA, CA – DAY 

           -- reaches the wall and pops up to catch her breath. Takes 
           her goggles off, and sees-- 

           Bonnie, on her phone, running towards the pool.

                                 BONNIE  
                        I called you 10 times. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Training. What?? 

                                 BONNIE (INTO PHONE) 
                        Dane, tell her. 

           She presses a button, holds the phone out for Diana. 

                                 DANE CLARK (PHONE) 
                        I’m seeing a 3-4 day window here. 
                        Low winds, warm water.  

                                 DIANA 
                        How warm? 

                                 DANE CLARK (PHONE) 
                        High 80’s. Haven’t seen conditions 
                        this good in a long time. I say go. 

           Diana smiles big at Bonnie. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Thank you Dane!  

                                 DANE CLARK (PHONE) 
                        Good luck. 

           Bonnie hangs up. Grabs Diana’s towel. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Well hurry the fuck up and get 
                        outta there. 

           Diana slaps the water, giddy like a kid on Christmas.

           Diana and Bonnie walk to baggage claim and see Mark and 
           David and the rest of the team.  

           The others start clapping and whooping when they spot Diana. 
           She runs to them and jumps into a big group hug.  

           EXT. HEMINGWAY MARINA, HAVANA – DUSK 

           Diana sits with Bonnie in the backseat of a glorified golf 
           cart, driving towards the marina up ahead. We can see the 
           press there. Cuban and USA flags. About 100 onlookers.  

           Title card: August 7, 2011 

           Diana’s wearing a bathrobe and taking deep breaths. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You okay? 

                                 DIANA 
                        I can’t believe it’s finally 
                        happening. My adrenaline’s going 
                        into overdrive.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        You’re okay. C’mon. Breathe. 

           EXT. HEMINGWAY MARINA, HAVANA – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana’s POV now. They’ve reached the marina and she walks to 
           the edge of the water. Dozens of cameras pointed at her. 
           Time slows down. We hear her heartbeat like a drum. 
           She steps up on the embankment. Sees her CREW already out in 
           the water: 3 large boats, kayaks, pongas. They wave at her, 
           give thumbs up. 

           Out of POV now as Diana faces the crowd behind her. 

                                 DIANA 
                            (in Spanish) 
                        Thank you very much everyone. 

           The crowd claps and cheers. Some say “Gracias” back to her.  

           She puts on her swim cap, tucking all the hair in. Goggles 
           next, tight on the back, resting on her forehead. 

           Meanwhile, Bonnie’s greasing her down. Arms, legs, the 
           chafing spots on her one-piece swimsuit. Now applying heavy 
           duty chapstick all around her lips.  

           Finished, they stop and look at each other. Diana pulls her 
           into a tight hug and they stay there a long beat. 

           When they release, Bonnie gives a thumbs up to the boats. 
           They fire up their engines. 

           Diana pulls her goggles over her eyes. Shakes her arms out, 
           stretches out her neck a few times. A few deep breaths, 
           adrenaline racing again. This is it.  

           She steps to the edge, and jumps in. The crowd cheers. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (looking at her watch) 
                        Time in, 7:46 PM.  

           And watches as Diana makes a quick goggle adjustment, and 
           then -- starts to swim. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Here we go. 

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – HEMINGWAY MARINA – LATER 

           Diana’s going strong and steady. A kayaker flanks her on 
           each side, shark shields turned on. 

           Bonnie’s on the main boat with David, Mark, and 10 others.  

                                 BONNIE 
                            (beaming) 
                        She’s in the water. She’s actually 
                        in the fucking water! 
                                 DAVID 
                        Can you believe it Bonnie?! And 
                        what a night to leave on. 

           The water is glassy, no current at all.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s perfect. 

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – OPEN OCEAN – DAWN 

           Present. The sun’s coming up. Diana swims, same rhythm. 

           Bonnie watches her. Looks at her watch, writes in her 
           notebook: “12 hours in, 69 miles to go.”  

                                 DAVID 
                        I’m gonna have to sleep soon. 

                                 MARK 
                        She’s about to have a feeding. Why 
                        don’t you switch out with John? 
                        We’ll do a full rotation.  

                                 DAVID 
                        Can we wait a bit?  

                                 MARK 
                        Gotta be every 90 minutes. She’s 
                        burning like 700 calories an hour. 
                            (beat, nervous now) 
                        Why?  

                                 DAVID 
                        We’re okay, for now. But the 
                        current’s starting to push us. 

           Mark looks at the navigation screen. They’re veering just 
           slightly off course to the right. 

                                 MARK 
                        But we’re okay?  

                                 DAVID 
                        For now, yeah. 

           We move to the WATER now, and go tight on Diana’s face, 
           looking down into the darkness below, and CUT TO: 

           EXT. FT. LAUDERDALE BEACH – 1960 – DAY 

           Diana, 11, standing in the ocean next to her mom, Lucy.  
           Stark contract between them. Diana’s all sunshine and youth. 
           Something darker in Lucy. She points at the horizon.

                        Cuba. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Mom! You can’t see Cuba from here.  

                                 LUCY 
                        Yes you can. It’s so close you 
                        could almost swim there.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Really? 

                                 LUCY 
                        But nobody does.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Why not?  

           They hear LAUGHTER on the beach. Lucy sees ARIS talking with 
           two MEN. He’s animated and funny. The guys are loving it. 
           One gives Aris a business card. They shake hands.    

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Mom. Why not?   

                                 LUCY 
                            (beat, looking at Aris) 
                        Sometimes a thing can seem so close 
                        you could reach out and touch it. 
                        But you can’t. It’s farther away 
                        than it looks. 

           Diana just watches her mom, not understanding. 

           Suddenly a loud WHISTLE, and we’re BACK TO: 

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – OPEN OCEAN – MORNING 

           PRESENT. Bonnie’s on the whistle, signaling the crew. Diana 
           hears it. Slows up, wades over to the boat.  

                                 MARK (INTO WALKIE TALKIE) 
                        All boats stop. Feeding. 
           The crew cheers for her and yells encouragement, things like 
           “Good job, Diana!” and “Let’s do this!”  

           A HANDLER lowers a plastic bag, like an IV, into the water, 
           attached to a long rope, and reels it out to her. 

           Diana grabs it, eases onto her back, and hungrily puts the 
           feeding tube in her mouth. Pained look on her face. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You’re doing great. Great. 

                                 DIANA 
                        You don’t know what this is doing 
                        to my shoulder. I mean I feel like 
                        it’s gonna come out of the socket. 

           Bonnie turns back to the other handlers. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I need a bag of ice, and Tylenol. 

           The items come quickly. Diana puts the ice on her shoulder, 
           still feeding, and Bonnie drops 3 pills into her mouth.  

           Meanwhile David’s watching on nervously. 

                                 DAVID 
                        Mark... 

                                 MARK 
                        Yeah. Hey Bonnie... 

           He makes a motion to his watch, like “it’s time.”  

                                 BONNIE 
                            (to Diana) 
                        We’ve gotta keep going. You good? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Anybody could do it healthy, right?  

           She lets go of the feeding tube. Mark makes a big hand 
           motion to the other boats and they all start moving again. A 
           well oiled machine. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Right. Listen, this is gonna suck, 
                        no doubt about it. But you’ll get 
                        through it. You always do. 

           Diana looks at her and thinks about that. Pulls her goggles 
           over her eyes, dips her head under, and we CUT BACK TO:  
           EXT. FT. LAUDERDALE BEACH – 1960 – DAY 

           Lucy and Diana on the beach. 

                                 ARIS (O.S.) 
                        Hah!  

           Suddenly Aris is behind them, running into the water. Diana 
           jumps. He splashes them, playful.  

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                        C’mon you lazy asses, do something!   

           Diana chases him into the ocean, splashing and giggling, 
           leaving Lucy behind. They swim out a ways, past the break.  

           Aris stops when he sees a BUOY up ahead. Diana sees it too. 
           They share a quick look and the race is on!  

           Aris paddles like hell, early lead. But Diana’s stroke is 
           fast and steady and she catches up.  

           20 yards to go and she PASSES him. He makes a final push, 
           but she slaps the buoy, holding onto it, beaming. 

           When he gets there a few seconds later, he’s laughing. 

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                         Pretty good, darling. Pretty— 

           And he pulls her OFF the buoy and DUNKS her head in. She 
           comes up laughing. Splashes him. He laughs too, and then -- 

           Dunks her head under again. But this time holds it there.  

           And holds. And holds. She starts to thrash underwater.  

           Seconds go by like decades. Desperate thrashing -- 

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – OPEN OCEAN – DAY 

           PRESENT. Diana pops up out of the water, coughing. 

           Title card: Hour 15, 83 miles to go 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie...Bonnie... 

           Bonnie goes over to her. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Hey, hey. Calm down. 
                                 DIANA 
                        I can’t breathe.  
                            (wheeze) 
                        It’s making my muscles so weak.  
                            (wheeze) 
                        I can’t get enough oxygen. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay, relax. Swim over here, 
                        slowly. We’ll figure this out. 
                            (turns to a handler) 
                        Dr. Michael, hurry. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie...I don’t know... 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Hey, don’t talk, okay. Save your 
                        breath a minute. Just relax. 

           Mark watches on with David. 

                                 DAVID 
                        Oh boy. 

                                 MARK 
                        Fuck. 

           Dr. Michael appears at the boat’s edge with a snorkel and 
           flippers on. Jumps into the water and goes to Diana. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Michael. I’m having trouble. 
                        Catching my breath. Last 2 hours. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        It sounds like you’re having a 
                        little asthmatic attack. I’m gonna 
                        give you 4 pumps. 

           He puts an INHALER up to her lips. Bonnie turns to Mark:  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Asthma? Fucking asthma? I watched 
                        her do 10, 12, 15, 24 hour swims. 
                        She has never had an asthma attack. 

                                 MARK 
                        Hopefully it’s minor. 

           Diana rolls onto her back, feeling her chest, trying to 
           catch her breath. She looks up at the sky, scared. 
           EXT. FT. LAUDERDALE BEACH – 1960 – DAY 

           Finally Aris lets go and Diana bursts up, gasping for air. 
           She holds onto him, trying to catch her breath.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I wanna go in. 

                                 ARIS 
                        Why? We’re having fun. 

           She tries to pull away. He holds onto her, and we see --  

           His arm thrust forward as he reaches out underwater, between 
           her legs, and grabs her, hard.  

           Her body shakes. He keeps her there a minute, gripping her.  

                                 ARIS (CONT’D) 
                        Aren’t we having fun? 

           She’s frozen, terrified. What’s happening? 

           EXT. MAIN CREW BOAT – OPEN OCEAN – NIGHT 

           PRESENT. Diana looks lost, barely swimming through the 
           darkness. It’s quiet, most of the crew asleep. She feels 
           alone out here, helpless. 

           Title card: Hour 29, 57 miles to go 

           David talks quietly at the wheel with Mark and Bonnie. 

                                 DAVID 
                        We’re way off course.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Let’s get back on. 

                                 DAVID 
                        We can’t. Not at this speed. We’ve 
                        been letting her drift too long. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Well fuck David, that’s what we 
                        don’t want. 

                                 DAVID 
                        We don’t have a choice. Every time 
                        she stops, we’re drifting. We’ve 
                        been going east for 4, 5, maybe 6 
                        hours. She’s just going too slow. 
           Bonnie thinks, and decides: 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Until she can’t go anymore. Okay? 
                        Till she can’t go anymore. 

           They nod, somber. From the water they hear a heaving sound.  

           Bonnie goes back over. Diana’s treading water, vomiting. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jesus. Can we get a fluid pack? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie. I’m just barely alive right 
                        now. Barely alive. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I know. What do you wanna do?  

           Diana keeps treading. Shivering now, severe chills. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m sick and I’m cold. And I don’t 
                        wanna quit. But I have to get real. 
                        I have a tremendous will, but... 
                        I’ll never make it like this. It’s 
                        just too far. 

           Diana thinks. Keeps shivering. Looks around at her crew. 
           Everyone that’s awake is watching her, waiting. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I’m sorry. I just can’t anymore. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s okay. We love you. 
                            (turns to Mark) 
                        Help me get her out. 

           They pull her out and she starts crying. 

                                 DIANA  
                        I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. 

           Bonnie holds her. Mark wraps a towel around her. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Are you kidding? You’ve been sick 
                        15 hours. No one would’ve made it 
                        this far. 
                                 MARK 
                        You have nothing be sorry about, D. 

           The words are kind, but mean nothing to Diana. She weeps 
           like a baby, holding Bonnie’s arms.  

           INT. MAIN CREW BOAT – OPEN OCEAN – CONTINUOUS 

           Mark, David, and a couple other guys help carry Diana into 
           the boat’s hull and lay her down on a couch. 

           Dr. Michael quickly assembles an IV and puts it into her. 
           With more lighting now, we see how bad her condition is: 

           Face puffy from salt water, eyes and lips almost swollen 
           shut. Yellow skin from the vomiting and dehydration. She 
           looks absolutely awful. On the verge of passing out: 

                                 DIANA 
                        It was a beautiful dream. 

                                 MARK 
                        It still is. 

           And she closes her eyes.

                        An historic effort to be the first 
                        to swim from Cuba to Florida has 
                        ended early.

           Diana sits with Bonnie and some other crew. Mark’s got a 
           laptop open, reading comments. 
                                 MARK 
                        Look at this Facebook post: 61 year 
                        old Diana Nyad only made it half-
                        way from Cuba. I’m officially 
                        seizing my whining about being old. 

           The rest of the crew laughs. Mark smiles at her.  

           Diana is NOT fucking smiling. She leaves the room, slowly, 
           and walks out onto the deck alone. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (to Mark) 
                        She’s gotta grieve this and move 
                        on. Give her some time.

                                 DIANA 
                        I wanna try again. 

           Bonnie laughs. Looks up. Sees Diana smiling at her, serious. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        D. What the fuck? 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’ve failed first time out before. 
                        Manhattan, ’75, perfect example. I 
                        failed. Regrouped. Learned from 
                        that experience. And I went back 2 
                        weeks later and did it. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        That was 26 miles, and you were 25 
                        years old. Don’t you think this is 
                        different? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah. I’m stronger now. Wiser. It’s 
                        bullshit, Bonnie. People think 
                        sports is for the young. And yeah, 
                        the body’s a bitch sometimes. But 
                        what I wouldn’t give to put my mind 
                        now into that 25 year old.  
                            (points to her head) 
                        I’m stronger here. 
                            (points to her heart) 
                        And here.  
                                 BONNIE 
                        What about the other stuff we were 
                        gonna do this year? “After Cuba 
                        we’ll take that trip to New Zealand 
                        and we’ll start our company and” 
                        blah blah blah. 

                                 DIANA 
                        That’s still true. I want those 
                        things. I can’t see myself doing 
                        this whole thing for another year. 
                        But right now I’m in the best shape 
                        of my life. I feel more ready than 
                        last year, or even 6 weeks ago. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I think you’re stuck. And you’re 
                        not allowing yourself to grow or 
                        move on. It feels empty to me. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Well it doesn’t to me!  

           She said that a little too loud and the other diners look 
           over at them. Diana notices, calms down. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I wasn’t even sore when it was 
                        over, Bonnie. It was so beneath 
                        what I prepared myself for. And I 
                        know I have this in me. But we’ve 
                        gotta do it NOW. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Can you fundraise again that fast? 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m already half way there. And the 
                        other half... 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana, NO. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Oh c’mon. What else am I doing with 
                        my money? I don’t have kids, and I 
                        look ridiculous in heels. 

           Bonnie has to laugh.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay. But after this can we get on 
                        with our lives?  
                                 DIANA 
                        I promise. 

           EXT. HEMINGWAY MARINA, HAVANA – DAY 

           Diana, back on the embankment in Cuba. Bonnie greases her 
           down again. Less onlookers this time as last, but still a 
           crowd and a few local news cameras. Bonnie finishes.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s your time now. Go get it. 

           Diana takes a deep breath and jumps in, and we -- 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – NIGHT 

           -- find her again in the ocean, swimming in perfect rhythm, 
           a kayaker on each side of her.  

           Bonnie looks over at David, steering the main boat. He scans 
           the ocean, meets her eyes. 

                                 DAVID 
                        Water’s perfect. Couldn’t have done 
                        better than this. 
                            (Bonnie nods) 
                        Let’s just hope it holds for three 
                        days.  

           She gives him a nervous smile, and we start to remember this 
           scene now from the cold opening. 

           Title card: September 23, 2011, 8:12 pm 

           Mark writes in a small notebook: “Mile 5, glassy water, 
           freestyle.” And then: 

                                 DIANA (O.S.) 
                        Ooooow! Wow! Bonnie!  

           Bonnie’s eyes dart back to Diana, who has stopped swimming.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Is she stopping? Diana?? 

           We watch it all play out in QUICK CUTS this time: 

                                 DIANA 
                        Intense intense intense.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Stop the boat! Jon!  
           JON ROSE, 29, grabs a small towel and jumps in near Diana.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Fire fire fire!  

           Tentacles all over Diana’s neck and chest and forearm. Jon 
           wipes them off with the towel.   

                                 JON 
                        Shit, it just touched me.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Fire fire fire fire— 

           Diana’s body puts the full body suit on, but her eyes are 
           miles away, wide open and terrified. She mumbles incoherent.  

           Jon’s back on the boat now. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Do you know what it was? 

                                 JON 
                        Gotta be box jelly. It fucking 
                        hurts, BAD. 

           Bonnie watches Diana again, in enormous pain, still treading 
           water. She looks panicked, barely holding it together.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Do you want to get out?  

                                 DIANA 
                            (between deep breaths) 
                        NO! 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay. Keep breathing. Just breathe. 

           Diana rolls onto her back. We push in tight on her face. 
           It’s taking everything she has to cycle through this, and 
           she might not. Her eyes close, on the verge of passing out.   

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana? Diana?! 

                                 DIANA 
                        What!?! 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Just keep breathing! Stay there a 
                        minute, Dr. Michael’s coming. 
           Jon grabs a bottle of ammonia and douses his neck in it.  

                                 JON 
                        This is fucking crazy. Is she 
                        feeling what I’m feeling?  

                                 BONNIE 
                        What’re you feeling?  

                                 JON  
                        Like I’m being held over a goddamn 
                        bonfire.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jesus. Still? 

                                 JON 
                        Oh yeah. God she’s a tough cracker. 

           Diana leans forward, starts treading water again. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m ready. Let’s go. C’mon. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Are you sure? Why don’t you take a 
                        minute and catch your breath? 

                                 DIANA 
                        No c’mon, I wanna go now, power 
                        through it. C’mon!  

           It’s more desperate than tough. The crew gets in gear.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay, let’s go then. 

           Diana starts to swim and the boats chug along with her. 

                                 JON 
                        I don’t know how she’s not calling 
                        it. This is fucking intense. 

           Bonnie points her flashlight on Jon. We can already see red 
           burns all over his neck and shoulder, like whip scars. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Damn Jon. Are you okay? 

           He frantically puts more ammonia on his neck.  

                                 MARK (O.S.) 
                        Stopping! 
           Bonnie spins around. Diana’s not swimming; she’s treading 
           again, starting to hyperventilate. The boats stop. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana?? Shit. David get me closer.  

           David muscles the boat over, yard at a time. Finally they’re 
           feet from Diana and Bonnie shines a light on her. 

           Diana looks utterly terrified. She’s right near Bonnie’s 
           face, but stares past her the way a blind person would. 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s giving me the chills, 
                        paralyzing my back. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jon! It’s trying to paralyze her. 

           We see Jon’s sitting Indian style, rocking and trying to 
           breathe too. 

                                 JON 
                        I’m feeling the same thing. 
                            (breath) 
                        Freezing cold. Sweating. 

           Another crew member hurries over and wraps Jon in a towel. 
           Meanwhile Diana’s body goes through little convulsions. 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s...it’s my spine...and 
                        my...(indiscernible)...chills. 

           She’s barely making sense now. Her face is pure agony. It 
           really feels like we’re watching someone dying. 

           Bonnie tries to keep her grounded: 

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s okay, it’s okay, Jon is 
                        feeling the same thing. You’re both 
                        going through it. 

           A smaller boat speeds over with Dr. Michael. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Dr. Michael’s here, D. Hang on. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Michael! How long?? How long’s it 
                        gonna last? Hours? Hours?! 
                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Should be over in 15, 20 minutes.  

           Bonnie tries to help her get the pants of her swimsuit on.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Here, pull these on. Focus on this. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Luke! Think if I wear these I won’t 
                        get stung again? 

                                 LUKE 
                        It should protect you. 

                                 MARK 
                        Just take your time. 

           Diana’s pulling the pants on, crazed look still on her face, 
           eyes WIDE open. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Blink your eyes. 

           Diana has to really focus on it. Finally blinks her eyes. 

                                 MARK 
                        There ya go. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Good, D, good. 

           Silence for a beat as Diana keeps pulling. She finally looks 
           at Bonnie’s face for the first time. It’s hard for Bonnie to 
           watch; Diana looks like a scared child. 

           Dr. Michael puts an oxygen mask on Diana’s face. Moments 
           pass, her eyes closed. She’s calming down. 

           Her eyes open again; the worst of it gone. She nods. He 
           pulls the mask away. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Okay. I think I’m about ready. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You sure? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Don’t rush this, Diana. 

                                 DIANA 
                        No. I’m ready. 
           She takes a few more deep breaths. Swim pants on, long 
           sleeve lycra shirt, goggles down. Two more deep breaths and 
           she picks up her stroke. 

                                 JON 
                            (amazed) 
                        Holy shit. 

                                 MARK (INTO WALKIE) 
                        Diana is swimming.  

           The crew CHEERS around them and they can hear people on the 
           other 2 boats clapping in the distance. 

                                 JON 
                            (to Bonnie) 
                        How’d she do that? 

           Bonnie can only shrug and smile. As she turns back to watch 
           Diana’s perfect stroke, we CUT TO: 

           INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM – 1963 – DAY 

           That same stroke. Diana, 14 now, swimming through a pool, a 
           full body ahead of the other girls. It’s just practice, but 
           you wouldn’t know from looking at her.  

           A loud WHISTLE and all the swimmers stop and look at COACH 
           JACK NELSON, 30’s. Except Diana. She swims on, oblivious. 

           Nelson blows the whistle again, louder. She keeps swimming. 

           He moves to her lane and kneels down. Splashes the water and 
           finally her head pops up. She looks at him. 

                                 COACH NELSON 
                        What’s your name? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Diana.  

                                 COACH NELSON 
                        Come over here. 

           She swims to the edge. He looks down at her. 

                                 COACH NELSON (CONT’D) 
                        You know this is just warm ups, 
                        right? Try-outs start later. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I am just warming up. 
           Nelson smiles. Who is this kid?  

                                 COACH NELSON 
                        Diana, listen to me. Your stroke is 
                        good, really good. I can make it 
                        perfect. I can make you the best 
                        swimmer in the state, maybe the 
                        country. Is that what you want?  

           Diana smiles, nods yes.  

                                 COACH NELSON (CONT’D) 
                        Okay then. Deal. 

           He smiles back. Stands and moves on. She watches him a 
           minute, before slipping under the water. CUT BACK TO: 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – DAY 

           Diana’s swimming, back on track, fluid rhythm.  

                                 MARK 
                        David, how’s our course looking? 

                                 DAVID 
                        We’re okay. Little north-eastern 
                        drift while we were stopped, but we 
                        can correct it. 

                                 MARK 
                        So it didn’t kill us? 

                                 DAVID 
                        No. Not too bad. 

           They all nod at each other, little sigh of relief. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – LATER 

           Title card: Hour 21, 52 miles to go 

           Bonnie talks sotto with Mark and David at the wheel. There’s 
           a contained excitement we haven’t felt before, like ball 
           players trying not to jinx a pitcher during a no-hitter. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        We’re almost half way? 

                                 DAVID 
                        Since we left Cuba we’ve been going 
                        straight fucking north. We haven’t 
                        had to correct at all. 
                                 BONNIE 
                        So if she can get through 
                        tonight... 

                                 MARK 
                        If she keeps going like this, 
                        sometime tonight we’re gonna see 
                        lights down there. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Really? 

           Bonnie turns to watch Diana again, for the first time 
           believing this could really happen. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – DAY 

           Diana near the boat for another feeding. Bonnie next to her. 

           Title card: Hour 23, 47 miles to go 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You were so strong, D. We’re 
                        staying right on course. One goal 
                        now: the next stop. That’s all you 
                        wanna think about, okay? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah. Hey, when are we gonna put 
                        the full suit back on? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        When it starts to get dark. That 
                        suit slows you down. 

                                 DIANA 
                        No. Sooner. Jellyfish come at dusk. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay, we’ll do it at dusk.  

           Diana stops drinking, the pouch drained. Couple deep 
           breaths, rolls over, and starts swimming. 

           EXT. COACH NELSON’S HOUSE – 1963 – DAY 

           A team BBQ in Nelson’s backyard. He mans the grill. Diana 
           and the girls lounge by his pool. Parents mill about, chit 
           chatting. Lucy is there, talking to another mom. No Aris. 

           Diana approaches Nelson. She’s wearing a gold medal around 
           her neck. He points to the burgers. 
                                 COACH NELSON 
                        Which one you want? 

                                 DIANA 
                        That one. I’m hungry! 

           Nelson laughs. Puts it on her plate. 

                                 COACH NELSON 
                        Good. Hey, where’s your dad? 

           Diana looks down. Doesn’t know how to answer that. 

                                 COACH NELSON (CONT’D) 
                        I never see him at the meets 
                        either. 

           She shrugs. Nelson leaves it alone. Motions to her medal. 

                                 COACH NELSON (CONT’D) 
                        How long you gonna wear that?  

                                 DIANA 
                        You don’t think I should? 

                                 COACH NELSON 
                        Oh no, I want you to. And don’t let 
                        the other girls make you feel bad 
                        about it. I hope it makes them try 
                        even harder.  
                            (beat) 
                        You have a gift, Diana. Don’t ever 
                        apologize for it. 

           She looks at him with admiration; the father she never had. 
           And we CUT BACK TO: 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – DUSK 

           Diana swims, a beautiful sunset behind her.  

           Title card: Hour 26, 40 miles to go 

           Mark’s leading the crew in a chant. He yells, they clap and 
           yell back like a football game. 

                                 MARK

                        Onwards! (CLAP CLAP) 
           From Diana’s POV now, the team chants in the background. We 
           see the darkness underwater, nothing below.  

           EXT. COACH NELSON’S HOUSE – 1963 – DAY 

           Diana, 14, sits with her teammates around a big dinner table 
           playing cards. No adults around.  

           One girl puts a card out. Waits for Diana. 

                                 GIRL 
                        Diana, you’re up. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m kinda tired. Can I lay down for 
                        a bit? 

                                 GIRL 
                        Sure. You can go in my parent’s 
                        room. But we have to leave in a 
                        couple hours for the meet. 

           INT. NELSON BEDROOM – 1963 – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana enters the room and crashes onto the big bed.  

           INT. NELSON HOUSE / HALLWAY – 1963 – LATER 

           Coach Nelson opens the door to his bedroom and sees Diana, 
           asleep, on top of the bed. Watches her for a long beat.  

           He enters the room and locks the door behind him. 

           We stay in the hallway a minute and hear the other girls 
           downstairs playing cards. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – PRESENT - DUSK 

           Diana pulls up, hauling ass towards the boat. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana?? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Tentacles! Oh God! 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay come on over, come on over! 
                        Michael! It’s jellyfish.  

                                 MARK 
                        Shit. 
           The crew springs into action. Jon grabs a spray bottle of 
           ammonia. Dr. Michael opens a case and readies an Epi-pen. 

           As soon as Diana’s close enough to the boat, Jon starts 
           spraying her face with the ammonia. 

                                 JON 
                        Close your eyes. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Close ‘em, D. Close ‘em!  

                                 DIANA 
                        Wipe it off! Wipe it off! It’s up 
                        here! My eyes -- all over my face. 

           Jon jumps into the water and starts wiping with the towel. 
           She turns onto her back, in total agony again.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Oh my God, oh my God! The pain’s 
                        unbelievable! 

           She goes to touch her face— 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Don’t touch it! 

                                 JON 
                        Don’t let it win, we’re gonna win. 
                        Here comes an Epi. 

           Jon rolls Diana onto her side, still in the water, and Dr. 
           Michael injects the Epi-pen into her thigh. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Oh God, oh God! 

           Bonnie holds out the oxygen mask for Diana’s face. She tries 
           to breathe it for a second, then bats it away. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        It’s too painful, it’s too painful! 
                        I’m gonna get out and take care of 
                        it. It’s too much!  

           Jon looks up at Bonnie, stunned. Are they really going to 
           pull her out, now? They’re so close... 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana. Are you sure??  
                                 DIANA 
                        My face is on fire! It’s on FIRE! 
                        Please help me!  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Okay, let’s get her out. 

           They pull Diana onto the boat. Bonnie wraps a towel around 
           her. Diana shakes from the pain. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Oh my God, oh my God. 

           Another handler brings a water tube over to spray off 
           Diana’s face, but she starts choking on it. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Stop, stop! She can’t right now. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Oh my God, my face! It’s so 
                        painful! So painful. Oh my God. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        We’ve gotta move her, lay her down. 

           They lift and pull Diana onto the main hull and lay her 
           down. Wrap her whole body in towels. Dr. Michael puts the 
           oxygen mask over her mouth. 

           Her eyes close. Bonnie realizes she isn’t breathing. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You’ve gotta breathe, Diana. 
                            (nothing) 
                        Hey! Diana. Breathe. 

           Diana’s totally still. There’s no fog in the oxygen mask. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Shit. Hey! Diana!  
                            (nothing) 
                        Breathe out! Diana.  
                            (beat, nothing) 
                        Shit. Michael?? 

           Michael checks her pulse with a stethoscope.  

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        She’s breathing. Just not enough. 
                            (turns to Mark) 
                        Can you grab my kit?  
           Mark hurries off to get it. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        She’s down to 3 breaths a minute. 
                        We might need a tracheotomy. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You’re gonna cut a fucking hole in 
                        her throat?? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Only if we have to. 

           Bonnie looks down at her friend, unconscious now, dying 
           before her eyes. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        C’mon, D! Breathe goddamnit. 
                        Breathe in!  

           Dr. Michael removes the oxygen mask for a second and feels 
           under her nose. Shakes his head.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Diana! Blow it out! Blow it out!  

           Mark rushes back to them with Michael’s kit. Michael pops it 
           open and readies the antiseptic and glistening SCALPAL.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Ah fuck. No no no no... 

           Suddenly, a tremor goes through Diana’s body. Then another. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        D? Wake up!  

           Another tremor.  

           And then... 

           Her eyes flutter open. The mask begins to fog. She’s 
           breathing again. The crew finally exhales and looks at each 
           other like “Fuck that was close.” 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Oh thank God. Breathe in!  

           Diana does, finally, a long deep breath. 
                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Good, Diana, just like that.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Keep breathing. Hey! Don’t go to 
                        sleep. Eyes open. Good. 

           Diana takes a few more breaths. Notices the scalpel in 
           Michael’s hand. Pulls her mask off. 

                                 DIANA 
                        What the fuck is that for? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Oh. Nothing. 

           He puts the scalpel back and closes his case. The other guys 
           smile at each other, finally relaxing. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Hey, you gotta keep breathing. In, 
                        and out. Good. 

           Bonnie breathes with her like that for a moment. Then-- 

                                 DIANA 
                        Did David mark the coordinates? 
                        Where you pulled me out? 

           Bonnie scans her face, like “Where you going with this?” 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah... 

                                 DIANA 
                        What can I wear? When I go back in. 

           Mark and Bonnie look at each other. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana... 

                                 DIANA 
                        A mask with slits in it so I can 
                        see, and breathe. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana... 

                                 DIANA 
                        Tell David to turn around. We’re 
                        going back. 
           Bonnie stares at her friend, trying to will her to be 
           reasonable. Diana just looks up into the night sky and 
           doesn’t waver one bit. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

                                 DAVID 
                        We should be there in about 20 
                        minutes. She’s really doing this? 

           Bonnie just gives him a sad nod.  

                                 DAVID 
                        I just...(sotto) what’s the point? 
                        We already took her out. Doesn’t 
                        that break the rules? 

                                 MARK 
                        It did when it was a “continuous” 
                        swim. Now it’d be a “staged” swim.  
                        You’re allowed to start again from 
                        your last longitude and latitude.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Michael?  

           Dr. Michael joins them, leaves Diana with Jon. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        How is she? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        She’s stable. Heart rate’s good, 
                        breathing’s fine. It’s really gonna 
                        be up to her. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What about the box jellies? What if 
                        she gets hit again? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        We really, really don’t want that. 

           Bonnie sees Diana sitting up and taking the towels off.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Fuck me, she’s getting up. I 
                        thought she was dead. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           A handler is cutting slits into a black-white-grey lycra cap 
           so Diana can wear it as a mask.  
           They help her pull the mask on and use duct tape to lock it 
           onto her suit. 

           Diana straps her goggles on over the slits. It’s rough, but 
           the only exposed part of her body now is her mouth. 

           She gets ready to jump in. Bonnie stops her, quietly: 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana. The swim won’t count. You 
                        don’t have to do this. 

           Diana hears her. Pauses for a second. Jumps in the water. 

           The whole crew cheers! Jon stands with Bonnie, astonished. 

                                 JON 
                        She’s uh...I mean...I’m 6’2, 220 
                        and those fuckers put me down. 
                        She’s something else. 

           And Diana starts to swim again, same fluid stroke. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – NIGHT 

           Bonnie stands with David. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        How we looking? 

                                 DAVID 
                        Not good. It’s just too slow, the 
                        current’s starting to push us east 
                        towards the Bahamas. It’s making it 
                        impossible to stay north. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        But she still has a chance, right? 
                            (nothing from David) 
                        Is there any chance? 

           David looks at this screen again, then at Bonnie. He doesn’t 
           say anything. He doesn’t have to. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – DAWN 

           Boats stopped. Diana’s near the boat with Bonnie. 

           Title card: Hour 37, 47 miles to go 

                                 DIANA 
                        Are we even close? 
                                 BONNIE 
                            (beat, this will hurt) 
                        I don’t know if we’ll be able to 
                        make it to Florida this way. I 
                        don’t know, D. Because you’re 
                        swimming only 40% of the time. So 
                        60% of the time we’re being pushed 
                        into the Bahamas. Cause you’re not 
                        capable right now of swimming the 
                        way I know you can. 

           Diana locks eyes with her. We’ve never seen Diana this 
           desperate. It feels like the breaking point. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m really struggling here. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Look at the horizon. Sun’s coming 
                        up now, you’re gonna be warm. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I gotta keep swimming, it’s too 
                        cold. Too cold. 

           She starts swimming again. Bonnie nods to Mark. He walkies 
           the boats and they rumble on to follow. 

           The whole crew watches Diana with a mix of reverie and 
           sadness. All we hear is the lapping of her arms.  

           Bonnie goes to Mark; he’s watching Diana and quietly crying. 
           She gives him a hard hug. They know it’s over. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – DAY 

           Bright sun, hot now. Boats are stopped.  

           Diana’s holding onto the ledge and talking to her main crew. 
           She looks exhausted, swollen, puffy face again.  

           Title card: Hour 40. With ocean current: 90 miles swam. 

                                 DIANA 
                            (to Mark) 
                        What’s your opinion? 

                                 MARK 
                        This is my concern: if you get 
                        stung again, it’s gonna be BAD. And 
                        as your friend, I do not wanna see 
                        you go through that. 
           Diana thinks for a minute. Looks up at David. 

                                 DIANA 
                        There’s no place reachable by the 
                        morning? Tomorrow?? 

           David shakes his head, “No.” 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        24 hours? 

                                 DAVID 
                        At this pace...it’s at least 
                        another 48. 

                                 DIANA 
                            (to Bonnie) 
                        What’s your opinion? 

           Bonnie almost laughs. Looks away, then back at Diana. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        My opinion...I know you want this. 
                        We all do. And there’s nobody in 
                        the world that could possibly do 
                        this except you...but... 
                            (choking back tears) 
                        I watched you almost die last 
                        night. I really did. And I don’t 
                        think I can do that again. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I hate those fucking box jellies! 
                        This whole thing has nothing to do 
                        with them, and they brought me 
                        down. They did. 

                                 MARK 
                        They bring every swimmer down, D. 
                        They bring Navy Seals down. 

           Diana thinks about that a minute. Waves lap up behind her. 

                                 DIANA 
                        You know the difference for me 
                        though? This is it. It really is. 
                        My age and the other stuff I wanna 
                        do in my life. Other people can 
                        quit, but they’re younger and 
                        they’re gonna do more swims. 
                            (beat, closes her eyes) 
                        It’s a big dream to let go of. 
           Diana opens her eyes and looks at them. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I’m not gonna make it to Florida, 
                        am I? 

           They all shake their heads; no, she isn’t. Diana nods, 
           accepting it.  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana has pulled herself halfway onto the front of one of 
           the kayaks. She addresses the whole crew. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Can you all hear me? 

                                 CREW 
                        YES! 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s been a long dream of mine. 33 
                        years. And this is the end for me.  
                            (beat, regrouping) 
                        Thank you all for doing this with 
                        me. I couldn’t have made it even 
                        this far without you.  

           The crew cheers and claps for her. Some are crying.  

                                 VARIOUS CREW 
                        We love you, Diana!  

                                 DIANA 
                            (to herself) 
                        This is the end. 

           INT. TAXI – NIGHT 

           Diana -- hair a mess, gauze covering her fresh sting wounds 
           -- rides in back with Bonnie. It’s quiet and tense.  

                                 DIANA 
                        You know what? It pisses me off. 

           Bonnie bites her lip. For now. Looks out the window. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        That you would work so hard for 
                        something, and really prepare for 
                        it, and have this be the reason you 
                        can’t make it? 
                                 BONNIE 
                        Stop. Just stop.  
                            (Diana looks at her) 
                        What about the rest of us? We’ve 
                        been with you the whole way. 
                        What’re we supposed to take away 
                        from the last 2 years if you’re 
                        just gonna be bitter and angry?  

                                 DIANA 
                        How else am I supposed to feel? I 
                        failed, Bonnie. Again. With the 
                        whole world watching.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Do you really care what CNN or ABC 
                        or anyone else thinks?! No, you 
                        don’t. This is about you and you’re 
                        shit. I know that. But can you let 
                        us have our own feelings about it? 
                        Can’t it be about the journey, not 
                        the destination?  
                            (beat) 
                        I don’t regret a minute of it. I 
                        wish you wouldn’t either. It was an 
                        adventure, and now we can move on. 

           Diana turns away. Stares out the window. It’s raining. The 
           car drives on in silence. 

           INT. DIANA’S HOUSE / GARAGE – DAY 

           Diana’s pulling every piece of swimming equipment she has, 
           throwing it into a big hefty bag. Over this, we hear: 

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
                        In other news, marathon swimmer 
                        Diana Nyad failed for the 3rd time 
                        to swim from Cuba to Florida. 

           Diana pulls the last piece of gear and throws it in. Checks 
           to make sure there’s nothing else. 

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
                        The 62 year old conceded that this 
                        was her final attempt at the record 
                        breaking swim, and at this time has 
                        no plans to try again. 

           Finished, she ties up the bag and lugs it out to the trash 
           bins on the side of her house. Opens one and dumps it in. 
           INT. DIANA’S HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana comes inside to hear her phone ringing. She answers: 

                                 DIANA 
                        Hello? (beat) Okay. 
                            (listening) 
                        Really? 

           INT. TED TALK OFFICES – LONG BEACH, CA – DAY 

           Diana waits in the office lobby, a giant red TED TALK sign 
           on the main reception desk.  

           She scans the framed pictures on the wall of past Ted Talk 
           speakers: Bill Clinton, Jane Goodall, Al Gore, Bill Gates. 

                                 ROXANNE (O.S.) 
                        Ms. Nyad? 

           Diana turns to see a young woman; jeans and a blazer. Looks 
           smart and eternally busy. She greets her with a handshake. 

                                 ROXANNE (CONT’D) 
                        I’m Roxanne. Producer for the Ted 
                        Med conference. Thanks for coming. 

           INT. TED TALK / ROXANNE’S OFFICE – CONTINUOUS 

           They sit and talk at Roxanne’s desk. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I love the conferences. I just 
                        don’t belong up there.  

                                 ROXANNE 
                        Why would you say that? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Ted Talk people have accomplished 
                        things. Or have amazing facts and 
                        analysis. It’s inspiring.  

                                 ROXANNE 
                        True. That’s why we called you. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I failed. Three times. What’s my 
                        topic? “How to Fail, with Diana 
                        Nyad.” 

           Roxanne laughs a little.  
                                 ROXANNE 
                        You didn’t make it to Florida. So 
                        what?  

                                 DIANA 
                        So that was the point of the whole 
                        goddamn thing.  

                                 ROXANNE 
                        Was it? Or was it about having a 
                        clear goal, and never relenting, no 
                        matter the challenges or your age 
                        or the distance?  
                            (beat) 
                        My mom is 65. She just retired. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Good for her. 

                                 ROXANNE 
                        No, it sucks. She’s bored and 
                        passionless. Every time I talk to 
                        her now it’s all about me. I ask 
                        her about herself, her life. “What 
                        did you do this weekend, Mom?” She 
                        has nothing. I love her. But people 
                        stop trying. You didn’t. Yes, you 
                        failed. A lot. But you succeeded 
                        too. You lived the last 2 years to 
                        the fullest, every minute focused 
                        on that goal, on that journey. Who 
                        cares about the destination?  
                            (beat) 
                        You do belong up there. We’d be 
                        honored to have you. 

           Diana looks at her, considering everything, and now --  

           INT. TED MED CONFERENCE – AUDITORIUM – DAY 

           -- stands on a grand stage before 500 people. Wireless mic 
           on her business suit as she addresses them, mid speech. 

           Title card: TedMed Conference. October 2011. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m glad I lived those 2 years of 
                        my life that way. When you live 
                        with that kind of passion, there's 
                        no time for regrets, you're just 
                        moving forward. And I want to thank 
                        Bonnie. Bonnie, where are you? 
           Diana shields her eyes from the spotlight and scans the 
           crowd and after a minute finds BONNIE -- sure enough, she’s 
           there -- in the 10th row. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        There she is. Bonnie Stoll. My head 
                        trainer. My best friend. 

           The crowd claps. Bonnie’s embarrassed by the attention. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        She’s been saying this is about the 
                        journey, not the destination. Lotta 
                        people have been saying that. And 
                        so my goal now is to find some sort 
                        of grace in this defeat. To look at 
                        the journey, not just the 
                        destination. To feel proud of what 
                        we tried to do.  

           Applause from the crowd. Diana nods, “Thank You.”  

           Then, she goes quiet. Looks at the words on a TELEPROMPTER 
           by the main camera: “I want to live every day of the rest of 
           my life that way.” But she doesn’t say them. 

           A long beat passes. People start to look at each other. 

           Finally Diana looks up at them, excited now, off script. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        But there’s a difference. If cancer 
                        has won, if there's death and we 
                        have no choice, then grace and 
                        acceptance are necessary. But that 
                        ocean’s still out there. 

           We CUT TO Bonnie in her seat, realizing what’s happening. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (to herself) 
                        Oh shit. 

                                 DIANA 
                        This hope is still alive. And I 
                        don't want to be the crazy woman 
                        who does it for years and years and 
                        years, and tries and fails and 
                        tries and fails. But I can swim 
                        from Cuba to Florida. And I will 
                        swim from Cuba to Florida. 
           The crowd goes wild, clapping and whistling. All except for 
           Bonnie, who just looks sad.  

           EXT. TED CONFERENCE AUDITORIUM – LATER 

           Bonnie exits outside, Diana 10 yards behind her. Lot of 
           people out here and some try to stop Diana (“Great 
           speech!”). She’s darts through them. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie. 

           Bonnie keeps walking, shaking her head -- 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Bonnie! I know where you live, 
                        dummy. Just stop. 

           -- and finally spins around on her: 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What? What do you want from me?  

                                 DIANA 
                        I want you with me again. One more 
                        time. Just one more, that’s it. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You said that last time. You 
                        promised me. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I know. But we’ve learned so much, 
                        and I think we—  

                                 BONNIE 
                        You haven’t learned shit. You’re 
                        not doing this to move on from the 
                        past. You’re scared to death of the 
                        future. If you actually succeed, 
                        you don’t know what comes next. And 
                        that terrifies you.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I don’t think I’m stuck the way you 
                        do. I’m trying to move forward.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        No, Diana, you’re not. You’re 
                        trying to fix something that 
                        happened 50 years ago, and you’re 
                        thinking this swim is gonna do 
                        that. What if it doesn’t?  
           That shuts Diana up. They’re face to face now. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Yes, terrible things happened to 
                        you. Could you have done more? 
                        Maybe. But you didn’t fail! It 
                        wasn’t your fault! And I can’t keep 
                        watching you punish yourself for 
                        something you didn’t do.  

                                 DIANA 
                        What’re you so afraid of? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        That you’re gonna die! Literally. 
                        That this swim is gonna kill you. 
                        Is that what you want?  

           Diana stops. Takes a beat.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Yes, those things happened. I was 
                        raped, and abused, and I’ve spent 
                        my whole life filled with that 
                        rage. It has defined me. Not the 
                        swims or speeches or TV shows. And 
                        I don’t want it anymore. I don’t 
                        want that to be who I am. Not Diana 
                        Nyad: victim. Diana Nyad: champion. 
                        I want that to be who I am.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        You already won. Don’t you get it? 
                        You showed what you’re made of.  

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s not enough. I tried, Bonnie. 
                        But this isn’t about the journey for 
                        me. It’s about the destination.  

           Bonnie’s almost crying. She can’t look at Diana. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Well then I hope you get there. But 
                        it’ll have to be without me. 

           Bonnie walks away, leaving Diana alone, lost in the crowd. 

           INT. DIANA’S HOUSE – DAY 

           Diana on the phone, pacing around her kitchen. 
                                 DIANA 
                        Sue! Hey, Diana Nyad.  
                            (listening) 
                        Yeah, tough break in August. But 
                        we’ll get ‘em next time!  
                            (listening, laughs) 
                        Yep, exactly. That’s why I called 
                        actually. Secret’s been such a 
                        loyal sponsor-- 

           CUT TO: Diana still on the phone, living room now, another 
           SPONSOR on the other end. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Oh good, you saw the Ted speech? 
                        Well I’m glad you liked it.  
                            (listening) 
                        Yeah well you guys have been so 
                        helpful throughout this whole 
                        thing. So supportive.  
                            (listening) 
                        Exactly, that’s all I need. One 
                        more time. 

           CUT TO: Diana on her patio now. Same phone, new person-- 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        One more time. 

           In her BEDROOM NOW -- 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        One more time. 

           And now we stay here, as something on TV catches her eye. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Right. Thanks again.  

           She hangs up and turns the volume up on the TV. It’s a CNN 
           news report: 

                                 CNN ANCHOR 
                        Penny Palfrey, 49, was trying to 
                        become the first person to do the 
                        Cuba to Florida swim without a 
                        shark cage. But after 41 hours and 
                        only 26 miles to go, Palfrey had to 
                        abandon the swim and call it quits, 
                        as the strong gulf currents pushed 
                        them too far east. 

           The story continues in the background. Diana dials again. 
                                 DIANA  
                            (beat, into phone) 
                        Are you watching this? 

                                 BONNIE (O.S.) 
                        Watching what? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Penny Palfrey on CNN. She tried the 
                        Cuba swim this weekend. 

                                 BONNIE (O.S.) 
                        Oh. No, I’m not. 

           INT. FITNESS ROOM / BONNIE’S HOUSE – SAME 

           We find Bonnie on her treadmill, phone to ear, small TV in 
           front of her. She IS watching the story on CNN, on mute. 

           INTERCUT between the two: 

                                 DIANA 
                        She couldn’t do it. Made it 41 
                        hours though. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I can’t tell if you’re disappointed 
                        or happy. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Me neither. 
                            (beat) 
                        We’re 6 weeks out. All the sponsors 
                        came back. The Ted thing helped. 

           A long, silent beat. Neither sure what to say. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        Bonnie? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I’d tell you to be careful, but I 
                        know you won’t. So. Good luck. 

           Diana nods, heartbroken, but too proud to show it. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Thanks. 

           INT. MIAMI AIRPORT – DAY 

           Mark greets Diana at baggage claim. They hug. He takes the 
           small bag off her shoulder and they head for the exit. 
                                 DIANA 
                        Thanks again, Papa. 

                                 MARK 
                        You’re lucky I’m as crazy as you 
                        are. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Fourth time’s the charm, right? 

                                 MARK 
                            (he stops) 
                        Wait, where’s Bonnie? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie’s not coming. 
                            (off his look) 
                        We’ll be fine, we don’t need her.  

           She smiles, going for nonchalant, and keeps walking. 

                                 MARK 
                        Hey. Where’s your suitcase? The 
                        rest of your gear? 

           She stops, embarrassed. Heads back to the carousel. As she 
           passes Mark: 

                                 DIANA 
                        We’ll be fine. 

           EXT. HAVANA HARBOR – CUBA – DAY 

           Diana stands on the same embankment as the last two tries. 
           Even less of a crowd than before. Only one cameraman. 

           Title card: August 18, 2012 

           Diana finishes greasing her own legs down. Puts the heavy 
           chapstick on. Cap on, goggles down. Pauses. No one to hug. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA – MAIN BOAT – NIGHT 

           And the weather is awful. Thunder, lightening, torrential 
           downpour. Diana struggling through 4-foot swells.  

           Title card: Hour 51, 33 miles to go 

           There’s a frenetic panic on the boat, rocking hard back and 
           forth, crew members passing out life vests, and Mark’s at 
           the center of all of it. 
                                 LUKE TIPPLE 
                        So far we spotted a hammerhead and 
                        at least 2 white tips.  

                                 MARK 
                        What about the Shark Shields? 

                                 LUKE TIPPLE 
                        They’re holding for now, but the 
                        eddies throw off the signal a bit.  
                            (beat) 
                        I think we should get her out. 

                                 MARK 
                        That won’t stop her. 

           A huge CRACK of lightening spooks the whole crew. It’s 
           getting closer. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        What about the kayakers? They’re 
                        out there unprotected. What if they 
                        get struck? It’s not safe anymore!  

           Another big BURST of lightening. Mark nods, knows they’re 
           right. He walks over to the edge with a megaphone. 

                                 MARK 
                        Diana! Diana!! 

           She stops and swims over, treading through the swells.  

           We see the face mask they’ve rigged has covered every part 
           of Diana’s head -- except her mouth, which looks horrendous, 
           all red and swollen from stings. It slurs her speech. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D) 
                        I’m sorry, D. I really am. But 
                        we’ve gotta call it. 

                                 DIANA 
                        What? Why?!  

                                 MARK 
                        There are 3 sharks that we know 
                        about circling below you-- 

                                 DIANA 
                        Fuck the sharks!  

                                 MARK 
                        You’ve been stung on the mouth-- 
                                 DIANA 
                        I can handle it! We’re so close!  

                                 MARK 
                        Someone’s gonna die out here! 
                        Goddamnit, Diana! We timed the 
                        lightening. It’s within a quarter 
                        mile. We can’t risk their lives. 

                                 DIANA 
                        So pull the kayakers. I’ll swim 
                        without ‘em. 

           The crew looks at Diana with pity; they can see and feel how 
           desperate she is. It’s hard to watch.  

                                 MARK 
                        No. I’m not risking your life 
                        either. I’m sorry, D, it’s over. 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s not your call! 

                                 MARK 
                        It IS my call. You made it my call 
                        when you hired me. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Well then you’re fired!  

           And Diana treads away and starts swimming again.  

           Mark watches her for a beat, dumbfounded. The crew watches 
           him. What’s he gonna do? He turns to Luke. 

                                 MARK 
                        Help me on this? 

           Luke nods. Mark jumps into the water. Luke follows and they 
           swim after Diana. CUT TO: 

           UNDERWATER, looking up at Diana’s desperate face as she 
           swims on. Splashing around her, and then ARMS grab her. 

           BACK OUT now as Mark and Luke pull Diana towards the boat. 
           She’s kicking and crying and screaming like a toddler. 

                                 DIANA 
                        No! Let me go! Let me go!  
                            (losing energy) 
                        I have to finish! I have to finish. 
                        I have to... 
           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA – MAIN BOAT – DAWN 

           Diana, dry now, still wrapped in towels, sits on the boat’s 
           edge watching the sunrise. The rain has stopped. It’s quiet. 
           No one knows what to say. 

           Mark walks behind Diana, carrying a few life vests.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Mark. 

           He stops and looks down at her. Sees that she’s crying. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I’m...I just... 

                                 MARK 
                        I know. It’s okay. 

           She smiles at him, grateful, and he moves on. 

           EXT. PASADENA CAFÉ – DAY 

           Title card: 3 months later 

           Diana joins a patio table with Mark and Steve Munatones, and 
           hugs them both. She’s excited. They are not. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Good to see you, Steve!  

                                 STEVE 
                        Good to see you too, alive. 

                                 DIANA 
                        You should come on the next swim. 

           Mark hangs his head. Steve frowns. Diana feels it. 

                                 MARK 
                        There isn’t gonna be a next swim. 
                        I’m speaking for the whole crew. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Ah c’mon. Is that why we’re here? 
                        This an intervention? 

                                 MARK 
                        Yeah, it is. This has to stop. 

           Diana glares at Mark. Looks at Steve next. 
                                 DIANA 
                        Steve, you know what I’m trying to 
                        do here.  

                                 STEVE 
                        I know, Diana. It’s commendable. 
                        But I don’t think anyone can do 
                        this swim.  

           He hands her a packet. Page 1 is covered in graphs and data. 

                                 STEVE (CONT’D) 
                        I got this email from the Sports 
                        Institute of Medicine. They’ve been 
                        tracking your swims, analyzing all 
                        of it. 90% chance of adverse winds, 
                        90% waves, 70% currents, 30% 
                        navigational failure, 20% equipment 
                        failure, 30% seasickness, 10% 
                        sharks, 70% box jellyfish.  

                                 MARK 
                        They give you a 1.3% chance, out of 
                        1,000 tries, to be successful.  

           Diana finishes going through the papers, shaking her head.  

                                 DIANA 
                        I thought you were on my side. 

                                 MARK 
                        We are on your side. It’s not that 
                        we think it’s impossible. It’s that  
                        everyone thinks it’s impossible.  
                            (beat) 
                        You’ve got to move on, D. 

           She throws the packet on the table and leans back. 

           INT. DIANA’S HOUSE – DAY / NIGHT 

           A series of quick-cut phone calls now, as we watch her 
           calling sponsors again, like the sequence before her last 
           swim. Only this time they’re not so receptive. 

                                 DIANA (ON PHONE) 
                        Hey, Diana Nyad calling again! 
                        Yeah, we’ll get ‘em next time. Well 
                        sure one more time, why not?

                        It was really just the weather, we 
                        caught a bad break. But that won’t 
                        happen...yeah...no, I understand.

           INT. DIANA’S BEDROOM – NIGHT 

           Diana’s deflated, half asleep, watching the nightly news.  

                                 ABC7 ANCHOR 
                        Well another long-distance swimmer 
                        has tested the Florida Straights, 
                        and another has failed. 

           Diana perks up. 

                                 ABC7 ANCHOR (CONT’D) 
                        Chloe McCardel, 29, was going for 
                        the open swim record from Cuba to 
                        Florida today, but had to stop only 
                        11 hours into the swim due to 
                        severe jellyfish stings. The 
                        Portuguese Men-of-War, or “Box 
                        Jellies” are known to be the most 
                        poisonous in the ocean.

           At her computer now, Diana Googles: “Box Jellyfish expert”. 
           Ccrolls through results until she finds one name: 

           DR. ANGEL YANAGIHARA – BIOCHEMIST / BOX JELLY EXPERT  

           She clicks the IMAGES tab and we see pictures of Angel: 40, 
           pretty, holding a box jelly with a thick glove.  

           Diana smiles, wheels spinning.

           Diana walks down a hallway of offices until she passes an 
           open door.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Angel? 
           ANGEL YANAGIHARA steps out, goes to shake her hand.  

                                 ANGEL 
                        Diana. Nice to meet you finally. 

           Diana gives her a hug instead. 

                                 DIANA 
                        You’re even prettier in person. 

           INT. LABORATORY – LATER 

           Angel has live, baby BOX JELLYFISH in 1-foot tubs of water. 
           She uses a long plastic stick to prod one of the Jellyfish. 
           As soon as she does it SHOOTS a tentacle around the plastic. 

                                 ANGEL 
                        Hundreds of thousands of these 
                        microscopic tubules shoot out at 
                        bullet force, like needles, 
                        piercing the skin of whatever they 
                        encounter, injecting this complex 
                        venom. And once that enters the 
                        bloodstream, it’s like an avalanche 
                        of physiological problems. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah, I felt a few of those. How do 
                        I beat ‘em?    

           Angel rolls up her right sleeve. Her forearm is covered in a 
           small red RASH; looks really painful. Diana winces. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        You tested on yourself? Didn’t go 
                        too well huh?  

                                 ANGEL 
                        No, it went great. That’s the 
                        control arm. What a sting normally 
                        looks like. 

           Now she rolls up her left sleeve. Not a mark on it.  

           She uses surgical prongs to lay a 2” by 2” piece of white, 
           gelatinous plastic over her forearm.  

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D) 
                        I created this Sting-Stopper. Like 
                        a surface anti-venom.  

           She uses the prongs to pick up the baby jellyfish and put it 
           directly over the covered section of her arm. 
           Diana watches, expecting the worst. Angel doesn’t flinch.  

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D) 
                        It prohibits the sting mechanism, 
                        and it has the chemicals to treat 
                        the sting, even if it gets through. 

           The little jellyfish twitches on Angel’s arm, but can’t do a 
           damn thing. Diana smiles at her; she’s found her answer. 

                                 DIANA 
                        This is perfect. Thank you, Angel. 
                            (beat) 
                        Now I just have to cover my whole 
                        body in it.

           stings from her 2nd swim.

                        Build me a suit that can handle box 
                        jellies. Those little bastards have 
                        beaten everyone, John. Not anymore.

           John flips through it for a second. Looks uneasy.

                        What? 
                                 JOHN MIX 
                        Diana, we’d love to help you and be 
                        a part of this. But a suit like 
                        that...it’s gonna be expensive. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I know. Don’t worry about it. Now 
                        what about my face? 

                                 JOHN MIX 
                        What about it?  

                                 DIANA 
                        We’ve gotta make something that 
                        actually goes inside my mouth. Last 
                        swim, I had every inch of me 
                        covered, I mean everything, except 
                        my lips. Sure enough, they found 
                        ‘em and they stung ‘em.  

                                 JOHN MIX 
                        Well, lycra won’t do it. There’s no 
                        way to mold it to your mouth.

           Reveal Diana now, wearing the black, skin tight, brand new 
           FINIS bodysuit. But more shockingly --  

           A clear silicone MASK covers her whole head and neck. She 
           even grips it shut with her teeth. Not a single opening. 
           They all approach her and inspect it. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        How do you breathe? 

           Diana opens her mouth and pulls the bite plate out. 

                                 DIANA 
                        He had an orthodontist build a 
                        retainer inside the silicone. So I 
                        can force the mouth open, but keep 
                        it totally shut in the water.  

           Diana peels the mask off and hands it to Steve.

                        It’s all silicone and the anti-
                        venom from Angel. Legal, right? 

                                 STEVE 
                        I’ll double check. Silicone is 
                        fine. But...Diana... 
           He gives the mask a 360 inspection; feels how thick it is.

                        Swimming with this thing on would 
                        be like trying to climb Mt. Everest 
                        wearing lead shoes. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah, I know. It slows me down a 
                        bit. And it makes me swallow more 
                        salt water than normal. But I can’t 
                        get stung, so there’s no other way.  

           They all share a look: there IS one other way -- don’t swim. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I know you all think I’m crazy. I’m 
                        not. Well, shit, maybe I am. But 
                        I’m not stupid. I wouldn’t try this 
                        swim again without all this gear.  
                            (beat) 
                        This is our time. And I know I’ve 
                        said that before, but we’ve never 
                        been more ready. Every single 
                        failure has lead us here. And this 
                        time we’ll succeed.

                                 CLIENT 
                        No, don’t want to push it too hard. 

           She’s barely sweating. Bonnie almost laughs. It makes her 
           miss Diana. And then, on cue -- 

           DIANA walking towards her.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Can I have a minute? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I’m with a client. 

                                 CLIENT 
                        That’s okay, I could use a break. 
                                 BONNIE 
                        You don’t need a break. C’mon.  

           Client sighs and picks up the weights. Diana gets the hint. 

           INT. EQUINOX GYM – DUSK (LATER) 

           Bonnie exits the gym and JUMPS:  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Gah!  

           Diana’s in the silicone MASK. Scared the shit out of Bonnie. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Happy Birthday. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jesus Christ, Diana. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Got a new suit too. Covered from 
                        head to toe. They did it. I’m box 
                        jelly proof. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Take it off, it’s freaking me out. 
                            (Diana does) 
                        How much all this proofing cost?  

                                 DIANA 
                        Wasn’t too bad. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Sponsors cover it at least? 

           Diana pauses; doesn’t want to lie to her.  

                                 DIANA 
                        No. I covered it. These too.  

           She hands Bonnie an envelope. Tickets inside. 

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        New Zealand. Me and you. Or you can 
                        bring someone else if you want.  
                            (beat) 
                        I haven’t been there for you 
                        lately. I’ve been selfish, and I’m 
                        sorry. Everyone I ever trusted let 
                        me down or hurt me. But you never 
                        did. I know that. 
           Bonnie smiles, warming up. Then looks closer at the tickets: 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You bought trip insurance. 
                            (Diana nods, “Yeah”) 
                        In case you have to cancel. 
                            (Diana nods again) 
                        Unfuckingbelievable. 

                                 DIANA  
                        I’ve gotta see this through, and I 
                        can’t apologize for it. I want that 
                        life we talked about, but not yet. 
                        I can’t quit now. And I don’t think 
                        you really want me to. You need it 
                        as much as me.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        No, it’s your dream, not mine. 

                                 DIANA 
                        It was mine. Now it’s ours.  
                            (beat) 
                        Please come with us. I need you. 

           Bonnie sighs. Looks at her.  

                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        I don’t wanna die. I wanna live. 
                        But I wanna live big. No regrets. 

           Bonnie squeezes her hand, gives her a sad smile, and leaves. 

           INT. JOSE MARTI AIRPORT - HAVANA, CUBA – DAY 

           Passengers deboard and walk through the jetway bridge. Diana 
           steps off and walks among them, alone in the crowd and -- 

           INT. JOSE MARTI AIRPORT - HAVANA, CUBA – CONTINOUS 

           -- finds MARK waiting at the baggage claim carousel, holding 
           a sign that reads “Loca”. Diana smiles. 

                                 DIANA 
                        How we lookin, papa?  

                                 MARK 
                        We’re skeleton, but we’ll make it 
                        work. 

           She puts her arm around his waist and they walk out. 
           INT. DIANA’S HOTEL ROOM – HAVANA, CUBA - MORNING 

           Diana’s in her swimsuit, putting her robe on, looking at 
           herself in the mirror. Those deep, wrinkled eyes. 

           KNOCK KNOCK at the door. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Yeah? 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) 
                        Your shuttle’s here. Get up dummy. 

           Diana’s eyes go wide; she knows that voice! Opens the door-- 

           And there’s Bonnie. Diana shrieks and bear-hugs her!  

                                 DIANA  
                        Why’d you change your mind?  

                                 BONNIE 
                        When we started this whole thing 3 
                        years ago, you asked how many 
                        regrets I had.  
                            (Diana nods, sure) 
                        Too many. I was an athlete. I 
                        competed. But I never had the 
                        chance to do something like this. 
                        You were right. I do need it. 
                            (beat) 
                        You’ve been there for me before. 
                        Make it or not, I can’t regret not 
                        being there for you.  

           Diana hugs her again. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        But Jesus I hope you make it. 

                                 DIANA  
                        No shit. I hope you’ve been saving 
                        up on sleep. You’re gonna be a 
                        little busier this time.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Why?  

                                 DIANA 
                        We only got half the crew. Couldn’t 
                        afford ‘em. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Well. We’ll figure something out. 
           EXT. DIANA’S HOTEL - HAVANA, CUBA – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana and Bonnie leave the hotel and go outside and --  

                                 GROUP 
                        ONWARDS!!!  

           Diana jumps -- stunned to see her whole crew waiting on a 
           bus for her. Mark, David, Dr. Michael, Jon Rose, and 30 
           others. Heads out the windows, clapping, excited.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Oh my God. Onwards!! 

                                 WHOLE CREW 
                            (chanting back) 
                        ONWARDS!  

           Diana claps and yells back to them. Then, aside to Bonnie: 

                                 DIANA 
                        We don’t have the budget.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        They all volunteered this time. 
                        Even bought their own tickets. 
                        You’re not alone. We’re with you.  

           Diana looks at her team, so happy she could cry.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        One condition though: this is it. 
                        Really it. Last try. We’re all 
                        gonna give you everything we have, 
                        and you’re gonna give us everything 
                        you have. And then we’re gonna walk 
                        away from this thing, no matter 
                        what. Okay?  

           Diana wipes a tear away, takes a breath, and nods. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Okay. So let’s make it count. 

           EXT. HAVANA HARBOR – DAY 

           Diana back on that embankment. 

           Title card: August 31, 2013 

           We pull back to reveal there are no press there now, and 
           even less of a crowd than last time. About a dozen locals. A 
           few take pictures with their phones. 
                                 DIANA 
                            (with a smirk) 
                        At least Cuba believes in me. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Can you blame ‘em? 

           Bonnie finishes. Diana pulls her goggles down. Turns to the 
           water. Deep breaths. Ready to jump in. She turns back: 

                                 DIANA 
                        Don’t let me stop. No matter what. 
                        I don’t care about weather or 
                        sharks or anything. We can’t stop. 

           Bonnie’s going to argue, but Diana PLUNGES into the water 
           and she’s off. Too late. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – DAY 

           Title card: Hour 3, 96 miles to go 

           Luke’s on top of the main boat, scanning the water with 
           binoculars. He looks ahead a few hundred yards and stops. 

                                 LUKE 
                        Oh shit.  

           He climbs down fast and goes to Bonnie. Hands her the 
           binoculars and points ahead. She looks: 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What is that? 

           From her POV, there’s a huge patch of DARKNESS in the 
           turquoise water, the length of half a football field. 

                                 LUKE 
                        Box jellies. A whole school of ‘em. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s not even dusk yet. 
                            (looking again) 
                        Shit.  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           Boats are stopped. Diana’s putting on her new Finis suit and 
           silicone mask, every inch of her covered.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        We can go around. It’ll only take a 
                        few miles. 
                                 DIANA 
                        No way. We don’t stop, remember?  
                            (Bonnie nods) 
                        We’ll go through ‘em.  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana’s 20 yards from the patch of darkness. Everyone on the 
           boat watches, holding their breath.  

           From her POV: we see the first tentacle below her, then 
           another. She moves past. But here it comes... 

           A huge MASS. Hundreds of box jellies clumped together. It’s 
           a fucking nightmare. 

           She pulls up to stop and we CUT TO: 

           INT. DIANA’S BEDROOM, 1961 – NIGHT 

           Diana can see the KITCHEN down the hall. CU on the WATER 
           FAUCET, dripping one slow drop at a time.  

           She holds a cup, licks her lips. Makes her way carefully 
           down the hall. Until –- 

           ARIS turns the corner in the kitchen. Sees her.  

           She stops, terrified. 

                                 BONNIE (O.S.) 
                        Diana!  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           Diana’s frozen, still treading. She looks at Bonnie. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s gonna work. You got this.   

           Diana takes another deep breath, big inhale, closes her 
           mouth tight, and starts to swim through. 

           Bonnie can hardly watch. Dr. Michael’s getting his bag out.  

           Diana pushes one armful of tentacles out of the way. Then 
           another. Finally realizes: she doesn’t feel a thing.  

           She puts her head into the water and picks up her stroke, 
           plowing through them. The crew goes nuts!  

                                 CREW 
                        Onwards! / Alright Diana!  
           Bonnie smiles at Dr. Michael, finally exhales. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        They made her box jelly proof. 

                                 MARK 
                        Yeah they did!  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – NIGHT 

           Title card: Hour 6, 88 miles to go 

           Diana swims along in the darkness, red LED light on her cap. 
           Suddenly she stops, rips the mask off fast as she can and --  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana?? 

           -- vomits. Mostly salt water. Catches her breath. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m okay.  

           She rinses her mouth off. Pulls the mask down. Keeps going. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (to the crew) 
                        It’s alright. She’s fine. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – LATER 

           Diana’s not fine; treading water, puking more. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Jesus.  

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Bonnie-- 

                                 BONNIE 
                        I know. It’s the mask; makes her 
                        swallow too much salt water.  

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        We should double her feedings.  

                                 BONNIE 
                            (sotto) 
                        She got pushed east before, twice. 
                        We’re on a good course right now, 
                        we can’t slow down. 
                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        If we don’t, she’s gonna get 
                        severely dehydrated, then probably 
                        start hallucinating.  

                                 BONNIE 
                            (she can live with that) 
                        Okay. Then what? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Then kidney failure.  

                                 BONNIE 
                            (knows he’s right) 
                        Fuck. 
                            (has an idea) 
                        Okay. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – NIGHT 

           Boats stopped. Diana drinks from the feeding tube. Bonnie’s 
           looking at her watch. The timer hits 3 MINUTES and she 
           signals to a handler. 

           Suddenly the feeding bag is jerked away from Diana’s grip. 
           She watches it get reeled back to the boat. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Hey! I wasn’t done. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah you were. Let’s go. 

           Diana sighs, Fine. Leans forward. Deep breath. Swims on.  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – DAY 

           Bonnie stands with David, watching Diana. Her mask and extra 
           suit are off and she looks good; steady, fluid strokes. 

           Title card: Hour 20, 61 miles to go 

                                 DAVID 
                        I’m afraid to say it. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What? 

                                 DAVID 
                        We’re looking really...(good). 

           He smiles. Points to his navi screen, two inches right of 
           where their dot is. 
                                 DAVID (CONT’D) 
                        Normally we’re over here by now. 
                        But it’s actually pulling us north. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s pulling us? 

                                 DAVID 
                        We’re riding the current. Going 
                        directly north. 

           It’s great news and they know it. Bonnie looks over to Mark. 
           He nods, like “What?” She gives him a quick thumbs up. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – SUNSET 

           Diana’s near the boat, putting her Finis suit back on.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        How you feeling? 

                                 DIANA 
                        When I’m not throwing up I feel 
                        great. 

           Bonnie hands her the silicone mask; holds it for a second. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Hey, look at me. 
                            (Diana does) 
                        This is the last time you’re ever 
                        gonna have to put this mask on. 

           An excitement washes over Diana’s face. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I thought we had one more night. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        If we keep going at this pace... 
                        we’ll be in the Keys before sunset 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Holy shit!  

           Diana slaps the water. Bonnie’s watch timer goes off. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        C’mon, let’s go. 

           Diana hurries to get the mask all the way on. Bonnie motions 
           to the rest of the crew and the boats rumble forward. 
           And just as they do... the wind picks up. It sweeps Bonnie’s 
           hair across her face, rocks the boat just a little. 

           She looks up at the sky with a sick feeling growing in her 
           stomach, a few clouds gathering overhead. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – NIGHT 

           Diana’s swimming. The weather’s getting worse: strong winds, 
           2-foot swells, and a light rain starts to fall. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (at the sky) 
                        You motherfucker. Don’t do this. 

           And like it was listening... CRACK! The sky opens up. 
           Rolling thunder and lightening in the distance. The rain 
           doubles down. Winds pick up. Diana stops to puke again. 

           Title card: Hour 33, 42 miles to go 

           The crew looks worried. Mark tries to hold it together. 

                                 MARK 
                        Nothing new here guys. Let’s tie 
                        everything down, secure the lines. 

           Meanwhile the boats are really rocking now. In the water, 
           Diana’s fighting through 4-foot swells.  

           One of the two KAYAKERS next to her misjudges a wave and --  

                                 KAYAKER 
                        Oh no!  

           -- barely avoids Diana’s head.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Shit!  
                            (spins around) 
                        Mark, bring the kayakers in. Stop 
                        all boats.  

           Mark gets on his walkie. Bonnie blows her whistle. 

           Diana looks up and starts swimming over. It’s brutal; she’s 
           getting tossed by the waves. The kayakers have to go way 
           around to avoid her. She pulls her mask up: 

                                 DIANA 
                        I’m not getting out. 
                                 BONNIE 
                        I know. But we can’t have the 
                        kayaks out there with you.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Why not?? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        One of ‘em almost just hit your 
                        fucking head, that’s why not. They 
                        can’t stay that close to you with 
                        these swells. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Okay. 
                            (realizing) 
                        The Shark Shields... 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Right. 

           Diana thinks for 3 seconds flat.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Well, pull ‘em then. We keep going. 
                        Just tell Luke— 

                                 BONNIE 
                        They’ll be watching.  

           And just like that, her mask is down and she’s swimming. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                             (calls over) 
                        Luke!  

           Luke nods. Corrals the other two SHARK DIVERS and directs 
           them to various spots on the boat. 

                                 MARK 
                        What about the sharks?? Bonnie? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        She knows, Mark. She knows. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – NIGHT 

           Title card: Hour 35, 38 miles to go 

           Diana swims, breaststroke now. She mumbles something. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana? What’s she saying? 
           Mark shrugs; he can’t make it out either.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Bonnie? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah? What Diana?  

                                 DIANA 
                        How’d they do it? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What? Swim closer, I can barely 
                        hear you. 

           Diana makes her way over. We can hear her teeth chattering, 
           her body shaking.  

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Jesus, D, you’re freezing. 

                                 DIANA 
                        How’d they do it? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Do what? 

                                 DIANA  
                        How’d they build it? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Build. What. 

                                 DIANA 
                        The Taj Mahal. 

           Diana is looking above and past Bonnie, seeing the real TAJ 
           MAHAL behind them. She stares in wonder. 

                                 BONNIE 
                            (oh fuck) 
                        You see the Taj Mahal? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Are we off course? How’d we get to 
                        India? Isn’t it in India?  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Yeah it is. Hang on. 
                            (turns back) 
                        Get Michael over here. 

           They do and Michael comes over. 
                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        She’s seeing the Taj Mahal. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Let’s get her a full saline 
                        feeding, right now. 

           Bonnie rushes off. Michael puts his stethoscope on. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL (CONT’D) 
                        Diana, can you turn onto your back 
                        for me? Diana? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Huh? 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        Turn onto your back. 

           She does. He puts the stethoscope to her chest, checking her 
           heart. 

                                 DIANA 
                        It’s beautiful.  

           Bonnie rejoins them with a feeding tube. Hands it down. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        D. Drink this. 

           Diana grabs it and drinks, still staring behind them. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Listen to me. If you get to the Taj 
                        Mahal, swim around it. Okay? 

                                 DIANA 
                        Mmhmm. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – LATER 

           Diana, somehow swimming again. Bonnie with Dr. Michael. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        It’s close. If she goes full 
                        hypothermic we won’t know until 
                        it’s too late.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        But she’s okay? 
                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        She’s not okay, but she’s stable. 
                        She just has to warm up soon. 

           Bonnie nods. Looks out at Diana, worried. 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – NIGHT 

           Title card: Hour 40, 28 miles to go 

           Diana’s really struggling. Even from the boat we can 
           actually see her arms shaking with every stroke. 

           She slows down. Finally stops. Rolls onto her back.  

           INT. MAIN CREW BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           Bonnie’s asleep on a couch; power nap. Mark wakes her up. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What?  

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – CONTINUOUS 

           Bonnie walks out. Sees Diana, still laying on her back.  

                                 MARK 
                        She’s breathing. But she’s been 
                        there for 5 minutes. Tried to bring 
                        her in. She won’t listen to us. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Diana?  
                            (nothing) 
                        Diana!  

           Still nothing. Bonnie looks over at Dr. Michael. 

                                 DR. MICHAEL 
                        If she’s unresponsive...we’re gonna 
                        have to call it, pull her out. 

           Bonnie hangs her head, watching Diana, about to lose it all 
           again. And then -- 

           She catches something in the corner of her eye. Turns to the 
           north and squints hard at the horizon.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        Give me a minute. 

           Bonnie jumps into the water. The crew’s stunned. What the 
           hell’s she doing? 
           Diana finally looks over. Bonnie swims out to her. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Hey!  

                                 DIANA 
                            (no energy) 
                        What? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        What do you mean WHAT? Get your ass 
                        in gear. 

                                 DIANA 
                        I can’t. I just can’t. I’m sorry. 

           She pulls her mask off; she’s crying, and her face is rough 
           again, swollen, mouth covered with abrasions.  

                                 BONNIE 
                        You can. 

                                 DIANA 
                        No. I can’t. I’ve been going on 
                        empty now for the last 10 hours. 
                        I’m just dead, Bonnie. I’m dead. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Sit up. Look over there. 
                            (Diana doesn’t move) 
                        C’mon, just look. 

           Diana tilts her head back, looking upside down, to where 
           Bonnie’s pointing at the north. She can just make out some 
           LIGHT on the horizon. 

                                 DIANA 
                        Oh. The sun’s coming up? At least 
                        I’ll be warmer. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        That’s not the sun, Diana. That’s 
                        Key West. 

                                 DIANA 
                        What? 

           She spins around to get a better look.  

           Pulls her goggles up, rubs her eyes, stares hard. 

           It’s true: we can just see the Florida city lights in the 
           far distance. Still a long ways out, but there they are. 
                                 DIANA (CONT’D) 
                        How close are we?? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        30 miles.  

                                 DIANA 
                            (doing the math) 
                        15 hours? Really? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        You can do this, Diana. You’re 
                        already doing it.  

           Diana smiles at her. Wipes the tears away.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Thank you. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Thank me when we’re on the beach. 

           Diana puts the mask back on and picks up her stroke; slow at 
           first, but at least she’s moving. 

           Bonnie treads for a minute there, watching her go. We hear 
           the CREW cheering in the background: “Go Diana!” “Onwards!” 

           EXT. STRAIGHTS OF FLORIDA / MAIN CREW BOAT – DAY 

           Mark comes over to Bonnie with a satellite phone. 

                                 MARK 
                        They want a quote. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Who?

           NEWS FOOTAGE – CBS 

           We’re watching LIVE FOOTAGE of Diana swimming towards the 
           Florida shore, daylight now.  

                                 ANCHOR 
                        Only a few miles now from a record 
                        that has eluded her for decades.

                        History being made. She’s so close! 

           Footage of crowds cheering on the beach to welcome her in. 
           They’re holding signs, like “Go Diana!”. Someone waves a big 
           American flag. A few people do the same with Rainbow ones. 

                                 CNN REPORTER (CONT’D) 
                        You can feel the excitement here on 
                        this beach— 

           EXT. KEY WEST, FLORIDA – DAY (SAME) 

           And we’re ON that beach now, surrounded by a thousand 
           people. The story hit the major channels and they’ve all 
           come to out watch. 

           They see our 3 CREW BOATS in the distance, now only about a 
           mile out. 

           EXT. KEY WEST OCEAN / MAIN CREW BOAT – SAME 

           Diana doing breastroke now. Dunking in and out of the water, 
           POV from her goggles: 

           Every time we’re up we get a 1-second shot of the beach and 
           the people on it, just blurry figures from here.  

           She’s wheezing, hurting everywhere. But NOT stopping. Above 
           the wheezing more sound fades in and we hear: 

                                 CREW 
                        C’mon, Diana! / You got this! / One 
                        more mile!  
           Out of POV, on the BOAT: the whole crew is cheering her on. 
           They know how close they are and what this means. No more 
           jinxing now; they’re going nuts. 

           Bonnie’s clapping along, until she takes a harder look at 
           the people on shore. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Do we have police out there? 

                                 MARK 
                        I don’t know, why? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Look at all those people.  

                                 MARK 
                            (realizing) 
                        Fuck, you’re right. 

           He dials on the satellite phone. Bonnie turns to the crew. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        Listen up everybody!  
                            (they’re still cheering) 
                        HEY!!! Listen!!! 
                            (finally look at her) 
                        We have one goal when we get to the 
                        beach: keep people AWAY from Diana. 
                        If one person touches her or grabs 
                        her before she gets both feet on 
                        sand, totally out of the water, the 
                        swim will NOT count. Federation 
                        rules. Everyone got me? 

           This sinks in for the crew. They nod. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        We make a wall around her. NO one 
                        gets through. 

                                 MARK (INTO WALKIE) 
                        All boats, all boats, get to the 
                        shore, clear the path! 

           The boats all speed off around her, heading to shore. Two 
           kayakers stay, flanked on each side. 

           EXT. BEACH - KEY WEST, FLORIDA – CONTINUOUS 

           A local NEWSMAN reports on camera from the beach. We can see 
           the boats in the background, only a hundred yards out now. 
                                 NEWSMAN 
                        People have come out from all over 
                        Florida to watch her. Some 
                        surprised to find out this was her 
                        fifth attempt at the swim, a swim 
                        that most experts said was 
                        impossible. 

           EXT. KEY WEST OCEAN / MAIN CREW BOAT – SAME 

           With Diana, swimming, one slow stroke after the next, until— 

           Her FOOT touches something. It scares her at first. Then she 
           touches down again and realizes: it’s the sand. 

           She puts the other foot down, testing it, not sure if it’s 
           real. And then slowly stands up, water up to her chest. 

           EXT. BEACH - KEY WEST, FLORIDA – SAME 

           The crew CHEERS! The beach crowd does too. 

                                 NEWSMAN 
                        And she’s standing now! Just 
                        minutes from walking up on land. 

           EXT. KEY WEST OCEAN / MAIN CREW BOAT – SAME 

           Diana trudges on, water now waist high. From her POV again, 
           we see the mass of people, and we CUT TO: 

           INT. DIANA’S BEDROOM, 1961 (FLASHBACK) – NIGHT 

           Diana going to the KITCHEN down the hall and the water 
           faucet there, one careful step forward at a time.  

           ARIS turns the corner, going for the fridge. She freezes. 

           EXT. KEY WEST OCEAN – (PRESENT) DAY 

           Diana stumbles! Catches herself. Pauses there for a minute, 
           hands on her knees. Looks up and sees -- 

           The whole crew is in a huge half-circle, desperately trying 
           to keep the crowd pushed away.  

           A couple local COPS pitch in. They’re yelling “Back up!” and 
           “Don’t touch her!”  

           And in the middle of it, BONNIE. Staring right at Diana, 
           coaxing her forward: Come to me. 
           Diana moves one foot, then another, walking off balance and 
           wobbly like a toddler. 

           Knee deep now. Marching on. Then to her ankles.  

           The crowd’s at a fever pitch, starting to push the crew 
           circle in. Someone tries to reach out for Diana!  

           Mark boxes them out! The rest of the crew digs in and pushes 
           back! They’re only a few feet from her. 

           Bonnie stays calm throughout, eyes locked on Diana’s, and 
           hers right back. 

                                 BONNIE 
                        It’s okay, just come to me. One 
                        step at a time.  

           Diana’s feet in the water. And then one foot on pure sand, 
           then the other. 

                                 BONNIE (CONT’D) 
                        Few more steps... 

           Left foot, right foot, and two more. All sand now and -- 

           Bonnie HUGS Diana. She’s done it!  

           The crowd goes fucking ballistic around them! A thousand 
           people chanting and clapping. Boats nearby blow their horns. 

           Diana closes her eyes and falls into Bonnie’s hug.  

           Title card: Hour 53, 0 miles to go 

           Cameras snap. Mark is crying. Her crew pulls into a big 
           group hug around them all, jumping up and down. 

           And still at the center, Diana, holding onto Bonnie; sick, 
           totally drained, but feeling a calm she’s never known. 

                                 BONNIE  
                        You did it. 

                                 DIANA 
                        We did it. Thank you. 

           When they finally break, REPORTERS push mics forward. 

                                 REPORTERS 
                        Diana! / How do you feel? / What do 
                        you want to tell the world?  
           Diana looks at them, exhausted and happy.  

                                 DIANA 
                        Never, ever give up. 

           The crowd cheers again. Widen out to see the beach FULL of 
           people celebrating, and our crew at the center of it. 

           EXT. BEACH - KEY WEST, FLORIDA – LATER 

           Bonnie helps Diana walk forward, clearing the throngs of 
           people congratulating her. Aside to Bonnie: 

                                 DIANA 
                        So? 

                                 BONNIE 
                        So what? 

                                 DIANA 
                        What’s next? 

           Bonnie thinks she’s kidding. Looks at her. She’s not. 

           CUT TO BLACK. 

           Crawl on screen:  

           At the age of 64, Diana Nyad became the first person to 
           open-swim from Cuba to Florida. 103 miles. 53 hours. It was 
           her fifth try in 36 years. 

           One month later, she completed a 48-hour swim in New York to 
           raise money for Hurricane Sandy relief. 

           She has no plans for any other marathon swims. 

           Yet. 

           CUT TO BLACK. ROLL CREDITS. 

                                       THE END
