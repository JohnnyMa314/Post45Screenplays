           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           A chalkboard-black sky looms over the city. Not a star in 
           sight, just man-made glimmers in the windows of buildings. 
           The air hums with a sinister kind of electricity -- this is 
           brutal, unforgiving February in NYC, and snow is coming.    

           A SERIES OF SHOTS, over which we hear an INTERVIEW:

           --Waves strike the slushy, nearly frozen edges of the Hudson. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        The human body is ruled by 
                        instincts. Hard-wired for survival. 

           --Gusts of wind bend the Central Park trees, their branches 
           snarled in strings of tiny white lights.

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.) 
                        Eat. Choose the right partner. 
                        Sense danger. Fight or flight.

           --PEOPLE scurry to escape the cold, all hats and scarves.  

           --An East Village shop DOOR, decorated in crepe paper hearts 
           from Valentine’s Day, slams SHUT, closed for the night. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.) 
                        Our bodies have an internal alarm 
                        system. 

           --A STOPLIGHT swings on its cable as if pushed by an unseen 
           hand. It creaks as the signal turns from RED to GREEN.  

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.) 
                        But our minds can override it. And 
                        we do, all the time. 

           --A third story Morningside Heights brownstone window, above 
           the stoplight, spills light onto the street.  

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Because we’re too polite, or too 
                        comfortable, or too arrogant to 
                        listen. 

           We float up to it, this beacon of warmth, as snow falls... 

           INT. SOMEWHERE - CLOSE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN - NIGHT

           A slightly pixelated DR. ADRIAN COONS, 39, nerdy-handsome 
           with freckles and glasses, sits on a 60 MINUTES-STYLE SHOW. 
           An INTERVIEWER thumbs through his mass-market hardcover book.   
                                 ADRIAN
                        The brain is definitely my favorite 
                        organ. But our modern, evolved 
                        human minds can get in our way. 

           He has an intensity about him, like his mental circuit board 
           is all lit up and he can hardly choose which idea to express. 
           It’s a bit geeky but also powerful and captivating. 

           We PULL BACK to find ourselves in...

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           ...a homey, part Crate-n-Barrel, part Etsy living room. 
           Leather sofa, burlap pillows, a fridge covered in ripped-out 
           New Yorker cartoons, a gallery wall of framed photographs.     

           WILL, 32, effortlessly cool, kind, the prom king with a heart 
           of gold, now all grown up, watches the TV as he works out 
           with a kettlebell. He’s hot... shirtless, in basketball 
           shorts, slick with sweat. Legal books are spread around. A 
           scruffy white terrier, EINSTEIN, chews on a loose paper. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Dr. Adrian Coons is known for his 
                        bestselling books and his 
                        pioneering work abroad which he 
                        often broadcasts in snippets via 
                        his Vine, “Six Second MD.”  

           Beautiful, Annie-Leibowitz-meets-Instagram IMAGES OF ADRIAN 
           TREATING PATIENTS: He talks with KIDS with CLEFT PALATES. He 
           DELIVERS A BABY in a remote village. In Appalachia, he 
           administers a shot to a GIRL-- a banner says, “What is HPV?”

           Now a frenetic VINE VIDEO PLAYS: Quick, cutty shots of 
           bottles of MEDICINE. Horse-sized pills. Needles.    

                                 ADRIAN (V.O.)
                        Kahlil’s been on experimental HIV 
                        meds for ten weeks. We’re trying to 
                        get those T-Cells over 500.

           We find the kind face of KAHLIL, an African man of 35. CUT TO 
           a baggie filling up with BLOOD as Kahlil’s sample is taken. 

                                 ADRIAN (V.O.)
                        Now we’re gonna find out-- 

           The BLOOD IS TESTED with a CRUDE PAPER litmus test. A LOUD 
           PRINTER expels a page of paper. On KAHLIL’S EYES as he reads. 
           Adrian pops into frame. Kahlil looks to him for reassurance. 
                                 KAHLIL
                        I am 563! I am 563!

           The video ENDS. The Interviewer is clearly moved by this...

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        They call you “The Viral Doctor.” 

           Adrian smiles, shakes his head, comfortable in this fame.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Will stands before the TV, watching, rapt. Until he notices 
           the dog tearing apart a page of his notes. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey, you, no eating paper. That’s 
                        Torts. It’s not good for you. 

           Einstein pauses to wag his tail, then resumes eating paper.  

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           A freestanding glass shower, fogged with steam. 

           Hot water pours over CHARLOTTE, 35, porcelain skin and 
           piercing eyes. Behind those eyes, her mind is always humming. 
           She’s bright and alert, easily bored, and loves a challenge. 

           We move to HER HANDS as she stretches them, knuckles 
           cracking. They’re the hands of a hard worker: calloused, 
           tough, nails bitten. Her art deco wedding ring glints.  

           She reaches up to a ledge for soap and then -- SMASH! She 
           CRIES OUT! -- something falls and SHATTERS against the tile.  
           She scoops up what has fallen... petals of broken glass... 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Jesus. 

           As she pulls the pieces together, one shard SLICES her hand.   

           She winces. She watches her blood drip into the drain.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sopping-wet Charlotte walks in. In a towel, her body milky 
           and soft, she’s not hot like Will, but she’s beautiful.   

                                 WILL
                        Hey.
           She shoots him a look and holds up the glass, wrung with 
           bourbon and her blood.  

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Will stretches a Bert and Ernie Band-Aid over her hand. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How many times, though-- with the 
                        glasses in the shower?

                                 WILL
                        Bourbon tastes so much better in 
                        the shower.
                             (then, meaning it)
                        I’m sorry, honey.

           He struggles with the static-y paper that clings to the glue. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I can do it.

                                 WILL
                        Nope. Sorry. You may be the medical 
                        professional but I think I’m more 
                        qualified for this sort of thing.   

           He covers the wound with a bunch of raspberry kisses. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Bert and Ernie?

                                 WILL
                        It’s us.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What do you-- oh, no, which one am 
                        I? I’m Bert, aren’t I? I’m so Bert. 

                                 WILL
                        What’s wrong with that?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (laughing)
                        Bert is boring!

                                 WILL
                        No, Bert’s great. Bert has a 
                        perspective. Quilted socks. Saddle 
                        shoes. Appreciates a sense of 
                        order. Very cool.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Bert is not cool.

           He plays with the edge of her towel, tucked in under her arm.

                                 WILL
                        Bert is... sexy.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Bert is not sexy.  

           He tugs at the towel and she lets it fall. They kiss.

                                 WILL
                        How much time before you leave?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Ten minutes.

                                 WILL
                        Perfect. 

           She turns to lean on the sink, anticipating his every move as 
           they proceed to have patented, solid B+, ten-minute sex. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlotte coils a wool scarf around her neck. She takes stock 
           of the chaotic room -- blaring TV, Will’s books everywhere. A 
           game controller on top of his notecards. 

           He comes in, notices her looking around. She covers. 

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Nothing. I’m just proud of you.

           She gathers up her stuff, some books, a thermos of coffee. 

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        And I can’t wait to celebrate when 
                        you’re done! Everyone else will be 
                        there around 8, I probably won’t 
                        get there til 9 or so... I 
                        confirmed the reservation.

                                 WILL
                        See you in 24 hours.

           He gives her a sweet, dry, kiss goodbye. She hangs onto him.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’ve got this.

                                 WILL
                        I know. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I love you. Get some good sleep. 

           Over his shoulder she sees the dog tearing up those notes.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no-- Einstein! Drop it.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, hey, check this out for a sec. 
                        He’s been studying with me. 
                        Einstein, do Johnny Cochran. 

           The little dog cocks his head, bewildered.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I better go.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t put pressure on him, he’ll do 
                        it. Einstein, we believe in you, 
                        man. Johnny Cochran. 

           Einstein patters to a basket by the door... Charlotte watches 
           him nose through... and return with... a GLOVE! He presents 
           it to Will, tail wagging. Charlotte bursts into laughter.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh my god! That is extremely cute.

                                 WILL
                        Who’s cute, me or him?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Both of you. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S BROWNSTONE - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Charlotte approaches the revolving door. It whips like a 
           propeller. Inches away, she stops and CLOSES HER EYES. 

           Swish... swish... swish... ON HER FACE as the door clips 
           around. She takes a breath. Her mouth twitches. 

           Completely blind, SHE STEPS INSIDE THE REVOLVING DOOR. We 
           stay on her face -- eyes closed -- as she moves through. 
           Until... a PUFF of air... and she reaches the exterior. 
           She emerges and BREATHES, exhilarated, and looks back--

           From inside, SLY, 40s, the doorman, shakes his head at her.   

                                 SLY
                        You’re gonna give me a heart 
                        attack!

           She smirks at Sly, and waves as she walks away. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           A SURGICAL WARD at a respected midtown hospital. It’s 
           bustling -- DOCTORS on the move, NURSES manning stations, 
           PATIENTS in all states, the thick din of humanity...  

           Late, Charlotte hustles to join a group of RESIDENTS. They’re 
           mostly MEN, many of them older than she is. A serious bunch.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay, guys.

           They turn to her. She is the boss, their attending surgeon. 

           A red-headed nurse, KARA, 20s, passes Charlotte an iPad.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fun Friday night -- full recovery 
                        ward, two stab wounds en route, 
                        some stitches, a treasure chest of 
                        swallowed foreign objects and an 
                        ulcer. Mitesh, get the hell off-- I 
                        love you, but if I see you on your 
                        phone again I’m gonna throw it in 
                        the biohazard bin in the OR, okay? 
                        I’m gonna really bury it in there. 
                        Your attention is here. You give me 
                        less than 100% and we’re in 
                        trouble. Okay? Let’s go. Maybe 
                        we’ll even have some fun.

           She’s serious but warm, and the RESIDENTS nod, intent on 
           pleasing her. MITESH places his phone at the nurses’ station. 

           INT. PATIENT ROOM 1 - NIGHT

           Charlotte checks up on an older WOMAN recovering from knee 
           surgery. She moans and rocks, clearly in a lot of pain.

                                 WOMAN
                        It’s terrible! It itches!
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay. I need you to count every 
                        mole and freckle on your right arm. 

           The woman half-scoffs at her. Charlotte waits, serious. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Are you crazy?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Let’s find out. Come on. 

           The woman looks down at her arm... 

                                 WOMAN
                        One. Two. Three. Four, five, six.  

           The woman considers her weird doctor and laughs. Charlotte 
           motions-- continue. It works; she’s distracted from her pain. 

           INT. PATIENT ROOM 2 - NIGHT

           Charlotte argues with a feeble but angry MAN, 70s, lying 
           agitated on a bed. A MALE RESIDENT stitches his wound. A 
           skinny BOY, 8, in the corner, watches, curious and scared.   

                                 MAN
                        How do you know what I need?!

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Because you’re fully numbed, and no 
                        one needs Oxy after stitches.  

                                 MAN
                             (screaming)
                        Fucking bitch!!! Fucking CUNT!!!

           All the air seems to leave the room. The scared resident 
           looks up at Charlotte. She nods: it’s okay, keep going.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Mr. Reichert, please don’t speak to 
                        me that way.   

           Her calmness seems to bewilder and diffuse the man. The boy 
           takes this in. Charlotte offers him a comforting smile.  

           INT. PATIENT ROOM 3 - NIGHT

           Charlotte and a FEMALE RESIDENT examine a 15-year-old GIRL.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hey. Unrelated question. Are you on 
                        birth control?
                             (then...)
                        If it’s not a total yes it’s a no, 
                        and if it’s a no, I’m going to load 
                        you up with free samples, so...

           The girl is silent.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                             (to the resident)
                        Samples it is. Go raid OBGYN. If 
                        they get pissy, send them to me.
                             (to the patient, playful)
                        I’m like Santa Claus when it comes 
                        to the pill. 

           The girl gives Charlotte the tiniest of appreciative nods.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - CAFETERIA - NIGHT

           Charlotte eats with the lords of the hospital -- the heads of 
           surgery -- a pack of OLDER MEN including CARLSON, erudite 
           asshole, and one WOMAN, SONIA, 50s, Indian, poised and kind. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I actually find that-- 

                                 CARLSON
                        But is it an ethical issue or a 
                        practical one? We need options. 

           Speaking-while-female can be a challenge sometimes...    

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        As long as--

                                 CARLSON
                        As long as we don’t become serial 
                        minimizers or under-prescribers. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hey, Carlson. Are you aware that 
                        you’re like a serial interrupter?

           Carlson balks. She holds his gaze, terrified, unsure if that 
           was a stupid impulse... until everyone LAUGHS. 

           HALLWAY

           The skinny boy runs up to Charlotte and gives her a note. 
           INT. CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Charlotte tacks the NOTE to a bulletin board in her office. 
           It’s a colored-pencil drawing of a cat dressed as a DOCTOR. 

           It reads: THANKS! From: Noah (and my Grandpa).     

           PULL BACK to reveal: the board is full of thank-yous, 
           letters, wedding invitations, photos of former patients. 

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           GERMAN HOUSE MUSIC BLASTS. Charlotte is hunched over an 
           operating table, midway through a grueling surgery. A MOUSY 
           MALE RESIDENT dabs the sweat from her brow as she works. 

           CHARLOTTE’s POV: her tweezers grasp at A BULLET stuck in 
           throbbing flesh. She squints with intensity. Relentless. 
           Finally... a metallic PING as she drops the bullet in a tray. 

                                 MITESH
                        Making it look easy, Dr. G. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What would I do without Mitesh to 
                        kiss my ass? I think I’d wither 
                        away or something...

                                 MITESH
                        You want me to stop?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hell no. Keep it coming.

           The residents laugh. 

           EXT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - ROOF - DAY

           Charlotte drinks a huge coffee as she watches the sun rise. 
           She’s shivering, but happy, high on this job she loves.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - DAY

           By the nurses’ station, Charlotte scours the giant whiteboard 
           where surgeries are scheduled. She talks to Kara, behind her.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Grab me the lab results for 19?
                             (noticing something)
                        Dr. Coons is coming in? 
                                 KARA
                        Already is. He was looking for you. 

           DAN, 20s, a cute gay nurse, gapes excitedly at Kara.     

                                 DAN
                        Right now? He’s here?

           Kara nods, sharing in the enthusiasm. Charlotte notices.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh my god, not you guys, too. 
                        Everyone around here acts like he’s 
                        the goddamn messiah. Have we all 
                        forgotten the Sanuma measles thing-- 

                                 ALEX
                        What do you mean, what thing?

                                 KARA
                        There was an epidemic in Venezuela.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        And his experimental anti-viral 
                        drug wiped out like 90% of a tribe--

                                 ALEX
                        It was the drug or the virus?

                                 KARA
                        Come on, they never proved that-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Because if they did it’d basically 
                        be genocide. 

                                 KARA
                        Or maybe you’re a little jealous.

           Charlotte’s about to react, when ADRIAN COONS and an 
           entourage pass by. We saw him on TV, but he’s different in 
           person. Tall, with muscular shoulders and a gravity to his 
           presence. He stops his conversation when he sees Charlotte. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Wow, our very own celebrity. Is a 
                        documentary being filmed, or Adrian 
                        -- I’m sorry, are you lost? Because 
                        this is an actual hospital, not a 
                        TV set.
                                 ADRIAN
                        That’s why the scalpels are so 
                        sharp. They’re really, really 
                        sharp. 

           Familiarity here... every bit her equal, Adrian likes testing 
           Charlotte. And for all her bluster, she enjoys it.

                                 ADRIAN 
                        Hey, Charlotte. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What brings you in?

                                 ADRIAN
                        I have a trip to coordinate, 
                        meetings, a couple high profile 
                        surgeries, believe it or not--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Now-- “The Viral Doctor.” Tell me, 
                        do your patients find that branding 
                        problematic?

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s touching that you’ve saved up 
                        all this venom just for me. 
                             (to Kara)
                        You know in medical school she was 
                        just as mean-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Stop. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Always picking on all the boys. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Thank you, that’s enough.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        You look great by the way.  

           She thinks he’s being sarcastic; he’s not. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I haven’t slept.

                                 ADRIAN
                        What else is new.

           They grow quiet, and Kara clocks the energy between them. 
           Borderline flirtatious, but harmless. 
                                 ADRIAN 
                        Swing by my office later. I want to 
                        talk to you in private.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m busy for the next few hours--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Whenever.

           Adrian smiles and moves off. Charlotte abruptly heads down 
           the hall in the opposite direction. 

                                 KARA
                        Dr. Gordon?

           She’s still holding the lab results Charlotte wanted.

           INT. ADRIAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte’s knee bounces. A nervous tick. She catches it. 

           Charlotte sits across Adrian’s white granite desk, which is 
           like an avant-garde piece of art, in his giant office. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Laos is next. We’re fully funded. 
                        But I need to get a team together--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (taking in the city view)
                        I can’t believe this place. You’re 
                        here less than a third of the year. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        The trip is dedicated to surgeries. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s bigger than my apartment.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I want you to run it with me.

           She snaps to. Hugely flattered, but hiding it.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Co-chair the trip. Help me choose 
                        the doctors to bring, the cases, 
                        figure out the approach-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Laos?
                                 ADRIAN
                        Two small villages. We go for six 
                        weeks in June. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        And you film this, for your--

                                 ADRIAN
                        We get a lot of press. They’re 
                        talking about a TV pilot... 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That part of it just seems 
                        slippery. Your whole...

           She motions with her hand like she’s erasing over his face.

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        Fame. Whatever. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You want recognition for your work, 
                        right?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Of course.

                                 ADRIAN
                        And you want to build a legacy. 
                        Probably a pretty profound one. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yes.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Then you should consider it. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay, I will. And thank you.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’re the best. Always have been.  

           She doesn’t move at first, enjoying this shop-talk, not 
           wanting it to end. But she lurches up.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Oh, and, how’s Matt?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You mean Will. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I mean Will. Right.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He’s great. Actually, he’s 
                        finishing the bar exam as we speak. 
                        We’re having a big party for him 
                        down at Luca’s, this spot in our 
                        neighborhood tonight. 
                             (unsure)
                        If you wanted to-- 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I have plans.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Of course.

           As she’s heading out the door-- 

                                 ADRIAN
                        The bar exam. Really.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Really.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Good for you.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Good for him.

           Charlotte feels Adrian’s eyes follow her out, and it gives 
           her a charge to know that he’s watching her. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Have fun at your party.

           EXT. LUCCA’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Charlotte hops out of a cab, carrying a pink cake box tied 
           with white string. Snow falls -- dense, sharp flakes.   

           INT. LUCCA’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A cool, young, down-home-chic spot. Will’s party has its own 
           section. Cocktail in hand, Will holds court. In his element.

                                 WILL
                        And I looked around me at all these 
                        hunched-over-people scribbling.

           Charlotte squeezes through with the cake, pausing for a ‘hi’ 
           here and there, eager to get to Will. She’s actually shy in 
           big social groups, where Will is at his best.
                                 WILL
                        The guy next to me, he’s pressing 
                        so hard his pencil literally 
                        cracks. His whole body is like 
                        contorted in anxiety. And I realize 
                        we all look like this. Rows and 
                        rows of us. Freakin’ robots except 
                        we’re sweating like pigs. This is 
                        the life we’re fighting for. This?! 
                        I look down at my essay, I’m about 
                        to start in. I pick up my pencil.  

           He lowers his voice, smiles his dimpled smirk.

                                 WILL 
                        And then I set it down and I stand 
                        up. Everyone’s looking at me. My 
                        desk kind of squeaks when I stand 
                        up and I swear to god every single 
                        head in this beige fucking 
                        gymnasium snaps up. And it feels 
                        good. And I realize, I can’t do it. 
                        I don’t want to. I don’t want to be 
                        a lawyer. And I won’t.   

           Charlotte approaches, smiling. Will’s back is to her, and she 
           sees the awed faces of the crowd of friends before she hears--

                                 WILL 
                        So I walk the fuck out of the bar 
                        exam. 

           His BUDDIES react -- cheering, laughing, mashing their 
           glasses together. They all find this very cool and inspiring.   

                                 WILL 
                        Right? Fuck that!

           Charlotte looks stricken. Now, she doesn’t know exactly how 
           to make her presence known. Or what to do with the cake... 
           LIZ, 30s, locks eyes with Charlotte, reading Charlotte’s 
           face, realizing that Charlotte is just learning this now.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (soft)
                        Hi.

           Will turns to her, shielding her, a little marital side-bar. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey, oh, hey, baby.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Wait, so-- I-- why did you do that?
                                 WILL
                        First, calm down.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Don’t tell me-- I am calm. Why 
                        didn’t you talk to me before?

                                 WILL
                        I decided in the moment. 

           She lets out a horrified little laugh. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That’s great. I mean before now.

                                 WILL
                        Listen, we’ll talk later. Let’s 
                        just have fun, okay? Our friends 
                        are all here. Don’t be weird.

           Charlotte looks like she’s been punched in the stomach. 

           INT. LUCCA’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The cake, decorated with the scales of justice and frosting 
           that reads, “CONGRATULATIONS, WILL!” is half-eaten.

           Liz and Charlotte, off to the side, share a slice. Liz is a 
           sweet, hip, tomboy-ish academic, a Midwestern transplant, 
           completely assimilated but for a tinge of an Ohio accent.   

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I had no idea.

                                 LIZ
                        Fuck. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s okay. I just... Sometimes I 
                        wonder how this all happened. 

                                 LIZ
                        You mean these men in our lives, or 
                        their arbitrary-ass decisions?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yes. 

           Liz laughs, forking herself a bite of cake.  

                                 LIZ
                        Jonathan got a tattoo last weekend. 
                        Totally spontaneous. Poor guy.  
           Across the party ANGLE ON Liz’s web-developer husband, 
           JONATHAN, ex-MIT, wearing khakis and a Google watch.  

                                 LIZ
                        I was like, honey, you don’t have 
                        to... who are you trying to be? I 
                        felt bad for him. But also, like, 
                        what the fuck? I have to look at 
                        that thing for the rest of my life.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Are they crazy, or are we, for 
                        signing up for this?

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m getting us some booze. 

           When she gets up, something strikes her: she sees ADRIAN’S 
           FACE in the crowd. She smiles... but then looks again, and 
           it’s gone. She shakes her head, brushing off the fantasy.

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door swings open. Einstein springs up and dances around 
           Charlotte and Will’s feet as they enter wordlessly.

           Charlotte dumps her keys on the kitchen counter. 

           She’s hungry to get into this discussion, but she resists. 
           She pours herself a whisky. And then one for Will. She slides 
           the glass to him. They’re both already a little drunk. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        So.

                                 WILL
                        Here we go.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        See, I haven’t even said a word and 
                        already I’m in trouble with you. I 
                        feel like I have to walk this 
                        tightrope. If I call you on your 
                        shit, suddenly I’m the nag. I’m a 
                        villain for asking questions. 

                                 WILL
                        Go ahead. Ask questions.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay. Why?

                                 WILL
                        I didn’t want to be a lawyer. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        The bar exam is grueling. It’s the 
                        most stressful, miserable part of 
                        the process, it’s designed to make 
                        you feel that way. 

                                 WILL
                        Apparently it worked on me, then. 

           Charlotte takes a long sip and pours more whisky. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s so much to throw away. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re talking about the money.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m talking about resources. Time. 
                        Money.

                                 WILL
                        Your money.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did I say that?

                                 WILL
                        You didn’t have to.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Our money. That we chose to invest 
                        in you. That was a decision made by 
                        the two of us, and now you’ve made 
                        a decision completely without me--

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know what you want me to 
                        say.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Really? Because it feels pretty 
                        obvious what I want you to say... 
                        my god, it feels so obvious it’s 
                        like painted across my face. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                        I want you to say, “Charlotte, I 
                        had a crazy epiphany and I know it 
                        sounds on the surface irresponsible 
                        and, frankly, idiotic, and I 
                        apologize that I didn’t share it 
                        with you, and that you had to find 
                        out about it in front of all of our 
                        friends, but I have a new plan for 
                        what I want to do, and here it is.”

                                 WILL
                        Don’t condescend me, Charlotte.   

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m not. 

           She knocks back another shot of whisky. Closes her eyes.

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        Okay. Sorry. Let me genuinely ask 
                        you-- what do you want? What do you 
                        want to do? 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know yet. I’m going to 
                        think about it. 

           There’s something so vulnerable about Will but also so 
           infuriating. She stares at him, about to respond, when...

           ...a loud, mechanical BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP startles them both. 
           She looks down at her pager’s display. Her face falls.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fuck. 

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I have to go. They think... I’m on 
                        call. Shit. Shit, I’m not supposed 
                        to be on call tonight. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re going to go? Why don’t you 
                        call someone. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        There’s an emergency. That’s not 
                        how it works.
                                 WILL
                        You’re seriously going to go, like 
                        this?

           Maybe he means mid-fight. Maybe he means a few drinks deep. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yep, you know what, it’s not ideal. 
                        To go to work right now. It’ll he 
                        hard, and stressful, and waaahh I 
                        don’t wanna. But guess what, Will? 
                        This is what people do. To some 
                        people, their commitments matter.

                                 WILL
                        And when is something besides work 
                        going to matter to you?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Maybe when something else is as 
                        important or as challenging or as 
                        consistent or as exciting or as 
                        fucking good to me. Maybe then? 

           She barrels out the door, leaving him seared by this.

           EXT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Sirens BLARE as an ambulance tears through traffic and up 
           over the curb. HOSPITAL WORKERS swarm and the doors fly open.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Charlotte rushes into the surgical ward. 

           She crosses with Adrian, nearly slamming into him as she 
           hurtles down the corridor. He walks with her--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Hey. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re still here?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Yeah, I-- are you okay?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Got a Code Trauma, two minutes. 

           His looks at her. Clocks that she’s a little bit ‘off’...  
                                 ADRIAN
                        Page me if you need anything. I’m 
                        in OR 4 but I can peel away.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (thanks, but screw you)
                        Thanks but I’ve got it.  

           AT THE DOUBLE DOORS

           Charlotte CLOSES her eyes for a second. Swallows. Touches her 
           head. Then, FUCK IT, she’s doing this. She shoves through--

           A RUSH DOWN THE HALL -- EMTs push a wheeling stretcher and 
           Kara, Mitesh, and a couple RESIDENTS hustle along. Charlotte 
           joins them and sees the patient, JAY HAMILTON, 18, 250 
           pounds, motionless on the plastic spinal board. Skin sallow. 
           Eyes closed. Blood dripping from his nose.   

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the story?

                                 EMT
                        Eighteen-year-old male identified 
                        as Jay Hamilton, unrestrained 
                        driver in an SUV rollover. Ejected 
                        from the vehicle. Unresponsive to 
                        pain. Pulse a hundred, BP 110 over 
                        70, breathing at 30 on his own... 
                        Blood Alcohol is .24.   

                                 KARA
                        Trauma Bay 1.  

           TRAUMA BAY

           A tiled room full of monitors and surgical equipment. A 
           frenzied dance of activity begins: RESIDENTS lift Jay onto 
           the bed. NURSES cut off clothes, take vital signs, pierce an 
           IV line into his arm, clip sensors to fingertips.   

                                 NURSE
                        Catheter is set. Can I get O-2?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Turn it up full blast.

           An oxygen mask is placed over his nose and mouth. 

           Charlotte’s eyes go to a OXIMETER: a screen shows the oxygen 
           saturation of Jay’s blood. His breath is shallow, fast.  
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He’s not oxygenating well. We want 
                        him up to at least 95.

           ON THE MONITOR: the O-2 sat hovers around 89. 

           Charlotte dips her fingers into his mouth and feels. Nothing. 
           With her stethoscope she listens to his lungs, eyes darting 
           back to that oximeter every few seconds... it dips to 85. 

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        No obstruction, no lung collapse. 
                        Okay, let’s tube him.  

           Charlotte removes Jay’s oxygen mask.

           A RESIDENT hands her an L-shaped metal tool. Harsh and 
           primitive looking. With one fluid motion Charlotte slips it 
           DEEP DOWN JAY’S THROAT and cocks the handle up with a YANK. 

           Jay is still unconscious. His tongue is depressed, out of the 
           way, his mouth open. And now Charlotte can see... 

           BLOOD down his larynx, spurting everywhere! This is bad.

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        Suction! I need suction, I can’t 
                        see a goddamn thing.

           A RESIDENT suctions the blood away, as Kara palms Charlotte a 
           rubber tube, as thick as an index finger, about a foot long.

           Struggling to see through the flowing blood, Charlotte SNAKES 
           THE TUBE down JAY’S THROAT. But she hits resistance.  

           She forces the tube, but it is BANGING against something...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        His vocal cords are swelling, the 
                        airway is shutting down--   

                                 KARA
                        O-2 down to 70. 

                                 MITESH
                        Yeah, his BAC isn’t helping us.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Exactly. 

           Jay’s lips are turning blue. Charlotte’s beginning to PANIC.

                                 KARA
                        Down to 65. 
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We’re losing the airway. Get me 
                        anesthesia, get me a trache kit.

           Everyone scurries to work, CHAOS as orders are shouted--

           Charlotte’s POV: she’s sweating, the room is cacophonous, a 
           blur of moving shapes, the pressure suffocating. ALL EYES are 
           on her, and the nurses and doctors can see that their captain 
           is losing it... she’s shaky, not quite herself...

           The OXIMETER starts BEEPING LOUDLY. It’s at 60... Charlotte 
           presses the 0-2 bag over Jay’s face and pumps the balloon. 

           Kara unwraps a sterilized bundle of instruments, sets up 
           surgeon’s knives and what looks like a plumber’s elbow joint.

                                 MITESH
                        Should we call Dr. Wu or Dr. Coons?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. Just get me better light.

           She palpates Jay’s throat, smeared with brown bactericide. 
           She presses the scalpel to his NECK. Breathes. And SLICES. 

           Mitesh braces the wound with retractors as she cuts DEEPER. 

           She could kill Jay if she screws this up.

           She sticks the TUBE into the wound, but again-- a blunt WALL.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        There’s too much blood. I’m working 
                        blind here, can I get some suction 
                        and some fucking LIGHT, please?!
                             (breathless)
                        His vocal cords are swollen from 
                        the blood and the alcohol. I can’t 
                        get the tube past them-- it won’t--

           LIGHT shines in Charlotte’s face. Too bright. She winces. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 KARA
                        Let me get you help. Call Dr. Wu. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. There’s no time! Let me think.

           She clenches her eyes closed. Jay’s O-2 has dipped so low 
           that the Oximeter can no longer detect it. And his heart...
                                 KARA
                        Heart rate falling. 

           Charlotte’s eyes spring open, lit up with an idea--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Mitesh, get me a pediatric trache 
                        tube. 

                                 MITESH
                        What? That’s not--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        My hands are small enough. 
                        Pediatric endotrache-- NOW!

           Everyone rushes in search of what Charlotte wants. Drawers 
           and cabinets SLAM. Mitesh produces a much smaller, thinner, 
           clear plastic tube. Charlotte takes it. Determined, reaches 
           one of her tiny hands RIGHT INSIDE JAY’S SLASHED NECK.

           Blood GUSHES all over her.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I can thread this through the 
                        cords. Get him breathing for us, 
                        then we can do a proper trache...

           ON CHARLOTTE’S FACE as her fingers struggle to hook the tube 
           through. She can’t see into Jay’s throat, but she can feel. 

           It’s taking longer... longer... his heart rate is dropping... 
           Mitesh and Kara share a worried look... 

           She bites back her panic. Her chest heaves. She stares ahead, 
           determined. Grinding her teeth. This will not defeat her.

           Time is ticking. Every second that Jay is without oxygen his 
           heartbeat slows, as the MONITOR shows. Beep... beep... 

           ADRIAN appears in the doorway and takes in the chaotic scene.

                                 ADRIAN
                        What the hell is going on in here?

           Kara is about to explain--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Everyone, SHUT UP!

           Silence. The room is rapt, held hostage by this brutal 
           moment. Charlotte focuses. Blood is spilling everywhere. She 
           whispers, maybe to herself, maybe to Jay, maybe to God-- 
                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Come on. You can do this.

           And SUDDENLY... THE OXIMETER and the HEART RATE MONITOR chime 
           to life. The tube is through... Jay’s oxygen climbs...

                                 KARA
                        Heart rate is back! O-2 climbing.

           Holy shit. She did it. A communal moment of relief before the 
           room ERUPTS INTO CHEERS. Charlotte, drenched in blood and 
           sweat, drinks it in. Stunned that she pulled it off at all. 

           Her eyes lock with Adrian’s. He applauds her, GRINNING. 

           She shimmers in the success of this moment. It’s a rush.

           INT. TRAUMA BAY - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

           Charlotte washes her hands and catches her reflection in the 
           mirror. She looks like shit, but she can’t help but smile. 
           Buzzing that she succeeded, despite everything.  

           INT. WAITING AREA - NIGHT

           Charlotte speaks with Jay’s mother, MARCY, 40s, and uncle 
           DON, 50s, both careworn but genuine people. Don has an Irish-
           Catholic-tough-guy energy but he is in tears. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He’s alive.

           Marcy’s fingers clutch a rosary in her sweater pocket. 

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        The challenge was getting his 
                        oxygen levels up. He was without 
                        oxygen for almost three minutes, so 
                        we don’t know exactly what the 
                        effect will be. 

                                 MARCY
                        Thank you. Thank god. Thank god he 
                        made it. 

                                 DON
                        We’re just grateful he’s with us.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        So are we.
           EXT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - ROOF - NIGHT

           Adrian finds Charlotte on the roof, freezing, still riding on 
           the adrenaline of her success.

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        You saved that kid’s life.

           His voice jars her out of her own head. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Say it out loud.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Say, “I saved a life today.”

           His arm brushes against hers. She doesn’t pull away. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Why not? You did.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Because that’s vain, and dangerous. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        We live through so much fucked up 
                        stuff in this job. The pain, the 
                        disappointment, the lack of 
                        control. I hate that. It drives me 
                        crazy. You’ve got to celebrate the 
                        times it goes right. You have to, 
                        or else you’ll disappear. You need 
                        that for your ego, or else you’ll 
                        just... die.   

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re a narcissist.

                                 ADRIAN
                        A damn successful one. 
                             (leaning in, a whisper)
                        I dare you. 

           His breath plumes out of his mouth, cutting through the cold 
           air. She looks up at him, her eyes glinting.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I saved his life.  
                                 ADRIAN
                        What? I’m sorry. That got swept up 
                        in the wind.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You heard me.

           She laughs. He presses his hand to the small of her back. She 
           flinches... surprised by this... strangely awoken by it. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You were amazing. 

           Her eyes scan him. His muscular arms, his chest. His 
           intelligent, serious face, scruffy now after the all-nighter. 

           She traces him with her eyes. There’s this burning intensity 
           to him that makes her feel so fallible and bendable...

           ...and the thing is, that feels good...

           He leans closer to her. He’s going to kiss her. And she 
           becomes acutely aware in this moment that she could have this 
           man if she wanted him. It’s a sexy, powerful rush-- 

           But also TERRIFYING. She abruptly PULLS AWAY. He steps back.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (warning)
                        Adrian.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Right. 
                             (recovering)
                        You should go. Get some sleep. 

           There’s a flicker of pain on his face, but it’s fleeting. He 
           reaches out to hold the door for her as if nothing happened.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - NAP ROOM - DAY

           On the top bunk, Charlotte tries to sleep. She tosses and 
           turns. She flips her pillow. She can’t get comfortable. 

           Something is gnawing at her. 

           She rolls onto her side, indulging herself. Her lips curl 
           into a smile. A daydream plays across her eyes.    

           She lets them close, somewhere between sleep and dreaming...
           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Charlotte pulls ingredients from a Dean & Deluca bag on the 
           counter. Will comes home, sweats and fleece jacket.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hi.

                                 WILL
                        Hey.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Will, I’m so sorry. I feel terrible 
                        about what I said.

                                 WILL
                        It’s okay. And I’m sorry, too. 

           He smiles. She expects them to launch into a discussion -- 
           kind of hoping to get to the bottom of things -- but instead 
           he picks up an onion and tosses it to her. She catches it. 

                                 WILL
                        Do you want to do Iron Chef?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You want to? Or you want to eat 
                        something good? 

                                 WILL
                        Mine will be good. Yours remains in 
                        question. The secret ingredient 
                        is... 
                             (perusing the groceries)
                        This fine artisinal pickled 
                        asparagus that probably cost more 
                        than our mortgage. 

           She smiles, relieved that he’s so upbeat. 

           LATER

           Charlotte twirls her fork through fettucine in a skillet. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Somehow this is amazing despite 
                        that dumb asparagus. 

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean, somehow?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I mean you’re a little bit magic.
           He looks at her, gathering some courage in this calm moment.

                                 WILL
                        I’m gonna venture into dangerous 
                        territory here. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay.

                                 WILL
                        Because I actually have an idea.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh? That’s great.

                                 WILL
                        It’s a photography thing but it’s 
                        not a photography business. It’s an 
                        app that helps you take better 
                        pictures with your smartphone. 
                        Like, the rule of threes for 
                        example. Composition, focus, it’s 
                        all about toggling variables and 
                        math. So what if an app could do 
                        that for you. Jonathan could help 
                        me build it. It’ll be no big deal, 
                        I feel like building it is the easy 
                        part. Two years from now we sell it 
                        to Instagram for ten million 
                        dollars. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That’s cool. I mean, Jonathan has a 
                        full time job, but... 

           She looks at Will, wanting desperately to encourage him.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I think it’s a great idea. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They watch LOUIE in bed. Will eats ice cream from the carton. 
           Light from the TV shifts across Charlotte’s preoccupied face.   

           LATER

           The end credits scroll. Will cuddles up to Charlotte. 

                                 WILL
                             (half asleep)
                        How was work? I never asked. Your 
                        day...
           She takes a moment, thinks about what to say. Like they’re 
           kids at a sleepover, she rolls over, whispers--   

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I saved someone’s life. 

           But Will is out cold. Charlotte touches his face.  

           She gets up to put away the ice cream carton. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - DAY

           Charlotte moves through the recovery ward. She stops outside 
           a room and reaches for the file in the plastic holder at the 
           door. It’s not there. A NURSE, JEROME, 30s, at the station, 
           notices Charlotte’s confusion as she moves inside.

           RECOVERY ROOM

           Slightly deflated GET WELL SOON! balloons, blankets, take-out 
           containers litter the room. But the hospital bed is empty.

           The sheets have been stripped. Charlotte looks around.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did this patient, Hamilton--

                                 JEROME
                        He didn’t make it.

           Charlotte is gobsmacked, but she hides her shock.

                                 JEROME
                        Went overnight. Lost too much 
                        oxygen.

           Charlotte nods, fighting to stay professional. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlotte moves down the hall, in a daze.  

           An elevator door opens and Marcy and Don spill into the hall. 
           Flanked by ANNA, 12, Jay’s sister, and handsome, shell-
           shocked BRIAN, 18, built, tall, a friend, or maybe boyfriend, 
           of Jay’s. They look rough, tired, chewed up by sadness. 

           Charlotte reaches a feeble hand up to wave hello to them, and 
           she begins to head over, ready to offer comfort, but--
           Marcy unleashes a TERRIBLE, PRIMAL SCREAM, full of hate and 
           grief and fury. Don pulls her against his shoulder. She hides 
           her face. Brian’s eyes stay trained on Charlotte. 

           Charlotte continues down the hall towards her office. With 
           each step, willing herself not to crumble. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte collapses into shaky, silent tears.

           INT. CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Adrian barges into her office without knocking.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Get your coat, I’m taking you out.

           Charlotte tries to hide the fact that she’s been crying.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What? Where?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Where I go when things get really 
                        fucked up at the hospital. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m in the middle of something.

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s not a question. 

           He takes her coat from the hook at the back of the door. 

           INT. RUBIROSA - DAY

           A dark, old-school Nolita Italian joint. The sound of 
           sizzling mozzarella from a brick oven. Adrian and Charlotte 
           are tucked into a booth in the corner.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’ve lost patients before 
                        obviously, but never because I... 
                        shit. I should have worked faster. 
                        I should have been thinking faster.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’re right. You should’ve. You’re 
                        a terrible doctor. The worst.  
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay, okay.
                             (then, serious)
                        Do you think I’ll get sued?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Probably not. If you do, that’s why 
                        we have insurance. And you have a 
                        lot of allies at the hospital. 
                        Plus, it’s not like they’ll be able 
                        to prove any negligence.

           She considers this, the complex truth churning inside her.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fuck. He was so young.

                                 ADRIAN
                        That’s enough. You can’t do this to 
                        yourself. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I know.

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s the worst part of our 
                        business. We have to play god, and 
                        therefore we’re not allowed to 
                        acknowledge when mistakes happen. 
                        Fucks with your sense of reality.   

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re right. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        We gotta move on. 

           He makes a little plate for her from a dish of meatballs. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Here. Best meatballs in the city.  

           She takes a bite. It’s heaven.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Hey-- for the record, I didn’t come 
                        up with that Viral Doctor thing. I 
                        hate it.

           Charlotte chuckles. He’s happy to see her smile.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s so embarrassing.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It really is.

           But he’s also stung by the way she agrees.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        But, really, it’s nothing. Your 
                        name means so much more than that. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You think I’m a fame monger. But 
                        I’m not. It’s the price of wanting 
                        to do the type of big-scale things 
                        I do. You get to a certain level--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I know, I know. And I respect your 
                        ambition. I relate to that. I do. 

           Charlotte tries to pry herself away from this intimacy.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well. This was good. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Rubirosa’s is a cure-all. 
                             (a beat)
                        I like talking with you.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It feels good to talk about work 
                        with someone who gets it.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’ll talk about whatever you want.

           A spark of exhilaration shoots through her. But she tries to 
           steer the conversation back to work. A weird impulse--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What happened to the Sanumas in 
                        Venezuela?

                                 ADRIAN
                        How long have you been waiting to 
                        ask me that?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t know.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I scare you.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. I just need to know.

                                 ADRIAN’S
                        I saved 156 lives with my anti-
                        measles medication. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How many people died?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Sometimes things get fucked up. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did they die because they were 
                        going to die, or did they die 
                        because of you?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Oh, you don’t want to do that.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What?

                                 ADRIAN
                        You don’t want to start keeping 
                        score with me. Especially after 
                        last night. 

           She balks, and he holds her gaze with charged intensity. Kind 
           of unsettling and yet fascinating, this serious, unflinching 
           confidence. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte’s curled up in her desk chair, shoes kicked onto 
           the floor, her face buried in her computer -- on FACEBOOK.

           She clicks on her own profile picture, a candid of CHARLOTTE 
           AND WILL cuddled on someone’s velvet couch at a party. 

           She clicks through more old profile pics, looking at her life 
           like it belongs to someone else: CHARLOTTE AND WILL eat ice 
           cream on a park bench. Then, dressed up at Liz’s wedding. 
           CHARLOTTE in skis and WILL on a snowboard; she grins, he sits 
           on the mountain rolling his eyes. Finally, CHARLOTTE in her 
           gauzy dress, gazing at WILL, at their rustic outdoor wedding.   

           Her cursor blinks in the search box. She takes a moment. Then 
           types: “Jay Hamilton.” Nothing. She closes Facebook, looks 
           around like she might get caught, then types it into GOOGLE.  

           A YouTube channel loads. She CLICKS on the first video. 
           It’s a CLAYMATION VIDEO. A face pops into frame. It’s Jay. 
           Charlotte’s heart skips a beat. He’s so alive, so happy.  

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        All right, followers, here’s a new 
                        sketch, Mr. Rogers meets Timothy 
                        Leary kinda vibe, hope you enjoy--

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The apartment is a mess. Charlotte sits with her laptop, 
           frayed and exhausted. Will clicks through movies on TV. 

                                 WILL
                        Where are we ordering dinner?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Why do I have to decide?

                                 WILL
                        Because I’m picking the movie. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Babe, I truly don’t care.

                                 WILL
                        Well what do you feel like?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I feel like you deciding. I’m not 
                        that hungry.

                                 WILL
                        How are you not that hungry? Just 
                        pick whatever you want.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh my god. Honey, I’ve been making 
                        decisions all day. I’m exhausted. 
                        You can handle this one, okay?  

                                 WILL
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

           Charlotte sighs deeply. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 WILL
                        Clearly you’re not done with this. 
                        So just go for it.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We’re not done with it! We barely 
                        had one conversation about it. 

                                 WILL
                        Go ahead then. Cry it out.

           She wants to not take the bait. She knows she should be the 
           bigger person. But can’t not say what she’s thinking.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Was it self-preservation?

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I mean: you don’t walk out of the 
                        bar exam if you think you’re going 
                        to pass.

                                 WILL
                        Wow.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I get it if you don’t want to be a 
                        lawyer. It’s totally fine. I even 
                        get it if you realize that during 
                        the test. But why quit? Why would 
                        anyone who thinks they have even a 
                        modest chance of passing the test 
                        throw away all that effort and time 
                        and pain? It’s such a waste. At 
                        least, like, press on. Get through 
                        it. Finish what you started. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m not gonna keep suffering for 
                        something I don’t even want!

           Charlotte rolls her eyes and gestures like, ‘that’s life.’ 

                                 WILL
                        But maybe I’m just lazy. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No! Don’t say that. You’re 
                        brilliant. You’re creative and 
                        funny and quick but you sell 
                        yourself short, that’s the truth.

                                 WILL
                        Yep. And you’re perfect. You do 
                        everything perfectly.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. Not at all. In fact, today I--

           Will rises, raises his arms and SHOUTS, loud and animated:

                                 WILL
                        Doesn’t everyone know?! Does the 
                        world know? Charlotte is perfect. 
                        Charlotte is the best doctor in the 
                        world! She’s the perfect doctor. 
                        She can fix anyone. In fact, 
                        Charlotte is GOD! Do you hear that, 
                        everyone?! CHARLOTTE IS GOD!

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I never said that. I...

           She can’t speak. Tears burn behind her eyes.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m going for a walk.

           She scoops her keys off the counter and heads to the door.

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

           Charlotte walks fast, awash in thought. A stoplight changes 
           as she approaches the street -- DON’T WALK. She sees a CAB 
           careening towards the intersection, but she’s confident it’ll 
           stop for her, so she STEPS off the curb...

           SCREECH!!! The cab SLAMS its breaks, nearly hitting her. The 
           DRIVER SCREAMS out his window at Charlotte.  

           She takes out her phone as she makes it to the sidewalk.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (into phone)
                        Hey. I’m sorry. Can we talk?

           INT. PEGU CLUB - NIGHT

           A dark SoHo bar. Two empty glasses, a bottle of Tequila 
           between them. Charlotte sits next to Adrian. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I did something fucked up.
                             (then)
                        I Googled the kid. He went to a 
                        magnet performing arts high school 
                        He had an Instagram and a bunch of 
                        funny YouTube videos...
                                 ADRIAN
                        ...with the claymation. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Shit. You too. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        That doesn’t count as fucked up. 

           Charlotte absorbs this. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Look. The sum of who you are as a 
                        person is not your mistakes. Or 
                        else all the interesting people in 
                        the world are screwed.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Sounds like a convenient philosophy 
                        for bad people.

                                 ADRIAN
                        We’re all bad people just trying 
                        not to be.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Says the guy who gets treated like 
                        God walking among us--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Who says God isn’t a bad person?

           She laughs. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re drunk.

           He fills her glass with Tequila. A challenge. And she becomes 
           aware that he’s very close to her. Here she is, in this dark 
           bar across town, with this man who’s not her husband.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I should probably go.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Do you really want to leave?

           She doesn’t answer. Her face is hot. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’m going to say something.
                             (a drawn out beat)
                        Something was going to happen on 
                        the roof last night. 
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did you... want something to 
                        happen?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Yeah. And so did you.  

           He puts his hand on her thigh. She doesn’t move a centimeter. 

                                 ADRIAN 
                        How does that make you feel, to 
                        hear me say that?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Flattered.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Flattered. Okay. But anything else?

           He moves his hand further up her leg. Slowly. Her eyes close. 
           It actually feels painful for her to say the words--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I should go.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Okay. Let’s get you a cab.

           He gets up, nonchalant. Charlotte’s head is spinning. 

           INT. PEGU CLUB - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Charlotte stumbles down a long, dark, claustrophobic corridor 
           that leads to the door. Music from some club nearby POUNDS, 
           distorted, all around them. Adrian walks ahead of her...

           Charlotte’s bursting out of her own skin. In one motion... 
           she GRABS ADRIAN BY THE ARM and pulls him to her, hard.  

           She shoves into him and kisses him, giving over to it, this 
           feeling that’s so much bigger than she is. Adrian kisses her 
           back hungrily... his hands on her arms... her face... her 
           body... every inch of her electrified... she bites his lip... 
           he pushes her against the wall... she GASPS...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ADRIAN’S SOHO LOFT - NIGHT

           Adrian’s gorgeous midcentury apartment. Darkness shrouds the 
           living room, the black-and-white kitchen, a collection of 
           antique toys, a sleek Scandinavian desk, stacked with work--
                                 CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                        Shit. This is bad.

           We find Charlotte and Adrian in the entryway -- on the floor. 
           He kisses her chest. They tear off clothes. Frantic. His 
           hands all over her body... his eyes bright, locked on hers... 

                                 ADRIAN
                        This is the opposite of bad.

           She tugs him closer to her, but he sinks down, below her 
           waist. Her eyes roll back, the torment dissolving. She 
           surrenders, in insane, never-felt-so-alive, shivering bliss.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I think I’m obsessed with you.

           She laughs as he focuses his attention on her. Determined, 
           but not rushing, stretching out every second of this...

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Charlotte opens the door as gingerly as possible. Her keys 
           jingle... she cringes... Einstein jumps up, paws tapping the 
           hardwood. She steps in. Looks around. It’s... sobering.  

           She sees that Will is sprawled on the couch, asleep. A couple 
           bottles of beer on the coffee table. A MOVIE plays too 
           loudly; shoot-em-up, lots of EXPLOSIONS.   

           Charlotte watches Will for a moment, lost in thought. 

           Einstein WHIMPERS and snaps her out of it.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay, okay.

           EXT. MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS STREET - NIGHT

           Charlotte walks the dog down the street. She waits as 
           Einstein sniffs around a frail, frozen tree. 

           A strange smile creeps across her face. She brings her hand 
           to her mouth and lets out a weird little cry. Halfway between 
           a laugh and a scream, a sound of SHOCK.

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           When Charlotte comes back inside with the dog, the TV is off 
           and Will is gone. She looks around, alarmed.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Will?

           BEDROOM

           She finds him under the covers. She leans against the bed. 

                                 WILL
                        Thanks for walking the dog.

           She almost begins to cry, more out of fear and surprise and 
           confusion than anything else... 

                                 WILL
                        Where’d you go?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Just for a drink. 

                                 WILL
                        Where?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh, that place-- the Cricket Club.

                                 WILL
                        By yourself?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. 
                             (then, fuck)
                        With Liz.

           She lets Will coax her into bed. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey, baby, it’s okay. We’re going 
                        through a thing, but we’ll get 
                        through it. We always do. Love you.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I love you too. 

           Charlotte stares at the wall, her heart clenched like a fist.

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Charlotte lets the water flow over her as she leans her body 
           against the cool glass. QUICK FLASHES haunt her, relentless: 

           --Her fingertips on Adrian’s bare chest.

           --Adrian’s neck, his muscular shoulders, his freckly skin.
           --Adrian’s lips on her stomach. His lips on her hipbone. 

           --He squeezes her shoulders, massaging her neck, hard.

           She lets her eyes close. She reaches down, out of frame.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Charlotte and Liz trudge the icy path, past the Alice in 
           Wonderland statue, mittened hands clutching coffee cups. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Sometimes you see someone and you 
                        think, ‘Huh. You’re interesting.’ 
                        If things had gone another way, I 
                        could see that... happening...

                                 LIZ
                        And all these TED talks about how 
                        marriage is a relic of a time when 
                        we lived til 30. But I guess I want 
                        to believe, so I do believe.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How good do you think married sex 
                        is supposed to be?

                                 LIZ
                        We have our moments, but it’s a lot 
                        of... maintenance. I guess I’d 
                        rather have less sex and make it 
                        count.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Do you remember-- first time, 
                        crazy, can’t-get-past-the-foyer 
                        sex. Do you remember that? 

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah but-- that kind of excitement? 
                        It’s the mystery. Fear. 
                        Anticipation. Not knowing entirely 
                        who the other person is, or what 
                        they think of you-- they could 
                        surprise you or change their mind 
                        at any second. It’s not even really 
                        about the sex. It’s intimacy with 
                        way more at stake.  

           Charlotte feels this in her bones.
                                 LIZ
                        I think we’ll always wonder about 
                        what other people would be like...  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You don’t think it’s something you 
                        can get out of your system.

                                 LIZ
                        Actually, I don’t know. Maybe.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - HALLWAY - DAY

           Adrian rounds a corner. Charlotte watches from down the hall, 
           then intercepts him. Nervous, but resolved to clear the air-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hi.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Hey, Charlotte.

           He doesn’t suppress a smile. She swallows, worried.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Can we talk? We need to talk.

                                 ADRIAN
                        We’ll be late for the M&M.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I want to be direct with you. I 
                        think you can probably imagine that 
                        I need to say and I just want to--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Find me afterwards. 

           He keeps moving, and she’s stunned by his nonchalance. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - AMPITHEATRE - DAY

           Polished wood, plush seating, oil paintings of the hospital’s 
           best doctors. The mood is tense and serious as doctors 
           gather. A projection reads: Morbidity and Mortality. 

           A weekly meeting where deaths and mistakes are discussed. 

           In the front row, the big shots -- Sonia, Carlson, Wu. 

           FIND Charlotte, a few rows back, wringing her hands. 
           LATER

           From the podium, a non-surgical CHIEF TRAUMA RESIDENT we 
           recognize from the Hamilton case, LOPEZ, wraps up his report. 

                                 LOPEZ
                        ...after several traches were 
                        attempted unsuccessfully, the 
                        pediatric E.T. tube was placed, and 
                        the patient recovered stable 
                        vitals. A tracheostomy was 
                        completed later in the OR. Having 
                        lost a significant amount of 
                        oxygen, the patient went into fatal 
                        cardiac arrest during the night. 

           Awkward, prickling silence. Carlson jumps in. 

                                 CARLSON
                        What do you mean? How many traches 
                        and why ‘unsuccessfully?’ What the 
                        hell happened? 

           Charlotte sits up straight, gathering courage--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        This was my case. And I’d love the 
                        opportunity to elucidate some 
                        complicating factors, like the 
                        patient’s BAC three times the legal 
                        limit, his extremely large neck, 
                        and the poor lighting due to--

                                 CARLSON
                        Why didn’t you get more suction, 
                        more light? Another attending?

           Two hundred judgemental faces peer down on her. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He was GCS 7 when he arrived. We 
                        had no time to spare, and--

                                 CARLSON
                        It’s either a problem of skill or a 
                        problem of support. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’ve done dozens of tracheotomies.  

                                 CARLSON
                        Then you were in over your head in 
                        this case.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No.

                                 CARLSON
                        Someone screwed up here. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I found a creative solution when we 
                        were out of options.

                                 CARLSON
                        Why didn’t you call for help?

           It feels futile, but Charlotte’s about to respond, when--

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        She did. 

           Charlotte turns to see Adrian stand up, across the room.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Gordon called me for help. I came 
                        down and watched as she had the 
                        ingenious idea to apply the 
                        pediatric tube, which by the way, 
                        because of the amount of swelling 
                        and blood, required her particular 
                        stature and precision. That patient 
                        would’ve died on the table.  

           She can’t believe what she hears... it’s not true... but in a 
           way, it feels part of a higher truth... and she’s grateful. 

           Carlson considers this, deflected if not satisfied. 

           INT. ADRIAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte enters and shuts the door behind her. 

           Adrian, behind his desk, searches for a book. She watches 
           him. He ignores her. The bridge of his glasses slips down his 
           freckled nose. He stubs it with his thumb, clumsy, masculine.

           At the window to the hallway, she flicks the blinds CLOSED.

           She moves closer to him, testing the waters. Unsure of how 
           far she’ll go... He smirks. They’re magnetic. 

           He GRABS her, assertive. Her legs wrap around him. She’s on 
           his desk... He’s ripping off her pants... She pulls his 
           shirt, intense and decisive. And they have sex right there. 

           LATER
           Charlotte pulls on her scrubs. She rambles, nervous, guilty.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I didn’t think that was going to 
                        happen. The M&M. You think a male 
                        doctor would have gotten their ass 
                        handed to them like that? It’s 
                        funny, the kind of low-grade sexism 
                        we deal with... Always there, 
                        insidious and just subtle enough. 
                        If sexism was radioactive, I’d have 
                        like six toes on each foot, but I 
                        wouldn’t notice for years, and--

                                 ADRIAN
                        You know what’s funny? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What?

                                 ADRIAN
                        In school, you rejected me.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What? I didn’t reject you-- 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Now here you are. Talking. I want 
                        to watch you talk for hours. What 
                        were you even saying, I don’t know.

           He kneels down before her and tries to kiss her bare stomach.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I was saying thank you. For what 
                        you said. But listen, Adrian--

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s true, wasn’t it?

           Charlotte hesitates, unsure how to respond.

                                 ADRIAN
                        By the way, these are for you. 
                        Surgeries to choose from. 

           He reaches to his desk and hands her a thick folder of 
           DOCUMENTS and PHOTOS. Applications for surgeries in Laos.    

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Wow.
                             (parsing through, then...)
                        This can never happen again. It 
                        will never happen again. I mean it. 
                                 ADRIAN
                        Then why don’t you get back to 
                        work. Don’t you have patients?

           Charlotte, a little surprised, turns to leave.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - DAY

           A serious-looking ADMIN pokes her head in Charlotte’s door. 

                                 ADMIN
                        Dr. G? Risk Management needs to see 
                        you. 

           Charlotte’s head snaps up. She tries to sound upbeat.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Sure, thanks.

                                 ADMIN
                        ASAP.

           Charlotte’s terrified. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlotte walks by Adrian’s office, just to check...

           He’s not inside. 

           Fuck. Could this possibly be about them, their relationship?

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - BASEMENT - DAY

           The bowels of the hospital, a low-ceilinged network of 
           hallways. The hum of florescent lights. There never seems to 
           be another person down here.  

           She hurries, her sneakers squeaking on the tile. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - BASEMENT - TINY OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte sits in a small, cluttered office across from a no-
           nonsense but compassionate HR worker, LILIAN, 40s.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        So they’re suing me.
                                 LILLIAN
                        These cases almost always settle. 
                        Proving negligence in an ER trauma 
                        situation is nearly impossible.    

           Charlotte wonders about this, guilt swirling in her chest...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        This has never happened to me 
                        before. Am I allowed to go back and 
                        look at the patient’s file?

                                 LILLIAN
                        We advise against it. You’d have to 
                        sign out the old files, and that 
                        would be reported to opposing 
                        counsel. That can sometimes seem--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Suspicious.

                                 LILLIAN
                        Like you’re covering your tracks. 

           Charlotte processes this, freaked.

                                 LILLIAN
                        One last thing. And this is 
                        important. Don’t discuss the 
                        details of what happened with 
                        anyone. Not even with your spouse.  

           Lillian looks at Charlotte’s wedding ring. Charlotte 
           instinctually fidgets with it, twisting it around. 

                                 LILLIAN
                        They can depose anyone they want so 
                        it’ll make everything easier if the 
                        lawsuit goes forward if you just-- 
                             (making a zip-lip motion)
                        Okay? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay. 

           EXT. MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS - NIGHT

           Will and Charlotte walk the dog. He clocks her far-off gaze, 
           her troubled expression.   

                                 WILL
                        I can tell something’s up. 
           She straightens. Will taps her temple with his fingertips. 

                                 WILL
                        The little hamster in there is 
                        running on its wheel. What’s going 
                        on? Work. It’s work. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I dealt with a trauma that, um... 
                        it was a tough loss.
                             (Finally)
                        I’m getting sued for malpractice. 

                                 WILL
                        Shit. Babe. I’m so sorry. Holy 
                        shit. Tell me-- what happened? What 
                        was the case? When was this? What 
                        was the deal, why’d the patient... 

           Charlotte immediately feels uncomfortable rehashing it.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I can’t. I’m not supposed to, 
                        legally. 

                                 WILL
                        But it’s bothering you. You should 
                        let it out-- you can trust me. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh, I know I can, honey. 

           He takes her hand and squeezes it. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte’s head is in her hands. Adrian, in jeans and a 
           cashmere sweater, looking smart and sexy, paces. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Rubin & Rudman’s their firm-- 
                        they’re sharks. And expensive. Must 
                        be deferred payment, the lawyers 
                        think they have something.
                             (then)
                        I’ll take care of it.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What do you mean? 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Trust me. Do you want to save your 
                        career? I’ll figure something out. 
           Charlotte’s trepidatious about what he has in mind. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        If you’re trying to gain some 
                        currency with me...

                                 ADRIAN
                             (wry)
                        Of course I’m not.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It wouldn’t work...

           He moves closer, playful, a step beyond office-appropriate. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I know. 

           She tries not to look at him... but she also doesn’t move 
           away as he rests his elbows down on her desk and leans 
           there... His breath, the warmth of his body, so palpable. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        What are you thinking about?

           She doesn’t answer. She clenches her eyes closed. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’re smiling. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (smiling)
                        No, I’m not.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Say it. It can’t be that bad. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You fucking smell good. That’s what 
                        I’m thinking. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I smell good. Thank you. 
                             (then, sincere)
                        You want to know what I’m thinking?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’m gonna have to tell you--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Adrian, don’t--
                                 ADRIAN
                        Your clavicle.

           Charlotte snorts, stifling a laugh.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Specifically this one freckle on 
                        your clavicle. I can picture it. I 
                        wake up thinking about it. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay, okay. That’s enough.

           Adrian pulls away from her, back to business. He withdraws 
           and shifts gears with no problem. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’m serious about the lawsuit. I do 
                        want to help. There are ways that 
                        we could address this--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, I’ll handle it. 

           He shakes his head gravely, like ‘it’s your funeral.’ 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Thanks, anyway. I should go... 

           She doesn’t finish. Very slowly, she gets up to leave--

                                 ADRIAN
                        You know about absolute thresholds.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        The smallest amount of stimuli the 
                        brain can detect... 

                                 ADRIAN
                        A ticking watch 20 feet away. In 
                        the darkness-- a candle flame, 30 
                        miles off. A fly flapping its wings 
                        three inches from your cheek. But 
                        scent-- lucky for you-- you can 
                        smell a single drop of fragrance 
                        like three or four rooms away. 
                        So, all I’m saying is... enjoy! 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Wow, you’re a poet. And a dork.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’ll be here when you decide you 
                        change your mind. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        About the lawsuit. 

           Charlotte almost speaks, but instead she leaves...

           HALLWAY

           She fights herself, fights the urge to pivot back to him. She 
           leans against the wall. After a beat, she peels herself away.  

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - FILING OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte signs her name to a sheet. An ADMIN slides her a 
           file with JAY HAMILTON marked across the top.

           AT A TABLE

           Charlotte draws in air and opens the file. She has brought 
           along a notebook and a pencil. She’s about to turn to a fresh 
           page in the notebook when she sees-- the JUXTAPOSITION: 

           Her neat, controlled handwriting in the notebook. Next to her 
           notes in the medical file -- MESSY. SCRAWLED.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fuck.

           She closes the file.

           EXT. HELL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlotte and Adrian get out of his car and walk up to a 
           building. Adrian’s messenger bag slung over a shoulder. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Tell me exactly what you agreed on.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Look, you’re in this now, okay? 
                        Don’t worry. It’ll be fine.

           INT. MODEST HELL’S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           At a Formica table, in a cheap linoleum kitchen, Adrian 
           counts CASH. Charlotte sits in a chair with her eyes on her 
           hands. Don sits at the table watching Adrian stack the money.    

           Brian looms over them in the doorway. Arms crossed. He’s 
           built like a linebacker, but he’s just a kid. Weak, shaky.
           Don, gin-blossomed, hoarse cough, seems more menacing than 
           before. Charlotte feels his eyes move to her. She looks down.

           A TV plays somewhere off screen, a cartoon. It’s unclear what 
           other people might be in this apartment. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        That’s 500k. 

                                 DON
                        On the phone you said one million. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        This is good faith. You get the 
                        other half tomorrow by Western 
                        Union when you drop the lawsuit. 

                                 DON
                        I don’t like it. Feels like you 
                        switched the deal.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Take it or leave it.

           Adrian gathers up the money, ready to leave.  

                                 BRIAN
                             (quiet)
                        He’s worth more.

                                 ADRIAN
                        What?

                                 BRIAN
                        He’s... his life... is worth more 
                        than... a million dollars. 

           Brian’s voice is low and unsteady.

                                 ADRIAN
                        It isn’t ‘worth’ anything. Human 
                        life. There’s no market value on a 
                        dead person. It’s nothing. Okay? 
                        All that’s real is what I want you 
                        to do and what I’m willing to pay 
                        for it. It’s up to you. You can 
                        have a million dollars, or you can 
                        have nothing. Which is it? 

           Charlotte can’t look at him. Don nods, accepting. Yes, okay. 

           Brian’s eyes are on Charlotte as she fights to hold in tears.
           INT. ADRIAN’S CAR - NIGHT

           Adrian’s comfortable driving fast, changing lanes, whipping 
           around other cars. He turns to Charlotte.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You want to get a drink?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, thanks. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’re saying no to a drink?

           Charlotte looks at him, curious and a bit offended.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Even in school you never said no to 
                        a drink. I used to see you 
                        teetering down to the Red Line and 
                        worry that one day something bad 
                        was gonna happen. 

           Charlotte stares out the window. The city rushes by-- a blur. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Charlotte showers. The water is scorching, steaming up the 
           glass, but she shivers. She drinks a glass of bourbon. Gulps. 

           She sets it up on the ledge where the soap usually goes.  

           INT. SMOKE JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

           A five-piece band jams on the stage. A saxophone TRILLS.

           Charlotte, Will, Liz, Jonathan, a flannel-clad guy named NED, 
           and a third married couple, KATIE AND NOELLE, dressed up from 
           their office jobs, all 30s, tucked into a booth. Charlotte, 
           frayed, jittery. To her horror they’re reliving an old story--

                                 LIZ
                        I forced her. I wrote her whole 
                        OkCupid profile one night while we 
                        watched Intervention. Remember his 
                        pictures? You had a real casual 
                        shirtless one in the mix, Will. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He was so cute. And I did not think 
                        he would buy what I was selling. 
                             (summoning enthusiasm)

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                        Then he wanted to meet at Dave ‘n 
                        Buster’s at the Chestnut Hill Mall? 

                                 NOELLE
                        Dave and Busters, for real?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I wasn’t sure if it was supposed to 
                        be ironic... or earnest...

                                 WILL
                        Anyone who says they don’t enjoy 
                        Dave n’ Buster’s is full of shit. 
                        Same goes for the Cheesecake 
                        Factory, and U2. People are just 
                        afraid to like what they like. 

                                 NED
                        I fuckin’ hate the Cheesecake 
                        factory.

                                 WILL
                        No you don’t, though, you know?

                                 KATIE
                        Anyway, it wasn’t ironic. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We played skee ball. We challenged 
                        some drunk teenagers to air hockey. 

                                 WILL
                        She was so competitive! After being 
                        quiet the whole night-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I was just trying to figure you 
                        out! The oozing charm, it’s hard to 
                        tell if it’s sincere at first--

                                 WILL
                        These kids come out of the woodwork 
                        and suddenly she’s so intense. 
                        She’d never even played air hockey, 
                        and she wanted to beat them so bad. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You were gonna let them win.

                                 WILL
                        And I thought, this girl is 
                        confusing and adorable and weird 
                        and way smarter than me and it’s 
                        fucking great. 
           She rests her head on his shoulder. A knot in her chest. The 
           BAND’S riff builds to a crescendo. The symbols clang...

                                 LIZ
                        We were thinking of checking out 
                        the Cricket Club later. 

                                 WILL
                        Oh, weren’t you two just there?

                                 LIZ
                        I’ve actually never--

           Charlotte interrupts this with lightning speed.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Will, you never told anyone about 
                        the app. 

                           KATIE
                                                           NED
           What app?
                                              Shit, you’re gonna do that 
                                              thing?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, yeah, I am. As soon as we 
                        raise some startup cash, Jon’s 
                        company is going to code it... 

           Will launches into pitch mode. Off Charlotte, a close call...

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlotte, coming from surgery, pauses when she sees Adrian 
           down the hallway. She doubles back...

           He’s chatting, animated, laughing, with a YOUNG FEMALE 
           DOCTOR. He gesticulates, leaning closer to her... 

           Charlotte lets herself watch for a moment, uncomfortable. 

           She turns and walks in the other direction. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Charlotte plops down a tray of food next to Sonia, who’s half-
           focused on some paperwork alongside her lunch.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hey, so-- That family dropped their 
                        suit. 
                                 SONIA
                        Oh, good for you. That’s a relief.  

           Charlotte nods, relaxed, and is on her way out.

                                 SONIA
                        Heard you’re doing the Laos trip 
                        with Coons.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m co-chairing it. Actually, I 
                        want to talk to you about supplies. 

                                 SONIA
                        You knew him at HMS, right? Coons?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Not really. We had like a section 
                        or two together. I don’t think I 
                        had a full conversation with him 
                        til he came here. I remember he 
                        graduated first in our class, 
                        though, did you know that? 

                                 SONIA
                        You think he lets anyone forget it?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I know he’s arrogant. I know. But 
                        he’s... effective. 

                                 SONIA
                        There’s a fine line between genius 
                        and... whatever else. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You really think he’s a genius?

           Sonia says this like it’s kind of a shame.

                                 SONIA
                        Oh, absolutely.    

           INT. ADRIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Stacks of surgery applications. Lists of supplies and 
           projects fill the board. Adrian is popping a 25-year-old 
           bottle of champagne when Charlotte walks in, a bit cold...  

                                 ADRIAN
                        We’re celebrating. The rest of our 
                        Laos financing came through.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I thought we were already funded.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Just the last little bit. Here, 
                        take a glass. I got sushi, too-- 
                        but first, cheers--

           He hands her a glass. She takes it. Clinks, halfheartedly.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        So this is how you work, huh?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Oh, yeah. Stick with me.  

           LATER

           Charlotte and Adrian pore over applications. She stretches 
           out on his couch. She slips a document into the ‘no’ pile. 
           She takes a sip from her champagne coupe.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        What was that?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        A spinal reconstruction. Fused 
                        vertebrae. Super risky. I don’t 
                        think we’ll have the resources. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Underachiever.

           He takes it and puts it in the ‘yes’ pile.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s not essential. The mortality 
                        risk is high and no guarantee her 
                        quality of life would improve--

                                 ADRIAN
                        We can pull it off. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What if we don’t?

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s gonna be intense. That’s the 
                        deal. 
                             (then)
                        I was thinking-- maybe we can sneak 
                        off for a couple days over there. 
                        Hop over to the Thai islands. 
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

                                 ADRIAN
                        What are we gonna do that’s worse 
                        than what we’ve already done?

           She smirks, mischievous, relishing this attention, despite 
           herself. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hey. Back to work.

           INT. JOE’S SHANGHAI - DAY

           Liz and Charlotte eat soup dumplings from straw baskets. 
           Outside, snow pelts the windows of the bustling restaurant.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Do you remember when we were 
                        talking about... infidelity? 

           Liz sees Charlotte’s stricken face. She sets down her spoon.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I wasn’t totally transparent about 
                        the context of that conversation.

           Charlotte holds Liz’s gaze, and something dawns on Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my god. No. You’re kidding me. 
                        That asshole. He... cheated? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. I did. I slept with someone. 

                                 LIZ
                        Shit, no, I thought it would be...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        The other way around?

                                 LIZ
                        No. I didn’t mean that.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s okay. That’s what anyone 
                        would’ve predicted.

                                 LIZ
                        Jesus. Back up. Who is it? How did 
                        it happen?
           Charlotte fiddles with her chopsticks. 

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        This guy... made it clear he wanted 
                        to... and saying no felt so wrong, 
                        like I was clipping my own wings. 
                        So I just gave into it. You know 
                        how they say we only use 10% of our 
                        brain? Which is completely 
                        scientifically wrong, by the way, 
                        but imagine it’s true. I felt like 
                        I was using 100% of my brain and 
                        100% of my body with this guy. I 
                        was just so awake. Fuck. 

           ON Liz as she absorbs this. 

                                 LIZ
                        How many times?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Just once. 
                             (then, surrendering)
                        Twice.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m going go ahead and be hard on 
                        you now.

           Charlotte braces herself.

                                 LIZ
                        If this is about your marriage, fix 
                        your marriage or get out of it like 
                        a real person. If this is about 
                        something else, then fucking figure 
                        it out. Don’t let it happen again. 
                        Make sure this your mis-- Jesus, 
                        there’s no male word for mistress. 
                             (back on track)
                        Make sure he knows it’s over. And 
                        do not tell Will.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How terrible do you think I am?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t think you’re terrible. This 
                        happens. Fuck, this happens like 
                        all the time, to almost everyone, I 
                        think. It could happen to anyone. 
                        But -- it’s a grenade. If it was 
                        Jonathan? I wouldn’t want to know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        What’s terrible is blowing up 
                        everything over a stupid mistake. 

           Charlotte, nods, deeply agreeing.

                                 LIZ
                        Go home. Get a huge oxytocin hug 
                        from your husband. Remind yourself 
                        all the reasons you want to protect 
                        that. And keep your mouth shut.

           Off Charlotte...

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte sorts through mail. A couple trade magazines, 
           bills, and then a small brown envelope. No return address.   

           She tears open the envelope with her thumbnail and pulls out 
           a thin stationary THANK YOU card. She smiles as she opens it. 

           Written inside in red ball-point pen is one word: 

           killer

           Charlotte sets it down on her desk. She checks the back. The 
           envelope. Nothing. Disturbed, she throws it in the trash. 

           INT. ALOGONQUIN HOTEL - NIGHT

           Charlotte and Adrian have a working dinner at a couple of low 
           leather chairs with library lamps. She reads a proposal -- a 
           photo of a LITTLE BOY on the cover. Adrian peers up at her. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Do you ever want to have kids?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh man. The dog’s enough. For now.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Ugh-- I didn’t mean. Ugh. 

           Disgusted, he looks away, down at his iPad, hurt. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I didn’t mean with that guy.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        My husband? Well what did you 
                        think...
           She isn’t sure how to navigate this. He cleans his glasses.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You know... I could kill him if you 
                        want me to.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That’s not funny.

                                 ADRIAN
                             (cracking himself up)
                        Real peaceful. He’ll go out on a 
                        cloud of morphine.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Jesus. You’re an asshole. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Our kids would be so smart. 

           Adrian types an email. Charlotte considers him. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did you send me that note? As some 
                        kind of joke? 

                                 ADRIAN
                        What note?

           He’s so nonplussed, not even looking up, he seems sincere.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Nothing.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

           Adrian walks Charlotte to the subway, through the electronic 
           glitz and flashing-light-chaos that is Times Square.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        I have to tell you something I 
                        haven’t told you before.

           Charlotte tenses, unsure where this is going-- 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I love Times Square.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (laughing)
                        You do not. You’re way too much of 
                        a snob to love Times Square. 
                                 ADRIAN
                        No, see, snobs love Times Square. 
                        It’s a new subversive thing. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        All these people.

                                 ADRIAN
                        But we’re inside a kaleidoscope. Or 
                        one of those electric peg-boards, I 
                        loved those things as a kid--  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        A Lite-Brite. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Exactly. You had one too?

           She nods. They’ve reached the entrance to the train.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Let’s go get dessert. Come on.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, I can’t...

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s just one more hour.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, sorry. I have to go.   

           He just stands there, forcing her to leave first. It’s oddly 
           difficult. Finally she descends. 

           CLOSE on her face as she leaves him, tantalized. 

           EXT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S BUILDING - DAY

           Lots of foot-traffic. Charlotte pauses in front of the 
           rapidly revolving door, closes her eyes... steps in.

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Charlotte and Will cuddle on the couch. He shows her a sketch 
           of a prototype of his app’s design. It’s actually quite good. 

           Her phone rests next to her, on the edge of the couch.
                                 WILL
                        See, the idea is if I try to frame 
                        up a shot, this little icon will 
                        nudge me one way or the other until 
                        I get the best composition I want. 
                        Or I can set it on the timer, say I 
                        was gonna put it here and take a 
                        picture of us, and the app will 
                        automatically focus and offer me 
                        three different compositions. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Wow. You’re really doing this.

                                 WILL
                        You sound surprised.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. Not at all. I’m just excited.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t get excited yet. Jon helped 
                        me out over a few beers, but now I 
                        gotta raise some capital so he can 
                        pay his guys to code it. Thinking 
                        about a Kickstarter. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh yeah? How much do you need?

           Charlotte’s phone PINGS and she scoops it up.  

                                 WILL
                        Um, Jon said like fifteen grand.

           Charlotte looks at the screen. It’s a TEXT from ADRIAN COONS.

           She sets it down without opening it. SILENCES the phone.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh, wow. 

           The screen faces up, and THREE MORE TEXTS come in, rapidly. 

           She glances down at the phone to get a peek. Will notices... 
           she flips the phone face-down back on the couch. 

                                 WILL
                        You have to take it?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What? 
                                 WILL
                        Your phone.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, no. Hey, you know what, I think 
                        I-- we should invest. 

                                 WILL
                        Really? You don’t have to--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I want to. Seriously.

           Will is touched.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Charlotte shuts -- and locks -- the bathroom door behind her.  
           She takes a breath, checks her phone. 

           Texts from Adrian: “Where are you?” “Let’s work today.” “Come 
           over.” She ignores them.  

           INT. LUCCA’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Charlotte and Will enter arm in arm. The HOSTESS greets them 
           with a couple of menus, brings them to their usual table.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I am starving. How about halvsies 
                        on the steak and the smoked trout. 

           Will is distracted. Charlotte’s eyes are on the menu. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Or do you want the pesto? I’m open 
                        to negotiation.

                                 WILL
                        Isn’t that...

           Charlotte looks over her shoulder to see Adrian, sitting at 
           the bar and drinking a glass of wine, reading a book. 

                                 WILL
                        Doctors-without-borders.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Um, yeah. Yeah, it is. 

           And at this moment Adrian looks up and catches her glance.
           She freezes for a moment, spooked by this.

           But Will smiles his thousand-watt smile and waves.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, man, how’s it going?

           Adrian sets down his book and turns to them with a shy smile. 
           Charlotte’s eyes don’t move from his face. 

           LATER

           Adrian sits with Will and Charlotte as Will digs into a mound 
           of burrata. He spoons some onto Charlotte’s plate, but she is 
           suddenly not hungry at all. Adrian commands the conversation. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        But that’s the Catch-22 of off-
                        labeling Serotonin-specific re-
                        uptake inhibitors. 
                             (to Will)
                        You following here? Sorry... 

           Will couldn’t be more gracious.

                                 WILL
                        Doing my best. But please, don’t 
                        slow down for me.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We don’t need to have this 
                        conversation now. Work talk. It’s 
                        the weekend.

           Will puts his arm around her.

                                 ADRIAN
                        We can talk Monday. I just thought 
                        it might be good for the trip.

                                 WILL
                        Trip?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Charlotte didn’t tell you?

                                 WILL
                        No.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You didn’t tell him? We’re going to 
                        Laos in June for six weeks. 
           Will shoots Charlotte a look, good natured but enjoying this 
           bit of ammo--

                                 WILL
                        That wasn’t a plan she decided to 
                        tell me, I guess. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well, it’s all very early-stage...

                                 ADRIAN
                        We’ve chosen almost all the 
                        surgeries. And we’ll have a clinic 
                        open while we’re there too. Do you 
                        know how many lives she’s going to 
                        save? Okay, okay, how many lives 
                        we’re going to save, together?

                                 WILL
                        That sounds really incredible. 

           Will clearly feels left out that he didn’t know about this. 
           But as he always does, he lets it roll off his back.

           The waitress comes over and looks to Adrian.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sir, did you want to transfer your 
                        check over here, or--

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’ll have another, thanks. 

           Charlotte looks ill. Adrian is tipsy and very talkative--

                                 ADRIAN
                        So, Will. How is the law treating 
                        you?

                                 WILL
                        Hasn’t caught up with me yet. I’m 
                        always two steps ahead of my parole 
                        officer.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I mean your work. Charlotte said 
                        you’re a lawyer.

           Charlotte touches Will’s leg under the table.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Actually, I said Will went to law 
                        school, which he did. Fordham--
                                 WILL
                        I’ve decided to kind of change 
                        directions. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Is that right? Cool. What’s your 
                        new direction? 

           He leans in, picks up his glass, swirling his wine. 

                                 WILL
                        I’ve always been interested in 
                        photography. At one point after 
                        college I was a wedding 
                        photographer, parties, you know...

                                 ADRIAN
                        Fascinating. 

           Adrian eyes Will like a shark. Charlotte stews.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How’d you find this place, anyway?
                             (piercing)
                        Don’t you live downtown?

           As soon as she says it, she realizes it was a risky move.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What?

                                 ADRIAN
                        You recommended it. You don’t 
                        remember? The other afternoon, when 
                        we were up on the roof, talking--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Right. I remember now.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I was going to get together with 
                        this woman I’m seeing, but then I 
                        got stood up, can you believe that?

                                 WILL
                        No, that sucks. 

           Adrian looks at Charlotte. His gaze is searing. After a beat, 
           Adrian turns his attention back to Will.
                                 ADRIAN
                        Anyway, Will, you were saying, 
                        about your photography...

           Charlotte endures this, agonized...

           INT. USED BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

           Charlotte and Will meander through the dusty aisles of their 
           neighborhood bookshop. They have the place to themselves.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        So the thing is I wasn’t sure if 
                        I’d want to go--

                                 WILL
                        But you do want to go--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yeah, I think so... but I’m sorry I 
                        didn’t mention it before.  

                                 WILL
                        It’s okay. 
                             (then)
                        You know, on TV he’s such a mousey 
                        guy. Nerdy. I always forget how 
                        kind of aggressive he is.

           Charlotte plucks a book off the shelf, considering this. 

                                 WILL
                        You realize he has a thing for you, 
                        though, right?

           She bristles.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t think so.

                                 WILL
                        Something ever happens to me, he’s 
                        the first guy in line. He’s 
                        refilling your chardonnay glass at 
                        my freakin’ wake. I promise you.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No...

                                 WILL
                        I’ve met that guy what, a dozen 
                        times in the past however many 
                        years, and I always get that vibe. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        He’s just taking you in, with this 
                        kinda... thirst. 

           Charlotte’s mouth twitches into a messed-up little smile.

                                 WILL
                        It’s okay, you can be complimented 
                        by that.

           Charlotte puts the book back and moves off. Will laughs.

                                 WILL
                        It’s flattering. He’s a good 
                        looking guy. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What-- what does that have to do 
                        with anything?

                                 WILL
                        Raises the stock of the compliment. 

           She shakes her head, overwhelmed.

                                 WILL
                        Come on. You’re human, you can 
                        admit that it feels good to be 
                        attractive to other people. Not 
                        just my ass, who’s stuck with you! 

           Charlotte feigns a laugh.

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           In the middle of the night, Will stirs. Charlotte’s eyes 
           shoot open. He kisses her neck, warm and sweet. He hooks his 
           fingers in the waistband of her shorts and tugs them down.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        My retainer. 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t care.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Let me go take it out.

           She moves to get up and go to the bathroom. 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t worry about it.
           He’s so sweet, but it’s so crushingly lackluster to her. She 
           massages her own shoulder. She closes her eyes. She lets her 
           mind take her someplace else...

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           ON Adrian’s face as he silently reads over a speech he has 
           written. His lips find their way around each word. He pauses 
           for emotion, for faux-humility, to “search” for a phrase...  

           The room is set up for a presentation on the trip to Laos. 

           Charlotte bursts in. She closes the door behind her.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Oh, good. Thanks for coming early. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What the hell was that? Showing up 
                        at the restaurant. Tormenting Will. 
                        You knew it was my day off--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Tormenting him?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yes!

                                 ADRIAN
                        What are you, his mother? 
                        Protecting him from big, bad adult 
                        conversation.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        For the record, he’s wonderful, and 
                        very bright--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Yes. Keep telling yourself that. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fuck you. Fuck all of this. 

           She pulls on the door and Adrian stands to slow her.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Charlotte, okay. I’m sorry. I’m 
                        sorry. I was out of line. I 
                        probably had too much to drink.
                             (a pointed beat)
                        It happens to the best of us.

           He sizes her up. 
                                 ADRIAN
                        Doesn’t it?

           She tries to discern his meaning, not saying a fucking word.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I want you to know, I’m not just 
                        infatuated with your brain... your 
                        body... but I think I’m in--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Adrian. Stop. Don’t do that. You 
                        don’t want to do that. 

           This is a knife in Adrian’s heart.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We made a mistake. And I don’t want 
                        to leave this project. But I need 
                        to be sure that you’re going to... 
                        respect my situation. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Respect your situation? Wow.

           Charlotte STARTLES as the door opens from the outside. 

           It’s Sonia and Carlson, ready for the meeting.  

                                 SONIA
                        Are you guys ready for us?

           Charlotte looks to Adrian, worried that he may snap, but the 
           anger on his face melts away. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yes, come on in. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Will struggles with a tie in front of the mirror, while 
           Charlotte hunts for a missing shoe.  

                                 WILL
                        The truth is sometimes the sucky 
                        things do get you thinking... about 
                        life, and what I’ve set out to do 
                        for myself, what makes me happy, 
                        and what I want. Not just the 
                        immediate things, but long term.

           Intrigued, she looks at his reflection.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        And?

                                 WILL
                        And... 

           He makes a playful face. A familiar kind of pleading look.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. Not now. This is the worst 
                        time. 

                                 WILL
                        Maybe not right now, but soon. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I can’t handle this conversation.

                                 WILL
                        Let me just say. There’s never 
                        going to be a perfect time, to talk 
                        about it or to do it. We always 
                        said we’d have kids. And you act 
                        like we’re so young, but we’re not, 
                        not really. And when we do have 
                        kids, one of us will need to be 
                        home more, need to be around them, 
                        and that’s obviously not going to 
                        be you, but now, I could-- 

           A RAP-RAP-RAP at the apartment door. Charlotte freezes, 
           fearing for the worst like a sick reflex. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’ll get it.

                                 WILL
                        Saved by the bell.

           She hobbles over to the door with her one shoe. Opens it to 
           find a DELIVERY MAN, holding burlap-wrapped mason jar FULL OF 
           FLOWERS, a burst of color against the bleak hallway. 

                                 DELIVERY GUY
                        Charlotte Gordon?

           She takes the flowers, her eyes landing on a RED ENVELOPE 
           nestled amongst the lilies.   

           Fuck. She practically slams the door in the guy’s face.

           She looks over her shoulder. The coast is clear-- she plucks 
           the card from its plastic stem and tears it open.
           Inside is a typed-out card, “I LOVE YOU.” Her hand trembles, 
           holding the card. Around the corner, she can hear Will, O.S.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        We should bring a bottle. Did we 
                        ever open that Balvenie from a 
                        couple weeks ago?

           She stuffs the card in the sink and pushes it down the 
           garbage disposal. She turns on the faucet. The wet paper 
           bleeds RED DYE onto her fingers.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh, I’m not sure... let me check.

           She finds a plastic bag and throws it over the flowers. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Where is it?

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Up in the cupboard, I think.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Okay, give me a second...

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        That’s okay, I’ll...

           Will walks in, looking like a million bucks, catching 
           Charlotte in the middle of what she’s doing.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll find it. 

           She stiffens. She rests her hands on the bundle, protective.

                                 WILL
                        What are you doing?

           He smiles, those dimples like quotation marks around his good-
           natured smirk. He registers the mason jar. 

                                 WILL
                        Flowers. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I think they must be from a 
                        patient, but I have no clue how 
                        they got the home address, and 
                        lately I’m feeling so allergic...

           Charlotte’s heart is banging in her chest. Like a bird 
           slamming around in its cage. 
                                 WILL
                        Since when are you allergic?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I didn’t know I was ‘til like two 
                        weeks ago when there was this huge 
                        thank-you bouquet in the surgery 
                        lounge, and I had to pop a Benadryl 
                        to get through my shift. Allergies 
                        like that can develop later in 
                        adulthood. It’s really common. 
                        Anyway, so weird...

                                 WILL
                        No, no. They’re from me. 

           Charlotte’s face falls.

                                 WILL
                        Didn’t you look at the card?

           He crosses over to her side of the sink.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        There wasn’t a card.

                                 WILL
                        Really? They screwed up. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        But thank you, baby, that’s sweet.

           Will snorts, looking at the nearly-disposed-of gesture. 

                                 WILL
                        You’ve been kind of down. 
                        Understandably. So... Thought that 
                        counts, right?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Thank you. 

                                 WILL
                        You better go get ready. 

           She’s reluctant to leave the kitchen, not yet convinced that 
           this is all okay, but she finally retreats to the bedroom. 

           BEDROOM

           Charlotte opens the closet, looking at all of her nice 
           things. Her head falls to her hands. She rubs her temples.

           Willing herself to pull it the fuck together.
           KITCHEN

           Will reaches up into the cupboard and the unopened bottle of 
           Scotch is there, right in front, still has the bow on it.

           As he sets it down he notices red handprints on the dishrag.

           And a couple of red drops in the sink. Odd.

           A nagging sort of instinct-- he reaches down into the garbage 
           disposal and pulls out the sopping note and envelope. He 
           stares at the note. He squeezes it in his fist and watches 
           red-stained water drip into the sink. 

           He dips his head, haunted by this mundane strangeness...

           EXT. HOBOKEN STREET - NIGHT 

           Will parallel parks his rattling old Saab. Will and Charlotte 
           climb out, navigating the tall ledge of snow on the curb.

           INT. MARIN & LUKE’S HOBOKEN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           A farmtable is cluttered with plates. Ned, Katie, Noelle, 
           Charlotte, Will, Liz, Jonathan, and cool new parents MARIN 
           and LUKE are sprawled about the den. A grainy record plays 
           softly. People drink. Ned smokes a cigarette out the window.  

           Marin and Charlotte sit on a loveseat. Marin nurses her four-
           month-old BABY, a cashmere blanket draped over her shoulder. 

                                 NED
                        The ultimate relationship 
                        dealbreaker is the other person 
                        getting fat. 

           Everyone reacts, booing -- Marin glares at him. 

                                 NED
                        That’s the truth! Marin, I don’t 
                        mean pregnancy fat, I mean Shake 
                        Shack fat. You all feel the same 
                        way you’re just too PC to admit it. 

           He takes a drag on his cigarette.

                                 NED 
                        But I’m still single, so whatever. 

                                 JONATHAN
                        And probably having more sex than 
                        anyone here.

                        Dealbreakers from someone’s past-- 
                        is that fair? 

                                 NOELLE
                        Depends. We talking like, heroin 
                        addict? Or are we talking incest? 

                                 LIZ
                        Just some casual life experiences.

                                 JONATHAN
                        All that matters is who they are 
                        right now. Whatever they got over 
                        in the past, good for them.  

           Charlotte watches Marin and her baby, so tender. 

                                 MARIN
                        Did you want to hold her?

           Before Charlotte can think of a reason why not, Marin passes 
           over the baby. Charlotte holds her awkwardly, but Marin 
           helps. The baby raises her eyebrows at Charlotte, and 
           Charlotte laughs, disarmed. Charlotte settles in. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (to the baby)
                        Skeptical? I would be, too. 

                                 NOELLE 
                        For me, cheating is the only true 
                        dealbreaker.

           Charlotte’s skin gets hot, but she keeps her eyes on the 
           little baby. She doesn’t dare look up at Will. 

                                 NED
                        Is it really, though? I mean 
                        everyone says it is, but I think 
                        when it happens to you...

                                 NOELLE
                        Oh, it totally is for me. Once 
                        you’re married? Forget it. No one 
                        can get past it, it’s impossible. 
                        For the cheater, the paranoia will 
                        kill you. For the cheat-ee, the 
                        insecurity. You’re fucked. 

           For Charlotte’s sake, Liz tries to steer the conversation... 
                                 LIZ
                        My big dealbreaker would be a value 
                        shift. You know Addie’s husband? 
                        Started going to church a lot, 
                        decided he wanted to be baptized--

                        People who are happy don’t cheat. 
                        If you’re fulfilled, it shouldn’t 
                        cross your mind.

                                 KATIE
                        Shouldn’t. See that? I think it 
                        totally crosses your mind, but if 
                        you’re happy you just don’t do it.

                                 NED
                        Happy people cheat all the time. 
                        There was a thing on NPR. It’s 
                        biological. 

           Will, who’s been silent and detached the whole time, speaks.

                                 WILL
                        Cheating wouldn’t be a dealbreaker 
                        for me. 

           It takes all of Charlotte’s strength to act casual. The baby 
           squirms in her arms. 

                                 WILL
                        But lying would be. It’s not the 
                        cheating itself. I think people can 
                        get past that, if you get to the 
                        bottom of it. If the person came to 
                        me and said shit, I fucked up... I 
                        could probably find a way. But it’s 
                        the deceit. The feeling someone’s 
                        manipulating you, fucking with your 
                        sense of reality. The idea they’re 
                        creating some moving mirrors, some 
                        architecture so I won’t know what’s 
                        going on? That’s really what we’re 
                        all afraid of. Not the sex, not 
                        even the emotion, that sucks but 
                        that’s not the worst thing. It’s 
                        being separated from all of that...

           His eyes are on Charlotte, who does her very best not to 
           unravel. She tightens her grip on the baby. 

                                  WILL 
                        As long as the person came to me, I 
                        think I could make it be okay. 
                                 NED
                        Nah, dude, I think you’d fucking 
                        flip out. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah. On the other hand, I might go 
                        crazy and kill the guy.

           Everyone laughs, even Will. Charlotte smiles along, chilled.

           INT. WILL’S CAR - NIGHT

           Will drives. Charlotte watches him, something on the tip of 
           her tongue. She’s about to speak, but then he looks at her 
           and she turns away. 

           She notices a sign on the highway, over their heads.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Honey. Can you pull off here?

           EXT. WEST MANHATTAN MAGNET ARTS - NIGHT

           A shrine to Jay Hamilton runs alongside a chain link fence.

           A few battery-powered candles flicker their fake flames over 
           soggy soft animals, little trinkets, notes stuck in the wire, 
           and a poster of Jay in a school production of THE CRUCIBLE.  

           Charlotte peers out from the window of the car. 

                                 WILL
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t know.

                                 WILL
                        You’re torturing yourself. 

           She dissolves into tears. Surprised, he holds her.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I can’t do it. 

                                 WILL
                        What, baby? What can’t you do?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I want to put it back together.
                                 WILL
                        Maybe I can help you.

           She looks at him. He’s so sweet, and so kind... She wipes the 
           tears with the back of her hand, takes his, and kisses it.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Will, I... I made a mistake. 

           His face falls, and his expression grows hard. 

                                 WILL
                        I fucking knew it. 

           He puts the car in park. His voice is guttural, frightening.

                                 WILL
                        Talk. Everything. Now. 

           She keeps her eyes on her lap and draws in air to speak.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The HAZARDS of the Saab FLASH as other cars whip around it. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They’ve been at this for hours, and they’re both battleworn, 
           past the point of making sense, tired and raw. Charlotte’s 
           curled on the couch in a blanket. Will paces, aggressive. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We can go over it as many times as 
                        you want. All your questions. But 
                        maybe we should sleep...

                                 WILL
                        He’s such a fucking loser. 

           It’s a weak affront, and heartbroken, Charlotte agrees. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He’s a jerk.

                                 WILL
                        And you’re worse.

           She hangs her head. Will can’t look at her.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I know.
                                 WILL
                        You’re going to therapy, and you’re 
                        going to get to the bottom of this 
                        bullshit--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Absolutely. I’ll get a referral 
                        tomorrow. And maybe... the two of 
                        us can see someone, also. 

                                 WILL
                        Because I’m a part of this, right?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, I just... Well, yes. Look, this 
                        is going to sound harsh but... 

           She wrestles with whether to finish her thought. Then--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        The only way it works -- marriage -- 
                        is if somehow we can say all the 
                        ways that we’re not good enough. 
                        That you’re not good enough for me, 
                        and that I’m not good enough for 
                        you. We have to keep trying to be 
                        good enough. And we have to be 
                        honest. It has to be our life’s 
                        work. That’s what I fucked up. 

                                 WILL
                        Honest? Okay, I’ll go first. 
                        Charlotte, you’re a selfish, 
                        greedy, arrogant BITCH! You think 
                        you’re hot shit and that you’re 
                        untouchable and that your work is 
                        more important than other people. 

           Charlotte takes this in, nodding deeply. 

                                 WILL
                        You know, you haven’t fucking cured 
                        cancer. You’re not as smart as you 
                        think you are. And if you don’t 
                        have that, what do you have? You 
                        think you ‘push’ me and I ‘ground’ 
                        you. Without me, you’d be miserable 
                        and lonely. You’d be alone.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re right. 

           Her face twists; she holds back tears. 
                                 WILL
                        Your turn. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t think that you challenge 
                        yourself enough. You don’t 
                        challenge me enough. I feel like I 
                        can’t talk to you about serious 
                        things. The default is me pulling 
                        the weight. And I resent that. I 
                        want the best. I want to be 
                        surprised and compelled and 
                        thrilled. I want to see you try.    

           Will absorbs this for a moment. 

                                 WILL
                        Did you want to kill us? Is that 
                        what this is? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        Sabotaging a situation you don’t 
                        know how to get out of. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. Not at all. I love you. This is 
                        what I want. I’ll do anything. 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know if I can.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What you said, at the party--

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, well--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (desperate)
                        Please! Please, just don’t say no 
                        yet. Just... please, Will. I’ll do 
                        anything for you. 

           She gets up and forces him to look at her. He fights it, but 
           then collapses onto her shoulders. She holds him. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re not going to Laos. 
           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - SONIA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sonia sits across from Charlotte, delivering terrible news. 
           Charlotte is so exhausted that she’s edgy and wired.

                                 SONIA
                        We need you to take a four-day 
                        leave of absence while we conduct 
                        an internal review.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Risk Management didn’t say anything 
                        about this.

                                 SONIA
                        It has nothing to do with the 
                        outside lawsuit.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m confused. 

                                 SONIA
                        There are some other areas that 
                        need to be explored. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Sonia.

                                 SONIA
                        There have been disconcerting 
                        rumblings. Of behavior that, if not 
                        negligent, certainly qualifies as 
                        professional misconduct.   

           Charlotte’s heart sinks to her stomach. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well that’s ridiculous.

                                 SONIA
                        I’m sorry we have to do this. But 
                        I’m sure everything will come out 
                        fine. We just have to look into it. 

           Charlotte opens her mouth to object--

                                 SONIA
                        I can’t say anything more. Take a 
                        few days. Try to relax. You look... 
                        stressed, Charlotte. We’ll have a 
                        meeting at the end of the week.

           Furious, Charlotte gets up and leaves.
           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlotte storms towards her office. She sees Adrian around 
           the corner and she rushes by without acknowledging him. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlotte pulls papers from her drawer and shoves them into 
           her bag. A desk photo of Charlotte and Will stares up at her.   

           Adrian doesn’t knock, he just opens the door--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Don’t fucking open my door like 
                        that.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Jesus, what’s going on?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did you say anything? About us?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Why would you accuse me of that?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Institutional review. “Professional 
                        misconduct.” That’s all Sonia would 
                        say. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        No! And anyway Sonia can’t tell you 
                        who to sleep with and who not to.

           She stops. She leans against her desk. Cowered over, 
           breaking. He moves closer, wanting to touch her... 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, no... I can’t. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Are you angry because we fought the 
                        other day?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What? Oh god. No. Adrian. I’m 
                        trying to save my marriage. 
                        Whatever game we’ve been playing, 
                        it’s over. I can’t go to Laos.

           Adrian nods, but he is clearly shaken by this. 
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Let’s stay away from each other.

           She grabs her stuff and pushes past him, out the door. 

           INT. HUNGARIAN PASTRY SHOP - DAY

           Charlotte breaks off pieces of a jam cookie, hardly eating 
           it, just crushing it to crumbs. Liz stares into her coffee.   

                                 LIZ
                        Why?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t know. I thought it would be 
                        better. It’s worse. I’m an idiot.

                                 LIZ
                        No. You’re brave. Maybe too brave.

           Liz rubs Charlotte’s back. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I convinced him to go away for a 
                        few days, get out of the city. We 
                        can talk more. See where we stand. 

                                 LIZ
                        That’s good-- and that you took the 
                        time off work. That’s a nice 
                        gesture. 

           Charlotte smiles meekly.  

                                 ADRIAN (PRELAP)
                        Thank you for having me. It really 
                        is such an honor to be here. 
                        Always a thrill. I’ve listened to 
                        you guys since I was in med school. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS over which Adrian’s NPR Interview plays...

           --The Saab parked outside Charlotte and Will’s brownstone. 
           They load their bags into the trunk. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        I’m excited to announce we’ll be 
                        headed to Laos in June, with an 
                        amazing group of surgeons from all 
                        over the world.

           --Charlotte gets into the driver’s seat. 
                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                             (through the car radio)
                        Some of my favorite people from St. 
                        Christopher’s in New York will be 
                        joining me...

           --Charlotte and Will drive through snowy Vermont. 

           --They approach a stunning boutique hotel, built into the 
           mountain. It looks beautiful. And expensive. Charlotte looks 
           to him for a reaction, but Will doesn’t respond. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        And actually this is all 
                        spearheaded by one of my oldest 
                        friends and an esteemed colleague 
                        Charlotte Gordon, who’s quite 
                        simply brilliant, and a badass 
                        trauma surgeon. Am I allowed to say 
                        badass on NPR? 

           --They drop their stuff in their lush, lovely room, not 
           really sure what to do now. Will looks window at the slopes.

           --Charlotte on skis, Will on a snowboard, they snake down a 
           slope as wide a football field. Charlotte forces a smile, 
           trying so hard. Will is in his own world. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        We’ll have a clinic and perform 
                        surgeries from bone grafts to 
                        corrective spinal surgery.

           --Will and Charlotte drink hot chocolate in the lodge. 
           Adorable 5-year-old TWIN GIRLS at the table beside them make 
           designs out of sugar packets, chattering. Watching them, Will 
           smiles for the first time that day. Charlotte returns it.

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        Like anything, it’ll be intense and 
                        grueling. But also life-changing 
                        for all of us.

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

           Icicles -- sharp, crystal-clear stalactites -- hang from the 
           awning. Beyond, the stars are bright... almost overwhelming. 

           Charlotte and Will, bundled up, share a pizza and some wine. 
           She’s tiptoeing around him, but, after a long silence-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We’ve barely talked today.
                                 WILL
                        I’ve been thinking.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That’s good. 
                             (well...)
                        I hope.

                                 WILL
                        The... mistake... it is what it is. 
                        You fucked up. If it’s the two of 
                        us forever, we’re going to go 
                        through worse. Maybe I’ll even fuck 
                        up. And we’ll have to survive.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Are you saying--

                                 WILL
                        Let me get this out. I think I can 
                        get past it. But the way I can get 
                        past it is to know that we’re on 
                        the same page-- that it really is 
                        you and me, no questions, for good--  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It is! It is, Will--

                                 WILL
                        Charlotte. Listen.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Sorry.

                                 WILL
                        I’m talking about a family. 

           She watches the icicles drip and crackle... Her eyes close...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Right now, there’s a lot of shit 
                        going on at work. I’m not even sure 
                        I’m supposed to be a doctor... I 
                        don’t know what’s gonna happen...

                                 WILL
                        That’s a lame excuse.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s not, you have no idea. We 
                        could lose the apartment--
                                 WILL
                        Of course you’re meant to be a 
                        doctor. It’s who you are-- 
                        whatever. That’s not the point. 
                        That has nothing to do with it.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Children can’t be collateral.

                                 WILL
                        What? Of course not. I’m not trying 
                        to lock you in. It’s the opposite. 
                        If I’m going to deal with the hell 
                        you’ve put me through, if I’m going 
                        to endure this nightmare, 
                        Charlotte, I want to know you’re 
                        in. And if you can’t picture it... 
                        If where you land on the kid thing 
                        is ‘I don’t know,’ then there’s 
                        just too much fucking ‘I don’t 
                        know’ in this relationship. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s not that simple. 

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, you know what-- it really is. 
                        I’m pretty simple. 
                             (painfully)
                        Do you want to have kids with me? 
                        Not ‘maybe.’ Yes, or no. 

           She tries to summon the right response, but she just cannot. 

           And he has his answer. He rises with resolve.  

                                 WILL
                        I’m... going to go.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, Will...

                                 WILL
                        It’s okay.

           Charlotte’s stunned -- paralyzed -- as Will leaves. 

           INT. SUITE - NIGHT

           Darkness. Charlotte, alone, lies on the bed. In this light, 
           the rich hotel room looks cold, lonely, generic.  
           INT. HOTEL - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Charlotte eats dinner at the bar, alone.  

           Her phone buzzes and she looks at it: ADRIAN COONS calling. 
           She DECLINES the call and silences her phone. 

           EXT. HOTEL - FROZEN GARDEN PATH - NIGHT

           The mountain peaks glisten in the moonlight. Charlotte walks 
           the perimeter, her breath dense and visible in the cold. 

           INT. SUITE - NIGHT

           Wine bottle on the nightstand. Charlotte pours the last of 
           it, watching a black-and-white DOCUMENTARY program on TV. 

           Her iPhone LIGHTS UP, silently ringing, and she glances at 
           it. ADRIAN COONS CALLING. She hits decline. 

           She sees she has THREE MISSED CALLS from Adrian. 

           With a couple taps and a swipe, she puts her phone on 
           AIRPLANE MODE. 

           INT. SUITE - NIGHT

           The TV plays, but Charlotte’s laptop illuminates her face. 
           She wears her earbuds. She watches something, heavy-
           hearted... it’s soundless... 

           ON HER SCREEN: Jay Hamilton’s CLAYMATION YOUTUBE VIDEO. 

           She refreshes it, tortured. In another window of her browser, 
           an EMAIL NOTIFICATION pops up. She clicks on it... 

           ON THE EMAIL: From Adrian, just a subject line. “question 
           about laos call me.”  

           Charlotte considers... then, picks up her phone... 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        Hey-- got two minutes to talk about 
                        work?

           In this moment, there is no distraction she would enjoy more.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (into phone)
                        Absolutely. 
           LATER

           Charlotte is curled up on the bed, work long forgotten.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You mean your grandmother, the one 
                        who raised you?

           INT. ADRIAN’S SOHO LOFT - NIGHT

           Adrian paces, in a t-shirt and boxers. He fiddles with a 
           wooden 3D jigsaw puzzle, a retro toy, on his shelf.

                                 ADRIAN 
                        She had a DNR more complicated 
                        than, like, the constitution of 
                        most small countries. They still 
                        managed to keep her hanging on by a 
                        thread. She was in a nursing home 
                        for nine years. She was a walking 
                        vegetable. It was pathetic. 

           INTERCUT Charlotte and Adrian.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Jesus. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        What do you think about euthanasia?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        When I think about how I want to 
                        die? I think, yes, when there’s 
                        illness, or lack of function, we 
                        should be in control of our own 
                        destiny. With the right safeguards, 
                        we deserve to have that control.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’ve thought about this.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I was one of those worrier kids, 
                        always thinking about mortality...

                                 ADRIAN
                        Staring up at the ceiling at night?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Imagining my parents’ demise, and 
                        what I’d say at their funeral...
                                 ADRIAN
                        That’s so interesting. I was the 
                        opposite. I think everyone makes 
                        too big of deal about death. 
                        They’re so afraid of it. They’re so 
                        afraid of nothingness. What matters 
                        is the people who are here, who are 
                        really here. 

           Charlotte thinks about this, and is about to object when--

                                 ADRIAN 
                        So... are you alone?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yeah. 
                             (almost to herself)
                        Profoundly so, I guess...

                                 ADRIAN
                        Maybe I should...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Adrian--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Maybe I should come over? What if-- 
                        listen, what if I just came over--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        NO. Adrian, do not go over there, 
                        I’m not even home, I’m in Vermont--

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’re on vacation.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Something like that.

                                 ADRIAN
                        The St. Regis or the Mansfield? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Neither, this boutique-y spot.

                                 ADRIAN
                        The Stowe Peak. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (yes)
                        No--

                                 ADRIAN
                        Why don’t I come.
                        CHARLOTTE
                                                         ADRIAN
                                              I want to see you.
           Okay, that’s it, I have to 
           go. If you have another work 
           question--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m going to hang up now. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Wait. Close your eyes, okay? 
                             (quiet, fast)
                        Think about this for a second. You 
                        really don’t want me there... 
                        touching you... looking at you... 
                        If I walked in right now, I 
                        wouldn’t let you get past the 
                        doorway, you know that? You don’t 
                        want that?  

           On a crazy carnal level, she completely does...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Goodbye.

           She hangs up the phone. 

           INT. SUITE - LATER

           Hot water POURS from the faucet, loud. Charlotte sinks into 
           the big jacuzzi tub. Her face disappears under the water. 

           A POUND-POUND-POUND at the door startles her. Charlotte perks 
           up, alarmed-- could it be Will? Again, POUND POUND POUND-- 

           AT THE DOOR

           Clutching a towel around her, Charlotte pulls the door open. 

           A BELLHOP greets her, holding a bottle of wine and two 
           glasses. Both he and Charlotte are a little thrown off. 

                                 BELLHOP
                        Oh, hi, sorry. Er... we got a 
                        call... here you go. Compliments of 
                        your friend Doctor Coons.   

           Charlotte takes the bottle, shaking her head, a wry smile.

           INT. SUITE - LATER

           Charlotte’s sprawled on the bed, a glass and a half later. 
           She plucks her phone off the nightstand, smirking to herself.
           ON CHARLOTTE’S PHONE: She TEXTS Adrian: “Thanks.” 

           The ELLIPSES appear... He’s writing back. She sits up, eager, 
           despite herself.

           ADRIAN: “I’m upstairs.” 

           On Charlotte’s face: utter confusion. 

           Then, Adrian: “Did you know this place has a penthouse?” 
           Then, Adrian: “But please don’t bother me, I’m working.” 

           Charlotte balks, SHOCKED. She cannot believe it. And it’s... 
           oddly exciting. She writes back: “You fucking asshole.” 

           Adrian’s ellipses... Adrian: “You’re cute when you’re mad.” 

           This gets an incredulous half-laugh out of Charlotte. 

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Charlotte knocks on the door of the penthouse, holding the 
           half-drunk bottle of wine by the neck. Adrian answers.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re insane.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I know you. You just need the 
                        wheels greased a little bit. 
                             (then)
                        Get over here.

           He grabs her by the belt loop and tugs her, hard, bringing 
           her hips to him. There’s this charged, almost bitter energy 
           between them, but it’s fucking intoxicating. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Is this what winning feels like? 

           She pushes him, kind of hard-- letting off steam.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Do you want to hurt me?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No.

           But she grips him and pulls him down onto the bed. An 
           electric beat and he RIPS HER CLOTHES OFF.

           Her head lolls back... and she laughs...
           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

           Charlotte’s skis slice through two inches of powder. She hops 
           over moguls, shooting down a narrow slope. Adrian cuts her 
           off, but she stops with a parallel kick on the cusp of the 
           trail, spraying powder over a steep drop-off. 

           They work their way down in this way -- fast, competitive. 
           Criss-crossing, challenging each other at every turn. Every 
           move is a contest, a race. Charlotte’s a more advanced, a 
           more in-control, skilled skier. But Adrian doesn’t know that: 
           he’s reckless, bold, and fast.

           He’s ahead of her and so she surprises him with a sneaky 
           move. She spots a break in the woods marked by a FALLEN TREE. 

           And she zips off the demarcated trail and INTO THE GLADES!

           When Adrian looks up, Charlotte’s gone.

           CHARLOTTE’S POV: The woods unfurls before her faster than she 
           can keep up. She bends and dips, turning with precision. She 
           dodges trees, skids over exposed rockface and ducks under 
           branches. It’s CRAZY and DANGEROUS but god, what a rush. Self-
           destructive and semi-suicidal and exhilarating and joyful.

           ON CHARLOTTE’S FACE: for the first time in a long time, as 
           the crisp air cuts across her skin, she looks free. Until...

           HER SKIS CLANG across a jagged patch of ice and she nearly 
           careens into a thick, hulking tree trunk.  

           But JUST IN TIME she crouches, leans into her edges and TURNS 
           SHARPLY, an expert move that saves her from smashing her head 
           against that tree. She lets out a HOWLING, TERRIFIED SCREAM! 

           INT. SUITE - DAY

           Adrian naps. Charlotte opens her computer and Googles: CASES 
           of MMR in Venezuela. A MAP fills the screen. She reads.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

           Charlotte skis, in the zone. Her trail converges with another 
           at the base of a steep run. Skiers shoot down.  

           A SNOWBOARDER speeds towards her. Moving at her pace. She 
           sees him but she doesn’t slow. Her eyes trained on him... her 
           lips curl into a smile... he sees her, too, and expects her 
           to stop or slow or change course... but she doesn’t...  

           It’s a game of chicken, and she refuses to give in. 
           FASTER and FASTER they approach... he SHOUTS something 
           inaudible, BARRELING TOWARDS her now, too late to turn...

           She SLAMS into him, knocking them both down. Charlotte’s legs 
           buckle beneath her. She struggles to get up with her poles.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 SNOWBOARDER
                        Wrong with me? I have the right of 
                        way! Who do you think you are?

           He stands with some pain, and adjusts his board. 

                                 SNOWBOARDER
                        You’re crazy, lady! You’re gonna 
                        get killed! 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY 

           Charlotte and Adrian, at a plateau where the trails diverge. 
           Two French PARENTS comfort a crying tiny 10-year-old-BOY. He 
           cradles his arm to his chest; the father tries to touch it.

                                 FATHER
                             (in French)
                        It’s his shoulder, I think it’s 
                        dislocated.  

           Charlotte hears this, and she’s ready to head over to help.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Leave it alone. You almost got sued 
                        once already.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Excuse me?

                                 ADRIAN
                        And you’re being investigated. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Not a believer in the Hippocratic 
                        Oath?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Not a believer in you being an 
                        idiot. 

           She throws him a disgusted look and moves over to the family.  
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Can I help? I’m a doctor. 

           Off Adrian, angry at being defied, and helpless...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - CHAIRLIFT DROP-OFF - DAY

           At the top of a mountain, Charlotte waits as Adrian adjusts 
           his ski boots and helmet, making everything perfect. 

           She watches an older couple. The HUSBAND, white haired and a 
           little heavy, helps his WIFE with one mitten. He tugs it down 
           and adjusts the velcro of her parka sleeve, then covers her 
           hand with a million raspberry kisses. The wife’s lilting 
           laugh floats through the air as they head down the 
           intermediate BLUE SQUARE trail. It breaks Charlotte’s heart. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        Okay. See if you can keep up. 

           She’s jarred back to her own bizarre reality. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh, come on. We both know I’m 
                        kicking your ass out here!

                                 ADRIAN
                        That’s not true.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That really bothers you? 

                                 ADRIAN
                        It’s not true.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You can’t admit that I’m a better 
                        skier than you. 

           Adrian’s face flinches in anger.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’re not. 

           She squints at the horizon... finding this unsettling...

           INT. HOTEL - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Charlotte finds Adrian at the cozy bar, talking with a young 
           WOMAN who has clearly recognized him and come to say hi.
                                 ADRIAN
                        Thanks, I’m very flattered.

           Charlotte appears beside him. The girl’s eyes widen a bit.

                                 GIRL
                        Oh, is this your wife?

                                 ADRIAN
                        This is--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m his ski instructor. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        She’s my future wife.

                                 GIRL
                        So how’d you guys meet?

           Charlotte looks at him, unsure how to answer. But Adrian 
           launches in as if they’ve told this story a thousand times...

                                 ADRIAN
                        We met in medical school in Boston. 
                        I was a nerdy guy who didn’t know 
                        who I was yet, and she was this 
                        intense, focused, gorgeous girl. 
                        The kind of girl I always pictured 
                        myself with. And yet even better. 
                        Because she was real. I would sit 
                        behind her in organic chemistry -- 
                        remember, with Berenstein? I would 
                        lean forward and try to smell her 
                        hair. Her shampoo smelled like 
                        coconut. I tried to buy some at CVS 
                        but it wasn’t the same. Finally by 
                        second year we sort of had social 
                        groups in the same orbit... I’d see 
                        her at the bagel place on the way 
                        to one of her discussion sections, 
                        and I used to wait there even 
                        though it was on the opposite side 
                        of campus, just hoping that she’d 
                        say hi to me. Or that I’d have an 
                        opportunity to ask her out. 
                        Sometimes she’d wave or something 
                        but we didn’t really talk. Wasn’t 
                        until a year later that I finally 
                        got the courage. I told her how I 
                        felt. We were just... magnetic. 

           ON CHARLOTTE’S FACE: she does not remember this night.
                                 GIRL
                        What happened?

                                 ADRIAN
                        She rejected me! I told her how I 
                        felt and she completely rejected 
                        me. She ended up with someone else. 
                        But I didn’t give up. And we moved 
                        away... and we’d cross paths 
                        professionally a few times a year, 
                        and I knew I had to wait until the 
                        right time. But I somehow knew that 
                        I would get what I wanted, some 
                        day. I would get her. That’s me. 
                        I’m ruthless. I don’t see the 
                        obstacles between me and what I 
                        want. And it took some maneuvering, 
                        a bit of fate, a bit of design -- a 
                        lot of design -- and patience. But 
                        we found our way back together.    

           He turns to Charlotte and looks at her, eyes full of 
           intensity -- his own perverse brand of love. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        And now I’m never letting her go 
                        again.

                                 GIRL
                        Aw. That’s so romantic. 

           Charlotte tries not to betray how uncomfortable she is with 
           this bizarre story, but she is chilled to her core.

           RESTAURANT - LATER 

           A HOST deposits Charlotte and Adrian at their table.

                                 HOST
                        Enjoy your meal, Dr. Coons. 

           An oil candle flickers between them. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Why’d you want me to take the 
                        harder cases in Laos?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Because the harder cases are the 
                        better cases. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Even if the patient dies?
                                 ADRIAN
                        No. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        But it’s worth the risk.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Sometimes. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Like in Venezuela. The Sanuma.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Say what you want to say.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        An anti-viral medication doesn’t 
                        kill thousands of people. There’s a  
                        researcher who found no other 
                        tribes in that area had been 
                        exposed to measles. None but yours.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Yeah, I know that publication. 
                        Guess what happened to that hack? 
                        Two of his other papers were 
                        discredited. He lost his tenure-
                        track. Wife divorced him. Had to 
                        sell his four-bedroom house in 
                        Princeton and now he lives alone in 
                        an apartment in Jersey City. 

           Adrian places his napkin on top of the glass hurricane. The 
           flame struggles, growing dimmer, as the oxygen burns up. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Career totally imploded. You’re 
                        kind of in the same position. With 
                        the internal review. Teetering on 
                        the edge of obscurity. 

           The flame dims to near-darkness. He pulls the napkin away at 
           the last possible moment, and it flares back to life. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Let’s order some wine. You’ll feel 
                        better after a couple drinks. You 
                        always do.

           There’s a fire in Adrian’s eyes as she says this. 
           EXT. GONDOLA - NIGHT

           A GONDOLA glides up its cable, shaking as it rises to the top 
           of the mountain. Light from the moon reveals an icy, windy 
           night on the trails. Some runs are illuminated; others black.   

           Charlotte and Adrian are dressed for a night ski. They wait 
           in line, speaking softly as they inch forward. 

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        In Boston-- I didn’t reject you. I 
                        don’t even remember what night 
                        you’re talking about. We didn’t 
                        really know each other that well...

                                 ADRIAN
                        Sure we did.

           Adrian shrugs. He blows onto his goggles. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We went to a few of the same 
                        parties. There was one study group. 
                        I don’t even remember having a full 
                        conversation with you til you came 
                        to St. Chris’s. You know you don’t 
                        own our story, you can’t own my 
                        story that way... 

           Adrian ignores her, moving up in line, smiling.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Are you listening to me?

           An ATTENDANT ushers people into the cable cars, two by two.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Of course I own your story. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What?

                                 ADRIAN
                        You hand it over to me every chance 
                        you get. 

           He climbs into the cable car. The attendant looks to 
           Charlotte, motioning for her to go ahead. She’s about to turn 
           away, but she’s so unnerved... and raw... eager to continue 
           this fight...

           INSIDE
           Charlotte gets in. The cable car JERKS to life, rocking as it 
           climbs over the mountain. The higher they go, the more it 
           sways. She sits down-hill, across from Adrian.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        You know an animal would never get 
                        into an enclosed space with a 
                        perceived threat. Only humans do 
                        that kind of shit.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I hate you, Adrian.

           He turns to her with fascination.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re a sick imperialist. You 
                        killed those people in Venezuela. I 
                        think you shot them up with MMR to 
                        ‘cure’ them so you could tout 
                        yourself as a savior. But it didn’t 
                        work because your anti-viral drug 
                        wasn’t strong enough. You’ll never 
                        admit it, but I know--

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’ll admit it. 

           His lips twist into a smile. Charlotte shudders.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You know what the life expectancy 
                        of those people is? 38. If they 
                        don’t kill each other before then.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re disgusting.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You’ve known it all along. That’s 
                        the boring part. Everyone knows. 
                        What’s interesting is that it 
                        didn’t stop you from sleeping with 
                        me. Falling in love with me. Which 
                        proves that it doesn’t matter. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Please. I don’t love you. You’re a 
                        distraction.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        And you’re a mouse in a maze.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You started the internal review.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I just told them you were drinking. 
                        Which you were. 

           She’s stone-faced, refusing to give him any reaction--

                                 ADRIAN
                        I put you on call that night, you 
                        know? And you came running. I saw 
                        you at your stupid party getting 
                        loaded with your stupid husband.

           Charlotte balks, in horror... he was there that night.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I paged you to see if you’d come 
                        in. And you did! And you faltered. 
                        You know, this is what happens to 
                        women who think they’re invincible. 
                        They destroy themselves. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You know what happens to men who 
                        think they’re God? They go to 
                        fucking hell.  

           The wind HOWLS.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        And I knew you sent me that note.

                                 ADRIAN
                        What note?

           He seems earnest. Charlotte is thrown off... 

                                 ADRIAN
                        The thing is, I can make all this 
                        go away. 

           He tries to touch her face and she SWATS his hand away. He 
           grabs her wrist. Hard. 

           She grimaces. After a moment, he releases it. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You think if you ruin me you own 
                        me. But I won’t let you. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        You won’t? 
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m leaving when we get down. 

           The gondola creaks to a stop. It SWAYS. The wind is whipping. 
           And he moves toward her, too close, scaring her-- Charlotte 
           presses her back against the glass window of the cable car. 
           He stays there, violently near to her, inches from her face.

                                 ADRIAN
                        No, you’re not. 

           His spit lands on her face. She clenches every muscle. 

           After an excruciatingly long moment, the car rolls to life, 
           approaching the drop- off. The mechanical door opens.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        Race you down. 

           Charlotte shudders, petrified...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           A dozen skiers disperse, their lights bobbing in the night. 
           The trails up here are marked with black diamonds -- EXPERT.  

           Further down the mountain, eerie silence. A SLICING sound 
           pierces the quiet, reverberating off the frozen trail as 
           shadows approach...  

           Two parallel sets of skis FLY down the mountain. Charlotte 
           and Adrian -- side by side -- SHOOT DOWN, fast... 

           Charlotte keeps her eyes on the trail, desperate to get ahead 
           of him, but he’s locked onto her. He LOOKS OVER with a wry 
           grin... He inches closer... she fights to create distance... 
           she hops over a mogul... the blades of her skis scraping the 
           icy rim of the trail... terrified that he’ll push her off... 

           He edges CLOSER... reaches out his ski pole, and STABS at 
           her. She dodges him, but just barely, and he LAUGHS. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Stop! Stop it!

           He turns, FAST, and cuts her off... his SKIS CROSS HERS and 
           it throws her off balance! She tumbles, rolls, down-slope, 
           skidding on her blades until she SLAMS to a stop against a 
           mogul. Her skis tangled, she pulls herself up, struggling to 
           steady herself... Adrian watches from down the trail... 

           When she rises, she looks for him... but she can’t see where 
           he is in the darkness.  
           She draws in a breath. And, shaky, points her skis downhill. 
           She slips over the snow, then ACCELERATES...  

           Crouched low, she PLUNGES down the mountain, hoping to avoid 
           Adrian, but he appears... and is RIGHT BACK ON HER TAIL.  

           Up ahead, she sees... THE FALLEN TREE at the edge of the 
           woods... her shortcut from earlier... a chance to get away. 

           She slices across the mountain and Adrian watches her 
           disappear into the glades. He can’t resist going after her. 

           THE GLADES at night: a blur of craggy branches and brush and 
           the STEEP rockface barely covered in snow. 

           Charlotte turns constantly, leaning into her hips... 

           Adrian, behind her, is aggressive and overconfident. A branch 
           TEARS his jacket. He dips but regains balance, on her tail. 
           He gets so close to her that his skis almost cross hers...

           BUT SHE LEADS HIM RIGHT OVER THE THICK PATCH OF ICE.

           She skids across on her edges... just as she did earlier. 

           He loses control... slams into a tree, and falls backwards... 
           His head hits the ICE with a painful CRACK. Snow tumbles from 
           branches above from the impact.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Adrian?

           Nothing.

           Charlotte unclips from her skis and doubles back. She stands 
           over Adrian. From behind his head, seeping blood pools, 
           staining the snow red. His eyes are wide open but MOTIONLESS. 

           She squats down, her heart in her chest... he’s breathing, a 
           meager puff of air billows from his lips.... 

           She leans her cheek close to his lips. She hears a GURGLING 
           inside his throat. He’s alive, but barely.

           Charlotte is stunned.

           She looks around. There’s no one in sight. 

           LIGHT... distant, then, growing stronger... filters through 
           the trees. CHARLOTTE FREEZES. Soft orbs bounce on the slope 
           beyond the woods, headlamp reflections. 

           Skiers are coming -- the rhythmic SWISH of their skis on the 
           snow -- their distorted voices far away. 
           After a moment, they’re gone.

           A breeze rustles the powder, and snowflakes catch in her 
           eyelashes. The tree’s branches CREAK under the weight of 
           snow. Charlotte waits until it’s safe. 

           She waits for the return of the deathly quiet. 

           She steadies her breathing.

           She looks at Adrian, pondering the opportunity here... 

           Then, faster than she can think, Charlotte rises and clips 
           into her skis. She sets off down the mountain. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           Charlotte skis down. Buzzing. She sees a first Aid Station. 
           The RED CROSS taunts her. She slows down, considers...

           But she keeps moving, propelling herself with her poles. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Charlotte’s POV: she moves through the lobby, her heart 
           POUNDS, her body pulses in fear. Her eyes on the hall... the 
           faceless shapes moving around her. The elevator doors open.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey! Hey! Hey you, there!

           Charlotte steps into the elevator. The doors are about to 
           close when... A HAND STOPS THEM. They peel open, revealing...

           The French father from earlier, with the injured son.

                                 MAN
                        I just wanted to say, thank you 
                        again, doctor. He’s feeling much 
                        better. We’d love to buy you a 
                        drink to say thanks... 

           Charlotte nods frantically and punches the BUTTONS. The doors 
           thrust together, startling the man, who stares at her oddly. 

           She unzips her jacket. She’s drenched in sweat.

           INT. HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT

           She barges into the room, and hands shaking, grabs her stuff, 
           pushes everything into her duffle bag. 
           She tears open a dresser drawer -- and pauses when she sees 
           it’s full of Adrian’s things. Neatly folded sweaters, balled-
           up socks. 

           She stares at it. She closes the drawer gently.  

           She moves into the bathroom, collects her toiletries, makeup, 
           toothpaste, toothbrush. She breathes deeply. Looks up...

           ON HER REFLECTION in the mirror, she recoils. 

           Charlotte’s POV: there’s a RED SMUDGE ON HER TEMPLE. Adrian’s 
           blood. On the glove hooked to her jacket, there’s more... 

           She wets some toilet paper and rubs her face, hard. 

           She then buckles and PUKES VIOLENTLY into the toilet. 

           She looks at her reflection in the mirror, wilted and sweaty 
           and guilty. The spot above her temple rubbed raw. 

           She gets the fuck out of here. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Charlotte moves to the door, duffle bag on her shoulder. Her 
           instinct is to run, but she fights the urge and walks slowly.

           Some of the other NIGHT SKIERS, in their headlamps and 
           parkas, slick with snow, move toward her intently.   

           She’s sure they’re coming for her. She instinctually closes 
           her eyes, and their conversation washes over her like a wave. 

                                 SKIER 1
                        I was worried.   

                                 SKIER 2
                        I told you not to wait! I took 
                        Devil’s Cross instead. Too icy. 

                                 SKIER 3
                        I think we were the last ones in. 
                        Fucking freezing out there. 

           When she opens her eyes, one of the skiers smiles at her. 
           Normal, polite. And then they’re gone, chatting away...

           Charlotte beelines to the main door. A BELLMAN holds it open 
           for her, and she continues out into the night...   
           INT. BUS - NIGHT

           Charlotte sits at a window seat, gripping her duffle bag on 
           her lap. Her eyes are glued on the landscape outside, the 
           tree-dense country road finally surrendering to highway. The 
           old bus’s engine RATTLES as they accelerate. 

           Charlotte looks around, on alert, at the other passengers. 

           A TEENAGER passed out over two seats, MEN talking in baritone 
           rumbles, and a WOMAN across the aisle, her head dipped over 
           her lap, muttering inaudibly. Talking to herself, or praying. 
           Her head snaps up and they make brief eye contact. The 
           woman’s eyes are murky, far-off. Charlotte looks away. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAWN

           The sun rises over the frigid city. A fiery bubble, it looks 
           like it’s ready to burst...

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

           Charlotte moves in a trance-like state through the station. 

           In a small group of people waiting for the train, she sees a 
           MAN -- tall, lean, in a sweater under a wool coat, auburn 
           hair, and in profile, that jaw, that turned-up nose...

           It’s ADRIAN. She freezes, her stomach lurches...

           But the man turns, and she relaxes -- it’s someone else. 

           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Peaceful stillness in the living room. Everything is neat. 
           The JINGLE of KEYS. The CREAK of the DOOR. Charlotte enters. 
           She looks like she’s been through hell. Her hair is filthy, 
           she’s frail. The QUIET in the house is eerie...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hello?

           No response.

           She sees the dog’s sheepskin bed and a mangled bone atop it. 
           She collapses to her knees. She looks at the bed like it’s a 
           precious object in a museum. Reaching out, her hand shakes...
           INT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Charlotte stands in the shower, shoulders hunched, haunted... 

           She discovers, on the soap dish, a forgotten glass of booze. 
           She picks it up delicately. Considers it. And she HURLS IT 
           AGAINST THE WALL. It SHATTERS into pieces. 

           She sinks to the floor and dissolves into tormented tears.

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - MEETING ROOM - DAY 

           Charlotte sits at a conference table amongst the leaders of 
           the hospital, Sonia, Carlson, and Wu. She has cleaned herself 
           up but she still looks contorted, anxious... unwell.

           QUICK CUTS of the hospital chiefs SPEAKING, MOS. It’s like 
           Charlotte is under water. Finally, all eyes are on her. 

                                 SONIA
                        We know you’re eager to make a 
                        statement. The floor is yours.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I have nothing to say. Besides that 
                        it’s been an honor. I admire and 
                        trust you. You’re all good doctors. 
                        More importantly, you’re all good 
                        people. I respect whatever you 
                        decide about my future here. 
                             (quiet, small)
                        I do believe I’m meant to be a 
                        doctor..   

           Off Sonia, curious about this strange, humbled response. 

           INT. SUBWAY - 1 TRAIN - NIGHT

           A desolate subway car bound for the Upper West Side. 
           Charlotte stands next to a YOUNG WOMAN, chewing gum, leaning 
           against the pole as she watches a NEWS VIDEO on her iPhone.    

           Charlotte eyes what the woman is viewing, and she leans over:

           ON THE NEWS VIDEO:

           Photos of ADRIAN COONS: smiling in JAPAN; accepting an AWARD 
           in DC; outside Harvard Medical School as a young man, ALONE.   

           Then, a REPORTER explains. Tinny, through the girl’s earbuds--
                                 REPORTER
                        Celebrity doctor and humanitarian 
                        found dead at a secluded hotel in 
                        Vermont after a skiing accident.  

           Charlotte draws in air and looks away. She moves a little 
           deeper into the car. Something snags her attention... she 
           feels EYES ON HER... and she peers back to see...

           Staring directly at her, seated further down, is BRIAN. 

           Her head snaps down. Her gaze on the ground. The train rocks, 
           jerking as it approaches the next stop. 

           Brian, brow furrowed, watches her, curious and emotional.

           Charlotte forces herself to breathe. When the train doors 
           open with a mechanical sigh, she abruptly gets off. 

           She doesn’t see Brian rise and follow her. 

           I/E. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 110TH STREET - NIGHT

           There’s construction-- interior scaffolding means Charlotte 
           finds herself hurrying along a narrow strip of platform to 
           reach the exit. Hands in her pockets, she hustles. Alone. 

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        Sorry about your friend.

           Charlotte looks over her shoulder to see Brian behind her.

           She makes the decision to keep walking, quickly, silently. 

                                 BRIAN
                        You’re not even gonna answer me?

           He quickens his pace, catching up to her. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Killer.

           Now Charlotte’s scared, and he’s at her heels. Across the 
           tracks, on the opposite platform, a few people are speckled 
           about, but they’re not paying attention, and they’re so far 
           away... Charlotte moves faster, but suddenly HITS a DEAD END. 

           A wooden partition blocks the exit. Fuck.

                                 BRIAN
                        You scared of me? I should be 
                        scared of you. 
           She turns to face him. He spits at the ground. She cringes. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 BRIAN
                        What?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m sorry. 

           She tries to get around him, but he blocks her path. There’s 
           only about a foot of space, then the yellow rubber edge. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He deserved a better doctor. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Fucking right he did.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Sue me for everything I’ve got. 

           Brian shakes his head with a cynical smile, like this bitch 
           is crazy to give him some kind of peace offering...

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I mean it. You should.

           Charlotte is panicking, eyes watering, scared, desperate. She 
           looks down at the gap over the tracks... 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He seemed really smart and 
                        talented. Timothy Leary meets 
                        Sesame Street...   

                                 BRIAN
                        What?

           She suddenly BURSTS forward to bolt around Brian, but 
           surprised, he reacts, lurches towards her to block her path. 
           She LOSES HER FOOTING... she SLIPS...   

           Charlotte falls onto the tracks. Brian SCREAMS.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A coffee table covered in beer bottles. Will and his BROTHER 
           are watching TV. CLOSE on Will’s face as the NEWS comes on...
                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...found yesterday but responders 
                        believe Coons may have been in the 
                        unmarked glade since as early as 
                        Tuesday. In a freak accident, he 
                        apparently went off-trail and hit a 
                        tree. Conditions were icy, and 
                        Coons was not wearing a helmet. 

                                 WILL
                        Holy shit. 

           ON WILL, eyes wide, as he processes this... the wheels in his 
           head turning... an uncanny, satisfied smile creeps across his 
           face. Some sense of relief, some sense of order restored.  

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           A SHOCK OF BRIGHTNESS. A pen light in one eye. The other. The 
           distorted FACE of a female PARAMEDIC comes into view. A 
           second PARAMEDIC secures Charlotte’s leg to a splint.

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        Ma’am, are you with me? Ma’am, you 
                        passed out at the 110th street 
                        train station, okay? We’ve treated 
                        you for an external head wound. 
                        Your left leg is broken. We’re en 
                        route to St. Chris’s. Do you have 
                        any allergies?

           Charlotte, on a stretcher, looks down at her body. The chaos 
           around her, the sounds and shapes and energy, oddly familiar.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I was on the train tracks.

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        You were on the side of the 
                        platform. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, I’m telling you-- I fell--

           The Paramedics shares a look. 

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        We found you on the platform.  

           Charlotte absorbs this. She lets her eyes close. 

                                 PARAMEDIC 1
                        Do you have an emergency contact?
           The comforting BEEP... BEEP... BEEP of a heart monitor.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. No emergency contact. 

           INT. ST. CHRISTOPHER’S - NIGHT

           Charlotte lies in a hospital bed, a bandage on her head. 
           Sonia sits nearby, checking in, trying to comfort her.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Just listen, fire me if you want 
                        to. But don’t cancel the trip. I 
                        planned a good trip. We did.

           Sonia’s concerned. She touches Charlotte’s arm.

                                 SONIA
                        Don’t worry about any of that. With 
                        everything... You need to rest.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yeah. Yeah, I know. 

           A male COP, GOMEZ, 60s, appears in the doorway by Sonia.

                                 SONIA
                             (taking the cue)
                        Okay. I’ll be back a little later.

           She leaves, and Charlotte turns to the COP.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Officer. I can make this easy for 
                        you. I’m a doctor, I know how this 
                        works. I’m not interested in 
                        security footage, I wouldn’t press 
                        charges anyway, it was an accident--
                        I’m not concussed-- 

                                 GOMEZ
                        I’m not here about you Dr. Gordon. 
                        I’m here to talk to you about 
                        Adrian Coons.   
                             (sitting down, bedside)
                        You two were having an affair, 
                        weren’t you?

           Charlotte’s lips tremble. She takes her time.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What do you want to know?
           From a folder, he takes glossy PHOTOS of Adrian’s blue, 
           frozen CORPSE in the thawing snow. One by one, he places them 
           on her bed. Charlotte cringes, but she doesn’t look away.    

                                 GOMEZ
                        You were with him that night, yes? 
                        You were checked in...  

           She nods. 

                                 GOMEZ
                        I’m following up. Trying to piece 
                        everything together. There could be 
                        a liability issue here. Hopefully 
                        nothing more extreme than that.

           He holds her gaze. She flinches, a facial tick. 

                                 GOMEZ
                        You know if he was drinking? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yes.

                                 GOMEZ
                        Drugs?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No. I don’t think so.

                                 GOMEZ
                        Tell me more about him. 

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        You know... I don’t know Adrian 
                        very well at all. He was an enigma. 

                                 GOMEZ
                        Despite all the time you spent 
                        together?

           There’s a judgemental edge to his voice. She fidgets with her 
           wedding ring. Tears filling her eyes.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Yeah.
                             (then, breaking)
                        Don’t ever have an affair. 

           The cop is taken aback by her emotion. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh my god. Sorry, uh...
           He passes her a tissue. She regroups.   

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        The one thing I can say about 
                        Adrian is he didn’t value human 
                        life. His own, or others’. He liked 
                        to play God. That much I know.

                                 ADRIAN
                        What was he doing skiing through 
                        those icy glades, alone?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He was a pretty arrogant guy. 

                                 GOMEZ
                        That’s what we keep hearing. 

           Charlotte watches as Gomez writes down a few notes. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Charlotte waits outside the hospital, leaning on crutches, 
           one leg in a cast. Her head is bandaged. She brightens...

           ...as Will pulls up, in his car. He gets out and helps her in 
           the passenger’s side.  

           INT. WILL’S CAR - DAY

           Will drive. Charlotte smiles a bittersweet smile, warmed by 
           his presence... but deeply burdened by everything else. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Hi.

           He looks at her, frail and broken, mysterious and powerful. 

           They ride in silence. 

           EXT. CHARLOTTE & WILL’S BUILDING - LATER

           Will pulls over in front of the brownstone. He turns the car 
           off, unbuckles his seatbelt and faces her. He stares at her, 
           brow furrowed, about to ask her something...

           Her hand, resting on her knee, QUAKES. He notices.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It’s from the pain medicine. 

           A lie they both choose to accept. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Do you want to come up?

                                 WILL
                        No. Unless you need me to--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, I can make it. 

                                 WILL
                        I do have something for you. 

           He pulls out a stapled bundle of pages. Hands it to her. 

                                 WILL
                        I drew up a little joint custody 
                        agreement, for the dog. He misses 
                        you.

           She looks at it, sort of touched and grateful. She laughs. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Got a pen?

           EXT. VILLAGE IN LAOS - TWO MONTHS LATER - DAY

           A connected string of MEDICAL TENTS service dozens of local 
           people. Behind the dusty village, LUSH GREEN MOUNTAINS.   

           SURGICAL TENT

           Charlotte’s deep in a surgery. It’s hot. She sweats, grits 
           her teeth, as she EXCISES a piece of flesh with a scalpel.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        David, give me a hand here? Go 
                        ahead and press. Exactly, thanks. 

           EXT. VILLAGE IN LAOS - DUSK

           Charlotte takes off her mask and exits the tent. She passes a 
           pair of young, fresh-faced DOCTORS who smile and greet her--

                                 DOCTOR 1
                        Great work, Doctor Gordon. 

           She thanks them, appreciative, and continues on.  
           She rests, alone, against a limestone wall. She pulls out her 
           iPhone to check her messages. An email pops up from WILL 
           GORDON. She considers. Then takes a deep breath and OPENS IT. 

           THE EMAIL: It’s a form letter. “We’ve officially launched! 
           Welcome to the PhotoArt family. Click for a free download.”

           She smiles as she reads this. 

           She turns back to face the medical camp, and holds up her 
           phone. She frames a shot with Will’s app. 

           The chaos, the messiness, the unfinished work, the candid 
           DOCTORS, PATIENTS lingering... she captures it with a CLICK. 

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        Hey, Doctor Gordon! Doctor Gordon, 
                        get over here!

           Jarred back to reality, Charlotte rushes over to the area 
           outside the tents where a dozen DOCTORS are corralled. A 
           VOLUNTEER passes out Dixie cups from a tin tray. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Is this...?

                                 VOLUNTEER
                        Mango juice.

           She takes one. She notices someone with a CAMERA, filming. 

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        It’s our first night, and I just 
                        wanted to take a minute to 
                        acknowledge why we’re here. This 
                        trip wouldn’t have been possible 
                        without one person. They’re the 
                        reason we’re able to do this work. 

           She wets her lips, tucks her hair behind her ears.  

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        And we all know who that is. It 
                        only felt right to toast...

           Everyone raises their cups. ON CHARLOTTE...

                                 YOUNG DOCTOR
                        Doctor Adrian Coons. 

           Charlotte looks ill, peering around at the smiling faces... 
           as she forces a smile of her own.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
