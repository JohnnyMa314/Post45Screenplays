           All of this happened.

           Under this we FADE UP SFX of a boat chugging through the 
           ocean swell, music playing from the wheel house - Simple 
           Minds’ ‘Don’t You Forget about Me’. And we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK POINT - DUSK

           LOW ANGLE: the fishing vessel Anna Mary, a 42ft lobster 
           trawler, kicks up some spray as she pushes six knots, heading 
           due south from Montauk Point lighthouse out into the Atlantic 
           Ocean, music blaring. It’s a beautiful day, very little wind, 
           the sun just starting to dip. 

           As she passes we see, incongruously, two large ‘Space-Hopper’ 
           type inflated rubber balls are strapped to her bows, painted 
           to look like tits. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DUSK

           JOHNNY ALDRIDGE is on deck. He’s 44 years old, slim, 
           athletic, with short dark hair and a neatly trimmed goatee 
           beard. Wearing just a t-shirt and shorts in the warm weather, 
           he’s busy baiting several hundred lobster traps stacked up on 
           deck, reaching into a barrel and hanging putrid, stinking 
           fish heads and guts on a hook inside. As soon as he’s done 
           one he moves onto the next straight away - quickly, 
           conscientiously. There is no tailgate on the boat, the deck 
           is an open, flat bed the better for sliding lobster pots off 
           it into the sea. The engine churns up a foamy wake that 
           snakes away from the stern into the distance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CABIN, ANNA MARY - DUSK

           Below deck Johnny’s partner and closest friend ANTHONY 
           SOSINSKI is, by contrast, fast asleep. Lithe, muscled body 
           honed from years at sea, ANTHONY is the same age as Johnny 
           but looks like some surfer dude with long, blonde hair, 
           tanned weathered face with three days’ stubble and an 
           Hawaiian shirt and garland of paper flowers round his neck 
           from a party the night before. 
           He is in a deep, drunken sleep. We notice, pinned above his 
           bunk, a photo of two little girls with blonde hair.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DUSK

           JOHNNY slams the lid back on the bait barrel, glad for some 
           relief from the stench. An Anthony favourite - ‘Livin’ On A 
           Prayer’ - is playing as he pulls his rubber gloves off and 
           makes his way into the wheel house. He abruptly turns the 
           music off. He prefers quiet, and savours the peace for a 
           moment. He checks there are no other ships on the horizon 
           then leaves the boat on auto-pilot and clambers downstairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALLEY/CABIN/ENGINE ROOM, ANNA MARY - DUSK

           JOHNNY glances over at ANTHONY, asleep in his bunk, as he 
           crosses to the engine compartment. Unable to conceal his 
           irritation, he opens the compartment door and holds it open, 
           releasing choking fumes and the bellow of the diesel engine 
           into the confined space. But ANTHONY doesn’t stir. JOHNNY 
           grabs a rag and enters the engine compartment, deliberately 
           slamming the door with a loud thump against the bulk head. He 
           scans the gauges, checks the oil level. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT WHEEL-HOUSE, ANNA MARY - NIGHT

           Later. JOHNNY eats cold baked beans from a tin, just the hum 
           of the engine and the gentle swish of the bow cutting through 
           the ocean for company. It’s mostly black out there, what 
           moonlight there is glinting on the glassy surface of the 
           water. He studies an opened letter in an envelope pinned to a 
           little notice board in the wheel-house and a sudden thought 
           occurs to him. He reaches for it, but then spots some lights 
           up ahead. It’s a yacht, a rich man’s play-thing on it’s way 
           back to Montauk. He leaves the envelope, switches off auto-
           pilot, throttles back and changes course to avoid it. 

           He passes the yacht about six hundred yards to starboard - 
           JOHNNY looks over but it’s too far away to make out anyone on 
           board. Once he is satisfied the way ahead is clear again, he 
           resumes his original speed and course and switches auto-pilot 
           back on. He then takes a pen and circles the post-mark on the 
           envelope he was looking at a few moments earlier. He studies 
           it, his expression intense - it’s obviously important 
           somehow. Then he picks up his tin of beans again and eats.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GALLEY, ANNA MARY - NIGHT

           Down below ANTHONY gropes, eyes still shut, for a Gatorade 
           bottle beside his bunk. Drowsily, he glugs it down and puts 
           the empty bottle back on the side - the whole thing 
           apparently happening without him waking up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - NIGHT

           Much later. The Anna Mary continues her steady progress out 
           to sea. JOHNNY, back on deck, turns on the deck lights and 
           then - after first checking the time on his watch - the 
           boat’s refrigeration system. Using a spanner he undoes the 
           starboard deck hatch, lifts it up, reaches down into the 
           water inside and closes a valve.   

           JOHNNY moves on to the port side and frowns when he sees that 
           two large plastic cooler chests, full of ice ready for the 
           lobster they hope to catch, have been carelessly left on top 
           of the other hatch preventing him from lifting it. Sighing 
           heavily in frustration he tries to move them with his foot. 
           No luck. So he crouches, grabs a handle on the end of the 
           cooler and starts to pull. The cooler moves a little; 
           encouraged, he pulls harder... harder... until he’s pulling 
           with all his might. And then...

           SNAP!

           The handle breaks, and JOHNNY is thrown violently backwards. 
           His momentum is such that he can’t stop himself; he trips, 
           slides and tumbles off the open back of the boat straight 
           into the black ocean just a few inches below.

           JOHNNY ducks under, rolling head over heels, and pops up like 
           a cork, coughing and spluttering. We are with him as he 
           orientates himself and sees the Anna Mary is already five, 
           ten yards away. He tries swimming after it, thrashing as fast 
           as he can and shouting out frantically:

                                 JOHNNY
                        Anthony! Hey! Anthony!

           He gives up, he has no chance of catching it. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                             (Screaming)
                        Anthony! 

           But Anthony is sound asleep, and not about to wake up. The 
           gap between JOHNNY and the boat widens remorselessly. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Anthony! Help!
           The Anna Mary is on auto-pilot and it continues on its 
           course, oblivious. Already the lights on deck are starting to 
           twinkle into the distance. JOHNNY struggles to comprehend 
           what has happened... This makes no sense. This makes no 
           fucking sense at all. This is how he dies? Today? Like this? 
           He bellows one last:

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Anthony!

           And we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANTHONY’S HOUSE - DAWN

           JOHNNY knocks on the front door to Anthony’s house and calls 
           out in a harsh whisper:

                                 JOHNNY
                        Anthony!

           Caption                                                       
           One month earlier

           ANTHONY lives in a pre-fab house in a street just a couple of 
           hundred yards back from the sea. The front yard is full of 
           junk - old lobster pots, cars, a couple of canoes, bikes, 
           driftwood - it’s as chaotic (as we shall discover) as 
           Anthony. JOHNNY, dressed formally in a dark suit and black 
           tie, knocks again. It’s early, so again he keeps his voice 
           low - impatient, frustrated that Anthony doesn’t answer.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Come on...

           JOHNNY steps back, tries to see if he can see a light on 
           anywhere. He checks his watch. He pulls his cell out, goes to 
           dial, and then ANTHONY finally opens the door, bleary-eyed, 
           naked, hand between his legs covering his modesty. He sees 
           JOHNNY’S dark suit, seems confused for a moment, then:

                                 ANTHONY
                        Shit.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You forgot.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Gimme two minutes.

           ANTHONY disappears back inside the house. JOHNNY turns and 
           walks angrily back towards his truck.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JOHNNY’S TRUCK, OUTSIDE ANTHONY’S HOUSE - DAWN

           JOHNNY sits at the wheel of his truck, dark expression. 
           ANTHONY emerges from the house wearing dark trousers and a 
           white shirt. He’s clutching shoes, tie and jacket in one hand 
           and a unicycle in the other - which JOHNNY notes with a 
           frown. ANTHONY scampers up the drive, throws the unicycle in 
           the back and jumps in as JOHNNY pulls away, wheels spinning 
           on the gravel. ANTHONY almost tumbles out, but manages to 
           grab the swinging door and slam it shut. They both sit 
           staring ahead as JOHNNY picks up speed.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What did you bring that for?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Just in case.

           JOHNNY sighs, shakes his head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK HARBOUR - DAWN

           Their route takes them past Montauk harbour, a place of wild 
           contrasts. On one side, working fishing vessels are docked 
           ready to go to sea; on the other, rich men’s motor cruisers 
           gleam idly in the sunshine. The working side is already busy 
           and noisy even this early in the day as FISHERMEN take on 
           fuel and bait and prepare the nets on their trawlers and 
           draggers. ANTHONY smiles as they pass a bar named ‘The Dock’, 
           a favourite haunt of Montauk fishermen (shut at this hour). 

                                 ANTHONY
                        I would fuckin’ love to be there 
                        when George opens up this morning.

           He waits for JOHNNY to ask him why, but when JOHNNY doesn’t 
           he continues anyway:

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        So Paulie comes back from a three 
                        day trip, and we’re buyin’ drinks 
                        for these girls, and I get my hula 
                        hoop out... And then Paulie says 
                        he’s got this huge-

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Cutting across him)
                        We’re gonna be late. We’re gonna be 
                        late and his mother and father will 
                        think we don’t care.

           His quiet anger silences ANTHONY.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. HIGH STREET MONTAUK - DAWN

           JOHNNY drives along Montauk High Street, a collection of 
           bars, bait and tackle shops, restaurants and grocery stores.

                                 ANTHONY (V.O.)
                        I lost my cell Johnny, I’m sorry. I 
                        didn’t get my alarm call.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK HIGHWAY - DAY

           JOHNNY pulls onto the Montauk Highway and heads up-island 
           toward their destination - a little town called Wading River. 
           They pass at speed a row of telegraph poles lining the road-
           side, leaning at crazy angles.

                                 ANTHONY (V.O.)
                        Relax. We’ll make it...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HAMPTONS - DAY

           Soon enough the road starts to become lined by multi-million 
           dollar holiday homes overlooking the sea, with sculptured, 
           landscaped gardens and grounds. We dwell as much as possible 
           on the brilliantly green lawns.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EAST HAMPTON - DAY

           The Highway takes them through the centre of East Hampton and 
           Johnny’s beat up truck suddenly looks out of place amongst 
           the Porsches and Mercedes and designer shops.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHNNY’S TRUCK - DAY

           Traffic is heavy and JOHNNY impatiently bangs his steering 
           wheel as he’s forced to stop his truck in a line of traffic 
           which is letting a blonde WOMAN in a brand new white Porsche 
           reverse out of a parking bay outside a Gucci store. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Fuckin’ Cidiots...

           A cell phone rings. ANTHONY fumbles, pulls it out.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        I thought you’d lost it?
                                 ANTHONY
                             (Answers it)
                        Hello?

           The call is from Liz, Anthony’s estranged wife. We only hear 
           Anthony’s end of the conversation.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a half seven in the morning,

                        I’m on my way there now with 
                        Johnny...

                        Johnny.
                             (Listens)
                        I told you on Tuesday.
                             (Listens)
                        Tuesday - what am I an echo? I told 
                        you the same day Emma brought home 
                        the picture of the witch she 
                        painted at school. It was a 
                        portrait of you...
                             (Listens)
                        Of course you don’t remember 
                        because you don’t remember anything-
                             (Interrupted)
                        -because you’re high the whole 
                        time! You’re high now, I can tell-
                             (Listens)
                        How? Because of-
                             (Interrupted)
                        -I’ll tell you how. Because of 
                        agitation-

           ANTHONY hears the line go dead. Kills the call his end too, 
           looks at the screen for a few moments. JOHNNY doesn’t 
           comment, just stares ahead at the road.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SCHOOL HALL, WADING RIVER - DAY

           JOHNNY pulls up in the crowded parking lot of a high school 
           gymnasium in the rural community of Wading River, on the 
           southern shore of the Sound. 
           Wreaths and flowers are laid outside, and there is a hearse 
           and two other funeral limousines, the DRIVERS leaning against 
           them smoking cigarettes. JOHNNY and ANTHONY hurry from the 
           truck to the gymnasium, ANTHONY adjusting his tie as he goes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM, WADING RIVER - DAY

           The funeral service is in progress as JOHNNY and ANTHONY 
           enter, embarrassed. They ease past half a row of people 
           before reaching some empty chairs. There is no coffin, but a 
           large photo of Chubs Gray, mid-20s, a Montauk fisherman, 
           displayed in the centre of the gymnasium on a stand, decked 
           in wreaths. Chubs’ father WALLACE, 60s, is speaking.

                                 WALLACE GRAY
                        ... my son was a good boy, the best 
                        any father could wish for...

           We see Wallace’s wife MARIE, haunted expression.

                                 WALLACE GRAY (CONT’D)
                        The best husband. The best brother. 
                        The best father. 

           We see Chub’s distraught widow SUZIE, 20s, and 
           uncomprehending three year old son RICKY, surrounded by 
           family - including Chubs’ cousin AMY, early 30s, dressed 
           formally in black but with ear, eyebrow and nose piercings 
           and some tattoos peeking out of the sleeves of her dress.

                                 WALLACE GRAY (CONT’D)
                        He was also the finest fisherman I 
                        knew. Hardworking. Careful. By the 
                        book. Even in his short life it got 
                        harder and harder to fish out of 
                        Montauk, but Chubs knew where the 
                        catch was, but he would never take 
                        unnecessary risks.

           During this a few dark glances are cast in the direction of a 
           well dressed (and therefore slightly out of place) couple in 
           their early 40s - TOM and DYAN HORN. Unlike everybody else 
           they are obviously not from a fishing family. They ignore the 
           looks they get, keeping their attention on WALLACE. 

                                 WALLACE GRAY (CONT’D)
                        The worst part is we still don’t 
                        know what happened to him. They 
                        found his boat, out there on the 
                        fifty fathom line. But they never 
                        found Chubs’, or his two crew 
                        mates. Three more lives lost to the 
                        sea... 
           During this we see, etched on the faces of everyone there, 
           how this hits home. We establish the sombre faces of - 
           amongst others - fishermen like DONNIE ALVERSA, 30s, RICK, 
           mid-40s and NED, 60s, a red-faced guy with a big whiskery 
           moustache. A whole fishing community come together to mourn 
           one of their own, everybody in the connected directly or 
           indirectly to someone claimed by the sea. JOHNNY looks on, 
           deep in thought. ANTHONY’S expression is sombre as he looks 
           around, trying to spot people he knows. He notices AMY and 
           studies her with interest for a few moments.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM, WADING RIVER - DAY

           The ceremony is over; the GUESTS form a line to pay their 
           respects to WALLACE and his family. JOHNNY and ANTHONY are 
           behind TOM and DYAN HORN, who shake hands with WALLACE:

                                 TOM HORN
                        -we’re so sorry for your loss.

                                 WALLACE GRAY
                        Will you be comin’ back to the 
                        house Tom? You’re very welcome.

           TOM is aware of a big fisherman in an ill-fitting suit, RICK, 
           40s, glowering at them.

                                 TOM HORN
                        We won’t thank you Wally, but 
                        thanks for inviting us.

           To establish a modest, gently dilapidated ranch-style house 
           surrounded by woods; Long Island Sound in the background. 
           Black ribbons are tied to the door; cars are stacked up on 
           the road outside. From inside:

                                 RICK (V.O.)
                        Can you believe that? Tom Horn and 
                        his old lady sittin’ there with 
                        everybody else...

           INT. GARAGE, WALLACE GRAY’S HOUSE - DAY

           JOHNNY sits with WALLACE and a dozen other FISHERMEN around a 
           wood burning stove in the garage. Deck chairs and crates have 
           been pressed into service as the men sit around the stove 
           drinking beer. RICK is in mid-flow.
                                 RICK
                        -just like they’re part of it? 
                        ‘Sorry for your fuckin loss?’

                                 WALLACE GRAY
                        Chubs skippered Tom’s yacht a 
                        coupla times last summer. It was 
                        nice of ‘em to come. 

                                 NED
                        Only reason they came Wally was to 
                        feel better about themselves - and 
                        that’s the truth. 

           Those around him nod in solemn agreement. 

                                 NED (CONT’D)
                        Seems to me people like them, fancy 
                        houses, fancy yachts - they’re the 
                        reason we keep on losin’ good men 
                        like Chubs.

           JOHNNY is getting irritated.

                                 RICK
                        Amen to that. Fuckin’ Cidiots ain’t 
                        got no right to be here today.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Come on guys - Wally don’t wanna 
                        hear this.  

                                 WALLACE GRAY
                        That’s okay, ain’t nothin’ nobody 
                        can say can hurt me any more today.

           But JOHNNY is angry with their tactlessness. He goes over to 
           the cooler, takes out another beer. Takes a deep draught.

           women - which is why he’s there and not in the garage. 
           ANTHONY brings over beers for himself and AMY. ANTHONY, big 
           smile on his face, touches bottles with her:

                        guy I know’s gonna get a big shock.

           They both take a drink of their beers, AMY looks intrigued.

           INT. THE DOCK - DAY

           GEORGE, early 60s, the acerbic Jewish bar owner, heads from 
           out the back for the main door, a big bunch of keys jangling 
           in his hand. He selects a key and opens the inner door, which 
           leads to a porch area. As he opens it a dead 200lb shark 
           falls on him, knocking him to the floor. He cries out in 
           fright, frantically disentangling himself from the huge 
           carcass. After a few moments he comes to his senses:

                                 GEORGE
                        Fuck you Anthony!

                        Two hundred pound shark. Got caught 
                        up in Paulie’s nets. Took both of

                        inshore for lobster, before it all 
                        got fucked up with the weedkiller 
                        and the insecticides from the 
                        holidays homes. Now we have to fish

           WALLACE and DONNIE have joined JOHNNY by the cooler. JOHNNY 
           nods over to RICK and NED.

                        I’m sorry you had to hear that 
                        bullshit Wally. I guess when 
                        something like this happens people 
                        look around for someone to blame.

                        snuffed out. His mother begged him 
                        not to go to sea but it was in his 
                        blood.

                        Yeh, well I guess my bloodline ends 
                        with me.

                        You’re the only two left. The only 
                        two guys fishing for lobster out of 
                        Montauk. 

                                 DONNIE
                        Only two stupid enough to take a 
                        little boat like that out into the 
                        Atlantic.

           JOHNNY smiles. WALLACE nods, thoughtfully, takes a drink.
                                 WALLACE GRAY
                        How’s Anthony?

                        Ah, you know him. ‘Everything’ll 
                        work out okay in the end’ - all 
                        that shit...

           WALLACE has his back to the garage window but through it 
           JOHNNY can see ANTHONY come out of the house with AMY and 
           head for his truck. 

                                 WALLACE GRAY
                        Where is he, by the way?

           ANTHONY and AMY disappear from view for a moment...

                                 JOHNNY
                        Oh he’s...

           ... then suddenly JOHNNY sees ANTHONY speed in front of the 
           window on his unicycle. AMY follows him, laughing. ANTHONY 
           pirouettes, circles her and generally shows off.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        I think he’s back at the house.

           JOHNNY starts to steer WALLACE and DONNIE back to the others - 
           away from the window.

                                 WALLACE GRAY
                             (Sudden thought)
                        You tell him to keep away from my 
                        nieces, yeh..?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHNNY’S TRUCK - DAY

           JOHNNY and ANTHONY drive back towards Montauk.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I can’t believe you’d do that. At a 
                        funeral! His fuckin’ cousin!

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hey - no foul. Nothing happened.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Only ‘cos she had some fuckin’ 
                        decency.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Oh I was practically begging. As 
                        you know, I don’t have a problem 
                        begging. 
           Up ahead are the familiar telegraph poles at crazy angles.

                                 JOHNNY
                        This is not funny.

           ANTHONY checks the latest weather bulletin on his cellphone. 
           Almost on the last leg of their journey now, he looks up as 
           they pass Montauk Manor, a 1920s Mock-Tudor hotel off 
           Edgemere Street. He points to it:

                                 ANTHONY
                        Montauk Manor - built by Carl G. 
                        Fisher in 1926. He built a whole 
                        bunch of Tudor buildings round here 
                        before he lost all his money.

           JOHNNY ignores him. They pass the tennis club, built in the 
           same style.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Look Johnny - see that Tudor 
                        building. Carl G. Fisher. 
                             (Beat, then adds)
                        Same guy built Indianapolis 
                        racetrack.

           But JOHNNY doesn’t look at that either; he nods to Anthony’s 
           cellphone.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What’s the weather doin’?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK HARBOUR - DUSK

           As the sun starts to fall JOHNNY and ANTHONY, now dressed in 
           working shorts and t-shirts, walk up the jetty to the ‘Anna 
           Mary’ carrying lobster pots. Just as JOHNNY goes to step on 
           board he sees that the entire deck is covered with sand, and 
           that two deck chairs have been set out in the middle with a 
           parasol, a bucket and spade and some sandcastles.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Awww - come on!

           ANTHONY turns and sees GEORGE standing on the front deck of 
           ‘The Dock’ smoking a big cigar, smiling and waving to them. 
           ANTHONY bows to him.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Touché.
                                 JOHNNY
                             (To ANTHONY)
                        Will you stop fuckin’ with him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DUSK

           The Anna Mary is headed out to sea. Shawn Mullins’ ‘Rock-A-
           Bye’ plays over the speaker, JOHNNY is sweeping the last of 
           the sand off the deck. ANTHONY emerges from down below with 
           some hot food - burgers, egg and cheese - and hands one to 
           JOHNNY. They both eat hungrily. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        What the fuck are they?

           He nods to a pair of rubber boots JOHNNY is wearing - with 
           extremely thick soles.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What?

                                 ANTHONY
                        They’re like, Frankenstein’s boots. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        They’re cushioned. For my knee.
                             (Bite of his burger)
                        You see Liz?

                                 ANTHONY
                        I spoke to her again on the phone. 
                        Couldn’t face goin’ round there. 
                        It’s crazy, so angry all the time. 
                        Full of agitation. Fuckin’ coke, 
                        crack - anything she can get her 
                        hands on.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I thought she got clean?

                                 ANTHONY
                        I gotta go for custody Johnny, I 
                        gotta get the girls outta there.

           JOHNNY nods, takes a mouthful of burger.

                                 JOHNNY
                        How are you gonna look after them 
                        when we’re at sea? You thought 
                        about that?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Guess I’ll have to hire someone. 
                                 JOHNNY
                             (Beat)
                        I can ask my mom. Maybe she can 
                        help you out sometimes?

                                 ANTHONY
                        I gotta do something Johnny, it 
                        ain’t safe for the girls to be 
                        around her.

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Finishing his burger)
                        I’ll take first watch.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           The Anna Mary ploughs on through the night, headed for the 
           lobster beds far out to sea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - NIGHT

           JOHNNY is on watch. He finishes a cup of coffee, pours the 
           dregs over the side and goes downstairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ANN MARY - NIGHT

           JOHNNY shakes the sleeping ANTHONY awake. ANTHONY takes a few 
           moments, then hauls himself up out of the bunk. As he pulls 
           his boots on JOHNNY takes his off and dumps himself onto the 
           still-warm bunk. ANTHONY picks up a history book about 
           Montauk he was reading earlier from the side of the bunk.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Carl G Fisher - it says in here he 
                        wanted to turn Montauk into the 
                        ‘Miami of the North’. Lost all his 
                        money in the 1929 crash. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        What is all this? When did you 
                        become interested in Carl G fuckin’ 
                        Fisher?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (Pulling his oilskin on)
                        When I have the girls I take 
                        Melanie to the library to do her 
                        homework while we’re waitin’ for 
                        Emma to finish hockey practice. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANTHONY (CONT'D)
                        I picked up a book one day and 
                        started to read it. I never really 
                        read a book before - they got some 
                        great books in there.

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Turning over)
                        It’s a library.

           ANTHONY looks at him for a few moments, he’s already almost 
           asleep. Just as he goes to leave, clutching his book, JOHNNY 
           mumbles after him:

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Turn the coolers on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAWN/DAY

           A MONTAGE of shots of the boys working from first light, now 
           with oilskin dungarees on. We see how hard their life is, 
           hauling pots hour after hour without a break. The setting is 
           savage but beautiful: heavy seas, big swells, baking hot sun 
           then, in an instant, torrential rain. It makes no difference 
           to them, they work through it all, music pumping out of the 
           little speaker (Anthony’s - mostly 80s - playlist). We see 
           the inherent danger - the sea ready to pluck them from the 
           deck if they don't have their wits about them at all times.

           * Strings of pots are hauled up from the ocean floor by a 
           winch - which ANTHONY operates. 

           * The pots are slid along a rail on the side of the boat and 
           they both pull crabs and lobsters out. Those big enough are 
           dropped down a chute into the tanks below; females with eggs 
           or those too small are tossed back in the sea.  

           * Empty pots are re-baited and stacked up on deck - which is 
           JOHNNY’S end of the operation.

           * JOHNNY throws in a marker buoy, and the re-baited pots then 
           slide off the back of the boat after it to settle on the 
           bottom again ready for the next trip.

           * Late afternoon a school of curious dolphins swim alongside 
           the boat; flashes of silver and white riding the boat’s wake. 
           ANTHONY reaches down and can almost touch them as he trails 
           his hand through the water.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           The boys head for another string of pots, but as ANTHONY 
           grabs the marker buoy all that is on the end is a frayed rope 
           - no lobster pots. He is dismayed:

                                 ANTHONY
                        You’re kiddin’ me!

           JOHNNY grabs the frayed rope, inspects how the end was cut.

                                 JOHNNY
                        There been any draggers this way?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (Thinks)
                        Hannen- 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Says it with him)
                        -Hannen.
                             (Beat)
                        Why does he fuckin’ do that - 
                        there’s scallop beds for miles in 
                        every direction. Why does he have 
                        to go draggin’ over our pots?

           JOHNNY hurls the buoy into a pile of traps in frustration.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK HARBOUR - DAWN

           The ‘Anna Mary’ chugs gently back into harbour. The boys look 
           beat as JOHNNY throws a mooring rope round a cleat and 
           ANTHONY kills the engine. Two KOREAN GUYS, mid-30s, wait for 
           them on the dock with a refrigerated truck.

                                 KOREAN GUY
                        How many pieces?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Sixteen, maybe eighteen hundred.

                                 KOREAN GUY
                        Lobster?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Yeh we got some lobster. More crab 
                        though this time.

                                 KOREAN GUY
                        Okay, that’s good. We take all of 
                        it.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAWN

           Surrounded by empty crates ready to be loaded up, JOHNNY 
           starts to unbolt the starboard deck hatch as ANTHONY drinks 
           from a carton of orange juice. When JOHNNY’S finished with 
           the spanner ANTHONY takes it from him, walks over to the port 
           hatch and starts to unbolt that. As JOHNNY reaches in and 
           starts to pull out some of the crabs stored in his tank, his 
           expression drops. The water feels suspiciously warm. As he 
           pulls out the first of the crabs he holds it up and sees it 
           if lifeless.

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Low voice)
                        Did you turn the cooler on?

           He knows from ANTHONY’S sudden, guilty expression that he 
           didn’t.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Uh, yeh. I think I did.

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Hisses under his breath)
                        What do you mean, you think?

           JOHNNY pulls out more crabs. Also dead. He has to dig down to 
           find one still moving. He catches the eye of the KOREAN GUYS, 
           watching him intently, and tries to smile, embarrassed.

                                 KOREAN GUY
                        We only take live.

           JOHNNY looks across to ANTHONY, who has also now felt how 
           warm the water in his tank is. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        I could have sworn I turned it 
                        on...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           Later. Of the twenty crates they were hoping to fill, only 
           eight have been packed with lobster and crab. A huge pile of 
           dead shell-fish litters the deck. One of the KOREAN GUYS 
           finishes packing the crates into their truck, the other peels 
           off notes from a huge roll of cash to pay ANTHONY. JOHNNY 
           watches, dark, angry expression.

                                 KOREAN GUY
                        ... eleven, eleven fifty, twelve 
                        hundred. We need more than this 
                        next time, we don’t come all this 
                        way for little catch. 
                                 ANTHONY
                        It won’t happen again.

           ANTHONY takes the money and pockets it. He and the KOREAN GUY 
           shake hands and they drive off. ANTHONY turns to face JOHNNY.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You fuckin’ idiot. 

           ANTHONY feels terrible, but hates being told off like this.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I’m sorry Johnny. But you could 
                        have checked the cooler too you 
                        know, any time you wanted.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I asked you to do it! Two hours 
                        before we reached the lobster bed 
                        it needed to be turned on - that 
                        was your watch. The one fuckin’ 
                        thing I ask you to do.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I thought I did!

           From behind them:

                                 HANNEN (OOV)
                        Hey guys, how’s it goin’?

           They turn to see HANNEN, a burly guy with stubbly beard, 
           early 50s, hands in his pockets, cocky expression, looking 
           down on them from the dock-side.

                                 HANNEN (CONT’D)
                             (Looking at the dead shell-
                              fish)
                        Ah, that’s too bad. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        How come you weren’t at Chubs’ 
                        funeral Hannen?

                                 HANNEN
                        I was out fishin’. Wally 
                        understands. 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Unable to restrain 
                              himself)
                        Yeh well next time you’re out 
                        fishin’, we’d appreciate it if you 
                        didn’t drag across our pots.

                                 HANNEN
                        Who says it was me? 
                                 ANTHONY
                        The rope was sheared, it was cut by 
                        a dragger.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You just said yourself you were out 
                        fishin’ yesterday.

                                 HANNEN
                        Listen, if you lay your pots near 
                        my scallop beds that’s your 
                        problem, I’m just tryin’ to earn a 
                        livin’ here.

                                 JOHNNY
                        We been fishin’ there for years - 
                        you got hundreds of square miles to 
                        drag for scallops. Why you gotta 
                        drag there? 

                                 HANNEN
                        Hey, my licence says I can drag 
                        where I like. Freedom boys, that’s 
                        what makes this country so great.

           HANNEN chuckles as he walks away, happy to have got under 
           their skin.

                                 HANNEN (CONT’D)
                        Got yourself a whole lot of dead 
                        shellfish there boys... 

           JOHNNY turns to ANTHONY, picks up a dead lobster and angrily 
           throws it at him. He gestures to the dead shell-fish all 
           around them. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        Look at this shit.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Why do you always take the moral 
                        high ground?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Because... what are you talkin’ 
                        about? I’m not takin’ any ground. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Feels to me like you are.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You have no fuckin’ ground Anthony, 
                        okay. I’m already on my ground, you 
                        have no ground.
                             (Really irritated)
                        And that is a complete 
                        misunderstanding of the phrase 
                        ‘takin’ the moral high ground’.
                                 ANTHONY
                        I told you I’m sorry. I’ve 
                        apologized... I don’t know what 
                        more to say.

                                 JOHNNY
                        What the fuck are we doin’ here. 
                        Three days out, and all we’ve done 
                        is cover our fuel costs. Whole trip 
                        for nothin’ - and two grand’s worth 
                        of lobster pots on the bottom...
                             (Beat)
                        You know what this is? This is 
                        just... wastin’ time.

           OUT on JOHNNY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           JOHNNY coughs out seawater, kicking, panicking, desperately 
           trying to keep above the night swell. He can see the lights 
           of the ‘Anna Mary’ still, but they are twinkling now in the 
           distance. He looks above him - a few stars, a dark sky. He 
           looks below, and the inky blackness causes him to shudder 
           involuntarily.

           Caption                                                     
           3:32am Wednesday July 24th 2013

           He treads water, turning all around through 360 degrees. He 
           sees nothing. In these early moments he still doesn’t quite 
           compute what has happened. Surely Anthony will wake up? 
           Surely someone will come along in a few moments and pick him 
           up? He says out loud to himself:

                                 JOHNNY
                        This is how I’m gonna fuckin’ die? 
                        Tonight? Like this?

           Now, in a rush, blind fury takes over. He bangs his fist onto 
           the water. A howl of sudden grief, the sound almost animal-
           like. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Anthony!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CABIN, ANNA MARY - NIGHT

           Back on the boat, Anthony stirs - he needs a piss and pulls 
           himself up. He rubs his eyes, vaguely aware of how quiet it 
           is - just the steady hum of the engine, no sound of anyone on 
           deck. He swings his legs over the edge of his bunk... 
           then sees the empty Gatorade bottle. He grabs it and starts 
           to take a leak into it. He fills it, puts it back on the side 
           and rolls back into his bunk. An opportunity missed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           JOHNNY floats with his head back against the water, eyes 
           shut. He speaks more quietly, to himself:

                                 JOHNNY
                        No fuckin’ way...

           He stays like this for a while, bobbing about in the swell, 
           totally alone in the ocean.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JOHNNY’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           To establish Johnny’s place, on the top floor of a modest two 
           storey block, wooden balcony outside piled with fishing gear. 
           Sitting by the steps on the ground floor is DEADWEIGHT, an 
           ancient old ex Montauk fisherman, stick thin, lined, 
           weathered face, who sits in a canvas chair smoking a 
           cigarette. From this vantage point he can look out to sea, 
           watching all the ships coming into and out of Montauk 
           harbour. JOHNNY pulls up in his truck in the bay outside and 
           gets out, totally beat.

                                 DEADWEIGHT
                        Hey Johnny.

           JOHNNY groans inwardly - he’s too tired for Deadweight.

                                 DEADWEIGHT (CONT’D)
                        You and Anthony go to Chubs’ 
                        funeral?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Shitty day, he was too fuckin’ 
                        young.

                                 DEADWEIGHT
                        I knew his father Wally when he was 
                        a young man. Hard worker.
                             (JOHNNY starts to climb 
                              the stairs)
                        Haven’t had a drink now in four and 
                        a half days Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        That’s good Deadweight.
                                 DEADWEIGHT
                        Four and a half days. But I didn’t 
                        have any money left over to buy any 
                        food. I was wonderin’ if you could 
                        lend me fifty and I can pay you 
                        back on Tuesday when I get my 
                        welfare check.

           JOHNNY puts his hand in his pocket and fishes out two tens.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Deadweight, here’s twenty. That’s a 
                        gift, you don’t have to pay me 
                        back, okay.

                                 DEADWEIGHT
                        God bless you Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        But if I see you drunk again that’s 
                        it, no more. Finito.

                                 DEADWEIGHT
                        You won’t Johnny, I’m done with 
                        drink, it’s cursed my life. Four 
                        and a half days now - I’m done with 
                        drink.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHNNY’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           JOHNNY lets himself in and is immediately attacked by his 
           huge old Bulldog ‘Boss’. The two of them roll around the 
           floor, JOHNNY scratching his belly and play-fighting, BOSS 
           licking JOHNNY all over his face.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You’re such a good boy aren’t ya... 
                        such a good boy...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A little later. JOHNNY flicks through some mail as he forks 
           some dog food into a bowl for BOSS; from the way he tosses 
           the letters aside we guess they are bills. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM, ANTHONY’S HOUSE - DAY

           ANTHONY helps his elderly, naked father VINCENT into the 
           shower. VINNIE, mid-70s, a small man but heavy built, is 
           disabled from the effects of a stroke. He has no movement in 
           his left arm and only limited mobility, his face dropped on 
           one side and his speech slurred. 
           The bathroom has been done out like a wet room and there’s a 
           stool under the shower. ANTHONY - who only wears briefs 
           himself - lowers VINNIE onto it.

                                 VINNIE
                             (Overlaps)
                        You have a good trip?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (Overlaps)
                        That’s it dad, come on - Jeez you 
                        don’t get lighter. 
                             (Beat)
                        It was okay. Problem with the 
                        cooler, lost some pieces. Water on - 
                        watch out it’s cold at first.

           VINNIE leans to one side as ANTHONY turns the shower on and 
           picks up a facecloth and soap.

                                 VINNIE
                        How’s Johnny?

           He knows his father will fret if he tells him what really 
           happened, so he ducks it.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeh he’s fine. 

                                 VINNIE
                        You gonna go see the girls?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeh, soon as I’ve fixed you some 
                        food I’ll go over.

                                 VINNIE
                        That’s good. That’s good...

           ANTHONY soaps up the facecloth and starts to wash his 
           father’s back for him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JANICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           JOHNNY, showered and changed, pulls up outside and walks up 
           to the front door of a modest detached house in Holbrook. He 
           rings the doorbell. A few moments, then JANICE answers. Late 
           30s, dyed-blonde hair, dressed nice, she’s pretty but wears a 
           lot of make up which seems to make her features harsher. Her 
           false nails are long and patterned with diamantes.

                                 JANICE
                        Hey.

           He leans forward, gives her a kiss. 
                                 JOHNNY
                        Hey.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOUNGE, JANICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           JANICE leads the way, JOHNNY follows her and flops down on 
           the sofa. The TV is on.

                                 JANICE
                        You want some pasta? 

                                 JOHNNY
                        The boys home?

                                 JANICE
                        They’re with their father. I can do 
                        you some pasta?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Nah, I’m not hungry.

                                 JANICE
                        So you wanna beer? Soda?

           Their eyes meet for a moment. Nothing is said.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, JANICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           JOHNNY and JANICE have sex in her bedroom. Sex rather than 
           making love. JANICE’S nails dig into his back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, JANICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Now JOHNNY eats pasta. He wolfs it down hungrily; JANICE 
           doesn’t eat, just drinks a vodka and Coke and smokes.

                                 JANICE
                             (Mid-conversation)
                        -they just opened this new place in 
                        East Hampton and Barbara said the 
                        steaks were an inch thick. And the 
                        fries were like, really really thin 
                        and curly - we should go there.

           JOHNNY indicates the huge bowl of pasta he’s demolishing.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m not gonna be hungry ‘til 
                        November.
                                 JANICE
                        She said it’s very expensive, but 
                        really classy.
                             (Beat, no response)
                        How’d the fishing go?

                                 JOHNNY
                        We had a... kinda problem.

                                 JANICE
                        What did he do this time?

           He doesn’t reply, just keeps on eating. JANICE’S disgusted 
           expression says it all. She opens a bottle and pours a little 
           more vodka in her glass.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LIZ’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           ANTHONY has driven over to the appartment he has rented for 
           his wife and girls in Middle Island. He bounds up the outside 
           staircase and approaches the door, knocks. As he waits for a 
           reply he turns and looks down at the road below, cars 
           passing, pedestrians, people taking their lunch break. 
           People, like him, enjoying the hot weather in shorts, T-shirt 
           and thongs. He turns back to the door, there’s been no reply, 
           and knocks again. He waits. Nothing.

                                 ANTHONY
                             (Calls out)
                        Come on Liz it’s me, I wanna see 
                        the girls.

           An OLD LADY two doors along empties a dustpan over the 
           balcony. There’s something about the look she gives him that 
           makes him figure she knows something. He bends down and 
           pushes open the letter box to peer through: 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Liz!

           What he sees worries him. Most significantly, there is no TV 
           in the corner - just an aerial lead hanging out of the wall. 
           Now he panics. He stands up and, ignoring the look from the 
           OLD LADY, thumps his foot into the door by the lock. It takes 
           him two more goes before the door flies open. He enters-

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIZ’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           ANTHONY strides in and it is clear that nobody is there. A 
           single small, white sock lies on the floor. He enters the 
           bedroom - the wardrobe doors are open and everything has been 
           cleared out - even the bedding. Next bedroom - the same. 
           Liz and the girls have gone. His breath comes short and fast, 
           he picks up the sock, stares at it...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN, JANICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           JOHNNY is seated at the table but JANICE stands between his 
           legs, stroking his hair.

                                 JANICE
                        I wanna go out Johnny, ‘cos I wanna 
                        show you how nice I can look.

           JOHNNY isn’t really listening, he’s kissing her cleavage 
           above her top. She’s kind of protesting but loving it really.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        We only just did it. Why d’you let 
                        me get dressed again?

                                 JOHNNY
                        I can’t control these things...

           A car pulls up outside. JANICE looks out onto the drive and 
           sees a pick-up pull up on the drive. 

                                 JANICE
                        It’s Frank and the boys - they’re 
                        early...

           JOHNNY quickly pulls his head out of her boobs. JANICE goes 
           to the door and opens it. She exchanges a hostile look with 
           her ex-husband FRANK, a shaven-headed body-builder type.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                             (To DAVE)
                        What’s the matter - you get bored?

           FRANK gives her the finger. Sons RICKY, 12 and CHASE, 15, 
           enter, and she closes the door. JOHNNY tries a smile with 
           RICKY and CHASE but they don’t really acknowledge him as they 
           pass through into the lounge. JANICE calls after them:  

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        And don’t just play those stupid 
                        computer games in there, do 
                        something useful. 

                                 CHASE
                        Like what?

                                 JANICE
                             (Irritated)
                        I don’t know? Watch Discovery 
                        Channel or somethin’.
           They both look at her as if she’s mad. She shuts the door on 
           them, turns back to JOHNNY.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        So, we goin’ out?

           Before he can answer a cellphone rings. It’s Johnny’s - next 
           to Janice’s on the table. She picks it and reads the display.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        Anthony. You wanna let it go to 
                        message?

           He takes it from her - she sighs, annoyed. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        He wouldn’t call me unless it was 
                        serious.
                             (Answers)
                        Anthony?
                             (Listens)
                        When?
                             (Listens)
                        Hold on, hold on. Where are you 
                        now?
                             (Listens)
                        Okay stay there I’ll come over.

           He hangs up, gets up.

                                 JANICE
                        What are you doin’?

                                 JOHNNY
                        I gotta go see him.

                                 JANICE
                        You just been tellin’ me what a 
                        jerk he is. Why can’t he deal with 
                        it himself? 

           JOHNNY pulls a wad of notes from his pocket - his half of the 
           catch money - and starts to count out $200.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Here, for you and the boys.

                                 JANICE
                        I been waitin’ three days for you. 
                        This is my time. 

           JOHNNY puts an empty glass on the money to pin it down.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to do that.
                                 JOHNNY
                        I know, but I want to. I’m sorry 
                        it’s not more, we had a bad trip.

           He can see she’s upset. He kisses her and leaves. OUT on 
           JANICE, unhappy. Mixed up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LIZ’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           JOHNNY climbs the stairs and walks towards the appartment. 
           The door is open, he sees the OLD LADY watching him. He gives 
           her a nod and goes inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIZ’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           JOHNNY sees the appartment has been cleaned out. He goes into 
           the bedroom, finds ANTHONY sitting on the floor, propped up 
           against the bed, smoking a big spliff.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I got no idea where they are 
                        Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You tried callin’ her? 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Phone’s dead. 
                             (Beat)
                        She knew I was goin’ for custody. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        You called the police?

                                 ANTHONY
                        She’s their mother. She ain’t 
                        breakin’ any law I know.

           He takes another puff on the spliff, passes it to JOHNNY who - 
           without really thinking about it - takes a drag

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                             (Beat)
                        I don’t hate her. I know you said I 
                        never should have married her, but 
                        I loved her. I really did.

                                 JOHNNY
                        She was doin’ coke on your wedding 
                        day.
                                 ANTHONY
                             (Thinks about this)
                        So was I. 
                             (Beat)
                        We made those babies out of love 
                        Johnny, they was made out of love.

                                 JOHNNY
                        There must be something we can do. 
                        What about her friends?

                                 ANTHONY
                        She’s flown. It’s too late. I 
                        should have seen it comin’.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Maybe she’s called one of them 
                        already? Come on let’s make a 
                        list... 

           ANTHONY gets up.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What the fuck. Rock-a-bye.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Rock-a-bye?

           ANTHONY walks out of the room, JOHNNY follows him.

           ANTHONY goes out onto the balcony, grips the rail, looks out. 
           JOHNNY follows him.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Rock-a-bye? What does that-
                             (Seeing the OLD LADY)
                        -could we have some privacy please?

           He realises he still has the spliff in his mouth and quickly 
           hides it in his hand. The OLD LADY looks at both of them, 
           then - a touch reluctantly - goes back inside her appartment.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        What does that mean?

                                 ANTHONY
                        It means everything’s gonna be all 
                        right. Rock-a-bye.

           JOHNNY looks at him, can’t quite get his head round his 
           friend’s attitude. 
                                 JOHNNY
                        How Anthony? How is it gonna be all 
                        right?

           He stands alongside ANTHONY for a few moments, also looking 
           out at nothing in particular.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Just out there is Fort Pond Bay. 
                        War Of Independence, the British 
                        army was gonna land there, but this 
                        guy John Dayton tricked them...

           On JOHNNY - what the fuck is ANTHONY talking about?

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Only had a few troops but he got 
                        ‘em to run all over the fort, make 
                        it look like there was hundreds, 
                        and the British bought it. They 
                        never landed. John Dayton, 1775.
                             (Beat)
                        It’ll work itself out Johnny. I 
                        have faith.

           JOHNNY has seen ANTHONY in this mood many times before, and 
           there’s no reasoning with him. JOHNNY brings the spliff back 
           up to his mouth, takes a deep drag on it... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

           JOHNNY has decided to shake himself into action. He treads 
           water, attempting to clear his thoughts. Is there anything he 
           can do to help himself? 

           Caption                                                    
           4:45am. One hour and twelve minutes in the water.

           A few moments as he turns over an idea in his mind, then he 
           dives under the surface - we are not sure what he’s doing? 
           He’s down for a few seconds then bursts up again with his 
           rubber boots in his hands. He empties them of water, one at a 
           time, then carefully pushes back under the surface upside 
           down, trapping air in them. He positions one under each 
           armpit, then stops kicking with his feet. He doesn’t sink! 
           He’s buoyant! A tiny triumph. 

           Next he needs to find out where he is. Now able to float 
           effortlessly, he lies back and stares up at the night sky. He 
           frowns, trying to work out the location of the North Star. 

                                 JOHNNY
                             (To himself)
                        Handle of the Big Dipper... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        find the handle, brightest star at 
                        the end, North Star.
                             (Searching the night sky)
                        North Star...

           He stares some more, but he is having no luck finding it.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Is that the Dipper? 

           He turns his head to a different angle - but is still unsure.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the fuckin’ handle..?

           Suddenly, he bumps into something floating in the sea. He 
           jolts, not expecting anything to touch him, and cries out in 
           panic as his face is enveloped in something wet and soft. He 
           instinctively shoves it away and it takes him a few seconds 
           before he realises it is a rotting seal carcass. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck..?

           He pushes it away, revolted. But it has unnerved him. He 
           looks about warily for a few moments, but all seems quiet. He  
           tries to focus again on the night sky, and his search for the 
           North Star.  

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                             (Murmuring to himself)
                        ...one, two, three... that must be 
                        it. One, two, three - end of the 
                        handle-

           Suddenly, with a loud ‘SPLASH’, something takes the carcass 
           and - in one go - disappears underwater with it. JOHNNY jolts 
           round to look at where the carcass was - all that is left are 
           ripples of disturbed water on the surface. What the fuck was 
           that? We see the fear - he looks around wildly. What is below 
           him? He looks down but can’t see anything, just a black, 
           terrifying void. Anything could be down there.

           He pulls his legs up under him, trying to make himself into a 
           ball, so he is less of a target. He knows just before dawn is 
           prime feeding time for the ocean’s predators.

           A sound to his right, he turns, and catches something 
           breaking the surface about thirty feet away. An unmistakably 
           shaped fin. He figures it’s a blue shark, judging by the size 
           of it about three hundred pounds. It keeps its distance, 
           seems to be just circling. Then it disappears. 

           Fuck! Is this it?

           JOHNNY reaches for a knife in his pocket, opens the blade - 
           though it’s only about four inches long - and holds it ready. 
           He looks below him but he can't see anything. He tenses. 
           Nothing... nothing... Then he feels something brush against 
           his feet - and he immediately kicks out. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! 

           He stabs out wildly with the blade but doesn’t hit anything. 
           His heart is pounding in his chest. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RESTAURANT, EAST HAMPTON - NIGHT

           A fancy new steak restaurant in East Hampton. The  wealthy 
           and the glamorous have come to check it out - we FIND JOHNNY 
           and JANICE at a table. She’s really made an effort - big 
           showy dress, hair up, dangly earrings - but inevitably she’s 
           tried too hard. JOHNNY looks uncomfortable - he’s most 
           definitely not the ‘showy’ type.

                                 JANICE
                        You don’t think I look too brassy?

                                 JOHNNY
                        You look great.

                                 JANICE
                        I feel like they’re lookin’ at me.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Relax will you. Nobody’s lookin’ at 
                        you.

                                 JANICE
                        You know, like ‘hey, look what the 
                        cat just dragged in’.

           JANICE eats some of her meal - steak and curly fries.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        I just want you to be proud of me.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Be proud of yourself. 

                                 JANICE
                        I love these fries. Don’t you love 
                        these fries Johnny?

                                 JOHNNY
                        I love ‘em.

                                 JANICE
                             (Beat, sip of wine)
                        You don’t have to be sarcastic all 
                        the time.
                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m sorry, I’m on edge. I need to 
                        go fishin’, I need to earn some 
                        money.

                                 JANICE
                        It’s okay I won’t have dessert.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I got ten more bucks for a dessert 
                        for Christ’s sake!

                                 JANICE
                        It’s twenty and I need to lose 
                        weight.

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Beat)
                        Anthony always has dessert first.
                             (JANICE rolls her eyes)
                        He sits down and gets them to serve 
                        him some ice cream or fuckin’ cake 
                        before his main course, ‘cos he’s 
                        too impatient to wait for his food 
                        to be cooked. Says he’s gonna have 
                        it anyway. 
                             (Beat)
                        That’s fucked up... 

                                 JANICE
                        You are happy aren’t you Johnny?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Am I happy? What does that mean?

                                 JANICE
                        It’s just, sometimes I feel like 
                        you don’t wanna be with me.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Oh come on, I thought we talked 
                        about this.

                                 JANICE
                        I’ve got the boys... I told myself 
                        I had to be careful with who I 
                        chose next. I don’t want them to 
                        have to see me with a whole load of 
                        different guys.

           He looks at her. Softens. Takes her hand.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m sorry. I’m happy you chose me 
                        Janice, truly I am. Now have some 
                        fuckin’ dessert.
           He manages to pull a smile out of her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE DOCK - NIGHT

           A riotous night - lots of FISHERMEN and GIRLS getting drunk. 
           In the middle of everything we find ANTHONY, being clapped on 
           by DONNIE and another buddy PAULIE, mid-40s. He’s doing the 
           Hula-Hoop surrounded by GIRLS - including MARY, late 20s. 
           He’s good, keeping it up as the GIRLS clap and cheer. We see 
           HANNEN looking on, sour-faced, with a couple of his CREW. 
           GEORGE, the owner of The Dock, calls over to him:

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey keep it up Anthony, I’ll throw 
                        you a fish.

           ANTHONY gives GEORGE the finger as he continues.

                                 HANNEN
                             (Loudly, to his CREW)
                        I thought he was supposed to be 
                        lookin’ for his kids.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, ANTHONY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ANTHONY is fast asleep in bed. With a lot of puffing and 
           panting, his FATHER enters the bedroom on his frame, very 
           slowly, tiny steps at a time costing him a lot of effort and 
           pain. He manages to edge over to the bed.

                                 FATHER
                        Anthony.
                             (Louder)
                        Anthony.

           ANTHONY stirs, opens his eyes, see his FATHER.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Dad? How d’you get in here?

                                 FATHER
                        Aren’t you supposed to be goin’ 
                        fishin’?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Sit down dad before you fall.

                                 FATHER
                        Fishin’ Anthony.

           A few moments, then ANTHONY checks his watch.
                                 FATHER (CONT’D)
                        You can’t treat Johnny like this.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK HARBOUR - DAY

           Early morning, the ‘Anna Mary is in her usual berth, a pair 
           of Space-Hoppers strapped to her bow made to look like tits. 
           JOHNNY is on deck busily preparing to go to sea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           An hour later and JOHNNY sits gloomily on an upturned lobster 
           pot. He watches a gleaming white motor cruiser, a typical 
           ‘fun palace’ from the wealthy side of Montauk harbour, glide 
           out to sea. He looks along the jetty: still no Anthony. He 
           checks his watch, then looks up and sees MARY who we can 
           tell, from her uniform, works in a pizza parlour. She hurries 
           up to the boat.

                                 MARY
                        Hi Johnny is Anthony there?

                                 JOHNNY
                        No Mary. He is not.

                                 MARY
                        Oh. I saw him in The Dock last 
                        night. He asked if any of us heard 
                        from Liz to let him know. 

           She pulls a letter out of her handbag and gives it to him.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        My friend Cherry got this from her 
                        this morning. But she doesn’t say 
                        where she is. I’m sorry.

                                 JOHNNY
                        That’s okay. I’ll give it to him.

           MARY leaves. JOHNNY takes the letter from the envelope and 
           reads it. Over this we hear from the incoming scene:

           ANTHONY sits in the garden of Donnie’s house in Amagansett, 
           the two of them drinking a beer. Donnie’s two young CHILDREN, 
           aged four and two, play in front of them.

                                 DONNIE
                        Come on Anthony, you can’t just 
                        leave him hangin’. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        I know what he’ll say. It’ll be 
                        that high ground thing he does, 
                        where he makes me feel like a piece 
                        of shit. And I feel shitty enough 
                        already.

                                 DONNIE
                        He’s your partner? You two have 
                        known each other since fuckin’ 
                        kindergarten.

                        right now... 

           He looks at Donnie’s KIDS.

           EXT ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAWN

           Just before dawn. The ‘Anna Mary’ steams south, like a ghost 
           ship with all the lights on but nobody on deck. As the shot 
           WIDENS we see the first fingers of light creep above the 
           horizon.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CABIN, ANNA MARY - DAWN

           A ray of sunlight streams through a porthole. ANTHONY stirs, 
           his mouth dry and parched with thirst. He reaches for the 
           Gatorade bottle on the side and picks it up. At the last 
           moment - though befuddled with sleep - he remembers that it 
           does not contain Gatorade. He puts it back down, thinks for a 
           few seconds, then yawns massively, and sits up.

           Caption                                                                      
           6:06am. Two hours thirty four minutes in the water.
           He scratches his head, scratches his balls, then looks at his 
           watch. It’s after 6am - why didn’t Johnny wake him up? 
           Finally, he gets up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTCI OCEAN - DAY

           JOHNNY finally sees the sun climb above the horizon, and for 
           the first time since he went in his face cracks into 
           something resembling a smile. At last, he can gauge his 
           position. Energized, he stops treading water and starts to 
           swim towards what he now knows to be the east. He tries a few 
           different strokes before settling on a sideways doggy-paddle, 
           which allows him to keep his boots under his arms. He feels 
           much better doing something, taking control of the situation. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALLEY, ANNA MARY - DAY

           ANTHONY wanders into the galley in his shorts and looks 
           around. No sign of JOHNNY, he must be up on deck. He goes 
           into the head and takes an endless leak. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHEEL-HOUSE, ANNA MARY/EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           ANTHONY emerges from down below into the wheel-house. Still 
           no sign of Johnny, he must be on deck. He carries on out onto 
           the deck and calls out:

                                 ANTHONY
                        Johnny - why didn’t you wake me?

           He sees there is nobody on the back of the boat and the first 
           signs of panic start to gnaw at him. He turns and runs to the 
           bow, calling out: 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Johnny!

           He’s not at the front of the boat either. Where is he? He 
           dives back into the wheel house...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALLEY, ANNA MARY - DAY

           ANTHONY bursts into the galley calling out wildly

                                 ANTHONY
                        Johnny!
           He opens the door to the engine compartment. Is he in there?

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Johnny!

           No. He’s not in there either.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           ANTHONY runs out onto the deck.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Oh Jeez...

           He sees a hatch to one of the tanks lying upside down on the 
           deck and an awful thought occurs to him - has he fallen in 
           there? Johnny would never have purposely left it lying there 
           like that because it is a sign of bad luck to a fisherman 
           (signifying that the boat will also end up upside down). He 
           ducks his head down into the tank and looks around - he’s not 
           in there either. He pulls himself up, head drenched. 

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                             (Huge shout)
                        Johnny!

           Shit! Johnny is definitely not on board. He looks at the open 
           back of the boat, the wake snaking off into the distance. Oh 
           shit...

           Petty Officer Sean DAVIS, burly, mid-30s, is the radio 
           operator on watch. He has speakers from four different 
           channels aimed at him from different angles (so he knows by 
           direction where the radio traffic is from). He sits at a big 
           screen showing the New Haven sector (basically the whole of 
           Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean due south from 
           there) and has a microphone on a stand in front of him. A 
           message comes in on Channel 16, the distress channel. We hear 
           ANTHONY’S voice, nervous and faltering:

           ANTHONY holds his radio as he stands at the wheel, looking 
           more dazed and disbelieving, than panicky:

           with a laid back, easy-going style, looks up from his desk, 
           coffee in hand, as he hears the message. He wanders over the 
           short distance until he’s standing behind DAVIS.

                        um, and I never got woken up for my 
                        watch. He was supposed to wake me 
                        around eleven thirty, but I woke up 
                        at about six this morning and he's

                        I have no clue whatsoever of where 
                        he fell overboard or how many hours 
                        ago he fell overboard. I know we 
                        were going due south from Montauk

                        maybe thirty micro-seconds west

                        Suggest you turn around and head 
                        back the way you were coming. Can 
                        you give me a weather check cap’n.

           ANTHONY immediately sees the logic of this, disengages the 
           auto-pilot and spins the wheel, taking the boat through a 360 
           degree turn until it is headed back the way it came.

                        That’s good copy cap’n. Request to 
                        know what speed you were doing last

           it with his pen. He speaks to ANTHONY as he does so:

                                 WINTERS (CONT’D)
                        So you’re saying he could have gone 
                        over any time between nine last 
                        night, when you went to sleep, and 
                        six this morning, when you woke up?

                                 ANTHONY
                        That’s correct.

           WINTERS exchanges a look with DAVIS. This is bad. A nine hour 
           window.

                                 WINTERS
                        Cap’n, was John wearing a life 
                        jacket? 

                                 ANTHONY
                             (Beat)
                        That’s a negative sir.

           DAVIS gives WINTERS a ‘what the fuck? look.

                                 WINTERS 
                             (To DAVIS)
                        None of ‘em do.
                             (Transmits to ANTHONY)
                        No emergency position indicator?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Negative.

                                 WINTERS
                             (To DAVIS)
                        It’s six hundred dollars plus 
                        subscription. Way they look at it, 
                        that’s fifty lobsters.
                             (Back to radio)
                        Is he a good swimmer Anthony?
                                 ANTHONY
                        Yes, he is. He’s in exceptionally 
                        good shape. Um...
                             (Sudden thought)
                        He’s very resourceful, also.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           JOHNNY is swimming hard, all the time trying to lift his 
           head, looking for something. He thinks he sees something but 
           with the swell he’s not sure. Then, for a moment, as the 
           waves part, he sees them - a line of fishing buoys he knew 
           would be there about half a mile away - and we realize what 
           he was headed for. Excited, he strikes out for them - but is 
           now suddenly overcome by an agonizing attack of cramp in his 
           calf. He has to stop and grab his muscle, trying to massage 
           it back to life. It takes a good ten seconds for the pain to 
           pass... then he realises his boots have gone. He looks about, 
           panicking, and sees they have floated twenty feet away. 

           He swims after them but they seem to be getting further away. 
           Panicking, JOHNNY digs in hard and swims as fast as he can, a 
           mad, wild front crawl, until finally he grabs them, 
           overwhelmed with relief but having used up precious reserves 
           of energy. He lays on his back for a few moments, exhausted. 
           Then he turns on his front, looks for the line of buoys 
           again. He spots them blinking up and down through the swell a 
           half mile away. He empties the water out of the boots, 
           carefully puts them under each arm and resumes swimming.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ANTHONY is up on the wheel house roof, desperately scanning 
           the sea for any sign of Johnny. He has the radio mic,

           Montauk - some sixty miles to the north. And over this we 
           play the coastguard’s official distress broadcast:

           WALLACE GRAY is at the wheel of his ship the ‘Tremayne’, a 
           small dragger with which he fishes for squid. He hears the 
           broadcast over Channel 16:

                        sixty miles offshore.

                             (To himself)
                        Five and sixty?

           WALLACE knows that’s a potentially huge search area. He steps 
           out of the wheel house and shouts to his two CREW MEMBERS, 
           preparing to cast their squid net. 

                                 WALLACE GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Boys! Forget it - we’re turnin’ 
                        around.

           The CREW MEMBERS look mystified.

                                 WALLACE GRAY (CONT’D)
                        There’s a man in the water.

           Without another word they start to stow the nets. WALLACE 
           goes back into the wheel house and sets a new course.

           the ‘Last Mango’, and sits in a chair ready for some sport 
           fishing. PAULIE, (Anthony’s friend from ‘The Dock’), the 
           boat’s skipper, approaches him.

                                 PAULIE
                        I’m real sorry Mr. Buffett, but 
                        would you mind if we went fishin’ 
                        another day? 
                             (BUFFET looks at him, 
                              incredulous)
                        We got a man in the water and I’d 
                        like to go help find him.

           A beat, then JIMMY starts to reel his line in.

                        Sure. Is it someone you know?

           HANNEN is at the wheel of his scallop dredger, far out to 
           sea. He listens intently to the end of the Coast Guard 
           emergency broadcast.

           On HANNEN, grave expression. A beat, then he opens the door 
           to the wheel house and calls out to his CREW.

           JOHNNY’S eyes and tongue are puffy and swollen from the salt 
           water, but he’s within striking distance of the line of buoys 
           he's been trying so hard to reach.

           His precious boots under his arms, kicking and swimming with 
           one hand, JOHNNY starts to near the first buoy. But, as he 
           gets to within twenty yards, he realises to his horror that 
           the current is going too fast. He tries to swim against it at 
           the last moment, but it's too strong and it sweeps him by the 
           buoys - missing by just a few yards. He has exhausted himself 
           with the effort, and lets out an anguished roar of 
           frustration as he drifts helplessly away from the buoys.

                             (To keep the peace)
                        Okay I’ll have some.

           He picks the sandwich up and takes a bite. JOHN Snr gives his 
           wife a triumphant nod.

                        If you want anything just call.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Okay - but I don’t. 

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        He’s got a sandwich he’s okay!

           She bustles off. Both men take a bite of their sandwiches.

                                 JOHN SNR. (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were goin’ fishin’ 
                        today?
                                 JOHNNY
                        So did I. 

           A beat. JOHN Snr knows exactly what this means. He knows how 
           unhappy JOHNNY is with things at the moment.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        No message. No text. Just another 
                        no show.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        Anthony’s goin’ through a bad time 
                        Johnny. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        He’s out every night gettin’ 
                        wasted! Fuckin’ riding his unicycle 
                        and Hula-Hoopin’. 

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        He’s lost his family. The only way 
                        you’ll understand what he’s goin’ 
                        through is when you have your own.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I could have a family right now - a 
                        ready-made one. But you all got 
                        this thing about Janice.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        That’s your mother and Cathy, don’t 
                        pay any attention to them. Maybe 
                        they’re jealous ‘cos you buy her 
                        nice things. I like her. All we 
                        want is for you to be happy son. 
                        And if that’s with Janice that’s 
                        fine by me.

           He takes a sip of iced tea. JOHNNY broods for a few moments.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Just a coupla days he says. That 
                        becomes five, becomes six, seven - 
                        and three weeks later we still 
                        haven’t gone fishin’. I need to 
                        work dad.

           JOHN Snr looks at his son.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        You got the bank on you?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Yeh I got the bank... Finance 
                        company, credit card company - we 
                        just paid out for a whole load of 
                        work on the boat - I need to work. 
                                 JOHN SNR.
                        Tell Anthony how you feel. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        How I feel is... how did my life 
                        get to be so shitty? He’s got 
                        this... spastic, fucked up, car 
                        crash life - and I’m bein’ forced 
                        to live it with him. It feels like 
                        the end dad.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                             (Beat)
                        Remember when I got you your first 
                        car?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Yeh I remember. Anthony said 
                        ‘great, we’ve got a car’.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        He was always the one gettin’ the 
                        girls to go for a ride in it. Never 
                        you. But you did okay ridin’ 
                        shotgun if I remember right. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        He was my friend. My best friend.

           To establish the station, a collection of low rise concrete

                                 WINTERS (V.O.)
                        Anthony said Johnny was supposed to 
                        wake him for his watch at eleven 
                        thirty, right?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COMMAND CENTRE, NEW HAVEN COASTGUARD - DAY

           WINTERS is at his computer screen, attempting to input data, 
           but - from his laborious, one-finger style - we can see that 
           it’s not something that comes easy to him. DAVIS checks his 
           hand written notes in front of him.

                                 DAVIS
                        Uh... yeh. Eleven thirty. That’s 
                        what he said.
                                 WINTERS
                        Okay. So the most likely time he 
                        went in was between nine and eleven 
                        thirty - which would explain why he 
                        didn’t wake Anthony up? 

                                 DAVIS
                             (Thinks)
                        Yeh. But we can’t rule out he went 
                        in later.

                                 WINTERS
                        Sure. So how the fuck do we load 
                        that into SAROPS? We want a total 
                        search area and a specific search 
                        area at the same time.

           WINTERS stares at the screen for a few moments.

                        Who’s that new kid breakin’ in this

           He gets up and quickly heads for the exit.

           INT. CANTEEN, NEW HAVEN COAST GUARD CENTRE - DAY

           RODOCKER, mid-20s, a quiet, studious-looking guy, sits at a 
           table, glass of water in front of him, sending messages on 
           his cell phone; there are a couple of other CREW MEMBERS in 
           there eating their breakfasts. WINTERS pushes through the 
           door and calls across to him.

                                 WINTERS
                        Hey Rodocker. You’re a geek, right?

                                 RODOCKER
                             (Embarrassed)
                        Sorry?

                                 WINTERS
                        You’re a computer geek, right?

                                 RODOCKER
                        I really don’t know what you mean 
                        sir.

                                 WINTERS
                        You don’t eat burgers do you?
                                 RODOCKER
                        No sir.

                                 WINTERS
                        Okay get over here before I throw a 
                        one at you.

           RODOCKER gets up, a little hesitantly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           RODOCKER is installed at a computer terminal, WINTERS hovers 
           over him.

                                 RODOCKER
                             (Staring at screen)
                        So you want a general search area, 
                        but you also want an area of higher 
                        probability within the same search 
                        pattern?

                                 WINTERS
                        Yeh. Can you do that?

                                 RODOCKER
                        Yes sir. 

           WINTERS is about to launch into some expletives.

                                 RODOCKER (CONT’D)
                        I can do that.

                                 WINTERS
                        Okay... Good. Thank you.

           As RODOCKER starts to tap in data, DAVIS gets a call on 
           Channel Sixteen.

                                 ANTHONY (V.O.)
                        Coast Guard this is the Anna Mary

           DAVIS calls over to WINTERS.

                                 DAVIS
                        Sir!

           WINTERS hurries over to DAVIS as ANTHONY speaks:

                                 ANTHONY (V.O.)
                        Coast Guard I got a whole load of 
                        guys out of Montauk who want to 
                        help look for Johnny. Uh... I’m not 
                        sure what to say to them. Over.
                                 WINTERS
                             (Transmits)
                        Cap’n we’ll work somethin’ out for 
                        them. But in the meantime we have 
                        to try and narrow down this search 
                        area. If we take it from nine pm to 
                        six am that’s a sixty, seventy mile 
                        track line. By the time we factor 
                        in drift we’re talkin’ about...
                             (Calculates)
                        ... maybe two thousand square 
                        miles. When Johnny didn’t wake you 
                        up for your watch at eleven thirty, 
                        I’m guessing it could have been 
                        because he was in the water. Do you 
                        copy that?

           ANTHONY, on top of the wheel house, considers his reply.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I guess so. I mean, he could have 
                        taken a longer watch for some 
                        reason, but I don’t... I wouldn’t 
                        understand why he would have. 

                                 WINTERS (V.O.)
                        Okay, good copy there. 

           OUT on ANTHONY, mind turning. The row with Johnny the night 
           before weighing heavily on him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONTAUK HARBOUR - DAY

           Early evening. ANTHONY screeches to a halt in his truck and 
           jumps out - still wearing the same clothes he wore the night 
           before (an Hawaiian shirt with a paper garland of flowers 
           round his neck). He grabs a battered rucksack and walks along 
           the quay, wondering if Johnny will be there. As he reaches 
           the boat, there is JOHNNY on deck, mending some pots with a 
           pair of pliers. JOHNNY stops what he’s doing, looks at him.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I... gotta apologize. I know I 
                        ain’t been around for the last 
                        couple of weeks, but I’ve been 
                        struggling without the girls and... 
                        well I’m here. 
                                 JOHNNY
                             (Beat)
                        I been here waitin’ for you all day 
                        Anthony. Again.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeh I’m sorry about that too. I 
                        just thought when I didn’t show 
                        this morning you’d guess I was-

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Cuts across him)
                        I don’t wanna hear any more of your 
                        bullshit. I just wanna go fishin’ 
                        and get this over with.

           He walks into the wheel-house.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           The sun is starting to set as the ‘Anna Mary’ finally puts to 
           sea. ANTHONY fiddles with the music system and ‘Don’t You 
           Forget About Me’ starts to play.

           EXT. MONTAUK POINT - DAY

           LOW ANGLE (as before) as the boat passes, music playing, the 
           ‘tits’ still strapped to it.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           ANTHONY is at the wheel, sipping a cup of coffee. He sees the 
           letter from Mary that Johnny has pinned to the notice board 
           in the wheel-house and takes it down.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What’s this?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Mary dropped it off this morning.

                                 ANTHONY
                        It’s from Liz? 

                                 JOHNNY
                        There’s no address.
                                 ANTHONY
                        When were you gonna tell me about 
                        it?

                                 JOHNNY
                        Fuck you. How about this mornin’?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DUSK

           The boat is now out to sea. Both men are on deck moving stuff 
           around to make space. ANTHONY heaves a large cooler chest 
           aside, which knocks some pots, which topple and fall off the 
           back of the boat. As JOHNNY tries to grab them, a loop of 
           rope coils round his foot, tightens, and drags him towards 
           the water. He cries out and manages to jam his other foot 
           against the back of the boat. ANTHONY dives over and grabs 
           him under his armpits, pulling him back as hard as he can. 
           For a moment it looks as if the rope will pull JOHNNY off the 
           back and down into the depths with the pots, but at the last 
           moment the rope slides off his foot, releasing him. He and 
           ANTHONY both fall back on the deck.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Jesus I almost got killed there!

                                 ANTHONY
                        I’m sorry Johnny, I was just movin’ 
                        the cooler and... 

           They both lie on the deck panting.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I could have been dragged under! 
                        You don’t take any of this shit 
                        seriously.

                                 ANTHONY
                        It was an accident.

           JOHNNY gets up and angrily walks away from him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHEEL-HOUSE, ANNA MARY - DUSK

           JOHNNY is at the wheel, staring out to sea. ANTHONY enters.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I can't do this any more.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What does that mean?
                                 JOHNNY
                        It means we can’t go on like this. 
                        I’m sorry for your shit with Liz 
                        and the girls, but I’m fuckin’ 
                        broke.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I’m fuckin’ broke. So what, we’ll 
                        turn it around. We been in scrapes 
                        before. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        You know what. This whole, 
                        relentless, ‘everything’ll be okay’ 
                        thing you do, just makes me want to 
                        puke. All we ever do is catch up 
                        from mistakes. Life doesn’t just 
                        happen, you have to go out and make 
                        it happen...

           They look at each other, eyes blazing, angry.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM, JANICE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           JOHNNY lies in bed having just had sex. The bathroom flushes 
           and JANICE pads back into the room, naked except for panties, 
           and gets back in bed.

                                 JANICE
                        Why don’t you go without him?

           He looks at her puzzled for a moment.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        Hire some guy, pay him a couple of 
                        hundred for the trip and keep the 
                        rest. I don’t know why you split 
                        everything fifty-fifty with Anthony 
                        anyway when you do all the work. 

           JOHNNY shrugs, frustrated, doesn’t want to talk about it.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        You’d make more money. Nothing 
                        would go wrong... You’d keep to 
                        schedule... 

           She lets this hang, waiting for a response. But JOHNNY is 
           just looking at her boobs. She covers them with the sheet.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not listening to me. I’m 
                        trying to help you. I love you 
                        Johnny.
                                 JOHNNY
                        And I’m enormously fond of you.

           He smiles ‘I’m joking’ (though he has avoided a direct 
           answer). She gives him a playful shove.

                                 JANICE
                        I just see you being dragged down 
                        the whole time. Anthony is why you 
                        never get ahead in life.

           He looks at her, annoyed. But he also knows she’s right. She 
           drops the sheet.

                                 JANICE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, now you can look.

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DUSK

           JOHNNY paces about on deck, trying to speak quietly to Janice 
           on his cellphone.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I’m talking to him right now. 
                             (Listens)
                        I know what to say. Okay. I can 
                        find my own words. Jesus! Now will 
                        you just leave me to do it in my 
                        own way?

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNNY is swimming aimlessly on his side.

           9:04am. Five hours thirty two minutes in the water. 

           He stops for a moment and lifts his head. He’s pretty sure he 
           can hear... yes, he can hear an aircraft. He searches the sky 
           and there it is, a small dot around ten, fifteen miles away, 
           but he figures it must be looking for him. He’s momentarily 
           lifted by the thought as the plane turns in a lazy circle and 
           disappears. But then, as he treads water, he suffers another 
           attack of cramp in his other calf. Again, it’s agony, and 
           he’s forced to try and massage his muscle to ease the pain. 
           He knows he didn't eat much last night, he was too angry - 
           which is why he's cramping. What to do? He looks around and 
           sees some seaweed floating by. He grabs it and forces himself 
           to eat it. He gags - it tastes disgusting - but he has to get 
           some salt and some energy into his body somehow.

           A fixed wing Coast Guard plane flies low. As it passes we see 
           a Datum Marker Buoy dropped from it into the water. The buoy 
           will now start to transmit data about water temperature, 
           currents and wind back to Coast Guard command.

                        It’s got to be high - why else 
                        wouldn’t he have woken Anthony?

           Out of his window he sees the other helicopter peel away to 
           fly a different search pattern. He acknowledges the other 
           pilot with a wave as he sets a new course. Now that he has a 
           lock DEAL engages auto-pilot, so that he and JAMROS leave the 
           helicopter to fly itself while they stare at the water below. 
           In the back of the craft flight mechanic Ethan HILL looks 
           down at the sea through the open door on the right side of

           SUSAN, an elegant school mom, chats with BETTY, an older lady 
           from a working fishing family. NED, (who we saw at Chubs 
           Gray’s funeral) is listening to their conversation.

                                 SUSAN
                        Jimmy Buffett’s boat is out there, 
                        and Dick Clayton’s - and my husband 
                        turned up at the golf club this 
                        morning and they cancelled their 
                        game and went out on Tom Horn’s 
                        yacht to go searching.

                        My husband and his crew were due 
                        back today after three days 
                        catching squid - and they’ve gone 
                        straight back out to see if they 
                        can help. It’s a terrible thought, 
                        poor Johnny out there in the water. 
                        What must be going through his 
                        mind?

                        only way they come out is cold and 
                        gray.

                        And the most obvious reason for 
                        that is he wasn’t on the boat.

           JOHNNY is still swimming, but the stroke is weaker. His eyes 
           are almost shut from the salt. He is already way beyond most 
           expectations for survival in the North atlantic.

           11:22am. Seven hours fifty minutes in the water. 

           JOHNNY has been awake now for more than forty hours. Although 
           the sea is relatively warm at seventy two degrees, it is 
           still well below his body temperature and is slowly, 
           relentlessly sapping his body heat. But still he refuses to 
           give in. He sights a second string of buoys, and this time he 
           uses the tide rather than fights it. He is at right angles to 
           the string, kicking hard. He drifts agonisingly close, looks 
           like he might miss it again for a moment, but then reaches 
           out and manages to grab a buoy. At last! He’s made it! He 
           shouts out in pure joy... Finally, he has the situation a 
           little more under his control. He can stop swimming and just 
           hold on - he’s master of his own destiny again.

           Their daughter CATHY, slim, late 30s, enters from the 
           kitchen.

                                 CATHY
                        I put some meatballs in the freezer

                        bakes 24/7!

           The phone rings. CATHY ignores it, sits on the arm of her 
           mother’s chair.

                                 CATHY
                        Hey look at this picture of Jake...

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        Is nobody gonna get that?

           They ignore him; CATHY shows her mother a picture of her five 
           year old son, Jake, in the garden holding a huge toad.

                                 ADDY
                        Oh my goodness! And he wasn’t 
                        frightened? That’s so good to have 
                        no fear at that age...

           With a big sigh JOHN Snr gets up and walks over to the 
           sideboard where the phone has been left.

                                 JOHN SNR.

                                 THEEL

                        John, who is at this time missing 
                        at sea.

           JOHN Snr’s legs seem to sag as he receives this news.  

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        No...

           ADDY sees something is wrong.

           JOHN Snr steadies himself with a hand on the sideboard.

           JOHN Snr turns to his wife and daughter.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        They’re saying Johnny’s missing.

           ADDY clasps her hands to her face.

                                 ADDY
                        Oh my God...

                        Okay, just a minute...
                             (To CATHY)
                        He says put it on speakerphone.

           (she works in a beauty salon). Son RICKY is at the table 
           eating from a large bowl of nachos as he watches TV. As she 
           reaches the door her cellphone rings. She answers:

           JANICE listens as she locks the front door behind her and 
           walks towards her parked car, (a tatty saloon). THEEL fills 
           her in and she stops, face dark as thunder.

                        The reason he’s in the water is

           ANTHONY is in the wheel house, straining his eyes, scanning 
           the sea, the boat on auto-pilot headed back the way he came. 
           He gets a call over the radio.
                                 MIKE REILLY (V.O.)
                        Anthony this is Mike Reilly from 
                        the Viking on twenty two.

           ANTHONY switches to that channel, grabs up the radio handset 
           and replies.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hi Mike this is Anthony.

                        Hey I think I passed you guys last 
                        night.

                                 ANTHONY
                        When?

                                 MIKE REILLY (V.O.)
                        Maybe, around four in the mornin’. 
                        We were on our way back in and we 
                        saw you comin’ out.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Did you see Johnny on deck?

                                 MIKE REILLY (V.O.)
                        Deck lights were on, but we didn’t 
                        see nobody. I radioed you couple of 
                        times to say hello but didn’t get 
                        an answer.

                                 ANTHONY
                        About four?

                                 MIKE REILLY (V.O.)
                        That’s right.

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           ANTHONY goes back out on deck. He looks at the open back of 
           the boat, deep in thought. He has lots of stuff whirling 
           around inside his head and he knows he has to try and get 
           things clear. He’s beginning to have seconds thoughts about 
           his original strategy of just leaving it all to the Coast 
           Guard... he realises that he might have to take control of 
           the situation. The first thing he needs to do is to try and 
           work out what happened last night...

           He spots a spanner lying by the edge of the deck - he hadn’t 
           spotted it before. He turns to look at the starboard deck 
           hatch, lying on the deck. Again the thought hits him - 
           ‘that’s bad luck, Johnny would never have left it like that’. 
           He looks to the port hatch, and sees now that two big coolers 
           are stacked on it. He walks over and sees that it would be 
           impossible to lift it up without first moving the coolers. 
           And now he sees it, a strip of white plastic lying by a coil 
           of rope. He walks over and picks it up, touches it, feels the 
           sharp edges. He realises what it is - the sheared-off handle 
           from the bottom cooler. It fits the broken handle still left 
           on the cooler like a piece from a jigsaw puzzle. And suddenly 
           it becomes clear to him what has happened. He dives back into 
           the wheel-house. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNNY clings on to his buoy, picking little bits of seaweed

           He sees a helicopter - but it’s far off to the north east, 
           way too far away to see him. His head drops.

                        Well that’s the thing, I don’t 
                        think he would have been doin’ this

           JANICE is in the kitchen watching the TV with RICKY, still in 
           her white coat. The news is on:

           ANTHONY is searching through the accumulated junk in the 
           wheel house, looking for a possible note. He sees the letter 
           delivered earlier by Mary pinned to the notice board - and 
           now sees that the post mark has been ringed by Johnny. He 
           studies it, sees the letter was posted in Laguna Beach, Ca. 
           and realises the significance. He can’t help a little smile.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hey look, I found a note. The note 
                        was a cooler chest moved out of 
                        position, a hatch upside down on 
                        the deck, a spanner and a broken 
                        cooler handle. The note says he 
                        fell off the back by accident, 
                        okay? He's out there and I know he 
                        ain't dead.

           Pilot Mike DEAL is carrying out another search pattern; he 
           and his team scan the water below. In the back of the craft 
           flight mechanic Ethan HILL looks down through an open door - 
           and sees a large dark shadow just under the water - he 
           realises it’s a shark.

                             (Into headset)
                        Jeez... anybody else see that 
                        shark?

           He sees from HOVEY’S face that he saw it too.

           EXT. MONTAUK COASTGUARD STATION - DAY

           CATHY (driving) and JANICE pull up by the gate to Coast Guard 
           station Montauk, (a much smaller station than New Haven, on 
           the edge of Montauk Harbour). A GUARD emerges from a Guard 
           House and CATHY collects Janice’s driver’s licence, puts it 
           with her and hands it to the GUARD.

                                 CATHY
                        Hello I’m Cathy Patterson and this 
                        is Mrs. Arrigoni, we were told we 
                        could come here - John Aldridge the 
                        fisherman in the water? I’m his 
                        sister and this is his fiancée. 

                                 GUARD
                        Okay we’ve been expecting you. 

           He looks in the back of the car.

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Could you flip the trunk please?

           CATHY gets out and opens the trunk. There’s the usual clutter 
           in there - coats, boxes - and a large plastic container 
           containing three dozen corn dogs. The GUARD picks it up. 
                                 CATHY
                        I’m sorry that’s my mother, she 
                        always thinks everyone’s hungry.

           The sun beats down and he is starting to get a little 
           delirious from exposure and dehydration. He can see tiny 
           specks on the horizon - boats far to the north east. He

           arm underwater. It takes him a moment then he suddenly shakes 
           himself fully awake. Something huge has come close up to him 
           to take a look - it’s nearly ten feet long and a fin sticks 
           out of the water. For a moment he thinks it’s a shark then, 
           as he pushes himself away from it in terror, he realises it 
           is a Sunfish which, in spite of its size, is totally 
           harmless. He is now very awake, watching as  the Sunfish 
           swims off. 

           He looks to the east again, at those dots on the horizon - he 
           can see a tiny helicopter too. He stares at them, and he 
           knows if he stays here the chances are they won’t find him. A 
           few more moments then, with a sinking expression, he knows 
           what he has to do:

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck...

           He reaches into his pocket and takes out his knife. He opens 
           the blade, and then... cuts himself free. He’s tried doing it 
           his way, taking control of the situation. And now, even 
           though it’s alien to his nature, he knows his only chance is 
           to surrender himself to fate. He holds onto his buoy and 
           drifts. Just drifts now, wherever the current takes him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ANTHONY is back up on the roof of the wheel house, leading

           some wartime convoy with a line now of twenty five Montauk 
           vessels behind him.

           JOHNNY has stopped at another line of buoys that he’s 
           crossed. He picks off some more seaweed from them and stuffs 
           it in his mouth before cutting one free and tying it to his 
           one. He hauls himself up so he’s sitting - hammock style - 
           with a leg either side of a rope between the two buoys. Under 
           his armpits the rubber boots still do their job, holding him 
           upright in the water. Once more, he drifts with the current.

                        of the others are still on their 
                        way, may take some time before 
                        they’re in the line.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Please, everybody, get here as fast 
                        as you can. I don’t wanna think 
                        about the light goin’ on us.

           He turns his eyes again to the sea, in front and to either 
           side.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JOHNNY’S eyes are bloodshot and puffy - almost completely 
           shut with the salt in them. He is still - feebly now - 
           paddling with his hands, but he’s not really sure where he’s 
           headed for. He stops for a little rest, lays his head back in 
           the water. He can hear a rhythmic switching through the 
           water, at first finding it a soothing sound. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHEEL HOUSE - DAY

           ANTHONY is at the wheel, carefully watching his course, at 
           the same time searching the water.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           JOHNNY’S eyes are still shut. That swishing sound is getting 
           closer... but it’s not until the last moment that he regains 
           consciousness, opens his eyes, and see the ‘Anna Mary’ barely 
           five hundred yards away, steaming right past him. He is so 
           stunned he doesn’t say anything for a few moments, then:

                                 JOHNNY
                        Anthony! Hey Anthony - I’m over 
                        here!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA MARY - DAY

           At this precise moment ANTHONY has decided to leave the wheel 
           house and climb up on the roof. 
           We can see, to his left, JOHNNY - with his two buoys either 
           side - waving and shouting. But the sound of the wind and the 
           engine drowns him out. By the time ANTHONY gets on deck - 
           ironically for a better view - JOHNNY is behind him. He has a 
           good look round, but he misses him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           JOHNNY still waves and shouts in the water:

                                 JOHNNY
                        Anthony! Anthony!

           But the boat keeps on going, without slowing.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        Anthony you fuckin’ numb nuts...

           This agonising near-miss hits harder than anything. JOHNNY 
           feels all the hope sucked out of him. That Anthony came so 
           close and still missed him is so hard to swallow. Tears fall 
           down JOHNNY’S cheeks: 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        How the fuck did you find me? I 
                        mean, that’s...

           His mind fixes on something. And we see:

           The envelope is pinned on the notice board, with the Laguna

           JOHNNY worries that ANTHONY won’t realise the significance. 
           Just one more little spur to stay awake, to stay alive - so 
           he can tell him about it. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        She’s in Laguna Beach Anthony, 
                        that’s where she is...

           But he’s so tired... He kicks hard with his feet, carries on 
           trying to swim. And then something makes him look down, at 
           the dark depths below. He is dehydrated and hallucinating, 
           not sure what he's seeing. A large, dark shadow underneath? 
           It passes. Then another. He realises this is real, looks up 
           and sees two fins break the surface only a dozen yards away. 
           The sharks have returned, attracted by his erratic movements. 

           He reaches again for his knife and holds it in readiness, 
           pulling his legs up under him so they don't dangle. One of 
           the sharks swims by not three feet away, the pressure from it 
           bobbing him up slightly out of the water. 

           He lashes out with the blade - but he sees how small the 
           blade is, and how large the sharks are. He laughs at how puny 
           it is, and puts it away. Another fin breaks the surface - 
           that's three now. This is it. No chance. 

           He waits for the first strike, strangely calm. He lays his 
           head back, lowers his legs, shuts his eyes, resigned. Then, a 
           smile comes over his face, and... he starts to sing through 
           swollen and cracked lips. Why not? 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                             (Singing softly)

                        Rockabye, rockabye 
                        Rockabye...

           It's Anthony's favourite song and he's always secretly loved 
           it too. He opens his eyes and looks at the blue sky - the 
           sharks can go fuck themselves. He ain't got no time for them. 
           He sings some more.

           roar overhead and he sees a Coast Guard helicopter flying 
           over him, just a hundred feet or so above the sea. He roars 
           with relief:

           JOHNNY has stopped singing. He opens his eyes, looks around. 
           He’s still alive. He sees the sharks - still circling, but 
           not coming in close.

           He seems confused. What are they doing? 

           (In fact what has happened is he has relaxed; his heart rate 
           has come down and, no longer sensing thrashing panic, the 
           sharks seem confused, and leave him alone). 

           He looks at his feet, dangling, still, in the water, and 
           decides to keep them like that.

           The crew have been searching for six hours straight. They are 
           tired, and they have become mesmerized by looking at the 
           bobbing surface to the point where they have almost lost all 
           sense of perspective and depth. A million dark shadows and 
           shapes - could that be him? Could that? And then JAMROS 
           thinks he sees something. He looks again, attracted to the 
           colours of the buoys.

                        Hey... I think that might be 
                        something. I got a mark.

           DEAL makes an aggressive turn back towards JOHNNY, no time 
           for a gentle turn, fuel is critically low. Now they can see 
           him waving, feebly - there is no doubt that he is alive. They 
           can also see the three sharks, circling close by him. HOVEY, 
           the swimmer, unstraps himself from his seat and grabs for his 
           wet suit. HILL shouts to him:

                        No time - we’re too low on fuel.

           HOVEY quickly just kicks off his boots and pulls on his mask 
           and flippers. HILL takes a rifle from the side of the craft 
           and stands at the open bay door, taking aim at the sharks to 
           keep them away if necessary. HOVEY - still in his flight 
           overall - jumps in the water.

           JOHNNY laughs - after so long in the water, salvation so 
           close at hand seems surreal. He sees HOVEY grab the rescue 
           cradle dropped in after him and swim towards him with it. He 
           sees the shark fins, still close by, attracted by the new 
           activity in the water. HOVEY reaches him:

           Two shots from above fizz into the water - warning shots to 
           keep the sharks away. HOVEY starts to help him into the 
           rescue basket.

                        Laguna Beach... I gotta tell him 
                        about Laguna Beach...

           HOVEY assumes he’s delirious - but then JOHNNY, seeing his 
           precious rubber boots floating away - suddenly plunges back 
           in the water and swims after one of them. 

                                 HOVEY
                        Hey there’s sharks - we gotta go!

                                 JOHNNY
                        These boots saved my life!

           Left with no alternative, HOVEY swims for the other one.

           JOHNNY grabs one boot, HOVEY the other, and they both get 
           back to the basket. JOHNNY climbs in and HOVEY puts the boots 
           on top of him. He then clings to the side of the basket and 
           they are both winched up.

                        Is it Johnny? Is he alive?

           A few moments, then DEAL’S voice comes over the radio:

                        He’s tired and cold, but he’s 
                        alive.

           ANTHONY lets out a long, shrieking howl.

                                 ANTHONY

           And that’s all he can manage before dropping to his knees in 
           tears as he watches the helicopter fly back to shore.

           has blisters on his forehead and his eyes and mouth are puffy 
           and swollen - but otherwise seems okay. He sips some special 
           protein drink through a straw. He sees JANICE, CATHY, his MUM 
           and DAD enter the ward looking for him. He waves weakly, then 
           they spot him and rush up to him. He’s pleased to see them, 
           but he hates any kind of fuss. ADDY gets there first and 
           smothers him in kisses.

                                 JOHN SNR.

                        him!

           CATHY gives him a hug.

                        We were with the Coast Guard - they 
                        were so great Johnny.

           Finally, there’s JANICE. He looks at her. Smiles.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Hey.

                        but... I guess I’m still here.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        They said on the TV that Anthony 
                        was fantastic - he helped them find 
                        you Johnny.

                        Johnny didn’t he’d never be able to 
                        show his face in Montauk again.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        I’m just sayin’ what they said.

                        I feel like I could walk out of 
                        here right now, but they say they 
                        want to keep me in overnight for 
                        observation.

           ADDY pulls a plastic container from her bag.

                                 ADDY
                        You hungry? I brought some 
                        blueberry muffins. I thought they’d 
                        be good if you’ve just been for a 
                        long swim.

                                 JOHN SNR.
                        It wasn’t a swim - he was fightin’ 
                        for his life!

                                 ADDY
                        You know what I mean.

                                 JOHNNY

                        I’ll have one later.

           He subtly rolls his eyes at JANICE, she stifles a smile. ADDY 
           puts the container down, gives JOHNNY another kiss.

                                 ADDY
                        I could just eat you all up.

           It’s nearly ten o’clock as ANTHONY gently steers the ‘Anna 
           Mary’ into her berth and turns the engine off - but there are 
           dozens of people lining the quay, cheering and clapping him. 
           Other boats sound off their ship’s horns in salute. As 
           ANTHONY steps onto shore they crowd round, slapping him on 
           the back, shaking his hand. 
           Further along the quay RICK has also docked the ‘Islamorada’. 
           As he steps ashore he runs into TOM HORN and his four well-
           dressed FRIENDS, all making their way round from the 
           expensive half of the harbour to join the celebrations. 
           There’s a brief moment as they face each other, then RICK 
           offers his hand and he and TOM shake. 

           ANTHONY makes his way through the throng until he stops in 
           front of GEORGE, who is waiting for him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Anthony I prayed so hard. I prayed 
                        so hard that it was you fell in and 
                        I wouldn’t have to do this.

           They look at each other for a few moments, then he takes 
           ANTHONY’S head in his hands and kisses him on the mouth. He 
           pulls back, wiping his mouth with his hand and pretending to 
           spit in disgust.

                                 ANTHONY
                        George, I actually liked it.

           He makes a grab for GEORGE and to laughter plants a smacker 
           on his lips in return - GEORGE trying to pull away.

                        We move in together, and we’re a

           He looks at her.

                        I think you’d make a great dad. 

           They kiss.

           An open-air party on the quay is in full swing - barbecues 
           have been set up, music is playing and the drink is flowing. 
           But even though the party is in his honour - and even though 
           he is the ultimate party animal - ANTHONY is in the process 
           of trying to slip away. He’s with DONNIE, PAULIE and a whole 
           load of GIRLS.

                                 GIRL
                        Oh come on Anthony - we haven’t 
                        seen you ride your unicycle yet. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        Maybe tomorrow - I’m sorry.

                                 PAULIE
                        Anthony, are you really gonna leave 
                        us here with all these beautiful 
                        girls?

                                 ANTHONY
                        I gotta go.

           He gets in his battered jeep and drives off. DONNIE, PAULIE 
           and the GIRLS watch him go. At the last moment he opens his 
           door and rolls a hula hoop back to them as he drives off.

           INT. HOSPITAL WARD - NIGHT

           ANTHONY - still in his shorts and t-shirt, enters the ward - 
           which is now mostly quiet with everybody asleep. He sees, at 
           the end of the ward, JANICE cuddled up to JOHNNY on his bed - 
           though they don’t see him. He thinks about things for a 
           moment, then quietly turns and leaves without letting them 
           know he was there.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Next morning. JOHNNY poses for photos with JANICE. CATHY, 
           JOHN SNR and ADDY watch from the side. JOHNNY holds up his 
           rubber boots to frenzied flashes and shutter clicks. JOHN 
           Snr. calls over:
                                 JOHN SNR.
                        Don’t tell them the brand ‘til we 
                        get an endorsement deal!

           Laughter. OUT on JOHNNY and JANICE holding hands. A couple.

           Two days later

           JOHNNY drives alone past the harbour, a place so familiar to 
           him and yet somehow different today. He sees the fishing 
           vessels and the motor cruisers - both halves of Montauk, both 
           of which helped to find him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JOHNNY’S TRUCK, HIGH STREET MONTAUK - DAY

           JOHNNY drives along Montauk High Street, smiling as he passes 
           the eclectic mixture of shops. He stops at some lights and 
           sees NED in the truck next to him. They both wind down their 
           windows.

                                 NED
                        Thought you were gone there Johnny. 
                        Once they go in, they never pull 
                        ‘em out alive.

                                 JOHNNY
                        They do sometimes Ned.

           The lights change, he pulls away.

           JOHNNY speeds along the Montauk Highway, thoughtful again as 
           he passes those telegraph poles leaning at crazy angles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           He goes past the millionaires’ houses, with their beautiful 
           green lawns.

           EXT. ANTHONY’S HOUSE - DAY

           JOHNNY pulls up in his truck outside Anthony’s house, the 
           front yard is, as usual, full of junk. He picks his way 
           through to the front door and knocks. Nothing. He knocks 
           again. He steps back - is there anybody in? Finally, the door 
           opens and there is ANTHONY, just wearing briefs. They stare 
           at each other.  

                                 ANTHONY
                        Where the fuck have you been? Did 
                        you get lost again?

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Smiles)
                        Fuck you.

           EXT. ANTHONY’S GARDEN - DAY

           ANTHONY and JOHNNY sit in the little secret patch in his 
           garden where he grows cannabis. They are surrounded by high 
           plants on all side as they puff on a joint, passing it back 
           and forth to each other.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I fucked up. I know that. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        It wasn’t your fault I fell in.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I been behavin’ like a douche bag 
                        the last coupla months, I’m sorry 
                        Johnny.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Months? Try years.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I thought I’d lost you.

           A few moment’s silence.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Did you find the postmark?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Laguna Beach, yeh. I discovered one 
                        of Liz’s aunts lives there. I got a 
                        lawyer involved already. I’m goin’ 
                        for access rights, the whole deal.
                             (Smiles)
                        She couldn’t believe I found her.
                                 JOHNNY
                        I couldn’t believe you found me.

           ANTHONY looks at him.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        You know you went past me in the 
                        water? You were no more than a 
                        coupla hundred yards away.

                                 ANTHONY
                        No way!

                                 JOHNNY
                        I shouted like fuck but you didn’t 
                        see me - I mean that was no 
                        surprise.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Fuck!

                                 JOHNNY
                        How did you do that?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (Beat, looks at him)
                        I just thought about you Johnny. 
                        About how you’d have handled it.

           JOHNNY smiles, shakes his head.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You know, I was hangin’ on to this 
                        buoy out there - and I was thinkin’ 
                        ‘come on, I’m here - come and find 
                        me’. But nobody did. And I realised 
                        you weren’t gonna find me there. 
                        And then I thought about you. 
                        And... I cut myself free and just 
                        drifted with the current. Felt 
                        fuckin’ great actually, lettin’ go 
                        like that.
                             (Beat)
                        Rock-a-bye...

           Emotion passes between them, but they don’t like overt 
           displays of affection. JOHNNY punctures the moment:

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        So who d’you bang when you got 
                        back? I mean, c’mon, you were the 
                        hero.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Come on, do you think I could do 
                        something like that after thinking 
                        you were dead? After going through 
                        all those emotions?
           JOHNNY looks at him.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        A nurse, at the hospital.

                                 JOHNNY
                        You came to the hospital?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeh. 
                             (Beat)
                        You were with Janice, and you were 
                        lookin’ kinda cosy together. I 
                        didn’t want to interrupt... And 
                        this nurse was very sympathetic, 
                        and...
                             (Beat)
                        So how’s Janice?

                                 JOHNNY
                             (Uncomfortable)
                        Yeh... that’s the thing I wanted to 
                        tell you.

           ANTHONY looks at him, knows what’s coming.

                                 ANTHONY
                        It’s okay Johnny, I understand. I 
                        really do. You got a relationship 
                        with her, and that’s important. And 
                        that’s a serious false nail habit 
                        you gotta fund. 

                                 JOHNNY
                        I finished with her.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What?

                                 JOHNNY
                        She’s a nice woman, a really nice 
                        woman. But the only thing we had in 
                        common was... you know... bangin’.

                                 ANTHONY
                        That’s a terrific thing to have in 
                        common, by the way.

                                 JOHNNY
                        I didn’t love her Anthony. And when 
                        you’re with someone and you don’t 
                        love them, you’re just... wastin’ 
                        their time.

           He looks at JOHNNY for a few moments, stunned.

           Six weeks later

           ADDY holds Anthony’s two daughters, EMMA, 8 and MELANIE, 12, 
           by the hand as they approach the ‘Anna Mary’. JOHNNY and 
           ANTHONY are on deck salting bait, stacking pots, preparing to 
           sail. But as ANTHONY spots them and waves - ADDY quickly 
           covers their eyes:  

                                 ADDY
                        Don’t look girls!

           On top of the wheel-house roof are two inflatable sex dolls, 
           one with a shaggy blonde mop of hair (Anthony); the other 
           with dark hair and a goatee beard inked in with a marker pen 
           (Johnny). Needless to say ‘Johnny’ is shagging ‘Anthony’ from 
           behind. ANTHONY realises what has caused the fuss.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Addy don’t worry, that’s just 
                        George messing with me.

                                 ADDY
                        It’s disgusting.

                                 JOHNNY
                        He deserved it. Look what he did to 
                        George.

           He nods to ‘The Dock’; the front of it has been festooned 
           with ladies’ bras. ADDY covers their eyes again: 

                                 ADDY
                        Don’t look there either girls!

                                 ANTHONY
                        Had a lot of fun collecting them 
                        last night.
           ANTHONY comes up to the bow, next to the quay, and reaches 
           out for a cuddle with his GIRLS.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Come and give me a hug, I’ll see 
                        you tomorrow night. And you be good 
                        for Auntie Addy.

           He kisses each girl. JOHNNY unties the mooring rope.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks Addy.

                                 JOHNNY
                        Bye ma. 

           As the ‘Anna Mary’ edges out of harbour the GIRLS and ADDY 
           stand on the quay, waving. 

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        How long you got ‘em for?

                                 ANTHONY
                        This week and next. And then every 
                        other weekend.

                                 JOHNNY
                        That’s good. 

           He looks at the girls. Smiles.

                                 JOHNNY (CONT’D)
                        That’s good.

           The ‘Anna Mary’ heads out to sea, the two inflatable dolls in 
           their grotesque embrace flapping in the breeze.

                                 ANTHONY (V.O.)
                        Let’s go catch some lobster, I 
                        gotta lawyer’s bills to pay...

           EXT. JOHNNY’S APPARTMENT - DAY

           DEADWEIGHT sits in his canvas chair, looking at the sea, 
           watching the ‘Anna Mary’ head off into the sunset, bright 
           blue eyes sunk deep into his crinkled, leathery face. He 
           smiles, then puts a half bottle of whisky up to his lips and 
           takes a drink. A contented sigh, then he wipes his mouth with 
           the back of his hand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           distance.
