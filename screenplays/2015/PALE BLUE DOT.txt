           AN SUV RACES UP TO--

           EXT. LOUISIANA GAS STATION - 2007 - EVENING

           -- SPRAYING GRAVEL EVERYWHERE. The driver’s side door FLIES 
           OPEN before the engine’s even cut off--

           -- BANG!--

           -- the SUV is too close and the door slams into the pump.

           It doesn’t matter. There’s no stopping this driver, a woman 
           in her late thirties, as she wiggles her way out of the car--

           -- DING DING DING--

           -- leaving the keys in the ignition. This is LAURA PEPPER and 
           she does not have a second to spare.

           Laura runs to the pump, hurrying the nozzle into the tank, 
           leaping over the hose to insert her credit card.

           She is athletic and pretty in a no-nonsense way but, right 
           now, she’s also an agitated, disheveled mess--

           -- ratatat-tat--

           -- impatiently tapping her fingernails on the roof of her 
           car. She checks her watch, looks over her shoulder to catch 
           the sun disappearing from the horizon.

           The SUV has Texas plates. Wherever Laura’s going, she’s in an 
           awful hurry to get there.

           Unbeknownst to Laura, there’s a SMALL BOY, sitting on the 
           curb in front of the gas station, playing with a toy UFO. Or, 
           at least, he was playing with the toy before he got 
           completely distracted watching...

           ...Laura frantically pulls the gas pump from the SUV, without 
           even letting the tank fill--

           -- splattering an unnoticed bit of gasoline as--

           -- she replaces the gas pump and reaches up under her dress 
           to--

           -- PULL OFF A SOILED ADULT DIAPER.

           Laura tosses the diaper into the trash, hops back in the SUV 
           and tears out of the gas station, leaving the stunned boy 
           behind.
           INT. LAURA’S SUV - LATER

           Laura smokes a cigarette and tears down the highway. She’s 
           staring off into the distance, her gaze fixed on a distant 
           point in the horizon-- an old Navy trick for staying awake.

           Without looking away from the road, she tries the radio. She 
           finds nothing but static.

           Laura reaches over to open the glove box. She grabs a CD 
           case. She pops the case open, shoves the mix CD in the player 
           and--

           -- “You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette kicks in. 

           Laura cranks the volume up and, as she does, we pan over to 
           the still-open glove box--

           -- to find a loaded hand gun.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Laura’s SUV hurtles down the highway, going almost double the 
           speed limit. She flies past a sign:

           WELCOME TO FLORIDA -- THE SUNSHINE STATE

           TITLE CARD: PALE BLUE DOT

           EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

           Now wrapped in a giant TRENCH COAT, and wearing a bizarre, 
           dark WIG, Laura enters the arrivals terminal of Orlando 
           International Airport.

           INT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           Laura walks purposefully through the mostly-empty airport. 
           She pulls at the belt of her trench coat, tightening it as if 
           it were a suit of armor.

           Nearby, an AIRPORT JANITOR vacuums the loudly patterned 
           carpet. Laura walks up and taps the man on the shoulder--

           -- startling him half to death. After collecting himself, the 
           Janitor pulls an earbud from his ear.

                                 LAURA
                        Baggage from the Houston flight?
                                 AIRPORT JANITOR
                        Uh, I’m not sure. Over there maybe?

           The Janitor points to the other side of the terminal where a 
           crowd waits beside a luggage carousel.

                                 LAURA
                        Thanks.

           Laura heads for the carousel. The Janitor watches her go for 
           a moment, an eyebrow cocked at her bizarre getup. But, 
           eventually, he shrugs and goes back to his vacuuming.

           This is Florida, after all. He’s seen worse.

           INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - MOMENTS LATER

           A woman waits beside the baggage carousel, stretching. This 
           is ERIN FLEETWOOD. 

           She is a few years younger than Laura but very much the same 
           type-- blonde, fit, pretty. Though, even after a red eye 
           flight, Erin is far more rested and put together than Laura 
           right now--

           -- which, is readily apparent as Laura peeks from behind a 
           nearby column--

           -- spotting Erin. Laura’s obviously watching her, spying 
           even. She’s breathing heavily and her hands are shoved deep 
           into the pockets of her trench coat.

           Erin senses something, someone, and turns her head just as--

           -- Laura jumps back behind the pillar. It’s a close call but 
           then--

           -- BEEP BEEP BEEP--

           -- an alarm goes off, signaling the arrival of the flight’s 
           luggage. 

           With a heavy lurch, the conveyer belt starts up. Erin spots 
           her bag quickly-- a bright red suitcase-- grabs it and starts 
           for the exit.

           Keeping her head down, Laura steps out from behind the column 
           and walks after Erin. As she does, she reaches in a trash can 
           and pulls out an old newspaper.
           EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           Laura’s pretending to read the newspaper as she follows Erin. 
           They make their way past a line of taxis and shuttles. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Erin walks up a set of stairs. Aware of footsteps coming up 
           behind her, she stops.

           The footsteps stop, too.

           Erin waits for a suspicious second but there’s no sign of 
           anyone else in the garage or stairway.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - GARAGE

           Erin wheels her suitcase along the darkened parking garage, 
           hurrying a bit now. As she does, she looks over her shoulder 
           to find--

           -- Laura following her. She’s twenty feet back, looking 
           downward, her wig pulled low to cover her face--

           -- Erin takes off at a full sprint, her bag bumping and 
           rolling behind her.

           Laura doesn’t run. She takes her time.

           As she walks, Laura reaches in the pocket of her trench coat 
           and removes a pair of bright yellow DISH WASHING GLOVES. She 
           pulls them on as she continues to stalk Erin.

           Erin makes it to her car, fumbling with her keys-- 

           -- WHICH SHE DROPS--

                                 ERIN
                        Shit! Shit! Shit!

           -- Erin scrambles to the ground, reaching for her keys. She 
           grabs them, unlocks the car--

           -- haphazardly tosses her suitcase inside--

           -- before diving in herself--

           -- and slamming the door shut and locked. 

           Erin looks out the window but there is no sign of Laura. 
           She’s gone. Vanished.
           Erin takes a long, deep breath, collecting herself. She puts 
           the keys in the ignition and turns the engine--

           -- BAM BAM BAM--

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHHH!

           -- a HAND REPEATEDLY SLAPS THE WINDOW. It’s Laura and she’s 
           screaming:

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry! I’m so sorry! I need 
                        help!

           Erin stops, her eyes squinting in recognition...

                                 ERIN
                        Laura?--

           -- at the sound of her name, LAURA STARTS CRYING. It’s ugly 
           stuff-- big tears, heaving, the works.

           Concerned, Erin rolls down her window. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here? Are you 
                        okay?

                                 LAURA
                        You have to stop.

                                 ERIN
                        What--

           -- LAURA BLASTS ERIN IN THE FACE WITH A CAN OF MACE!

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        You bitch!

           ERIN SLAMS ON THE GAS--

           -- CRUNCHHH--

           -- her car lurches forward, directly into the bumper of the 
           car parked opposite--

           -- Laura stands there, the can of mace in her gloved hand, 
           stunned at what she’s done--

           -- Erin blindly grabs at the gearshift, throwing her car into 
           reverse and slamming on the gas all over again--

           -- Laura drops the mace--
           -- CRUNCHHH--

           -- Erin crashes into more cars, making her getaway--

           -- BEEP BEEP BEEP--

           -- setting off a car alarm. She shifts back into drive and 
           takes off--

           -- SCREEEETCH--

           -- the side of the car scraping along the concrete wall as 
           Erin drives like a (blind) bat out of hell.

           Laura’s still crying, standing in the same spot, in a trance 
           until, finally--

           -- she runs.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura takes the stairs two at a time. She’s wild-eyed and 
           moving as fast as she can. 

           She pulls at the dish washing gloves, trying to get them off. 
           She tosses one in a trash can, drops the other, and keeps 
           running. 

           But, Laura isn’t going down the stairs. She’s going up. She’s 
           not trying to make her escape, she’s trying to get to--

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Laura bursts out onto the roof. She has nowhere else to go.

           Above her, it is a cloudless Orlando morning with stars 
           spread out as far as the eye can see. 

           It’s our first real look at the night’s sky. The expanse of 
           stars is breath-taking.

           In the distance the screech of police sirens grows louder. 
           But Laura no longer seems concerned. Instead, she looks up at 
           the stars and, for the first time we’ve seen, she smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A 2-POUND DRILLING HAMMER--

           -- FLASH--
           INT. ORLANDO POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

           -- the hammer sits on a metal table, where a beefy man, 
           DETECTIVE JORGE LOPEZ, takes a series of pictures, 
           documenting evidence.

           Lopez replaces the hammer with Laura’s wig. He snaps a new 
           picture. He repeats the process with a long list of items--

           -- the dish washing gloves--

           -- FLASH--

           -- a Venom action figure--

           -- FLASH--

           -- $585 in cash--

           -- FLASH--

           -- plastic garbage bags, rubber tubing, rope of varying 
           lengths, the mace, a potted African violet, another pair of 
           gloves--

           -- FLASH--

           -- an 8-inch Gerber folding knife. Another detective enters, 
           DETECTIVE CASH CAIN. She picks up the knife, whistling in 
           amazement.

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        She just wanted to talk, huh?

                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ
                        Oh, that’s not even the best part.

           Detective Lopez takes the knife and hands Detective Cain a 
           large, open package of ADULT DIAPERS.

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        No.

                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        She was wearing one of these?

           INT. ORLANDO POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Laura is turned to the left, posing for a series of mug 
           shots.
                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ (O.S.)
                        Said every second counted. No time 
                        for bathroom breaks.

           Laura turns towards the camera, brow furrowed in 
           embarrassment. She looks terrible. 

           Laura’s hair is a stringy mess, tear-smeared make-up streaks 
           her cheeks but, even that, can’t cover the dark, tired 
           circles under her eyes--

           -- FLASH--

           This is the picture everyone will remember.

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN (O.S.)
                        Who the hell is this lady?

                                                                CUT TO:

           TITLE CARD: 12 MONTHS EARLIER

           EXT. OUTER SPACE - DAY

           Silence.

           Darkness.

           And then--

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                        Ah ha!

           Laura, attached to the Canadarm of the Space Shuttle 
           Discovery, is maneuvered into place over a communications 
           satellite. 

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        There you are.

           Below her is the enveloping brightness of planet Earth, a 
           swirling mass of blue and white and green anLauraown.

           Laura latches onto the satellite as a replacement solar panel 
           is lifted up to her.

           A voice crackles into her headset, payload specialist ARIK 
           AVRHAHAM, 43.

                                 ARIK
                        Be careful there. Those solar 
                        panels aren’t cheap.
                                 LAURA
                        You just keep the arm working. I’ll 
                        worry about the panel.

                                 ARIK
                        Yes ma’am.

           Laura inspects the panel. She frowns. 

                                 LAURA
                        This one’s gonna take a while.

           She sets to work, but she can’t help but look down--

                                 ARIK
                        Some view, huh?

                                 LAURA
                        It sure is.

           Laura floats on, two hundred miles above a thunderstorm 
           covering a third of South America. 

           She watches as miles-long arcs of lightning jump from cloud 
           to cloud below her.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I could stay here forever.

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - “EVENING”

           Laura and other crew members are strapped into special 
           sleeping bags attached to the shuttle walls. In the micro-
           gravity of low Earth orbit, the unconscious astronauts seem 
           frozen-- arms slightly bent, unmoving hair standing on end.

           A voice crackles through one of the cabin speakers:

                                 MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Good morning, Discovery! And a 
                        special good morning to you, Laura. 
                        Here’s a little something to get 
                        your day started from Drew and the 
                        kids. 

           After a brief hiccup, a tinny-sounding recording of the song 
           “All Star” by Smash Mouth infects the speakers. (Since the 
           Gemini program, NASA’s been sending musical wake-up calls to 
           astronauts at the start of each new mission day.)

           The song does its work, spreading throughout the Discovery 
           cabin and waking up the crew. 
           Among them is CHITHRA GILL, a sardonic biochemist in her late 
           thirties and decidedly NOT a morning person. 

           Picking the sleep-gunk from her eyes, Chithra manages to yawn 
           her displeasure at Laura:

                                 CHITHRA
                        I’m pretty sure I came up here to 
                        get away from this song.

                                 LAURA
                        Be nice. My kids picked it.

                                 CHITHRA
                        Well, your kids have shitty taste 
                        in music.

           Laura flashes a smile at Chithra. 

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, I dunno. I think it’s pretty 
                        good.

           Laura floats over to the nearest shuttle intercom, depressing 
           the button that connects to Mission Control.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for the wake up call, 
                        Houston. I love this song. Don’t 
                        you?

           She shoots a wink toward Chithra, who promptly responds with 
           a thorough eye-roll.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        We think it’s great. Have a good 
                        day up there, guys.

           Laura switches off the communicator and tries out some micro-
           gravity dance moves. It’s the space equivalent of mom-
           dancing, but her enthusiasm is infectious.

           Pretty soon the whole crew-- even Chithra-- is dancing.

           The music continues to play as we see--

           INT. DISCOVERY CABIN - “DAY”

           Laura floats over to Discovery’s computer terminal. She logs 
           into NASA’s email client and starts typing:
                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        Dear Drew, I hope this email finds 
                        you well...

           INT. DISCOVERY CABIN - LATER

           Laura sits for a live interview with GRETCHEN CARLSON of FOX 
           NEWS. GARY SHALIMAR, the burly, gregarious Mission Commander 
           floats next to her, trying out zero-g backflips.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        That’s still weird, isn’t it? An 
                        email from outer space. We’re doing 
                        our best to make it feel like 
                        home...

                                 GRETCHEN CARLSON
                        So Laura, I’ve gotta ask you the 
                        big question: How do you wash your 
                        hair up there?

           Commander Shalimar CRACKS UP.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, it’s not pretty. But we’ve 
                        found a way--

           Laura produces a packet of NASA-issue shampoo and a box of 
           baby wipes.

           Carefully she demonstrates how, using the two, she can “wash 
           her hair”

           The cast of Fox and Friends can’t stop laughing.

                                 GRETCHEN CARLSON
                        And to think people say that 
                        nothing good comes from the space 
                        program.

                                 GARY
                        Hey now--

           INT. DISCOVERY CREW CABIN - LATER

           The crew is busy eating their freeze-dried dinner. There’s a 
           lot of goofing off-- tossing food in the air, doing 
           somersaults, playing catch.
                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        The food is better than you’d 
                        imagine. At least if you don’t 
                        think too hard.

           EXT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - “NIGHT”

           Laura puts the finishing touches on the solar panel she’s 
           repairing. 

           It’s dark now, the sun hidden on the other side of the Earth.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        But believe me when I say it’s all 
                        worth it.

           Below her, the bright NEON LIGHTS of the Shanghai night GLOW 
           and PULSE, reflecting off her visor.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        You see all the pictures and you 
                        think you understand. Like, you’ll 
                        get up here and be prepared for it, 
                        but there’s no way. 

           A BRIGHT FLASH suddenly illuminates everything around Laura. 
           The sun, arcing around the curvature of the earth. 

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        There’s no preparing for this. It’s 
                        majestic. It’s frightening, too. It 
                        makes you feel so small.

           Two hundred and fifty miles below her, the Pacific ocean 
           churns and froths.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        Give the kids my love. Tell them 
                        I’m keeping an eye on them, even 
                        from up here. I miss you every day 
                        and can’t wait to see you. I know 
                        this is hard on everyone but I hope 
                        you understand this is something I 
                        had to do. I hope I’ve made you 
                        proud.

           Laura floats for a moment, done with her work but enjoying 
           the view.
                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        And don’t forget to water the 
                        violets.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BOOM BOOM.

           The distinct double-thunderclap of the sonic boom that 
           accompanies every Space Shuttle as it re-enters earth’s 
           atmosphere, racing through the sky at six thousand miles per 
           hour.

           BOOM BOOM.

           The loud rumble of the Discovery crew out-running sound 
           itself can be heard all across the Gulf Coast. 

           Little League Games. Shopping Mall Parking Lots. Car-choked 
           highways. Everyone stops and looks up the moment they hear 
           Laura shatter the sound barrier.

           Forty miles above the ground, the belly of Discovery glows a 
           BRIGHT LAVA-ORANGE. The sheer force of entering the 
           atmosphere transforming oxygen gas into unimaginably hot 
           PLASMA.

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - CONTINUOUS

           If the outside of the shuttle is hell itself, the interior is 
           a study in serenity.

           Commander Shalimar, steady hands at the controls, eases the 
           orbiter into its decent to the Eastern coast of Florida.

           Laura, focused, attentive, monitors the onboard safety 
           systems. The noise is deafening, but the crew presses on.

           EXT. NASA RUNWAY 33 - CONTINUOUS

           A crowd of NASA employees and families are gathered at the 
           edge of Runway 33 near a large stage strung up with balloons.

           FRANK PAXTON, a pushing-sixty NASA official with a crew cut, 
           checks his watch.

           Off in the distance, a small black-and-white speck appears.

           Discovery.
           It grows in size, making its way toward Cape Kennedy, 
           touching down like clockwork on Runway 33.

           PARACHUTES rocket from the rear of the orbiter. 

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - CONTINUOUS

           Discovery finally rolls to a stop.

           The crew breathes. 

           They are alive.

                                 GARY
                        All right, everyone. Remember where 
                        we parked.

           EXT. NASA RUNWAY 33 - MOMENTS LATER

           The outer hatch of Discovery opens to the roar of the crowd.

           At Paxton’s cue, an aide fires up the sound system, Tommy 
           James and the Shondell’s “I’m Comin’ Home” blasting on the 
           speakers.

           Gary steps out to WILD CHEERS. He’s followed by the rest of 
           the crew and, finally, Laura.

           They’re hobbling under Earth’s gravity-- the weight of the 
           world literally on their shoulders-- as NASA employees help 
           each of them to the stage. Gary grabs a microphone:

                                 GARY
                        Thank you, Cape Canaveral!

           Thunderous applause. The crew can’t help but smile.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Look, folks. This was a flawless 
                        mission, executed perfectly. I’ve 
                        flown four times and this shuttle 
                        was in the best shape of any 
                        shuttle I’ve ever flown in. We did 
                        it. We’ll do it again. And God 
                        dammit, we’re gonna be doing it for 
                        a hell of a long time.

           Again, the crowd goes nuts.

           Laura, looking particularly uneasy dealing with the gravity, 
           squints into the sun.
                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I think we made the Columbia crew 
                        proud.

           Gary pauses. It was hard to say but it was on everyone’s 
           mind.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to go see our families 
                        now. Have a good day. Thanks.

           Laura gingerly makes her way off the stage.

           Just off the runway, her family awaits. 

           There’s her husband DREW, mild-mannered and sweet (if a 
           little nervous). Beside him their twelve-year-old daughter 
           RUTH stands a few paces away, trying to look disaffected. 
           Finally, Laura’s twin six-year-old boys, NEIL and ED, each 
           holding a foil “Welcome Home” balloon.

           Laura hesitates a moment. She’s not quite ready for this, not 
           quite ready to admit her time in space is over until--

           -- the boys spot her--

                                 NEIL AND ED
                        MOM!

           -- and come running.

           They’re all running for her, now, arms outstretched. Neil and 
           Ed have let go of their balloons. Even Ruth is tearing up. 
           The boys hit their mother at full speed--

                                 LAURA
                        -- Oof.

           Drew puts his arm around Laura. She leans into him. Smiling. 
           Crying. Breathing him in.

                                 DREW
                        I missed you so much.

           He gives her a big hug that knocks her off balance--

                                 LAURA
                        Careful. I might break.

           Above them, the balloons float towards the clouds.
           INT. FRANK PAXTON’S OFFICE - LATER

           Laura sits patiently across Paxton’s desk as he thumbs 
           through the flight report for Mission STS-121.

           Paxton is warm and paternal, but he’s also no-nonsense. He’s 
           been with NASA for years, and the walls of his office can 
           easily double as a museum.

           Photos of Paxton, always with the same haircut, overseeing 
           the construction of ENTERPRISE (the first shuttle prototype), 
           posing with SALLY RIDE, JOHN GLENN, other astronauts from the 
           last twenty years.

           It’s clear the shuttle program is his baby. He’s been a 
           protective father for decades. 

                                 PAXTON
                        How you feeling?

                                 LAURA
                        Well, walking’s a lot more of a 
                        pain in the ass than I remember.

           Paxton flips through a few more pages of the flight report.

                                 PAXTON
                        It’ll get easier. How was it up 
                        there?

                                 LAURA
                        Amazing.

           Paxton looks up from his paper work and smiles. The wonder in 
           Laura’s voice gets to him. For all his work, Paxton’s never 
           been to space. This wonder is as close as he’ll ever get.

                                 PAXTON
                        And the mission?

                                 LAURA
                        Shuttle ran beautifully.

                                 PAXTON
                        Okay.

           Paxton scribbles a few notes in his report.

                                 LAURA
                        The crew was a pleasure to work 
                        with.
                                 PAXTON
                        Did you ever feel like you were in 
                        danger?

                                 LAURA
                        There’s always a risk--

                                 PAXTON
                        You know what I mean.

                                 LAURA
                        No. I never felt like I was in 
                        danger.

           Paxton sets the file down. He leans in, adopting a grave tone 
           just to make it clear he’s serious:

                                 PAXTON
                        There are a lot of people out there 
                        who believe the shuttle program 
                        should just wind things down. Go 
                        quietly into that good night.

                                 LAURA
                        That would be a mistake, sir.

                                 PAXTON
                        Nobody gives a shit anymore. It’s 
                        not like when we had the Soviets. 
                        Americans stopped caring a long 
                        time ago. 

                                 LAURA
                        That’s not true. I care.

                                 PAXTON
                        Would you be willing to return to 
                        space?

           Laura resists the urge to blurt what’s on her mind: 
           ABSOLUTELY.

           Instead, she opts for composure:

                                 LAURA
                        I look forward to serving NASA and 
                        my country, any way I can, for a 
                        long time to come.

           Paxton smiles.

                                 PAXTON
                        You’re one of the good ones, 
                        Pepper.
           INT. PAXTON’S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Paxton escorts Laura from his office into a waiting area, 
           where a MAN leans against the wall and thumbs through an old 
           issue of Time Magazine.

                                 PAXTON
                        It’s great to have you back on 
                        Earth.

           The man looks up--

                                 MAN 
                        Ha! That’s not what you said when I 
                        came back.

           The man is MARK GOODWIN, a 45-year-old All-American type.

           Paxton grunts something like a laugh.

                                 PAXTON
                        That should tell you something.
                             (to Laura)
                        Laura have you met Mark Goodwin? 
                        He’s commanding Endeavour in the 
                        Fall.

           Laura turns to Mark.

           Their eyes meet.

           Time stops.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m Laura--

           -- the film skips, stutters and--

           -- BURNS RIGHT OFF THE SCREEN.

                                                               BURN TO:

           NEWSREEL FOOTAGE

           EXT. ALASKA - 1970S

           Black and white footage of a quiet lake. Mountains line the 
           skyline. The sound of an ENGINE SPUTTERING TO LIFE is 
           followed by:
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Born April 29, 1965 in Anchorage, 
                        Alaska, Mark Nathan Goodwin was 
                        born to fly.

           A seaplane takes off from the water’s glassy surface. 

           INT. SEAPLANE - CONTINUOUS

           A teenage Mark, baby-faced but full of confidence, is 
           piloting the plane. He turns to the camera and takes his 
           hands from the yoke, goofing off like a kid riding a bike.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        From an early age, Mark was a 
                        skilled and confident pilot.

           EXT. ALASKA - MOMENTS LATER

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Which, is not to say his early 
                        flight hours were not without 
                        incident.

           -- THE SEA PLANE CRASHES--

           -- it’s a horrible accident, the kind of thing no one could 
           possibly survive, except--

           -- Mark “mother fuckin’” Goodwin--

           -- who, somehow, climbs out of the wreckage, shaking his head 
           and laughing at himself.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Mark walked away.

           As Mark walks away--

           -- KA-BOOM --

           -- the plane EXPLODES behind him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Unharmed.

           EXT. PERSIAN GULF - WAR YEARS

           Standard news reel footage of a plane landing on an aircraft 
           carrier.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Goodwin served in the Gulf War. 
                        Earning a number of medals and a 
                        teaching position at the Navy’s top 
                        flight school.

           Having landed safely, Mark climbs out of the cockpit. He 
           pulls his helmet off and walks across the carrier runway, a 
           total badass.

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Mark, in a short bathing suit, struts around a volley ball 
           court.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Where he excelled both in and out 
                        of the classroom.

           He leaps into the air and SPIKES THE BALL into the camera.

           INT. MARK’S TOP GUN OFFICE - LATER

           An ATTRACTIVE FEMALE CADET enters the office, where Mark sits 
           on his desk with that same confident smile.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He was quite popular amongst his 
                        students.

           The Female Cadet closes the door behind her suggestively...

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - LATER

           Mark somersaults through low-gravity, not a care in the 
           world.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And soon, Goodwin was recruited to 
                        NASA, where he quickly became a 
                        star pilot and the life of the 
                        party.

           INT. PHOTO SHOOT - LATER

           Back on Earth, Mark, decked out in a flight suit with a 
           helmet in hand, poses for his NASA portrait. There’s an 
           American flag over his right shoulder, a model of the shuttle 
           over his left, and that same ever-confident smile on his 
           face.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Mark Goodwin has logged more than 
                        three hundred hours in space and is 
                        set to prove that, for someone this 
                        special, even the sky is not the 
                        limit--

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. FRANK PAXTON’S WAITING ROOM - DAY

           ... where Laura’s offering her hand to Mark. He takes it 
           gracefully, amused by her flustered stammering.

                                 LAURA
                        ...Laura Vine. I mean, uh, Pepper. 
                        Laura Pepper. I’m sorry it’s 
                        just...I...

                                 MARK
                        It’s okay. Coming back is hard.

                                 LAURA
                        Yes it is.

           Mark laughs to himself, recognizing something in her.

                                 MARK
                        Already trying to get back there, 
                        aren’t you?

           There’s no sign of her earlier composure as Laura blurts out:

                                 LAURA
                        As soon as I can.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PEPPER HOUSE - EVENING

           Laura enters the house. It’s cozy and lived-in, as clean as a 
           house with three kids could reasonably be. She’s carrying her 
           own luggage. 

           As soon as she reaches the kitchen, Laura makes a beeline 
           straight for--

           -- a row of African violets on a window sill. The flowers 
           look healthy but she can’t be sure and she sticks her fingers 
           into the soil. It is soft and damp, perfectly maintained.
                                 DREW (O.S.)
                        You didn’t think I’d remember.

           Drew enters behind his wife, smiling.

                                 LAURA
                        I know you didn’t.

           Laura lifts the potted violet, revealing a brand new price 
           tag on the bottom.

                                 DREW
                        Busted.

           Laura playfully hits Drew with the pot. She’s about to give 
           him an earful when--

           -- Ed runs inside with a LIT SPARKLER.

                                 ED
                        Mommy, we’re having 4th of July 
                        again! Since you missed it!

                                 LAURA
                        Give me that.

           Laura snatches the sparkler from her six-year-old. She turns 
           to Drew who gives her two big thumbs up.

                                 DREW
                        4th of July!

                                 ED
                        FREEDOM!

           With that, Ed races from the kitchen. Laura runs the sink and 
           puts the sparkler out with a hiss as--

           -- POP POP POP--

           -- a loud string of firecrackers goes off outside. Drew 
           laughs.

                                 LAURA
                        What about the neighbors, Drew? 
                        It’s a weeknight.

                                 DREW
                        Who cares about the neighbors? My 
                        wife just got back from outer 
                        space. We’re celebrating.

                                                                CUT TO:
           FIREWORKS EXPLODING...

           EXT. PEPPER BACKYARD - LATER

           ...they’re the home-variety but it’s still an impressive 
           display. 

           As Drew runs around like a maniac, lighting mortars and black 
           cats and cherry bombs, the twins look on in awe.

           Laura, for her part, seems to be enjoying the display from a 
           safe distance. Ruth’s a few feet from her, playing a game on 
           her cell phone, ignoring the rest of the family.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey. Come here.

           Ruth answers without looking up from her phone:

                                 RUTH
                        Why?

                                 LAURA
                        Just come here.

           Ruth rolls her eyes and shoves her phone in her pocket. She 
           walks over to her mother. Laura pulls Ruth into her, wrapping 
           her arms around her daughter and resting her chin on the top 
           of Ruth’s head.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        What’d you grow three inches while 
                        I was gone?

                                 RUTH
                        No.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, you’re growing so fast you 
                        could’ve fooled me. 

           The two of them stand there a moment, the constant blast of 
           fireworks almost soothing. There’s a faint hint of a smile on 
           Ruth’s lips but it’d disappear in a second if either of her 
           parents could see.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Anything happen while I was gone?

                                 RUTH
                        Dad killed your violets and got new 
                        ones from Lowe’s.
                                 LAURA
                        You’re not supposed to tell me 
                        that.

                                 RUTH
                        Oops.

                                 LAURA
                        I meant with you. Anything happen 
                        with you? Any changes?

           Ruth finally grasps what her mother is asking...

                                 RUTH
                        Eww. Gross, Mom. Stop.

           ...Ruth pulls away from her mother’s grasp, unwilling to 
           stick around if the topic is her changing body. Laura calls 
           out:

                                 LAURA
                        You know I missed you, right--

                                 NEIL (O.S.)
                        AHHHHHHHH!

           Laura turns towards her screaming sons, who are wrapped up in 
           a tangle of pulled hair and kicked shins. She runs to break 
           up the fight:

                                 LAURA
                        Stop! Stop!

                                 NEIL
                        Asshole!

                                 LAURA
                        Watch your mouth!

           Laura pulls the boys apart. They’re both red with anger, 
           ready to tear each other to pieces.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Guys, what are you doing?

                                 ED
                        Neil tied Venom to a bottle rocket.

           Ed points to Neil’s handiwork, which is, just like he said, a 
           Venom action figure bound with a shoelace to the barrel of a 
           bottle rocket.

                                 LAURA
                        Neil.
           Neil bursts into tears.

                                 NEIL
                        I wanted him to be up there for 
                        you. I wanted you to have something 
                        to remember us.

           Laura looks at the toy super villain tied to the firework and 
           her heart breaks for her children. There really was a price 
           to her going to space. 

           Laura doesn’t have the words, might never have them but--

                                 DREW (O.S.)
                        Don’t worry, boys.

           -- Drew steps up and puts his arm around Laura, pulling her 
           in tight.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Your mom’s back now. And she’s here 
                        to stay.

           We’re the only ones who catch the momentary flicker of panic 
           on Laura’s face at just how permanent those words seem.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LYNDON B. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAWN

           Laura runs on the training facility’s outdoor track. She’s 
           sprinting, drenched in sweat. She’s been at this a while, but 
           she’s still going. She’s pushing herself as hard as she can.

           Behind her looms the giant SATURN V ROCKET.

           Finally, with one last burst of speed and energy, Laura 
           sprints a hundred yards. It’s intense, ugly running-- a 
           person pushed to their limit.

           And when she stops, she doubles over. She’s gasping for 
           breath, the sweat pouring from her face. 

                                 MARK
                        Hey, space girl.

           Mark jogs casually past, making no attempt to hide the fact 
           that he’s staring at her ass. Laura struggles to get out a 
           response between ragged breaths:

                                 LAURA
                        Hey...you.
           Mark continues on his jog, calling back to her:

                                 MARK
                        Keep up the good work!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - BETHESDA, MARYLAND - EVENING

           Laura and Drew enter a darkened old house, carrying luggage.

           The place is hideous, with a very heavy 70s influence on the 
           decorating. Actually, given the thick layer of dust coating 
           everything, it’s possible no one has touched any of this 
           since the 70s.

                                 LAURA
                        Dad?

           There’s no response. Just the muffled sound of a television 
           somewhere deep in the house.

           Laura and Drew continue through the house, passing a wall 
           lined with framed photographs. The pictures tell the story of 
           Laura’s childhood.

           There she is as a chubby eight-year-old with no front teeth. 
           There she is-- thinner, older-- destroying the competition at 
           a track meet. There she is giving a speech as the 
           valedictorian of her high school class.

           There are family portraits, too. Laura looking nervous in 
           each of them, standing between her mother and father. 

           Laura’s mother is a heavy-set woman with kind eyes and a head 
           of thick, brown hair. She looks incredibly warm, especially 
           in comparison to Laura’s father, WALLACE “WALLY” VINE. Wally 
           is a military man with a bald head and the same stern 
           expression in every picture.

           The row of pictures ends with the final family portrait. In 
           it, Laura’s mother is obviously sick but putting on a good 
           face. She’s smaller, almost thin now and her hair’s been 
           replaced with a bad wig. Both Laura and her father look 
           miserable.

           And now, finally, as Laura and Drew reach the den, we find 
           present-day Wally sitting in a recliner and watching TV while 
           chewing on a big wad of dip. The years have not been kind to 
           him-- there’s an oxygen tube plugged into his nose and hair 
           sprouting from his ears.
           Wally’s disposition certainly hasn’t brightened, either. He 
           doesn’t even look away from the television as Laura and Drew 
           enter.

                                 WALLY
                        What are you doing here?

           Laura is genuinely disappointed by her father’s reaction. 
           Drew, however, looks as if this is exactly what he expected.

                                 LAURA
                        You forgot we were coming?

                                 WALLY
                        I didn’t forget. I just don’t know 
                        what you’re doing.

                                 LAURA
                        We’re here to visit you.

                                 WALLY
                        Well, I didn’t ask for that.

           Wally picks up the remote and turns up the volume on the 
           television.

                                 LAURA
                        Daddy, you can’t just sit here in 
                        the dark.

           Laura turns on a lamp. 

           The dim bulb reveals the walls of Wally’s den are lined with 
           Naval memorabilia from his war days. It also appears as if 
           Wally’s been living in this one room-- there are dirty dishes 
           everywhere and glass bottles filled with a disconcerting 
           yellow liquid.

           Laura immediately goes to work tidying up, grabbing a pile of 
           dishes.

           Drew, looking terrified, takes a seat on the couch beside his 
           father-in-law’s recliner.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Want a beer, sweetie?

                                 DREW
                        Absolutely.

           Laura hurries off with the mess, leaving the two men alone 
           for an awkward moment. After steeling himself, Drew blurts 
           out:
                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        You know, you should be very proud 
                        of your daughter in there, Wally. 
                        You raised quite the girl.

           Wally ignores Drew. He grabs a nearby cup and spits a big, 
           disgusting glob of dark tobacco juice.

           INT. LAURA’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

           With Drew asleep in her old twin bed, Laura pokes around in 
           her childhood bedroom. It’s mostly untouched since she left-- 
           though, this is more from Wally’s indifference than any sort 
           of preservation.

           Laura pulls a large cardboard box from the closet.

           She begins to empty the boxes contents. First, there’s a 
           large Styrofoam ball painted orange. She puts the ball in her 
           lap and reaches in for another, smaller ball. This one is 
           painted to look like Earth.

           It’s an old school project, a complete set of Styrofoam 
           planets-- even Pluto. Laura sits there, the Sun in her lap, 
           and arranges the solar system on the floor around her.

           EXT. BETHESDA MARRIOTT - NIGHT

           In the middle of a heated argument, Laura and Drew make their 
           way through the hotel parking lot.

           Laura looks great in a little black dress. Drew’s in a suit, 
           but he looks more like a guy who grabbed the first thing he 
           saw at J.C. Penney.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m worried about him. I think he 
                        needs to come stay with us.

                                 DREW
                        What? No way. Where are we supposed 
                        to put him? I don’t know if you’ve 
                        noticed but there’s hardly enough 
                        room for the five people who 
                        already live in that house. Much 
                        less an eighty-one-year-old man who 
                        has never thrown anything away in 
                        his entire life.
                                 LAURA
                        Okay. So we get him an apartment, 
                        then. Nearby. We can hire a nurse. 
                        Someone to help out.

           Drew stops, only now realizing how deep he’s in on this one.

                                 DREW
                        Wait. You’re serious about this? 
                        You want him closer?

           But Laura’s not stopping, she’s already made up her mind. 
           Drew has to rush to catch back up with her.

                                 LAURA
                        Of course I do. He’s sick and 
                        lonely and he needs our help. Why 
                        wouldn’t I want him closer?

                                 DREW
                        Because he’s awful? Because he’s 
                        never been anything but horrible to 
                        you? Because he terrifies our 
                        children?

                                 LAURA
                        He’s my father.

                                 DREW
                        That’s even worse. He treats you 
                        like garbage and all you ever do is 
                        try to get his approval. You’re so 
                        caught up trying to be daddy’s 
                        little girl that you can’t see 
                        daddy’s a fucking asshole.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m all he has.

                                 DREW
                        Fine. We’ll put him in a home.

                                 LAURA
                        Are you kidding me? He’d kill 
                        himself before he’d let us do that.

                                 DREW
                        I’d say good riddance but, knowing 
                        Wally, he’d probably try to take us 
                        out first.

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah, he probably would.
                                 DREW
                        Listen to you. Your father would 
                        kill us before letting us put him 
                        in a nursing home? That’s not 
                        normal.

                                 LAURA
                        Who wants to be normal?

           The argument still going, Laura and Drew enter--

           INT. BETHESDA MARRIOTT BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Balloons arc the entrance along with a banner that reads 
           “Welcome Home, Frontier High Class of ‘84!” The room is full 
           of 38 year-olds catching up over alcoholic punch while a DJ 
           spins the likes of Toni Basil and The Vapors.

                                 DREW
                        Look can we talk about this later? 
                        For now, I’d really like to just 
                        enjoy being the astronaut’s wife.

           But Laura’s already dropped the argument, stopping short in 
           the ballroom entrance. This is all a little more than she’s 
           prepared for.

                                 LAURA
                        Wow. It’s been a long time.

           Drew smiles. He leans in to kiss Laura’s forehead.

                                 DREW
                        Well, they won’t think that when 
                        they see you. You haven’t changed a 
                        bit since the day I met you.

           Laura smiles, trying to put on a brave face. They approach a 
           table lined with name tags where a VOLUNTEER watches them 
           with an unsettling smile.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s Laura and Drew--

                                 NAMETAG VOLUNTEER
                        Oh stop. I know exactly who you 
                        are.

           The Volunteer hands them their badges.

                                 NAMETAG VOLUNTEER (CONT’D)
                        And let me be the first to say how 
                        proud you’ve made us.
                                 LAURA
                        Well, thank you. That’s awful nice 
                        of you.

                                 NAMETAG VOLUNTEER
                        Of course. You’re an inspiration to 
                        us all.

           Laura turns away from the table. She rolls her eyes at Drew 
           but he doesn’t think the Volunteer’s sentiment is overblown 
           in the least. Laura really is an inspiration.

           INT. FRONTIER HIGH REUNION - LATER

           Laura and Drew stand in a crowd of her former classmates. 
           People are actually jockeying for position, trying to get 
           into Laura’s circle. 

           Everyone is here to see her.

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t know. You train and you 
                        train and then, one day, you’re up 
                        there. You’re floating around in 
                        space and...

           ...Laura makes eye contact with one of the men in the circle, 
           HAL FREELY. He’s handsome and slim and he nods to her, 
           noticing the eye contact...

           ...it throws her off her game for a moment...

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        ...you’re not even sure it’s real. 
                        It can’t be. Who would let you up 
                        there? How can this be your life?

           INT. FRONTIER HIGH REUNION - LATER

           The crowd watches a slideshow of old pictures on a giant 
           projector. A picture of Laura, nerdy with braces and giving a 
           thumbs up comes on and the place goes nuts.

           Laura and Drew are watching from the back, she leans over to 
           him, whispering:

                                 LAURA
                        What a dork.

                                 DREW
                        Hey! That’s my woman you’re talking 
                        about.
           Drew waves a mock fist at Laura. She laughs and shakes her 
           head.

           INT. FRONTIER HIGH REUNION - LATER

           Drew’s alone, whistling to himself as he refills his and 
           Laura’s punch cups.

           As he turns from the punch bowl, a DRUNK DUDE takes him in a 
           massive bear hug, lifting him up in the air and spilling 
           punch everywhere.

                                 DRUNK DUDE
                        Whoa! Freddie! It’s been too long, 
                        brother.

                                 DREW
                        Uh, I think you’ve got the wrong 
                        guy.

                                 DRUNK DUDE
                        You’re not Freddie?

           Drew points to his name tag.

                                 DREW
                        Nope. I’m Drew. I didn’t even go to 
                        school here. My wife did. Laura 
                        Pepper.

           The Drunk Dude’s jaw drops. This is way better than finding 
           Freddie, whoever he is.

                                 DRUNK DUDE
                        Whoa! Awesome!

           Drew nods. Yep. It is awesome. He’s having the time of his 
           life.

           EXT. BETHESDA MARRIOTT - LATER

           Laura leans against the building smoking a cigarette. She’s 
           alone, staring up at the stars, getting a much needed break 
           until...

                                 HAL
                        Laura Vine.

           ...it’s Hal Freely, from earlier, with a big smile on his 
           face-- she’s just the person he was looking for. Now, without 
           Drew around, there’s a familiarity between these two, a long 
           history.
                                 LAURA
                        Pepper. Laura Pepper.

                                 HAL
                        I saw that. It’s still Freely here. 
                        Not that the man changes his name 
                        if he’s married. Just, you know, 
                        I’m not married.

           Hal holds up his hand, providing the lack of a ring as proof.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi, Hal.

                                 HAL
                        I mean, full disclosure, I’m 
                        divorced.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s okay. I’d heard.

           Laura stubs out her cigarette, ready to get back inside if 
           this is the alternative. But Hal wants to talk:

                                 HAL
                        I guess word gets around, huh? How 
                        about you? How’ve you been? What’ve 
                        you made of yourself?

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t do that. You know what I do.

                                 HAL
                        Okay, okay. You’re a big shot 
                        astronaut. Imagine that. Our Laura-- 
                        my Laura-- in outer space.

                                 LAURA
                        And back again.

           Hal misinterprets Laura’s wistfulness. He leans in to kiss 
           her but Laura stops him. Before their lips can even touch, 
           she takes a step back and pushes him away. 

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Stop.

                                 HAL
                        I’m sorry. I don’t know what came 
                        over me.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s okay. I get it. It’s just, I’m 
                        happy now.
           This, much more than the fact that his ex-girlfriend has been 
           to space, seems to really blow Hal’s mind. In fact, he can’t 
           believe it:

                                 HAL
                        Really? That’s...you’re happy?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes.

                                 HAL
                        Wow.

           Laura doesn’t say anything. Hal picks at the brick wall for a 
           quiet moment.

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Why’d I ever let you go?

                                 LAURA
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 HAL
                        It does to me. You were crazy about 
                        me, once. And I got bored of it. I 
                        thought, when we left for college, 
                        I could do better. You cried and 
                        cried. You called my house at all 
                        hours of the night. My mother was 
                        so freaked out she wanted to change 
                        our number. Do you remember what 
                        you said?

                                 LAURA
                        Not really.

                                 HAL
                        You said I couldn’t do better than 
                        you. You said you were the best 
                        thing that ever happened to me.

                                 LAURA
                        Yikes.

                                 HAL
                        No. You were right.

           Laura thinks about this for a moment. Then she smiles.

                                 LAURA
                        I know.

           With that, Laura brushes past Hal and heads back in to:
           INT. FRONTIER HIGH REUNION - CONTINUOUS

           Laura returns to the ballroom and finds Drew. She wraps her 
           arms around him, kisses him deeply, and takes her drink.

           The class president, SAHAYA AHMED, is up on stage, giving a 
           big speech.

                                 SAHAYA
                        I don’t know about the rest of you, 
                        but these last twenty years have 
                        been full of some hard truths. 
                        Like, maybe we don’t all get to 
                        grow up and get married and have 
                        three kids and that house with the 
                        white picket fence. And we 
                        definitely can’t eat a whole bag of 
                        Oreos like we used to. And we’ve 
                        all lost friends. There are people 
                        who aren’t here tonight who, twenty 
                        years ago, we couldn’t imagine life 
                        without.

           Someone yells from the crowd, echoing this sentiment:

                                 VOICE
                        We miss you Dylan!

                                 SAHAYA
                        But, I’ll tell you what we do have 
                        here tonight. Hope. And 
                        inspiration. There’s a girl-- no, a 
                        woman-- amongst us, who made more 
                        of herself than any of us could 
                        have ever dared to dream. That 
                        woman is Laura Pepper. Where are 
                        you Laura?

           Laura tries to shrink away, to hide from this. This is not 
           what she wants--

           -- but Drew doesn’t notice. He pushes her forward, calling 
           out:

                                 DREW
                        Here! She’s here!

           Everyone turns to see her. They’re all beaming; they’re all 
           unable to get enough of her.

                                 SAHAYA
                        Now, I want to make a toast and I 
                        know you’ll all join me. To Laura 
                        Pepper! A real, American hero!
           Everyone holds up their cups and calls out:

                                 CROWD
                        To Laura!

                                 LAURA
                        Aw, thanks, guys.

                                 SAHAYA
                        No, Laura. Thank you.

           The crowd goes wild. Drew whispers in Laura’s ear:

                                 DREW
                        I love you so damn much.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSTON APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           Laura, having won the argument (as if there was ever any 
           doubt), carries boxes into her father’s new apartment. Drew’s 
           there, with the kids, all doing their best to help. 
           Everyone’s walking on eggshells.

           Wally sits in the rental truck and glares at all of them.

           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Wally’s still glaring after the truck’s been unloaded. Now, 
           he’s sitting in his recliner while Laura and Drew unpack.

           The kids run around, caught up in a game of tag. They’re 
           getting along, having a good time in spite of the obvious 
           tension.

                                 RUTH
                        You’re it!

           Ruth tags Neil, who turns to chase her--

           -- only he trips over a box--

           -- falling onto the back of Wally’s recliner--

                                 WALLY
                        Watch it you little shits!

                                 DREW
                        Wally!
           Drew drops the empty box he’s just unloaded. Wally laughs a 
           mean little laugh.

                                 WALLY
                        What are you going to do? You can’t 
                        even stand up to her.

           Drew takes a step towards his father-in-law, who, even though 
           he’s sitting in a recliner, somehow manages to not back down.

                                 DREW
                        Listen here--

           -- but Laura steps in--

                                 LAURA
                        -- Drew. It’s not worth it. Trust 
                        me. Go. Take the kids. I’ll finish 
                        up.

                                 DREW
                        You’re sure?

                                 LAURA
                        Yeah. I’m sure.

                                 DREW
                        Come on guys.

           The kids, who are all standing there in terrified silence run 
           after their father. 

                                 LAURA
                        Be good!

           Wally smiles his awful smile, his point made.

                                 WALLY
                        Pussy.

           INT. DREW’S CAR - EVENING

           As Drew drives home, the kids sit in awkward silence, until:

                                 ED
                        Grandpa’s an asshole.

                                 DREW
                        Hey! Watch the language.

                                 RUTH
                        He’s right.
                                 DREW
                        I know.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m glad you’re not an asshole, 
                        Dad. 

                                 DREW
                        Well, I’ll have to be one if you 
                        guys don’t stop using that word 
                        this second.

                                 NEIL
                        Sorry.

           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Laura’s made a lot of progress on the apartment and Wally, 
           now sipping a beer, seems to have calmed down a bit with 
           everyone gone.

           Laura opens one of the last remaining boxes. She reaches into 
           the box and pulls out what looks like a bundled up cloth. 
           Whatever’s in the cloth falls out--

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus.

           -- startling Laura. She turns to her father, concerned.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

           Wally barely looks in her direction. Laura reaches in the box 
           once again and pulls out a handgun. She holds it with two 
           fingers, far from her body, as if it’s something dead and 
           rotten.

                                 WALLY
                        What?

                                 LAURA
                        Really?

                                 WALL7
                        I have my rights.

                                 LAURA
                        All right, all right.

           Laura carefully wraps the gun in the cloth.
                                 WALLY
                        This is the God damn United States 
                        of America.

           Laura pats her father reassuringly on the shoulder as she 
           heads out of the room. She’s not taking his gun.

                                 LAURA
                        I know, Daddy. I know.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura enters her father’s guest room. She grabs a folding 
           chair and stands on it in order to shove the gun in the back 
           corner of the highest closet shelf.

           She may not be taking it away from Wally but she’s certainly 
           not leaving it anywhere that he can find it.

           EXT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Laura carries a load of broken-down boxes to the dumpster.

           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Laura sits on the ground beside her father’s recliner. 
           They’re finishing off pizza. Laura’s trying to have a 
           conversation but isn’t really getting anywhere.

                                 LAURA
                        I wish you could have seen it up 
                        there, Daddy.

           Silence from Wally. But Laura doesn’t give up:

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t wait to go back.

                                 WALLY
                        Well, I know one thing. I’m going 
                        back. That’s for sure.

           Laura’s heart breaks. Her father’s even further gone than she 
           thought.

                                 LAURA
                        Daddy, you didn’t go to space. 
                        You’ve done a lot of things. Great 
                        things. But you didn’t go to space. 
                        I did.
           Or, maybe he isn’t:

                                 WALLY
                        Who cares about space? I’m going 
                        home. You can’t keep me locked up 
                        here forever. This ain’t no fucking 
                        prison.

           Maybe he’s the same asshole he’s always been after all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NASA CAFETERIA - DAY

           Laura walks through the crowded company cafeteria, her tray 
           has only a modest salad and a big glass of water. She looks 
           around nervously, back in school for a moment, unsure where 
           to sit.

           Luckily, there’s an empty table and Laura eases into a seat 
           by herself. Just as she’s about to take a bite of her lunch--

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        We’re going bowling tonight.

           -- Mark drops his tray on the table, it is loaded up with 
           Salisbury steak and tater tots. He turns a chair around and 
           straddles it.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry, who’s going bowling?

                                 MARK
                        We are, space girl. Us. You, me, 
                        the guys.
                             (calling out to a line of 
                              passing astronauts)
                        Guys! Bowling, tonight?

                                 ASTRONAUT #1
                        Yep.

                                 ASTRONAUT #2
                        Yep.

                                 ASTRONAUT #3
                        Yep.

           -- Mark turns, expectantly to Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        Nope.
                                 MARK
                        Oh come on.

                                 LAURA
                        Can’t. I’ve got kids and a husband. 
                        Dinner doesn’t make itself.

                                 MARK
                        Bleh. Earth families. Who needs 
                        ‘em? Tell them you’ve got a new 
                        family, now. A brotherhood.

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t think they’d like that very 
                        much.

           Mark flashes a devilish grin.

                                 MARK
                        Then lie. Tell them it’s training. 
                        You’re serving your country. That’s 
                        what the rest of us do.

           Laura looks over at him, smiling. She’s obviously tempted. 
           But, for now at least, she just can’t do it.

                                 LAURA
                        Maybe next time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SEEMINGLY ENDLESS CEREAL AISLE--

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           -- as Laura slowly pushes a shopping cart, lost in the 
           infinite options. She turns to the twins, who are tagging 
           along behind her.

                                 LAURA
                        What do you want? I can’t decide.

                                 NEIL
                        That one.

           Neil points to neon purple box, the least healthy option.

                                 LAURA
                        That’s nothing but sugar.

                                 ED
                        You told us to pick.
                                 LAURA
                        Well, you blew it.

           Laura grabs bland, sugarless corn flakes and tosses them in 
           the cart. She continues on, still sort of amazed by the 
           place.

           It’s weird to come to the realization that you’re more at 
           home in outer space than in the suburban grocery store where 
           you’ve done your shopping for the last ten years.

           In fact, Laura doesn’t realize something’s off until she’s 
           all the way to the end of the aisle.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Boys?--

           -- Laura turns to find Neil and Ed, standing in the middle of 
           the aisle, elbow-deep in a torn open bright purple cereal 
           box. They laugh through mouthfuls of sugar.

           Laura sighs heavily and closes her eyes. Just as she opens 
           them we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BOWLING BALL ARCING THROUGH THE AIR--

           INT. SUGARLAND LANES - NIGHT

           -- landing on a waxed lane, headed directly for a triangle of 
           pins--

           -- CRASH --

           -- the pins wobble and collapse but don’t all fall. There’s a 
           nasty spare to be picked up.

                                 LAURA
                        Damn it.

           Laura’s bowling, and clearly not doing the best job. Off by 
           the ball return, Mark pals around with PETE HOFSTRA and JIM 
           MENDELSON, two other astronauts.

           Jim takes a moment to rib Laura--

                                 JIM
                        Now why would you go and do that?

                                 LAURA
                        I meant to do it, Jim.
           Mark takes a swig from his Yuengling and hops up to Laura.

                                 MARK
                        Care for some pointers, ma’am?

                                 LAURA
                        That depends. You have any idea 
                        what you’re talking about?

           Mark smiles.

                                 MARK
                        I practically invented this game.

           Mark gets up close to Laura, cupping her arms in his--

           --he draws her arm back and forth in large, slow practice 
           throws.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        The trick is adding a slight twist 
                        at the end there. You see? 

           Laura smiles. She’s enjoying this moment of closeness.

                                 LAURA
                        That’s your secret?

                                 MARK
                        That’s my secret.

           Pete cups his hand to his mouth.

                                 PETE
                        His secret is that he’s hammered!

                                 MARK
                        Oh, that’s no secret at all.

           Mark heads back to his beer but not before calling out to 
           Laura:

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Remember what I told you!

           Laura steps up to the line. She takes a deep breath before 
           heaving the ball down the lane and--

           -- PICKING UP THE SPARE!

           The other astronauts cheer wildly. Laura gives Mark a high 
           five.
                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Say it.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re the best.

                                 MARK
                        And now, the best in action.

           Mark grabs a ball and approaches the line. He tosses it down 
           the lane where it--

           -- promptly lands in the gutter.

           Laura can’t help but laugh.

           INT. SUGARLAND LANES - LATER

           The astronauts are shooting the shit around a table, post-
           game. Mark swings by, placing an armful of beers on the 
           table.

                                 MARK
                        As requested: five Yuenglings.

                                 JIM
                        And only four of us.

           Mark gives himself an extra beer, feigns surprise:

                                 MARK
                        Oh no-- how could this have 
                        happened?

                                 PETE AND JIM
                        Must’ve been a rounding error.

           Laura laughs.

                                 JIM
                        Ah, so that’s why he brought you 
                        along. Someone to laugh at that old 
                        joke.

                                 MARK
                        The only old joke here is you, my 
                        friend.

                                 LAURA
                        Ouch.

           Mark gives Jim a playful shove.
                                 MARK
                        Oh, don’t worry about it. These 
                        guys love me.

                                 PETE
                        I can assure you, we don’t.

                                 MARK
                        We go way back. We got called up 
                        together. Pete was with me on the 
                        Discovery. Jim’s still waiting for 
                        his shot.

           This is obviously a sore spot for Jim::

                                 JIM
                        Thanks for the reminder.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, you’ll get up there. It’ll 
                        happen.

                                 JIM
                        It better. Or I’m going to have to 
                        blow my fucking brains out.

           There’s a hint of misery in Jim’s voice. He’s joking, sure, 
           but there’s more than a bit of truth to it. 

                                 MARK
                        Okay. Enough of your moping. I was 
                        just saying how close we are. How 
                        you guys know all my dirty secrets.

                                 PETE
                        Like the crying incident.

                                 MARK
                        Oh jeez--

           Without thinking, Laura grabs Mark’s hand--

                                 LAURA
                        What crying incident? I need to 
                        hear this.

           He looks at her, a little surprised. Laura, realizing what’s 
           happened, takes her hand back.

                                 MARK
                        Well, since you asked so nicely--

           Mark takes a sip of his beer. He pauses for dramatic effect 
           before starting his story:
                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Four years ago. Atlantis-- ISS 
                        Science module, real bitch of a 
                        job. Three spacewalks, twenty-three 
                        hours of work.

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus.

                                 MARK
                        I’m on the third walk, just about 
                        to finish up, when-- you know that 
                        defogging solution they put on the 
                        visors?

           Laura makes a disgusted face.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh God, yes. Smells like fish.

                                 MARK
                        Bingo. Well, my cooling system goes 
                        on the fritz and all of the sudden 
                        I’m starting to sweat. I end up 
                        getting a bit of the defogger in my 
                        left eye.

                                 PETE
                        That’s what he claims. I still 
                        maintain he was crying because he’s 
                        a big puss--
                             (remembering there’s a 
                              lady present)
                        Sorry, Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        Nothing I haven’t heard before, you 
                        dumb cunt.

           The guys are momentarily stunned by this but then burst into 
           laughter. She’s doing a great job fitting in and Mark loves 
           it.

                                 MARK
                        See? What’d I tell you? She’s one 
                        of the good ones. Now, where was I?

                                 LAURA
                        Defogger in your left eye.

                                 MARK
                        Right. Burns like hell. My eyes are 
                        watering. And you know space-- 
                        things are weird. Tears don’t fall. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK (CONT'D)
                        They just hang there in your eye 
                        sockets. And it’s not like you can 
                        just reach up and wipe them away. 

                                 JIM
                        Not unless you want it to be the 
                        last thing you ever do.

                                 MARK
                        I’m blind. I’m overheating. I’m 
                        just out there and I have no idea 
                        what my surroundings are.

           Laura looks sick-- this isn’t the sort of story she wanted to 
           hear.

                                 LAURA
                        How’d you make it out?

                                 MARK
                        Was able to shake the tears from my 
                        eyes and pull myself back into the 
                        cargo bay.  

           Laura lets this sink in.

                                 LAURA
                        Everything is so fragile.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, but what a ride.

           EXT. PEPPER HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           Mark’s large truck rolls up the driveway.

           He turns to Laura, seated beside him and clearly a little 
           tipsy--

                                 MARK
                        Nice place.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s home.

           With some effort, Laura forces her door open and works to 
           pour herself out of the pickup.

           Mark gets out too, hurrying around to the passenger side.

           He makes an exaggerated bow, holding his hand our for Laura 
           to take--
                                 MARK
                        M’lady.

           Laura laughs, taking Mark’s hand and returning the gesture 
           with a regal nod.

                                 LAURA
                        Such a gentleman.

           On her way out of the truck, Laura SLIPS, falling right onto 
           Mark.

           He catches her, stopping the fall. They both crack up.

                                 MARK
                        Still don’t have those Earth legs, 
                        huh?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m just drunk.

           Laura regains her footing, bracing herself against Mark as 
           she gets her balance.

           She looks up at the house, wistful--

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think my family wants me 
                        back up there.

                                 MARK
                        What’d you tell them?

                                 LAURA
                        I told them the truth.

                                 MARK
                        That you’re going?

                                 LAURA
                        That I need a break.

           Mark doesn’t answer at first. He frowns slightly at the house 
           before offering:

                                 MARK
                        They just don’t get it, do they?

           Laura laughs a short, bitter laugh. She doesn’t want to talk 
           about this right now.

                                 LAURA
                        Can I get a cigarette?
           Mark pulls out his softpack and removes a pair of cigarettes.

           Laura stops him--

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        No. Let’s just share one.

           Mark smiles. He lights the cigarette, taking a long drag 
           before handing it off to Laura. 

           The two of them lean against the pickup, looking skyward.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Do you ever miss it?

           Mark turns to Laura, brushing away a few strands of hair 
           covering her face. He looks into her eyes:

                                 MARK
                        Every God damn day.

           Their lips are inches apart.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        See you at the office, space girl.

           INT. PEPPER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura enters the house, dropping her bag on the kitchen floor 
           and slowly, quietly making her way up the stairs.

           As she moves down the hallway, she notices a light on: 
           Ruth’s.

           INT. RUTH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura enters to find Ruth seated on the floor reading a copy 
           of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. She’s so caught up 
           in the book she hasn’t even noticed her mother.

           Laura gives a quick knock on the door to get Ruth’s attention-
           -

                                 LAURA
                        Bed time.

                                 RUTH
                        Okay.

           Ruth dog-ears a page and crawls into bed. Laura doesn’t 
           leave. Instead, she gets into bed beside her daughter.
           Laura chokes up, suddenly overcome with emotion.

                                 LAURA
                        Baby, I’m sorry.

           Ruth is surprised and a little scared-- she’s never seen her 
           mother like this.

                                 RUTH
                        For what?

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t know. For not being around. 
                        For yelling at you guys.

           Ruth gives her mother a hug.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s okay, Mom. Sometimes we 
                        deserve to get yelled at.

           Laura hugs Ruth back. The two of them lay there in bed. They 
           stare up at Ruth’s ceiling, which is covered in glow-in-the-
           dark plastic stars.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHUTTLE SIMULATOR - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

           Laura, Mark, Pete and Jim-- each in full astronaut gear-- are 
           strapped into a shuttle simulator that’s nearly as old as 
           they are.

           It’s a machine built in the 1970’s-- slow, and prone to 
           breaking down. But it’s all there is for training, all there 
           has ever been.

           The astronauts busily check their instruments as--

           -- A FLASHING RED LIGHT FILLS THE CABIN--

                                 MARK
                        Looks like we have a life-support 
                        failure.

           Loud sirens kick in.

           Laura pulls out a large binder at her feet and begins 
           thumbing through the Mission Protocols.
                                 LAURA
                        Copy that. Houston, reporting a 
                        failure of life support system in 
                        crew cable.

                                 MISSION CONTROL
                        Roger. Endeavour, can you confirm 
                        O2 levels?

                                 MARK
                        Stable.
                             (to Laura)
                        Power reading?

           Laura thumbs through her guide to the appropriate page.

                                 LAURA
                        Um, power levels confirmed stable.

           Mark flips through his binder, double-checking Laura’s 
           assessment.

                                 MARK
                        Houston, do you read that? Power 
                        and O2 remain constant.

                                 MISSION CONTROL
                        Copy Endeavour. 

           The shrieking sirens continue. Laura winces.

                                 LAURA
                        We’ve got a lot of noise up here.

           Jim flips to the back of his binder.

                                 JIM
                        Any ideas, Houston?

                                 MISSION CONTROL
                        Endeavour, CAPCOM is suggesting a 
                        hard restart. 

                                 MARK
                        Laura, that’s you.

           Laura’s thumbing through a second binder. A second, more 
           staccato siren begins SHRIEKING.

                                 LAURA
                        Fuck. One second--

           More shrieking. Lights are starting to flicker in the cabin.
                                 MARK
                        Gonna need some help here, Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        Almost there--

                                 PETE
                        O2 dropping.

           Pete starts throwing switches on his console no luck.

           Mark turns to Laura, alarm creeping in--

                                 MARK
                        Laura, where we at?

           Finally, Laura has flipped to the page she was looking for--

                                 LAURA
                        Found it!

           Laura flips a series of switches on her console--

           -- the flashing lights and sirens suddenly STOP.

           Everything is still.

                                 MARK
                        We’re all dead.

           Mark unbuckles his harness. 

           He storms out of the simulator.

           EXT. SIMULATOR - LATER

           Laura sits alone in front of the simulator. She’s a wreck, 
           still wearing her flight suit, breathing heavily. After a 
           moment, she stands, walks over to the simulator and--

           -- punches it as hard as she can, ripping her knuckles open 
           against the metal exterior.

                                 LAURA
                        God damnit.

           She turns and kicks a wooden bench, in full meltdown mode.

           She pulls off a boot, grunting loudly, tearing the thing off 
           with little regard for whether or not she takes her foot with 
           it.

           She hurls the boot across the room. Pulls at the suit itself.
           She’s moaning, too. This low, aching moan. Real pain. She’s 
           on the verge of tears but, somehow, this is even more intense 
           than if she was actually weeping.

           Laura’s completely tangled in the suit as she tries to pull 
           it off. She’s flailing at the thing, tearing at it as if it’s 
           on fire.

           And then, she stops.  

           Half out of the suit now, wearing only one boot, Laura slumps 
           down on the bench. Her hand is bleeding but she ignores it.

           She just sits there. Breathing heavily. Completely unhinged. 
           And then--

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        This seat taken?

           Laura looks up to find Mark-- the Mark she knows: all charm 
           and cowboy swagger and not an ounce of the anger she saw in 
           the simulator.

           She melts. All the tension leaving her in that moment.

                                 LAURA
                        You sure you want to sit with a 
                        dead girl?

           Mark takes a seat. He’s buffing an apple against his sleeve, 
           completely unfazed by any of this.

                                 MARK
                        You did good in there.

                                 LAURA
                        Are you joking?

                                 MARK
                        You know how these simulators go. 
                        You fuck up so you can learn how 
                        not to fuck up.

           Mark takes a bite of the apple. He offers a bite to Laura but 
           she waves it away--

                                 LAURA
                        I’m fine.

                                 MARK
                        You sure are. We’ll get ‘em next 
                        time.

           Laura rolls her eyes.
                                 LAURA
                        You’re just saying that because you 
                        like me.

           Mark responds with an impish grin:

                                 MARK
                        That can’t be true. I don’t like 
                        you one bit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANGELINAS NATIONAL FOREST - DAY

           A dense forest North of Houston. Laura and her family are 
           gathered around the beginnings of a camp site.

           Laura is playing with the kids as Drew is struggling to set 
           up the tent.

           He’s clearly not having much luck, dropping one pole every 
           time he tries to secure another--

                                 DREW
                        God dammit!

           Laura overhears and heads over to Drew.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        This tent isn’t playing nice.

                                 LAURA
                        Let me do it.

           Drew steps aside as Laura takes over.

           It’s easy work for Laura. Time with the Navy and NASA has 
           left her with some solid survival skills. 

                                 DREW
                        I feel like I’m in the way.

           Laura is busy tying another elaborate knot around a post. She 
           calls out to Drew, withouth looking up--

                                 LAURA
                        You can unpack the gear if you 
                        want.

                                 DREW
                        Right.

           Drew grabs Laura’s pack and brings it over.
                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Where do you want it?

           Laura hammers the fourth tentpole into place.

                                 LAURA
                        Not here. Just take it out and set 
                        it aside.

           Drew takes the bag over to a clearing and begins unpacking. 
           As he sets aside item after item-- three knives, four 
           canteens, two compasses varying lengths of rope, kerosene, 
           gauze, tinfoil--

           And one very sharp-looking HATCHET.

                                 DREW
                        We expecting trouble?

                                 LAURA
                        Not unless you want some.

           Laura smiles. Drew laughs-- nervously.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        It’s really not that much. There’s 
                        a purpose for everything I brought.

           Drew holds up a length of rope. 

           He makes some suggestive eyebrow raises.

                                 DREW
                        I can think of a use for this 
                        tonight.

           Laura laughs, rolling her eyes.

                                 LAURA
                        So romantic.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - DUSK

           The sun is fast disappearing behind the trees as the whole 
           family is gathered around a large campfire making s’mores.

           Drew is in the middle of telling a ghost story, his face lit 
           from below with a flashlight.

                                 DREW
                        ...and when her date untied the 
                        ribbon around her neck...
           Drew does his best to mime untying a knot with his one free 
           hand--

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        --Her head fell off!

           Laura gives an exaggerrated GASP. The twins are appropriately 
           weirded out:

                                 EDWIN
                        Oh that’s creepy.

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah definitely.

           Ruth grunts. Unimpressed.

                                 RUTH
                        That would never happen.

           Laura gives a playful smile.

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t be so sure, Ruth. I knew the 
                        girl this happened to.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah right.

                                 DREW
                        It’s true. She went to the same 
                        high school as your mother. 

           Ruth perks up--

                                 RUTH
                        Really?

           Drew creeps toward Ruth, shining the flashlight under his 
           face.

                                 DREW
                        Really. She was your age, you know. 
                        And they say, if you listen 
                        carefully you can still hear her in 
                        these woods.

           Ruth is trying to look cool, but it’s obvious she’s listening 
           to the woods right now.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        BOO!

           Ruth SCREAMS.
           EXT. CAMPSITE - MIDNIGHT

           Laura puts out the campfire and heads toward the tent.

           The kids are already asleep and she’s looking to turn in 
           herself when--

                                 DREW (O.S.)
                        Psst!

           Laura turns to find Drew emerging from the trees.

                                 LAURA
                        What are you doing?

                                 DREW
                        Come on, I want to show you 
                        something.

           Laura casts a glance back toward the tent--

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        The kids’ll be fine.

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Drew and Laura wander through the forest, ducking under 
           branches and hopping over downed trees.

                                 DREW
                        Watch your step. Stubbed a few toes 
                        on my way out here.

                                 LAURA
                        Where are we going?

                                 DREW
                        That’d spoil the surprise.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s late.

           They come to a clearing in the trees, ending up on the shores 
           of a warm LAKE.

                                 DREW
                        This is something else, huh?

                                 LAURA
                        It’s nice.

           Drew starts to unbutton his shirt--
                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DREW
                        Skinny dipping, silly. 

           Drew hangs his pants on a nearby tree branch.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        And you are too.

           With that, he slips off his baggy, white briefs and wades 
           into the water.

           Laura starts to undress herself, working her night clothes 
           over her head. But when she looks back up at the lake--

           --Drew is gone.

                                 LAURA
                        Drew?

           No answer.

           Laura wades into the water naked. Still no sign of him.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Drew, where are you?

           She continues to look but is seemingly alone when--

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        AHHH!!!

           Laura SCREAMS as she’s PULLED UNDERWATER. 

           She thrashes at the water when, finally, the creature that 
           pulled at her surfaces:

           Drew. Laughing hard.

                                 DREW
                        Got you.

           He leans in and kisses her, not noticing how she is pulling 
           back.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        And I’m never letting go.

           High above them the stars twinkle in a clear, cloudless sky.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

           Laura walks down a long NASA hallway lined with offices. She 
           passes a number of nondescript doors before stopping at one 
           that’s slightly ajar at the end of the line.

           Laura pokes her head in--

           -- to find Mark, napping. The tinny sounds of Steely Dan 
           coming from a small radio on his desk.

           Laura enters. She closes the door quietly and walks over to 
           him. She leans close, getting just inches from his face--

                                 LAURA
                        Boo!

           -- Mark is startled awake, gasping a big, shocked breath 
           before he recognizes his surroundings.

           Laura laughs. Mark plays it cool.

                                 MARK
                        I’m up, I’m up.

                                 LAURA
                        Coulda fooled me.

                                 MARK
                        Maybe I did?

           Laura smiles, shaking her head and giving Mark a playful 
           shove.

                                 LAURA
                        What’re you doing for lunch?

           Mark places a paper bag on his desk.

                                 MARK
                        Brought my own.

           He reaches into the bag, pulls out a six-pack of Budweiser.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Care to join me?

           Laura arches an eyebrow.

                                 LAURA
                        Well--
           EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DUSK

           Laura’s SUV is parked on a side road in the Johnson Complex. 
           It’s remote, but the old, decommissioned Saturn V Rocket is 
           still visible from her windshield. 

           Inside, Mark and Laura are splitting an order of fries. Mark 
           pops the top of a can of beer; hands it to Laura.

           As she sips, a car drives by. Laura repositions herself to 
           hide the fact she’s drinking.

           Mark laughs at Laura’s cautiousness.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s like we’re back in high 
                        school, smoking under the 
                        bleachers.

           Mark takes a big swig from his can.

                                 MARK
                        You never smoked under the 
                        bleachers.

                                 LAURA
                        How are you so sure?

                                 MARK
                        You’re a straight arrow, space 
                        girl. As straight as they come. 
                        You’ve never done a single thing 
                        wrong in your life.

                                 LAURA
                        I’ve done plenty of things wrong.

                                 MARK
                        Name one.

           Laura thinks for a moment but she is genuinely stumped.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        How about smoking under the 
                        bleachers?

                                 LAURA
                        Nope. Never did that.

           Mark laughs and takes another sip. 

           He stares out the passenger window and sighs. He seems a bit 
           off, a bit lost.
                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 MARK
                        Just tired. 

           Laura puts her hand on Mark’s shoulder.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        My kids--

           Mark stops, surprised he said it. There is a silence, but 
           Laura doesn’t try to fill it.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I love my kids. How could I not? 
                        They’re my kids for God’s sake. But 
                        I feel like I don’t even know them. 

           Laura nods. She knows the feeling.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        And their mother too. She’s stay-at-
                        home, so they’re all close. Like 
                        they’ve got their own language. 
                        Sometimes they’ll say these things 
                        and burst out laughing and I won’t 
                        understand a single bit of it. 
                        Sometimes I feel so alone.

           That last one lands particularly hard. 

           Laura takes Mark’s large hands in hers, turning to look 
           directly in his eyes:

                                 LAURA
                        You don’t have to be alone.

           She leans over and kisses Mark, fully and deeply.

           She undoes his belt. He removes her shirt.

           They fuck right there in the car.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHILI’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Laura and Drew are lead through the restaurant by CHERYL, a 
           friendly waitress they’ve known for years.
           It’s date night. Their first in a long, long time. Laura is 
           distant and nervous, a few steps behind. Thoughts of Mark 
           weigh heavily on her.

                                 CHERYL
                        And here you are, your regular 
                        table. Right where you left it.

           The table is nothing special, just a quiet two-top in the 
           middle of the restaurant. Drew pulls a chair out for Laura, 
           who drops into it like a dead weight.

                                 DREW
                        Well, thanks, Cheryl. Means a lot. 
                        You know we sat at this table the 
                        night Laura got tapped for the 
                        program? 

                                 CHERYL
                        How could I forget? Now that was 
                        some celebration.

           Laura’s certainly not in the mood for any sort of celebrating 
           right now. She’s a complete wreck. 

           But neither Drew nor Cheryl notices. Cheryl gets out her pen 
           and pad while Laura eyes the exit.

                                 CHERYL (CONT’D)
                        I take it y’all won’t be needing 
                        menus?

                                 DREW
                        Nope. The usual should do the 
                        trick.

                                 CHERYL
                        Great. And can I start you guys 
                        with some apps-- potato skins, hot 
                        wings, Southwestern egg rolls?

                                 DREW
                        You know what? I’m feeling 
                        adventurous. Egg rolls sound great. 
                        Laura?

           Laura-- still not quite there-- manages a shrug.

                                 LAURA
                        That’s fine.
                                 CHERYL
                        Fantastic. I’ll get that started 
                        and y’all just shout if you need 
                        me.

           With a cheerful bounce, Cheryl heads for the kitchen. But, 
           after only a few steps, she stops, remembering something. She 
           hurries back to the table.

                                 CHERYL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Laura? We’re so proud of 
                        you.

           Laura forces a smile.

                                 LAURA
                        Thanks. You shouldn’t be.

           Cheryl’s unsure what to make of that. She gets a confused 
           look on her face before heading back to the kitchen.

                                 DREW
                        Be nice. She means well.

           Laura doesn’t respond. She sips her water. She looks at her 
           hands-- they’re shaking. But she can’t bring herself to look 
           away from them.

           Anything to avoid looking at Drew.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        So...

                                 LAURA
                        Drew, I have to tell you something.

                                 DREW
                        Okay. I actually have something to 
                        tell you, too. But go for it. You 
                        first.

           Laura takes a deep breath. She looks at her husband across 
           the table. He has no idea. It terrifies her.

           But still, she has to do it. It’s the right thing to do. She 
           steadies herself and is about to blurt out everything, when--

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Actually, can I go? I’ve been 
                        working up the nerve to say this 
                        all day. I know you’re not going to 
                        like it, but I just feel it has to 
                        be said. And if I don’t do it now, 
                        it’ll be too late.
                                 LAURA
                        What is it?

           Drew takes a deep breath of his own.

                                 DREW
                        I don’t want you to go back.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 DREW
                        Up there. You can’t go on another 
                        mission. I won’t allow it.

                                 LAURA
                        You won’t allow it?

                                 DREW
                        Okay. Poor word choice. But it’s 
                        time to realize your life is here. 
                        Your kids are here. I’m here. 

                                 LAURA
                        I know that.

                                 DREW
                        Do you? Do you ever even think of 
                        what I go through when you’re gone? 
                        What the kids go through?

                                 LAURA
                        Every single day. 

                                 DREW
                        Well, if you really did, you’d 
                        realize how selfish this is.

           Laura is taken aback. She lashes out--

                                 LAURA
                        Are you serious? How can you call 
                        me selfish and then ask for this?

                                 DREW
                        I’m not asking you. You can’t go 
                        back. I need you. We need you.

                                 LAURA
                        And I need this. You know that. 
                        I’ve worked my entire life to get 
                        out there.
                                 DREW
                        You got there. You did it. You went 
                        up and you came back. Safely. I’m 
                        proud of you for it. Every single 
                        god damn person in your entire life 
                        is proud of you for it. But why go 
                        back again? Why risk it?

           Laura slams her hand down on the table, rattling the 
           silverware. Everyone around her notices.

                                 LAURA
                        Because it’s the only thing I ever 
                        wanted.

           Cheryl, back with the appetizers, cautiously places the 
           platter on their table. A pro, she acts as though she hadn’t 
           heard a thing.

                                 CHERYL
                        And here we are. They’re on the 
                        house. Just our way of saying 
                        thanks to an American hero. 

           She leaves. An embarrassed Drew and Laura mumble gratitude.

                                 DREW
                        Thanks, Cheryl.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you.

           Laura and Drew sit there for a moment. 

           Scared. Hurt. Ruined. 

           The food goes cold.

           INT. DREW’S CAR - LATER

           Drew and Laura drive home in silence.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NASA’S NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LAB - DAY

           A massive swimming pool. A tank, actually. It’s large enough 
           to contain a full-scale mock up of the International Space 
           Station. This is where NASA’s astronauts go to train for 
           spacewalks. 
           Which is exactly what Laura’s preparing to do. She’s beside 
           the pool, on a metal platform, being outfitted in a specially 
           modified space suit.

           A LAB WORKER holds Laura’s helmet.

                                 LAB WORKER
                        You ready for a six hour bath?

                                 LAURA
                        Can’t wait.

           Laura offers a clumsy thumbs up. The Lab Worker gives a 
           thumbs up of her own and fits Laura’s helmet over her head.

           INT. NASA’S NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LAB - LATER

           The platform, with a fully-outfitted Laura strapped in, is 
           lowered into the water.

           INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - LATER

           Surrounded by safety divers, Laura works underwater to 
           install a solar panel much like the one we saw her install in 
           space. She’s great at it. A real pro.

           INT. NASA’S NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LAB - LATER

           Laura stands outside the pool, water pouring from her suit. 
           The lab workers slowly go to work removing the equipment--

                                 PAXTON (O.S.)
                        I want you to know we’re watching 
                        you, Pepper.

           -- Laura jumps, startled, accidentally elbowing one of the 
           lab workers. Laura doesn’t even notice. Paxton’s stepped up 
           beside her, smiling.

           Laura’s utterly terrified by Paxton’s words.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        We know what you’ve been up to.

                                 LAURA
                        Excuse me?

           Laura’s sheet white. Breathing heavy. Seconds away from a 
           panic attack.
                                 PAXTON
                        Your training. You’re really 
                        pushing yourself. You’ve made a lot 
                        of fans around here.

           Laura’s face fills with relief.

                                 LAURA
                        I do what I can.

                                 PAXTON
                        Well, nothing’s official, yet, but 
                        we’re sending the Atlantis up next 
                        August. I’ll be putting in my 
                        highest recommendation to have you 
                        on the crew.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 PAXTON
                        Of course, Pepper. It’s my 
                        pleasure.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PEPPER KITCHEN - EVENING

           Laura stands in the kitchen, washing dishes. She’s wearing 
           that pair of yellow, rubber dish washing gloves. There are a 
           ton of dishes, huge piles of them, and Laura works alone.

           That isn’t to say she’s alone, Wally sits at the kitchen 
           table, playing solitaire and chewing dip. Ruth’s beside him, 
           reading her book. Drew’s building Legos with the boys, or, 
           rather, they’re destroying Lego structures together.

                                 LAURA
                        Ruth, dry for me.

           Ruth doesn’t even look up from her book.

                                 RUTH
                        Do I have to?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, you have to.

                                 RUTH
                        Ugh. Nobody else has to help.

           Ruth rolls her eyes as she stands--
                                 LAURA
                        Fuck it, then. Neither do I.

           -- the rest of the family (aside from Wally, who just smiles 
           and keeps at his game of solitaire) looks at Laura in stunned 
           silence as--

           -- she drops an unfinished plate in the sink and storms off, 
           grabbing the phone as she goes.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura pulls the gloves from her hands and dials a number.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARK’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Mark sits in a recliner, drinking a beer. MARY GOODWIN, his 
           wife, sits at the kitchen table, helping their daughters with 
           homework when--

           -- the phone rings.

                                 MARK
                        Got it!

           Mark grabs the portable and answers.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                        Hey. It’s, uh, me.

           There’s a flicker of panic on Mark’s face, it’s the closest 
           we’ve ever seen him to losing his cool. But, after just a 
           second, he’s got a handle on this:

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, Pete. Give me a second, I’ll 
                        go check on that.

           Mark stands from the recliner, motions to Mary that he’ll be 
           in the garage, and hurries from the room.

           INT. MARK’S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mark makes it safely to his garage before saying anything.
                                 MARK
                        What are you doing? This is my 
                        house. Mary could have answered the 
                        phone. My daughters could have 
                        answered the phone.

                                 LAURA (O.S.)
                        I know. I know. I’m sorry. I just 
                        needed to hear your voice. I feel 
                        so alone here. It’s like, I can’t 
                        stand being around them and I’m a 
                        terrible person--

                                 MARK
                        Laura, you’re not a terrible 
                        person. You’re an incredible 
                        person. You hear that? You’re the 
                        sexiest, smartest, most incredible 
                        woman I’ve ever met. And you’re not 
                        alone.

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura looks as if she might melt.

                                 LAURA
                        Really?

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Really.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re not mad at me?

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Of course not. How could I be mad 
                        at you when it’s so good to hear 
                        your voice?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Don’t be. Just be careful.

                                 LAURA
                        I will.

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        I’m here for you, space girl. I’ll 
                        always be here for you. See you 
                        tomorrow.
           Mark hangs up. Laura stays in the laundry room, enjoying this 
           moment alone.

           INT. NASA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Paxton stands in front of a crowd of astronauts and other 
           NASA personnel. Behind him, stands a line of recruits. This 
           is the latest NASA class-- what will eventually be the final 
           class of shuttle astronauts-- and they look both terrified 
           and full of pride.

                                 PAXTON
                        Now, I know you all remember what 
                        this was like, being up here. You 
                        were nervous and proud, unsure of 
                        what you were really getting 
                        into...

           As Paxton’s speech continues, Laura, Mark, Jim, and Pete 
           stand in the back of the room. They’re the cool kids, 
           whispering amongst themselves:

                                 JIM
                        Fuck me. Don’t they already have 
                        more of us than they could ever 
                        send up there? Now they’re just 
                        rubbing it in my face.

                                 LAURA
                        It’ll be fine, Jim. You’ll get your 
                        shot.

                                 JIM
                        Yeah, a self-inflicted shot. 
                        Straight to the temple.

                                 PETE
                        Jesus.

                                 JIM
                        Look at them. They’re all so...

                                 LAURA
                        Young.

                                 PETE
                        Clueless.

                                 JIM
                        ...hungry. It’s disgusting.
                                 MARK
                        I don’t know, that one on the end 
                        there’s pretty cute.

           And now we see, there at the end of the row of new recruits, 
           is Erin Fleetwood. She is young, hungry, and, yes, a little 
           clueless.

           Laura clocks the way Mark is openly gawking at Erin.

                                 PAXTON
                        ...don’t forget you’ve worked your 
                        entire lives to get here. You join 
                        a brave, select group. You have 
                        made your families and country 
                        proud. But your work is far from 
                        over. In fact, it’s only just 
                        begun.

           INT. NASA MEET AND GREET - LATER

           Over boxed wine and terrible cheeses, the new recruits mingle 
           and chat.

           Laura, holds a plastic cup of wine and searches for Mark and 
           the others. She has no luck. They’re not here, were smart 
           enough to take off and avoid moments like--

                                 PAXTON (O.S.)
                        Laura Pepper...

           Laura turns to find Paxton standing beside Erin.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to introduce you to Erin 
                        Fleetwood. Pepper’s one of the best 
                        we’ve got.

           Laura and Erin shake hands.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 PAXTON
                        I’ve assured Fleetwood here that 
                        you’ll be looking out for her these 
                        next few weeks. Help her learn the 
                        ropes around this place.

                                 LAURA
                        Of course, sir.
                                 PAXTON
                        Well then, I’ll leave you to it.

           With that and a nod, Paxton’s off, leaving Laura and Erin 
           alone. It’s an awkward moment for both of them. But then, 
           Erin gives it a shot:

                                 ERIN
                        Pretty crazy, huh?

                                 LAURA
                        What’s crazy?

                                 ERIN
                        All of this. We’re astronauts. It 
                        still feels unreal.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, don’t celebrate just yet. 
                        You’ve got a long ways to go before 
                        getting up there, where the real 
                        work is.

           Laura walks off without another word.

           INT. FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY

           Laura stands in front of Ed and Neil’s classroom. The boys 
           are their usual, fidgety selves but obviously proud of their 
           mother.

                                 LAURA
                        Now, I was about your age during 
                        the Apollo 11 mission. Does anyone 
                        know what the Apollo 11 did?

           Neil and Ed’s hands shoot up but they’re the only ones. It’s 
           been a long time since the moon landing. 

           Still, Laura looks around for a hand other than her sons’ but 
           they get impatient, calling out:

                                 ED
                        They landed on the moon!

                                 LAURA
                        That’s right, Ed.

                                 NEIL
                        And Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin 
                        were the first men to step foot on 
                        the moon and you watched on TV when 
                        you were a little girl.
                                 ED
                        And that’s when you knew you wanted 
                        to be an astronaut.

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, boys. That’s true. But why 
                        don’t we give someone else a 
                        chance? Someone who doesn’t see me 
                        every single day. What do you say 
                        guys, any questions out there?

           A few hands shoot up across the room. But, Laura focuses on a 
           chubby girl in the back, with thick glasses. The girl, 
           SIMONE, barely gets her hand up before Laura points to her.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        What’s your question, sweetheart?

                                 SIMONE
                        What’s it like up there, in space?

                                 LAURA
                        That’s a very good question. First 
                        off, it’s terrifying.

           Laura’s answer continues as we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Laura’s getting her stuff together to leave for the day, when 
           she finds a card on her desk. It’s nothing special, just a 
           piece of folded over yellow paper.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        But, you hardly even notice because 
                        you’re so busy. So, caught up in 
                        how amazing it all is.

           Inside, the card reads: “Thinkin’ bout you, space girl.”

           Laura reads the card and blushes.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Mark picks up his wedding ring from the dresser in a cheap 
           hotel. He buttons his shirt as Laura, still naked in bed, 
           watches him with a smile.
                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        Your heart’s always racing. And 
                        every time you wake up you have to 
                        remind yourself you’re not 
                        dreaming. This really is your life. 
                        You’d be one of the luckiest people 
                        on Earth but you’re not even on 
                        Earth anymore.

           Before leaving, Mark walks over and kisses Laura on the 
           forehead.

           INT. PEPPER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Laura quietly enters her house. It is dark, everyone gone to 
           bed. She slowly tip toes her way up the stairs.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        There’s this picture of Earth-- 
                        actually, it’s a picture of a lot 
                        of things-- called “The Pale Blue 
                        Dot.” It was taken by the Voyager 
                        1, a space probe, from six billion 
                        kilometers away.

           INT. LAURA AND DREW’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Laura climbs into bed beside Drew, who is still awake but not 
           saying anything.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        And the picture, it just looks like 
                        a bunch of lines, in all these 
                        different colors. Except, in one of 
                        the lines there’s this little blue 
                        dot. That’s Earth. It’s just this 
                        tiny, little speck. You might not 
                        even notice it if you didn’t know 
                        to look.

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Laura and Mark lay in the bed of Mark’s truck with blankets 
           and pillows. They look up at the stars.

                                 LAURA (V.O.)
                        And sure, we can’t get that far out 
                        there. Not yet, anyway. We’re just 
                        a couple hundred miles out, but you 
                        can still see the Earth. You can 
                        see all of it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAURA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Everything that existed, everyone 
                        you know, everyone you ever will 
                        know, they’re all just on this 
                        little circle you can cover up with 
                        your thumb.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT.  FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 LAURA
                        It all seems so insignificant. And 
                        you feel lost and alone and more 
                        vulnerable than ever before. It’s 
                        the greatest feeling I’ve felt in 
                        my entire life. It’s a feeling that 
                        makes it all worth it.

           Simone and the rest of the class-- especially, Ed and Neil-- 
           look at Laura in stunned silence. They have no idea what she 
           was talking about. 

           It’s gone completely over their heads.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Uh, sorry about that. How about 
                        you? You have a question?

           Laura points to a boy in the front row, ROY, whose hand isn’t 
           up. It doesn’t matter, though. No one’s hand is up after 
           that.

           But, after a moment’s thought, Roy does have a question:

                                 ROY
                        How do you take a dump in space?

           INT. DREW’S CAR - NIGHT

           Drew drives as Laura applies makeup.

                                 DREW
                        So what are they like?

                                 LAURA
                        What do you mean, what are they 
                        like? They’re like regular people. 
                        They’re like me.

           Drew shrugs.
                                 DREW
                        It’s just, I don’t know. I never 
                        get to hang out with your work 
                        friends. What if they don’t like 
                        me?

                                 LAURA
                        They’ll like you. Why wouldn’t they 
                        like you? Everyone likes you.

           Laura closes the visor mirror. The car goes dark.

           INT. SUGARLAND LANES - EVENING

           Drew steps up to the line. He closes his eyes. He takes a 
           deep breath. He throws his ball--

           -- straight into the gutter.

           The astronauts from the previous bowling trip-- with the new 
           addition of ERIN-- give Drew some weak pity claps.

                                 MARK
                        Tough break, pal.

           Erin steps up to select a ball.

           Drew slumps down next to Laura, doing his best to look 
           miserable. 

                                 DREW
                        Of course I’d look like an idiot in 
                        front of a bunch of astronauts.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re doing fine.

                                 DREW
                        Thanks for lying.

           Laura is busy, focused on Erin. Mark is giving her pointers, 
           his arms wrapped around her waist as he demonstrates the 
           proper form.

                                 LAURA
                        No problem.

           Laura watches Erin throw the ball down the lane--

           A PERFECT STRIKE. Mark goes wild.
                                 MARK
                        Oh my God, you’re a natural! I need 
                        a double high-five here.

           Mark gives Erin an enthusiastic two-handed high five before 
           turning to the others--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        This girl’s amazing, right?

                                 LAURA
                        Beginner’s luck.

           INT. SUGARLAND LANES - LATER

           Post game, Pete pours beers for the astronauts and Drew. 

           Pete raises his glass.

                                 PETE
                        I’d like to propose a toast to a 
                        son of a bitch we all know. Mark-- 
                        somehow, someway, the bosses 
                        upstairs saw fit to send you back 
                        up. 

                                 JIM
                        And if they have any sense they’ll 
                        leave you there.

           Everyone laughs.

                                 PETE
                        To Mark. Safe trip, buddy. Come 
                        back soon.

           The group clinks their glasses together. 

           INT. SUGARLAND LANES - LATER

           It’s nearly closing time at Sugarland but the astronauts are 
           still there, enjoying themselves. But one person is 
           noticeably absent: Drew.

           He sits alone at one of the lane tables, clearly ready to 
           leave.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        This seat taken?

           Drew turns to find Mark, a big smile on his face.
                                 DREW
                        Go right ahead. 

           Drew takes his jacket from the seat to make room for Mark.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        So you’re going up for a second 
                        time, huh?

           Mark tips his glass back, emptying the last of his beer as he 
           holds up three fingers.

                                 MARK
                        Third.

                                 DREW
                        And what does your wife think?

                                 MARK
                        My wife?

                                 DREW
                        Yeah. You’re married, right? You 
                        have kids?

                                 MARK
                        Two girls.

                                 DREW
                        And yet you’re still going back? 
                        Even if it means leaving them here, 
                        unsure if you’ll make it home?

                                 MARK
                        I’ll make it home.

                                 DREW
                        You don’t know that. Not for sure. 
                        It’s dangerous. Do you even care? 
                        Do you even know what’s it’s like 
                        for the rest of us?

           Mark laughs. Hard. He puts his arm around Drew, leans in 
           close.

                                 MARK
                        You’re not jealous of your wife, 
                        are you, chief?

                                 DREW
                        What? That’s ridiculous.
                                 MARK
                        But you want her to give up her 
                        dreams though, don’t you?

           Drew’s stunned by this. 

           Does Mark know something? Was that just a lucky guess?

           Drew tries not to let on what a chord Mark’s just struck, 
           stammering--

                                 DREW
                        Of course not.

                                 MARK
                        Good. You couldn’t stop her if you 
                        tried.

           Mark shoots Drew a wink just as--

           -- Laura walks up, eyeing the two of them suspiciously. 

                                 LAURA
                        You two sure look like you’re 
                        getting along.

                                 DREW
                        Swimmingly.

                                 LAURA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MARK
                        You. We were both just saying how 
                        swell you are.

           Laura’s not sure if this is the case but she’s going to have 
           to let it slide as Erin walks by. Mark calls out to her--

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Hey newbie, quick question.

                                 ERIN
                        Yes?

                                 MARK
                        You think your man would be upset 
                        if you went to space?

                                 ERIN
                        I’m single.

                                 MARK
                        You don’t say.
           Erin gives a demure shrug and moves along. Mark turns back to 
           the Peppers, slapping Drew on the back.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Now that’s the real shame right 
                        there, brother.

           Laura grimaces, getting up from her seat.

                                 LAURA
                        I need some air.

           Mark watches her go from the corner of his eye:

                                 MARK
                        So Laura tells me you’re a computer 
                        programmer?

                                 DREW
                        IT services.

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, I can see that.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUGARLAND LANES - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura’s outside, angrily smoking a cigarette when--

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Hey, space girl.

           She turns to find Mark, giving her his biggest smile.

           Laura folds her arms. She takes a step back.

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t.

           Mark stops. He puts his hands up to indicate he won’t come 
           any further.

                                 MARK
                        You’ve got yourself a swell guy in 
                        there.  

           Laura turns away. She’s in no mood to hear this. 

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Really. Drew’s great. A bit of a 
                        square but, you know, super nice 
                        guy.
                                 LAURA
                        Fuck you.

                                 MARK
                        I wish you would.

           Laura chuckles-- it surprises her.

                                 LAURA
                        Right here?

                                 MARK
                        What? In the parking lot?

           Laura shrugs. Mark laughs.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        You’re all right, Pepper. But 
                        that’s a little crazy. Even for me.

                                 LAURA
                        So why are you really out here?

           Mark places his hands loosely around Laura’s waist.

           He draws her close.

                                 MARK
                        I’m here for us, babe. Let’s get 
                        away for a few days.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s not that easy. I can’t just 
                        get up and go.

           Mark runs his fingers through Laura’s hair. He shoots her a 
           wink.

                                 MARK
                        You’ll figure something out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LAURA FLOATING IN THE OCEAN...

           EXT. BEACH - COCOA BEACH, FLORIDA - DAY

           She’s on her back, in a bathing suit. Her eyes are closed and 
           there’s a smile on her face. She’s at peace.
           EXT. COCOA BEACH, FLORIDA - LATER

           Laura makes her way to shore. The beach is full of families 
           on vacation. Kids splash and women tan and Laura walks 
           through all of it, until she reaches...

           ...Mark, sitting in a lawn chair and reading a Tom Clancy 
           novel.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, there.

                                 LAURA
                        Hey.

           Laura plops down on a towel beside him.

                                 MARK
                        What do you say, space girl? Do my 
                        back?

           Mark holds out a bottle of suntan lotion. Laura can’t believe 
           it. Even here, on vacation together, this is such a brazen 
           display.

                                 LAURA
                        Really?

           Mark shrugs.

                                 MARK
                        Flight suit’ll be a real bitch with 
                        a sunburn.

           Laura takes the suncreen but holds back. There’s a condition.

                                 LAURA
                        Only if you come swimming.

                                 MARK
                        Not happening.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re a butt.

           Laura squirts some sunscreen on her hand and starts rubbing 
           it on Mark’s back.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t get it. You’re going to 
                        outer space in a few days. You know 
                        that, right? What’s so scary about 
                        the ocean?
                                 MARK
                        Everything. Up there, you’re all 
                        there is. It’s just you and the 
                        ship and your crew. That’s it. I 
                        know exactly what to expect. I’m in 
                        charge.
                             (motioning to the ocean)
                        Who knows what’s out there? I’m not 
                        giving up that much control.

           Laura smiles, enjoying this.

                                 LAURA
                        Well, if you ask me, maybe you 
                        could stand to give up a little 
                        control every once in a while.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - EVENING

           Laura sits in the bathroom, on her cell phone. She’s dressed 
           up, in the same tight little dress from her reunion. She’s 
           talking quietly, to Ruth back at home.

                                 LAURA
                        Sweetheart, I know. But, your dad 
                        can handle this. He knows what to 
                        do. I told him what to get for you 
                        and I’ll be back tomorrow. 

           Laura listens for a moment.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Ruth, you’re a woman now. I know 
                        this is scary and confusing but 
                        it’s all completely natural. You 
                        have to realize it’s nothing to be 
                        upset about. You’re getting older 
                        and more mature and I couldn’t be 
                        more proud of you, okay?

           She listens again, while looking herself over in the mirror.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Okay. I miss you and I love you 
                        very much.

           With that, Laura hangs up the phone. She gives herself a 
           final once over before heading out into the room...

           ...where Mark sits in his socks and boxers drinking a beer.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        You’re not ready.
                                 MARK
                        I’m ready. I was planning on going 
                        like this. What do you think?

           Mark stands, models his outfit. Laura smiles and shakes her 
           head.

                                 LAURA
                        I like it. Not sure what everyone 
                        else will say but I like it.

                                 MARK
                        They’ll say you’re the luckiest 
                        girl in town.

           He pulls her in close, wrapping his arms around her, and 
           starts unzipping her dress.

           Laura slaps his hand away.

                                 LAURA
                        I am. But we still need to get 
                        going. We’ll miss our reservations.

           But Mark doesn’t give up. He grabs her again, with a 
           mischievous grin.

                                 MARK
                        Reservations? I’ve got news for 
                        you, space girl. People like you 
                        and me, we don’t need reservations.

           Mark kisses Laura passionately, falling back on the bed.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - ORLANDO - LATER

           Their reservations long past, Laura and Mark fall back on a 
           tangle of sheets. They’re naked and sweaty.

           Laura turns to Mark, watches him as he dozes. It’s possible 
           he’s fallen asleep right there. She holds her breath, 
           building up the courage to say something.

           When she blurts it out, it’s hardly even a whisper...

                                 LAURA
                        I love you.

           ...there’s no way Mark heard it. But then--

                                 MARK
                        Yeah, yeah. I love you, too.
           -- he answers, without even opening his eyes. He wraps his 
           arm around her and pulls her closer.

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - ORLANDO - NIGHT

           Laura and Mark, now fully dressed, enter a crowded 
           restaurant. The place is packed. There’s no way they’re 
           getting a table.

           But, Mark, as always, is unflappable. He walks straight to 
           the HOSTESS.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, there. Now, I know my lovely 
                        date and I have missed our 
                        reservation-- missed it by a long 
                        shot-- but, something came up-- 
                        official NASA business-- and I was 
                        wondering if you could, maybe, find 
                        a spot for us.

                                 HOSTESS
                        NASA business?

                                 MARK
                        Yep. NASA business. I’m Mark 
                        Goodwin, and I’m piloting the Space 
                        Shuttle Endeavour next week.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Really?

                                 MARK
                        Scout’s honor.

           The Hostess look around, obviously charmed. She leans in to 
           Mark and whispers:

                                 HOSTESS
                        Let me see what I can do.

                                 MARK
                        Thank you. It’d mean a lot.

           The Hostess picks up the phone. Mark gives her his biggest 
           smile before turning and walking back to Laura.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Watch this.

                                 LAURA
                        There’s no way.
                                 MARK
                        Just watch.

           And then, as if on cue, the MANAGER approaches, carrying two 
           menus.

                                 MANAGER
                        Mr. And Mrs. Goodwin?

                                 MARK
                        Yes.

           Laura smiles at this, thrilled that Mark hasn’t corrected the 
           manager. If only for the night, they’re a married couple. She 
           could not be happier.

                                 MANAGER
                        If you’ll just follow me, your 
                        table is ready.

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - ORLANDO - LATER

           Laura and Mark don’t just have a table. They have the best 
           table in the entire restaurant, with a giant window, 
           overlooking the city.

           They’re picking at dessert-- small, fancy, decadent things. A 
           long way from the Chili’s brownie ice cream sundae.

                                 LAURA
                        This has been really nice. All of 
                        this.

                                 MARK
                        I did all right, didn’t I?

                                 LAURA
                        More than all right.

           Laura drops her fork. She’s about to burst into tears.

                                 MARK
                        What’s wrong?

                                 LAURA
                        It’s just...I don’t know what I’m 
                        going to do when you’re gone.

                                 MARK
                        Oh, space girl. You’ll do what you 
                        always do. You’ll fight. That’s 
                        what I like about you. You’re a 
                        fighter.
                                 LAURA
                        I know. I know. And it’s only 
                        twelve days. We can email each 
                        other and...
                             (noticing a look on Mark’s 
                              face)
                        What?

           Now Mark sets his own fork down. He’s not sure how to say 
           this...

                                 MARK
                        Actually, I’ve been meaning to 
                        bring that up. I don’t think I can 
                        put you on the contact list. 

                                 LAURA
                        Why not? You can put anyone on 
                        there. No one will read it--

                                 MARK
                        -- It’s too risky. No one can know 
                        about this. You know that. We could 
                        be court marshalled. Paxton would 
                        toss us both out on our asses. Is 
                        that what you want?

                                 LAURA
                        No.

                                 MARK
                        It’s just twelve days. And, when I 
                        get back, we’ll figure something 
                        out. We won’t be a secret for long.

           This is what Laura needed to hear. She regains her composure.

                                 LAURA
                        Promise?

                                 MARK
                        Promise.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - BANANA RIVER VIEWING SITE - DAWN

           Laura, Drew, the kids, and Wally are gathered near the large 
           countdown clock at the Banana River Viewing Site on Cape 
           Kennedy.

           It’s the closest any civilian is ever allowed to a launch.
           As the friends and family look on, we hear the sounds of 
           mission control:

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        T-minus 4 minutes, stand by for 
                        readiness check.

                                 MISSION FLIGHT DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        Roger.

           Laura watches the kids as they chase each other around.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        Cooling systems: Go/no go?

                                 MISSION FLIGHT DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        Go.

           CHHHHHHH!!

           Wally, cracking open an early morning can of beer. 

           Laura turns to him, surprised.

                                 LAURA
                        Dad, where’d you get that?

           Wally opens his jacket to show what’s left of a six pack 
           dangling from his jacket pocket.

                                 DREW
                        A little early for that, isn’t it?

           Wally waves Drew off.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        Fuel cells: go/no go?

                                 MISSION FLIGHT DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        Go.

           Laura reaches out to her father. But, instead of taking the 
           beer from him. She grabs one for herself.

           CHHHHHH!

                                 DREW
                        Real great example you’re setting.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        Life support: Go/no go?

                                 MISSION FLIGHT DIRECTOR (V.O.)
                        Go.
           Laura takes a long pull on the beer. Drew just shakes his 
           head.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        T-minus ten seconds.

           The large clock rolls backward from ten seconds. The crowd 
           gathered starts chanting numbers backward--

           Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. 

           The twins are beyond excited.

                            ED
                                                          NEIL
           FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO--
                                              FIVE. FOUR. THREE. TWO-- 

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        --ONE. Main engines start.

           The countdown clock rolls to ZERO. 

           In the distance, a BRIGHT FLASH of smoke and light as 
           Endeavour’s twin booster rockets ignite.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        Liftoff.

           Endeavour arcs skyward, the flames from its engines 
           reflecting on the waters of the Banana River. 

           At this early hour, the light cast shines brighter than the 
           rising sun. Monstrous plumes of smoke and steam, thousands of 
           feet long, billow from the launch site.

                                 WALLY
                        Jesus Christ.

           The friends and family of Endeavour track the arc of the 
           space ship as it breaks free from the influence of the 
           planet.

           The astronauts travel at speeds most humans will never know, 
           covering a mile every three seconds as they’re propelled by 
           over one million pounds of fuel.

           The crowd cheers-- how could they not?

                                 NEIL
                        Whoa. So cool!

           Laura-- eyes fixed on the orbiter-- starts to cry. 

           Drew puts his arm around her, drawing her close.
                                 DREW
                        It’s okay, babe. You had a good 
                        run.

           She doesn’t stop crying.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - SHUTTLE SIMULATOR - DAY

           SIRENS BLARING.

           Laura, intense yet detached, is at the helm of the simulator--

           RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

           Calmly, she turns back to the crew member responsible--

           -- ERIN.

                                 LAURA
                        Erin. It’s you.

           A SECONDARY ALARM SOUNDS.

           Erin thumbs through her book too quickly, dropping it to the 
           ground.

                                 ERIN
                        Shit. Sorry sorry sorry.

                                 LAURA
                        We’re dying right now. Our families 
                        will never see us again. 

                                 ERIN
                        Okay. I hear you.

           Erin starts hitting buttons. Nothing is working.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re fucking up. There’s not 
                        gonna be anything left of us to 
                        bury.

                                 ERIN
                        Okay!

           Erin flips one last switch and--

           The simulator shuts down. Failure.

           Laura is furious:
                                 LAURA
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 ERIN
                        I’m sorry--

                                 LAURA
                        You’re not properly prepared. When 
                        you’re sloppy, people die. Do you 
                        understand?

                                 ERIN
                        Yes.

                                 LAURA
                        This job is a privilege. You need 
                        to show it the respect it deserves.

           Laura unbuckles her harness and leaves the simulator, 
           brushing past a dumbfounded Paxton.

                                 PAXTON
                        What the hell was that?

           Laura storms by without answering.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura lumbers down the hallway, fists clenched.

           Behind her, a door flings open: Erin.

                                 ERIN
                        Wait!

           Laura stops. She takes a deep breath.

                                 LAURA
                        If you want an apology it’s not 
                        happening.

           Erin catches up to Laura.

                                 ERIN
                        It’s not that. I’m the one who 
                        should apologize.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 ERIN
                        You’re right. I was fucking up in 
                        there. But I’ll get better.
                                 LAURA
                        You’ll have to.

                                 ERIN
                        I will. I can do this. I’m sure of 
                        it. And a big part of that is you.

           Laura doesn’t answer. 

           She works to hide the grimace that twists on her face every 
           time she hears Erin speak.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been to space. You have a 
                        family. You’re strong and smart and 
                        everything I want to be. I know I 
                        can get there because I have you to 
                        look up to. Thank you so much for 
                        that.

           Erin moves in for an awkward hug. Laura does her best to 
           reciprocate, grateful that nobody else is around.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m not that great.

                                 ERIN
                        You are. You’re not afraid to go 
                        after what you want. I wish I could 
                        do that.

           Laura hugs her back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           DREW’S FACE: DEVASTATED. RAGGED.

           INT. PEPPER HOME - NIGHT

           He looks like he’s had the wind knocked out of him.

           Drew and Laura sit on opposite ends of their kitchen table, 
           unable to look at each other, unable to speak.

           And then--

                                 DREW
                        How long?

           Laura wipes a tear from her eye. She shakes her head.
                                 LAURA
                        Does it even matter?

                                 DREW
                        I want to know how long you’ve let 
                        me look like a fucking idiot.

                                 LAURA
                        Drew--

                                 DREW
                        I guess your life here with a 
                        husband-- with your children-- just 
                        wasn’t good enough? 

                                 LAURA
                        Stop it.

                                 DREW
                        Maybe if I was an astronaut, huh? 
                        Like your new boyfriend? 

                                 LAURA
                        It’s not that.

                                 DREW
                        I deserve to know why, dammit.

                                 LAURA
                        Because he gets me, Drew.

                                 DREW
                        And I don’t?

                                 LAURA
                        No. You don’t. I wish you did. But 
                        you don’t. Mark-- he knows what 
                        it’s like.

                                 DREW
                        What does that even mean?

                                 LAURA
                        I just don’t want this anymore. I’m 
                        sorry. I’m really sorry.

                                 DREW
                        Sure you are.

           Drew looks away-- he can’t take this.

                                 LAURA
                        I’ll leave.
           Drew doesn’t respond. Laura reaches for his hand, but he 
           pulls it away.

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           Ed and Neil sit in the backyard, playing with action figures 
           and toy trucks. Laura’s crouched beside them, watching.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s kind of like when you went to 
                        space?

                                 LAURA
                        Kind of like that. But you’ll still 
                        get to see me. I’m going to be much 
                        closer.

                                 NEIL
                        Okay.

                                 LAURA
                        Ed?

           Ed doesn’t answer. He doesn’t even look at his mother. He 
           just crashes two trucks into each other over and over again.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        I love you both.

           Laura stands. She looks at her boys before heading back 
           inside.

           But, just as she reaches the sliding glass door--

                                 ED (O.S.)
                        Mom.

           -- Laura turns to find Ed running towards her, something 
           clutched in his hand. He holds it out to her.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           He hands Laura the Venom action figure.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        To remember us.

           Laura grabs her son in a huge hug.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh, Ed. How could I ever forget 
                        you?
           INT. RUTH’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruth’s been crying. She’s standing on her bed, using a broom 
           to try and scrape the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars from her 
           ceiling.

           There’s a knock on her door before Laura quietly enters.

                                 LAURA
                        Ruth?

           Ruth turns on her mother, yelling at her with all the pre-
           teen fury she can muster:

                                 RUTH
                        Get out!

                                 LAURA
                        Sweetheart, I have to tell you 
                        something.

                                 RUTH
                        I know what you have to tell me. 
                        You’re leaving, right? I already 
                        know.

                                 LAURA
                        You’re right. I am leaving.

           Ruth drops onto the bed. She lies on her back, looking up at 
           her now blank ceiling.

           Laura walks over and sits beside her.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s because Dad doesn’t want you 
                        going back to space, isn’t it? 
                        You’re leaving because he doesn’t 
                        want you to be an astronaut 
                        anymore.

                                 LAURA
                        Who said that?

                                 RUTH
                        I can hear you arguing. I live 
                        here, too.

                                 LAURA
                        Ruth, listen. This isn’t your 
                        father’s fault--

           -- Ruth sits up at this, angry once again.
                                 RUTH
                        I know it’s not his fault. It’s 
                        your fault. You’d rather go up 
                        there than be here with us. You 
                        went up there and you changed and 
                        now getting back there is all that 
                        matters to you.

           Laura’s stunned. This whole time, she’s felt crushingly alone 
           in this house, completely misunderstood. But her daughter 
           gets her.

           Ruth knows exactly who Laura is. And she hates her for it.

                                 LAURA
                        Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Go. Get out. You want to leave so 
                        badly just do it.

           Ruth climbs off the bed and starts collecting the plastic 
           stars from the ground. She’s done with her mother and doesn’t 
           even look up as Laura exits.

           EXT. PEPPER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura sits in her car, unable to believe this is all 
           happening. The Venom action figure is on the seat beside her.

           She looks up at the house-- her house, until just moments 
           ago. It is quiet, with just a few lights on. There’s no sign 
           of the drama going on within its walls.

           Laura takes a deep breath and tries to calm herself. She 
           tries to make herself as blank and hard to read as the house. 
           But, as she turns the ignition it may be too much to handle. 

           She’s about to break entirely as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A “WELCOME HOME DADDY!” BANNER

           EXT. GOODWIN BACKYARD - DAY

           Mary and the girls are throwing a welcome back barbecue for 
           Mark. It’s huge.
           There are kids splashing in the pool, men smoking cigars and 
           drinking beers, and women setting out potato salad and 
           deviled eggs.

           And there, over by the grill, is the man of the hour. Mark’s 
           surrounded by neighbors, manning the grill. He seems to have 
           completely recovered from being in space only a few days 
           before.

                                 MARK
                        The secret’s the charcoal. You need 
                        exactly twenty-two medium-sized 
                        charcoals lit in a chimney starter. 
                        You let those burn to eighty 
                        percent grey and then spread it 
                        evenly.

           Mark’s wife, Mary, walks past, carrying a plate of lettuce, 
           tomatoes, and onions. She runs her hand across her husband’s 
           shoulders as she passes him.

                                 MARY
                        Easy there, honey. Don’t push 
                        yourself too hard.

                                 MARK
                        You know me, babe. No other way I 
                        can push myself. But I feel great. 
                        Going up there, it’s like a 
                        vacation for me. A nice, relaxing, 
                        break from the grind down here. Now 
                        who wants a burger? 

           Everyone does, especially from an American hero. Mark’s 
           thrilled. There’s nothing he likes more than an audience.

           As he hands out the last of the burgers, someone speaks out 
           behind him:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hope you saved one for me.

           Mark turns to find--

           -- Laura, all dressed up and holding a potted African violet.

                                 LAURA
                        Welcome home, Commander.

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mark pokes his head into the garage to make sure the coast is 
           clear before pulling Laura in with him.
           As soon as they’re alone, with the door closed, Laura goes in 
           for a kiss. She’s hungry for him, reaching to unbutton his 
           jeans. Mark pushes her away.

                                 MARK
                        Stop. What the hell are you doing 
                        here?

                                 LAURA
                        I left him.

                                 MARK
                        What?

           Laura hands Mark the African violet, as if it were the key to 
           her explanation. 

                                 LAURA
                        You’re back and I brought you this 
                        and I left Drew so that we can be 
                        together.

           Mark looks at the potted flower in his hand, the full extent 
           of this finally crashing down on him.

                                 MARK
                        Laura, you can’t do this. Not here. 
                        I have kids. I have a family to 
                        think about.

                                 LAURA
                        I have a family, too. And this is 
                        going to be hard on all of them. 
                        I’m not going to pretend it won’t 
                        be. But they’ll get over it. We’ll 
                        form a bigger, stronger family 
                        because of it. You and me. We’ll be 
                        a family. Together.

                                 MARK
                        It doesn’t work like that. We can’t 
                        just snap our fingers and fix all 
                        of this. We have to be careful. Our 
                        jobs are at risk. Our lives. It’s 
                        going to take time.

           Laura’s stunned. This possibility hadn’t even occurred to 
           her. She and Mark were supposed to be on the same page with 
           everything. He was the only person who understood her.

                                 LAURA
                        How much time?
                                 MARK
                        I don’t know. More than this. We’ll 
                        talk about it, I promise. But not 
                        now. Right now you have to get out 
                        of here.

           Mark gives Laura the African violet back and heads for the 
           door.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ever do this again.

           He leaves. 

           INT. GOODWIN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura rushes through the house, on the verge of tears. She’s 
           desperate to get out before the water works start but the 
           house is one of those big, suburban monstrosities-- square 
           footage and dining nooks at every turn. But, then--

           -- there’s the door. Laura rushes for it, the potted African 
           violet clutched to her chest. As Laura grabs for the knob--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Laura?

           Laura turns to find Erin, in a cute outfit and ponytail, 
           smiling at her. Before Laura can say anything, Erin grabs her 
           in another big hug.

                                 ERIN
                        How about that Mark? He really is 
                        something else, isn’t he?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry. I have to go.

           With that, Laura hurries from the house, leaving a stunned 
           Erin behind.

           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Laura lugs her suitcase into her father’s place. 

           He is dozing on the couch, a baseball game playing on TV.

           MARTINA, Wally’s live-in nurse, turns off the TV.

                                 MARTINA
                        I’ve just set him down for a nap. 
                        Do you need a hand?
                                 LAURA
                        No. Thank you. I think I’ve got it.

                                 MARTINA
                        I’m so sorry about what happened. 
                        Husbands can be garbage sometimes.

                                 LAURA
                        Actually, this was my choice. I 
                        wanted this.

           Martina isn’t quite sure how to take this--

                                 MARTINA
                        Oh. I see. Well good for you.

           Laura takes a look over at Wally. He’s snoring gently.

                                 LAURA
                        Listen, why don’t you take the rest 
                        of the day off? I can handle him.

           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - LATER

                                 WALLY
                        Get your fucking hands off of me!

           Wally’s eyes well up.

           He’s on his back as Laura works to change his adult diaper.

                                 LAURA
                        Dad, please. I’m just trying to 
                        help.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m not some God damned baby!

           But Wally doesn’t have the fight in him. 

           Exhausted, he relents, letting his daughter change his 
           diaper.

           He stares daggers at Laura as he lies there, helpless.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - EVENING

           Laura unpacks her suitcase in the apartment’s guest room.

           She unfolds a couch bed, when something catches her eye--
           -- an old box, dusty and stuffed under an end table. The word 
           MARGARET is Sharpied on the side in thick black lettering.

           Laura opens it up.

           It’s a box of her mother’s things. Her wigs. Her old 
           pictures. Notebooks. Pressed flowers.

           Laura hasn’t seen these things in years. She chokes up, 
           searching for more when--

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Wally is in the doorway. He is furious.

                                 LAURA
                        Why haven’t I seen this, dad? 

                                 WALLY
                        Those belong to your mother.

                                 LAURA
                        How long have you kept these?

                                 WALLY
                        Get out of here. Those aren’t for 
                        you. You left your family. If your 
                        mother was still here she’d be 
                        ashamed of what you’ve become.

                                 LAURA
                        Daddy--

                                 WALLY
                        I said get out.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

           Laura carries the African violet down the row of offices 
           until she reaches the door marked “GOODWIN”.

           She stops, listening just outside the door. Is that laughter 
           coming from inside?

           When she can take it no more, Laura opens the door, revealing-
           -

           INT. MARK’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mark and Erin, a little too close.
           Mark looks up, surprised--

                                 MARK
                        Laura!

           There is something suspicious about Mark and Erin’s body 
           language.

                                 MARK (CONT’D)
                        I was just helping Erin out with a 
                        few things. She’s having trouble 
                        with some of the launch protocols.

                                 LAURA
                        Ah, it can be tough.

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah. But you guys have been so 
                        helpful. I know I’ll get the hang 
                        of it eventually. Thanks, Mark. See 
                        you around.

           Erin rushes past Laura, keeping her eyes low.

           Mark closes the door behind her. He turns to Laura. 

                                 MARK
                        I was worried about you, space 
                        girl.

                                 LAURA
                        I thought you might want this.

           She hands him the African violet. He takes it and places it 
           on his desk.

                                 MARK
                        I wanted to tell you, you did the 
                        right thing. Drew’s a nice enough 
                        guy but he doesn’t deserve you. 
                        You’re special.

           He leans in, kissing her. He reaches to unbutton her blouse 
           but--

           -- Laura stops him.

                                 LAURA
                        No. Not here. I want to be with 
                        you. I mean, really be with you.

                                 MARK
                        I know. I want to be with you, too.
                                 LAURA
                        So take me out to dinner. Be with 
                        me. There’s nothing stopping you.

                                 MARK
                        You know that’s not true. We have 
                        to figure out--

                                 LAURA
                        So let’s do it. Let’s figure it 
                        out. You’re right, we are special. 
                        There’s nothing we can’t do.

           Mark looks at his watch.

                                 MARK
                        Look, I’m headed to Orlando for a 
                        few days. My flight leaves in just 
                        a few hours. Work stuff. We’ll talk 
                        about this when I get back.

           Now it’s Laura’s turn to step in and take hold of Mark. All 
           her earlier restraint disappears at the possibility of losing 
           him again.

                                 LAURA
                        Don’t go.

                                 MARK
                        I have to. It’s training. I’m 
                        serving my country. You understand.

           Laura’s heart sinks. She’s heard that line before and it’s 
           enough to make her panic inside.

           She hides it. She smiles.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - GYM - LATER

           Laura sprints around the NASA running track. There are others 
           working out, but not like this--

           She doubles over, gasping for air. She covers her head with a 
           towel, hobbling over to the nearest trash can to puke when--

                                 PAXTON
                        I thought I’d find you out here, 
                        Pepper.

           Her breath becoming regular, Laura looks up to find Paxton 
           wrapping up a workout of his own.
                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        I have good news. It’s official: 
                        you’ve been selected for crew duty. 
                        You’re going back to space.

           Laura eyes widen.

                                 LAURA
                        Atlantis?

                                 PAXTON
                        That’s right.

                                 LAURA
                        Who else?

                                 PAXTON
                        Let’s see-- Gary Shalimar. Jeffrey 
                        Watts. That new cadet Erin 
                        Fleetwood. Oh, and we’ve got a 
                        cosmonaut hitching a ride, too--
                        Sergey-something. You’ll love him.

           At the mention of Erin’s name Laura’s face blanks. There’s a 
           hole in her gut-- she looks ill.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        You seem disappointed.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s not that. I just don’t know 
                        what to say.

           Paxton unlaces his sneakers, packing them into his duffel 
           bag.

                                 PAXTON
                        Say thank you. I know how badly you 
                        wanted this.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER GYM - SHOWERS - LATER

           Laura stands motionless under the shower head in the Johnson 
           gym. Hot water streams over her.

           She starts to cry. She tries to stop herself but she can’t. 

           Desperate for it all to stop, she makes a fist--

           --and PUNCHES the shower wall.
           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - NIGHT

           After hours at NASA. 

           Late enough that everyone has gone home-- that is, almost 
           everyone.

           Laura stalks the hallways of the Johnson Space Center, making 
           her way toward Mark’s darkened office. 

           Even if he wasn’t in Florida, Mark isn’t exactly the midnight-
           oil sort. It doesn’t seem like anyone is inside-- Laura tries 
           the handle.

           Locked.

           Undeterred, Laura reaches into her pocket, pulling out two 
           PAPERCLIPS. She bends them into a tension wire and lockpick, 
           goes to work--

           -- CLICK--

           -- the door opens.

           INT. MARK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Laura slips in, gently shutting the door behind her.

           Mark’s office is the same as it ever was-- more man-cave than 
           workspace. Laura takes a moment to enjoy it.

           There are two framed pictures-- Mark with his family and Mark 
           with the Endeavor crew-- Laura picks up the picture of the 
           crew. She runs her finger across it. This is what she wants. 
           This is all the family she'll ever need.

           She goes through Mark's drawers but doesn't find much more 
           than a few Playboys and a giant tub of cheese puffs.

           Finally, Laura boots up Mark's computer. Laura eats a few 
           cheese puffs as she leans in, pecking at a few keys. 

           Something catches her eye: an email, sent from Mark.

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        Hey Space girl--

           Laura stops. She checks the address-- it’s meant for ERIN.

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        Last night was amazing.
           She searches Mark’s mailbox for messages containing Erin’s 
           name.

           There are hundreds. The African violet sits in Mark’s trash 
           can, where he apparently dumped it.

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        Hey babe. Miss you. Miss your body. 
                        Hope you’re having fun in space.

           INT. ERIN’S CAR - DAY

           We FLASH to images of Erin and Mark undressing each other. 
           The two of them having sex in the back of Erin’s car.

           The affair playing out before Laura’s eyes.

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        Hey Space girl, it’s great out 
                        here. Would be better if you were 
                        here with me. Gonna try and take 
                        some naughty photos. You should 
                        send some too-- sure gets lonely up 
                        here.

           EXT. MARK’S BACKYARD - DAY

           We flash to Mark’s Barbecue. Mark is sticking his hand under 
           Erin’s shirt. She leans into him. In the distance, we see his 
           wife preparing the grill.

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        Space girl, Can’t wait for our 
                        weekend away. Orlando’s great. 
                        You’re going to love it. There’s 
                        this restaurant I’ll take you to. 
                        Super fancy. No one can get a 
                        reservation. But I know a guy.

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Erin and Mark lay in the bed of Mark’s truck with blankets 
           and pillows. They look up at the stars.

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        Here’s my flight info. There’s a 
                        two hour layover in Atlanta-- gross-
                        - but I should be getting in at two 
                        in the morning. Can’t wait to see 
                        you.
           INT. MARK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

           Laura clicks through email after email, until finally:

                                 MARK (V.O.)
                        Hurry, space girl. I want to be 
                        with you forever.

           Laura is devastated.

           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Laura paces in her bedroom. The door locked. She’s frantic, 
           breathing heavily. Unsure what to do. Unsure what any of this 
           means.

           The emails are all there, printed out and wrinkled from so 
           much handling. The box of Laura’s mother’s things is all 
           spread out across the bed. She’s pulled the African violet 
           from Mark’s trash, it’s sitting there on the bed, too.

           Laura pulls her cell phone from her pocket. She dials a 
           number, waiting a few rings before an answering machine picks 
           up:

                                 ERIN (V.O.)
                        You’ve reached the office of Erin 
                        Fleetwood. I will be out of the 
                        office for--

           -- Laura hangs up. She throws her phone across the room.

           Laura walks over to her wall, where she’s pinned up a number 
           of printed out maps. The maps form the Southeast coast of the 
           US, Texas to Florida.

           There are routes drawn on the map. First, a flight path in 
           red-- Houston to Orlando, with a layover in Atlanta. “Travel 
           time: 756 minutes. ETA: 04:32”

           The other routes are less certain. They’re are driving 
           routes, drawn in black marker. Most of them are abandoned 
           halfway, ETAs and travel times crossed out here and there.  

           But now, finally, she might have it. Laura plots a route, 
           cutting across six different states. She does a quick 
           calculation before writing:

           “ETA: 4:30” Bingo.

           If Laura wants to make it, she’ll have to leave right away. 
           There is not a second to spare.
           INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura rushes through the apartment, grabbing various items. 
           Wally sits in his recliner, watching television and ignoring 
           her as she grabs--

           -- a pair of hunting knives--

           -- the drilling hammer--

           -- the dish washing gloves--

           -- all the cash in her father’s safe--

           -- the handgun from his closet--

           -- and, finally, her mother’s wig.

           Her arms full, Laura stops behind her father. She leans over 
           him, kisses the top of his head, and heads out.

           On her way, she passes a box of Depends adult diapers. She 
           grabs them, just in case..

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Laura sets all her supplies in the back of her SUV and slams 
           the door shut. She hurries to the driver’s side, whistling to 
           herself.

           She is ready for this.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LAURA’S SUV - LATER

           “You Oughta Know” blasts, the SUV’s speakers pushed to their 
           limit. Laura smokes a cigarette and stares out towards the 
           horizon. The gun is out on the passenger seat.

           Laura’s in the zone, flying down the highway. 

           Nothing can stop her. Nothing can get in her way, until--

           -- sirens flash.

           Laura looks up at her rearview mirror. There’s a squad car 
           behind her, signaling for her to pull over.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Laura comes to a stop at the side of the highway. The POLICE 
           OFFICER, hefty and drowsy, climbs out of his car and slowly 
           ambles over.

           When, the officer finally reaches the SUV to find Laura, 
           window down and offering her best smile.

                                 LAURA
                        Sorry ‘bout that. Got lost in my 
                        thoughts, I guess.

           The Officer isn’t charmed.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Licence and registration. 

           Laura hands him her paperwork. Her glove compartment is 
           closed and there’s no sign of the gun--

           -- except, there it is, beneath the seat, in Laura’s left 
           hand!

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        You in a hurry?

                                 LAURA
                        A bit.

           The Police Officer spits, taking his time, proving a point. 
           He’s got no where to be--

           -- beneath her seat, Laura cocks the handgun--

           -- she’s gone this far. She has to get to Florida. Nothing 
           can get in her way--

           -- she puts her finger on the trigger-- 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Navy, huh?

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, sir.

           The Officer smiles, completely unaware of his close call.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I’m a Marine. Afghanistan. Two 
                        tours. Where’d you serve?

                                 LAURA
                        Lower-Earth Orbit.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Huh?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m an astronaut.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You don’t say. What’s it like up 
                        there?

           Laura looks up at the stars above.

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t even know. I guess, it’s 
                        the only place where anything makes 
                        sense.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I know exactly what you mean.

           He hands back Laura’s licence and registration without giving 
           her a ticket.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Just try and take it a little 
                        easier. This ain’t no space 
                        shuttle.

           The Police Officer pats the SUV’s roof before heading back to 
           his squad car.

           Laura lets out a deep breath. She pulls her finger from the 
           trigger, eases off the hammer of her gun. She tosses the gun 
           on the passenger seat, shocked at what she was about to do.

           But there’s no time for reflection. She has to hit the road, 
           she’s already off schedule.

           She quickly turns the ignition and takes off once again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AIRPORT GARAGE - NIGHT

           And we’re back. Laura’s on the roof, running around, staring 
           up at the stars above.

           Sirens are closing in on her. 

           She drops her gun in a garbage can. 

           She pulls her 8-inch Gerber folding knife from her boot, 
           tosses that in another. 
           At a third trash can, she removes her mother's wig and, after 
           a moment's hesitation, tosses it.

           There's no direction to where she's going. She's not making 
           any sort of escape. She's just zig-zagging across the parking 
           lot, tossing evidence in trash cans as--

           -- four police cars arrive. The officers pull their guns and 
           Laura stops. 

           She puts her hands in the air. She doesn't put up a fight.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. - INTERROGATION ROOM - ORLANDO - NIGHT

           Laura is locked in a small interrogation room, seated across 
           from Detectives Cain and Lopez. She is withdrawn, still in 
           shock.

           Her wrist is handcuffed to a tabletop rail. Next to her is a 
           full cup of coffee, unsipped.

           The detectives fire off questions in rapid succession--

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        What were the white gloves for?

                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ
                        What about the tubing?

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        The cash?

                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ
                        Who is Mark Goodwin?

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        Were you trying to kidnap Erin 
                        Fleetwood?

                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ
                        Were you trying to kill Erin 
                        Fleetwood?

           Laura stares down at the table. She doesn’t answer.

           Detective Cain sighs. She softens her tone, leaning in--

                                 DETECTIVE CAIN
                        Laura, I need you to answer me.

           Laura looks up.
                                 DETECTIVE CAIN (CONT’D)
                        How do you know Erin Fleetwood?

                                 LAURA
                        NASA. We’re both astronauts.

           The detectives exchange a glance.

                                 DETECTIVE LOPEZ
                        You’re shitting me.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - BREAK ROOM - MORNING

           Commander Paxton is busy with a coin-operated machine in the 
           NASA breakroom. It’s a temperamental machine, and only really 
           gets going after a few good bangs on its side and a healthy 
           stream of expletives.

           He slaps the machine a couple of times.

                                 PAXTON
                        Piece of junk.

           As if on cue, the machine sputters to life. Coffee drips 
           haphazardly into a styrofoam cup.

           Coffee in hand, he starts to sip when DIRK, a subordinate, 
           rushes in--

                                 DIRK
                        We’ve got trouble.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Dirk leads Paxton down another long NASA corridor to an open 
           office.

           Several NASA employees are crowded around a television.

           We see the ORLANDO POLICE CHIEF giving a press conference. 
           The news headline reads: 

           LAURA PEPPER ASTRONAUT KIDNAPPING SCANDAL

                                 REPORTER
                        Is it true that Pepper will be 
                        charged for attempted murder?
                                 POLICE CHIEF
                        We’ll be having a full briefing 
                        later today. Thank you.

           The chief leaves the lectern as cameras FLASH and reporters 
           jockey to get one last question in.

           The newscast cuts from the press conference to an ANCHOR. She 
           breathlessly delivers the sensational headline:

                                 ANCHOR
                        A sexy space love triangle? It 
                        happened. We’ll be bringing you all 
                        the latest on this breaking story.

           The program cuts to some fancy onscreen graphics: NASA LOVE 
           TRIANGLE. 

           Paxton holds his head in his hands.

                                 PAXTON
                        Oh no. No no. No no no no.

                                 DIRK
                        They’re calling her the “Diaper 
                        Astronaut”

           Paxton looks like he’s going to be sick.

                                 PAXTON
                        This is bad.

           RING-RING. RING-RING.

           A phone is heard in the adjacent office.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        That’s my phone.

           Other phones start ringing throughout the building.

           It’s a sound they’re going to have to get used to.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LA QUINTA INN - ORLANDO - AFTERNOON

           Erin sits alone in her Orlando hotel room, blinds drawn. The 
           TV is on mute, but she still watches. She sees her picture 
           flash onscreen.
           Over and over, they replay the story in exhaustive detail--
           playing frame-by-frame the security cam footage of a crazed 
           Laura stalking her through the baggage claim.

           RING RING

           Erin SHRIEKS at the sound of her phone.

           Cautiously, she picks it up. She hears a familiar voice:

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        Erin?

                                 ERIN
                        Where are you? Why aren’t you here?

           EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           Mark is hunched over a payphone outside Terminal B at the 
           Orlando Airport. Intercut as needed.

                                 MARK
                        I’m catching a flight home. This is 
                        bad. I don’t know what that maniac 
                        said to you but none of it’s true.

                                 ERIN
                        She seemed so sad.

                                 MARK
                        Fuck her. We gotta worry about 
                        ourselves.

                                 ERIN
                        Why are you going back then? Why 
                        aren’t you here with me.

           Mark hesitates.

                                 MARK
                        I gotta get there before Mary finds 
                        out.

                                 ERIN
                        I thought you were going to leave 
                        her anyway. We’re supposed to be 
                        together.

           A graphic reading “WHO IS LAURA PEPPER?” flashes on the 
           television.
                                 MARK
                        I know. It’s going to happen. This 
                        just isn’t the right time. We’ve 
                        got our careers to think about our--

                                 ERIN
                        Stop.

                                 MARK
                        What?

                                 ERIN
                        Just go.

           Erin hangs up the phone back on the receiver. She reaches for 
           the TV remote, turning off the news coverage.

           She sits alone in the darkness. She cries.

           INT. GEORGE BUSH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING

           Mark steps off his flight in Houston. The paparazzi are 
           already there, waiting as the gate, taking his picture.

           EXT. GOODWIN HOUSE - LATER

           Mark pulls up to the house in his truck. A news crew waits 
           outside.

           So does Mary. She sits on the steps in front of the house. 
           She’s obviously been crying. Mark walks up to her, his arms 
           open. But she’s not having it:

                                 MARY
                        You’re not coming in. You don’t 
                        live here anymore.

                                 MARK
                        Baby, please. Let me explain.

                                 MARY
                        You’ve done enough explaining, 
                        Mark. This was supposed to be over 
                        with. I’m done giving you second 
                        chances.

           With that, Mary turns and walks into the house, locking the 
           door. Mark’s left, surrounded by cameras, his trademark smile 
           nowhere to be found.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LAURA’S CELL - EVENING

           The heavy door to Laura’s holding cell slides open. A guard 
           leads Paxton in. He sees Laura-- tiny, afraid. 

           Neither can speak, neither has the words for this. Paxton 
           takes a seat next to Laura on the cell bench.

                                 PAXTON
                        You’ve caused me an awful lot of 
                        trouble here, Laura. 

                                 LAURA
                        I didn’t mean to.

                                 PAXTON
                        Doesn’t matter. Damage is done. I 
                        suppose I’d tell you how against 
                        NASA’s code of conduct this all 
                        was, if we had one.

                                 LAURA
                        We didn’t have a code of conduct?

                                 PAXTON
                        We will from here on out. They’re 
                        drafting it up as we speak.

                                 LAURA
                        I guess you can thank me for that.

           Paxton laughs. He can’t help it.

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        Sir, I just wanted to let you know 
                        that I am eager to put this all 
                        behind me. I want to go back to 
                        training for my mission.

                                 PAXTON
                        Laura-- that won’t be happening. 
                        You have to know that.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 PAXTON
                        I mean you’re out. We can’t have 
                        you at NASA. Not after this.

           Laura is devastated. Her eyes well with tears.
                                 LAURA
                        Please. Don’t do this to me. It’s 
                        all I have.

                                 PAXTON
                        I’m sorry. It’s already done. 
                        You’re out. Goodwin’s out. 
                        Fleetwood. All three of you, this 
                        whole sordid love triangle.

           Laura collapses. She can no longer hold it in, gasping an 
           anguished cry. 

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever heard of the 
                        “Overview Effect”?

           Laura shakes her head.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes, when people go up there, 
                        when they’re able to see the Earth 
                        in full view-- no borders, no 
                        boundaries, no context-- it changes 
                        their outlook on everything. 

           Paxton pauses-- he looks around Laura’s tiny cell. The small, 
           barred window. The guard a few paces away watching their 
           conversation. It breaks his heart.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        You’re different, Laura. In a way 
                        not many people can understand. You 
                        came back changed, didn’t you?

           Laura nods.

                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        Seeing it all up there. You must’ve 
                        felt--

                                 LAURA
                        Alone.

           Paxton gives Laura a pitying look. They’ve known each other 
           for so long. He doesn’t want to have to say this--

                                 PAXTON
                        I’m sorry. I know it won’t be much 
                        comfort but I think this is for the 
                        best for you. I don’t think going 
                        back there would do you any good.

           Laura wipes away her tears with the back of her hand. 
                                 PAXTON (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Laura.

           Paxton waves for a guard to let him out. Laura never sees him 
           again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ORANGE COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Laura, wearing an orange jumpsuit, is led before a JUDGE in a 
           cramped courtroom.

           The gallery is choked with onlookers.

           Laura takes a seat next to her ATTORNEY, a stressed-looking 
           public defender.

           The Judge glances at his notes, muttering into a microphone.

                                 JUDGE
                        State of Florida versus Laura 
                        Pepper. Does counsel have a plea?

           Reflexively, Laura begins to answer. She’s quickly cut off by 
           her legal counsel--

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Not guilty, your honor.

                                 JUDGE
                        Noting the defendant’s plea of not 
                        guilty. I’m setting bail at thirty-
                        five thousand dollars. Court will 
                        resume three weeks from today. 

           The Judge pounds his gavel as Laura is led from the courtroom 
           by two uniformed police officers.

           EXT. ORANGE COUNTY COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Laura’s led by the police down the courthouse steps. They are 
           immediately swarmed by a pack of reporters shouting 
           questions.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Were you going to kill her Laura?
                                 REPORTER #2
                        Do you blame NASA? Do you believe 
                        you’re suffering from post-
                        traumatic stress?

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Tell us about the diapers! Did you 
                        use them?

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Are you aware that the Navy is 
                        planning a dishonorable discharge?

           Laura ignores the questions. The roar of them begins to fade, 
           replaced with Neil Young’s “After the Gold Rush,” which plays 
           over the following:

           INT. RUTH’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Neil and Ed zip themselves into sleeping bags on the floor in 
           Ruth’s bedroom. Drew’s there, watching his kids get ready for 
           a night of indoor camping.

           Ruth is on her bed, reading her book.

                                 DREW
                        This okay?

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah. It’ll be fun.

           The boys smile and turn on an electric lantern. Drew hits the 
           lights and leaves them to it.

           INT. LAURA AND DREW’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Drew enters the empty bedroom. He takes a seat on the bed and 
           puts his head in his hands.

           EXT. ALASKAN WILDERNESS - EVENING

           Mark, now with a full beard, wanders the woods. He has a 
           walking stick, a large backpack, and a compass. He’s walking 
           a trail, taking it slowly. There is no hint of his smile.

           He is a man without a purpose and this is the most lost we 
           have ever seen him.
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Erin sits alone at a booth, eating dinner--

           -- and then she jumps in fright, turning her head--

           -- but there is no one there. She returns to her food, tries 
           to convince herself that there is no one there but it will be 
           a very long time before she feels safe anywhere.

           INT. NURSING HOME - NIGHT

           Wally sits with a number of other elderly tenants around a 
           television. It’s tuned to Fox News and the story, the only 
           story that’s been in rotation for the last month, is Laura’s.

           An OLD WOMAN gives him a pitying look but Wally won’t have 
           it:

                                 WALLY
                        At least she did something with her 
                        life. She went to space. What’d 
                        your kid ever do?

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAYTIME

           Paxton stands behind a lectern speaking to a large crowd. 
           He’s joined onstage by a long row of seated recruits.

           Behind him, projected on a huge screen, is the new NASA CODE 
           OF CONDUCT.

                                 PAXTON
                        And we think that these new 
                        regulations will help usher NASA 
                        into its next phase-- one that 
                        adheres to the standard of ethics 
                        at the heart of this organization.
                        And with that, I’d like to 
                        introduce our new class of 
                        astronauts. I know they’ll make us 
                        proud.

           Paxton leads the room in a round of applause for the young 
           cadets seated.

           He gestures for them to stand up.

           He tries to hide it, but he looks nervous.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LAURA’S CELL - EVENING

           Laura is led into her cell by a GUARD. He undoes her 
           handcuffs.

                                 LAURA
                        Thank you.

           The guard SLAMS the door shut.

           For the first time in a long time, it is silent.

           Laura sits down on her jail cot. She stares out the window-- 
           the moon is rising above the horizon line. 

           A tear streams down her cheek. Then another. And another.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - DAY

           We’re close in on Laura’s face. She’s nervous. Apprehensive.

           We hear the crackle of a headset:

                                 MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Main 
                        engines start.

           Liftoff.

           Still on her face: We see her recoil slightly as the 
           thrusters kick in. 

           The ground below her dropping away with each passing second. 
           The initial shock fading, giving way to elation.

           At long last, Laura smiles.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
