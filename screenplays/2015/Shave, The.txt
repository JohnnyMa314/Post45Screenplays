           A few tics of silence to read...

                        “Halfway through the journey of our 
                        life, I came to myself in a dark 
                        wood, for the straight way was 
                        lost.” -- Dante’s Inferno.

           Then -- BANG! 

           A GUN SHOT smashes it.  

           Animal ROAR from human lungs.

           HARD OPEN ON

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Pay close attention.

           “Apartment” is generous. A room. A decrepit room. 

           Gutted walls. A barred window. Torn up linoleum floors. A 
           stick with deep teeth marks next to a recently fired pistol. 

           And splayed out at the center --

           A MAN DYING. One hand cuffed to a toppled-over chair.

           Pool of crimson expanding around him, draining from his 
           thigh. He sinks his teeth into his undershirt and rips a 
           swath. Fashions a makeshift tourniquet around his thigh and -- 

           SQUEEZES!

           Suppressed MOANS of agony...                                  
           This is not a man who shows weakness.                        
           Not even when alone.

           PUSH IN towards him. Slowly. His bloodied fingers shake a 
           cellphone free from his pocket.

           Suddenly, an omniscient VOICE: MALE, rugged, introspective --

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        You believe in omens? 
                             (beat)
                        The past foretelling the future?

           A SECOND MAN’S VOICE. Tired, quiet, but with conviction --
                                 SECOND MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        I do.

           Keep PUSHING. The Man dials three numbers. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Back in Kandahar, ten minutes 
                        before hell broke loose, I did a 
                        final sweep of that bomb-makers hut 
                        and found his kid hiding under the 
                        kitchen in a little panic room... 

           MOS, the Man mumbles into the phone...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        He had pieces of dirty cloth jammed 
                        into his ears and he was flipping 
                        through a picture book of Aesop’s 
                        Fables... 

           The phone slips through his wet-with-red fingers... 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        He looked so focused. Like he was 
                        willing the whole fuckin world to 
                        just... disappear.

           It hits the ground.                                         
           So does his face.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        When I sat down next to him he was 
                        stopped at a fable called, The Wolf 
                        and the Crane. You know it?

           Beat.

                                 SECOND MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Tell it to me.

           OFF SCREEN -- the metal CLINK of a zippo opened. A flame 
           HISSES and CRACKLES at the end of a cigarette. 

           EXHALE...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        An insatiable wolf scours the 
                        forest day and night. Eats anything 
                        with a heartbeat... 

           Look at him for a moment. The face loosening. The eyes 
           glazing. The pain becoming more abstract than real -- 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Scum of the earth dive bar.                                 
           We’re in the farthest back corner where --

           Two MALE FIGURES, undefined in shadow, SPEAK at a table.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Then one day, half-way through a 
                        feast of little does, he gets a 
                        thighbone lodged deep in his throat 
                        and starts choking to death.

           Big drag. The BURNING CHERRY an ember eye. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        So he stumbles through the forest 
                        begging for help, and offers a 
                        handsome reward to whoever can 
                        dislodge the bone. 
                             (beat)
                        Nobody obliges him, of course. The 
                        other animals wanna see him burn.

           The BURNING CHERRY floats at us through the dark as the 
           Figure speaking leans forward. A strip of dirty orange bar 
           light catches his face and we’re looking at -- 

           The same Man from the opener: VIRGIL MARX, early 40’s, clean 
           shaven, eyes full of a certain brutal and hardened wisdom.

           He takes another drag. 

           Exhales...

                                 VIRGIL
                        At last, a brave Crane takes up the 
                        challenge. He opens the Wolf’s jaw, 
                        sinks his neck down his throat as 
                        far as it'll go and digs around 
                        with his beak... Moments later and--

           Virgil TAPS his Zippo against a shot glass twice --

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        -- he finds the bone and wrenches 
                        it out. Naturally, the Crane asks 
                        for his promised reward. And you 
                        know what the Wolf says? The 
                        duplicitous fucker.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        “You've stuck your head down a 
                        Wolf’s mouth and taken it out 
                        again, Crane. Isn't that reward 
                        enough?” 

           Long beat. Then, the Second Voice again --

                                 SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                        What was the moral?

           Beat.

                                 VIRGIL
                        I didn’t get a chance to find out.

                                 SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                        Guess.

           Virgil almost smiles. Considers...

                                 VIRGIL
                        Depends, I suppose.

                                 SECOND MAN (O.S.)
                        On what?

           A long suck from his cigarette.

                                 VIRGIL
                        On whether you think the Crane’s 
                        trying to save the Wolf...  
                             (beat)
                        ... Or the bone.

           Second Man, still in shadow, moves a bulging envelope across 
           the table. It catches the dirty light. Packed with bills.

           Virgil cashes his cigarette. Then flips through the bill-
           edges with his thumb. Covetously. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Either way, it’s usually just about 
                        a large pile of money, isn’t it. 

           He pockets the envelope. Pounds the shot glass and stands.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Second the jaws open, I stick my 
                        neck down as far as it’ll go. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           EXT. SMALL RUNDOWN HOUSE - DAY

           Bad part of town. Dense, metal-grey sky. Lightening makes 
           blue gashes in the distance. Low growl of THUNDER.

           Virgil walks aggressively up an unkempt lawn. In the light of 
           day he looks like the kind of man who has the capacity for 
           good and evil in equal measure. In one fluid motion --

           CRACK! He kicks open the door and draws a GUN to find --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A haze of smoke. Two BLACK MEN (20’s) sit on a couch passing 
           a pipe. All eyes look up: red, frantic, high as kites. Notice 
           three PLAGUE DOCTOR MASKS strewn across the coffee table.

           POP! -- Virgil FIRES a round into the ceiling. O.S BARKING 
           erupts. He scans his aim around the room.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Where is he?!

           Guy 1 lunges at Virgil, who SLUGS him hard. Drops like lead. 

           BARKING builds...

           Here comes THE DOG. A Pit Bull. Mouth gnashing. Tearing down 
           the hallway. It lunges just as --

           Virgil turns. Sends a bullet into its belly. 

           Canine SHRIEK. It whimpers into a ball.

           Virgil catches his breath. Eyes insane now.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        WHERE THE FUCK IS HE?!

           A scared finger points. Virgil dashes down a dark hallway.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Pines?! 
                             (beat)
                        Pines?!

           He stops at a closed door. Listens... 

           FRANTIC COMMOTION. A GLASS SHATTERS.

           Virgil KICKS it in to find --
           DOUGLAS PINES (18, black, tatted-up, short dreads) halfway 
           out the window. A young WOMAN lies in bed, sheets shielding 
           her naked body. 

           Virgil beelines it for Douglas and wrenches him back inside. 
           SLUGS him hard across the face. Woman SCREAMS. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been looking for you, Pines.

           Another SLUG. Blood drains freely from a subsequent gash on 
           his forehead. 

           Guy 2 appears in the doorway. Virgil hears him and swivels.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                             (gun aimed)
                        Back the fuck up!

           Back to Douglas, who spits a wad of blood in his face.                    
           Virgil’s eyes widen. Pure, uncut rage. 

           Virgil wipes the red spit from his face, clutches Douglas’ 
           shirt collars and leans in close. Notice the DOG TAGS that 
           drop through his collar and dangle around his neck. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        You think you can fuck with Sueños 
                        Norteños and go on breathing? 

                                 GUY 1 (O.S.)
                        He’s working for the spicks!

           Virgil swivels.

                                 VIRGIL
                        They pay more than you cheap-ass 
                        mother fuckers. Back up!

           Back to Douglas. He pulls out a POLICE BADGE. Like a knife.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                             (sotto, vicious)
                        You see this? Do you know what this 
                        means, you little non contributing 
                        zero? It means that I’m God and 
                        you’re my creation. You live and 
                        die at the mercy of my whim. You 
                        understand me?

           Douglas’ eyes struggle to focus.

           A beat. Then Virgil shakes Douglas to the fucking core --
                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. VIRGIL’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           VIRGIL JOLTS AWAKE IN BED

           Sweat-drenched. Trembling. Back from some terrible place.

           And months have passed... 

           Evidenced by the large, grey-peppered beard masking his face.

           The room is bleak and practically empty.

           Several panting breathes, then Virgil drags himself to the 
           edge of bed. Wipes his hands down his face. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON a fifth of whiskey poured into a glass. Next to it --

           A PHOTOGRAPH of a stoic-looking middle-aged WOMAN.         
           Next to her: a smiling BOY.

           With his left foot dragging slightly against the floor, 
           Virgil limps with his drink to the --

           BATHROOM

           -- Where he runs a shower. Steps in. Sips his drink and 
           silently implores the warm water to clean away bad dreams.

           Impressive scars mark his thigh and stomach.

           BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Virgil puts on a nice suit, but his disheveled face cancels 
           any elegance. Finished, he bores into his reflection in a 
           full length mirror. The thousand-yard stare of a war vet.

           LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Virgil limps to the front door. This room, too, is empty. 
           Leaning beside it -- a cane, which he takes.
           EXT. FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Virgil makes his slow, three-legged way down the cement path 
           that cuts his abandoned lawn in half...

           AT HIS CAR, he abruptly stops. Goes ashen. ANGLE ON --

           THE WINDSHIELD, where a PLAGUE DOCTOR MASK is leaning against 
           the glass, its ghoulish, beaked-face staring vacantly at him.

           He picks it up and looks around... honest-to-God fear... 
           privy to some warning the mask implies.

           CRACK. He snaps it in half. It breaks easily. He limps to the 
           curb-side garbage can and tosses the pieces in.

           INT. OLD BEAT-UP STATION WAGGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Packed with boxes. A life on the move. Virgil gently places 
           the PHOTOGRAPH of Sarah and The Boy on the passenger seat. 

           He takes the wheel. Squeezes. Knuckles white. A beat.

           The old engine COUGHS to life and we CUT TO --

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Packed, sweaty, closing in on us. 

           Benches creaking, hushed chatter, paper rustling. Every sound 
           vivid and crisp between these chamber walls.

           Virgil stands with his lawyer, blank, unreadable. That 
           thousand-yard stare. And then --                                                                                      

           The HEAD JUROR (female, 40) stands. Clears her throat.

                                 HEAD JUROR
                        In the matter of the people of the 
                        State of California vs. Detective 
                        Virgil Jon Marx... 

           Huge silence. You could drop a world through it. Virgil turns 
           his head slightly to the right. In the background --

           A GRIEVING FATHER 

           GEORGE PINES. 50. A stoic look masking impossible pain.

                                 HEAD JUROR (CONT’D)
                        ... We the jury, in the above and 
                        titled action...
           The two men lock onto each other. Electric and inscrutable.

                                 HEAD JUROR (CONT’D)
                        ... Find the defendant...

           Virgil turns away. Closes his eyes.

                                 HEAD JUROR (CONT’D)
                        ... NOT GUILTY of the crime of 
                        murder upon Douglas Luther Pines.

           He re-opens them. Long beat. See his face. Is that 
           disappointment there? Or something like it.

           And in the background --

           The Father is gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGE’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON 

           The dead man’s father. Indomitable. His presence fills up any 
           room he occupies.

           He’s at the dining room table. Spine arched. Elbows planted. 
           Fingers linked. The head held low.

           We find him mid-prayer --

                                 GEORGE
                             (sotto)
                        ... Thou art the living fountain of 
                        hope. So great and so availest, 
                        that whoso would have grace and has 
                        not recourse to thee, would have 
                        his desire fly without wings...

           Tired beat. Prayers don’t come so easily anymore...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        In Thy name, we gather around the 
                        table for this meal.

           He unlinks his fingers and --

           CUT WIDE

           To reveal that the table is set for two. George on the right. 
           An absence on the left. He’s even prepared two plates.
           George eats in silence. Occasionally looks up at the empty 
           seat... the plate of untouched food... the person not there.

           He almost says something... stops. That would make it real. 
           He stands, clears both plates and walks back to the --

           KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Where he places them beside the sink and -- 

           Freezes. 

           He grips the counter and bows his head.                 
           Douglas is everywhere and nowhere.

           If George were a different sort of man, this would be his cue 
           to cry. But he’s not a different sort of man.

           George doesn’t get sad. He gets angry --

           And -- CRASH! -- as he sweeps his arms across the counter and 
           sends the plates SHATTERING against the wall.

           Beat.

           He grips the counter again... chest rolling...

           Then, slowly, regains control of his breath. 

           EXT. BARBERSHOP - NEXT MORNING

           George slowly approaching.

           It’s old school. Spinning candy cane Barber’s pole and all. 
           Above the entrance, a SIGN: 

                                 “PARADISO CUTS”

           He opens a padlock and the outer gate CLANGS upward. 

           INSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lights stutter to life and George prepares his shop -- 

           Smocks folded over chairs.                               
           Combs, buzzers, brushes, straight-edge razors lined up on the 
           counter. Sterilizing disinfectants poured into small jars.   
           A leather blade sharpener unfolded.                  
           Latherizing machine stocked and turned on.                  
           He brews a pot of coffee and pours himself a cup.  
           Finished, he walks to the front window.

           Turns the blinds and a sharp morning light enters the store. 
           Prison-bar shadows on his face. See him.

           Long beat. He sips his coffee.

           Then turns around and gets back to the project of living.

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON A LOCAL FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR

           Talking at us. That mildly heroic tone they have --

                                 FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR
                        After two months of dramatic twists 
                        and turns... 

           B-ROLL FOOTAGE of Virgil wading through manic REPORTERS down 
           the courthouse steps...

                                 FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        ... in one of the most convoluted 
                        murder cases in recent history...

           We slowly PULL OUT of a TV, on which Virgil steps into his 
           car, camera desperately trying for a decent shot of his face.

           PULL OUT further -- the TV is mounted on the wall of a DINER. 
           The Anchor’s VOICE dissolves into the white noise.

           We PAN 180 degrees to find --

           INT. MA AND PA DINER - CONTINUOUS

           A place where everyone knows your name.

           Virgil sits at a booth. A leper in the room. Everyone in the 
           diner is hyper conscious of his presence. 

           Feeling it, Virgil takes a final sip of coffee, drops a ten 
           spot and stands. Looks around. 

           Beat. 

           Then, to them all -- 

                                 VIRGIL
                        Anybody feel like sharing?

           The place freezes. Patrons and Waiters. Only kitchen sounds.
           Radio silence. 

           Then he turns away and all eyes trace him as he leaves. 

           The door DINGS louder than ever.

           INT. BEAT-UP STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

           Virgil. Implacable stare. Drives through a beat-up 
           neighborhood. STREET SCENES pass through his window as if in 
           slow motion: 

           A FAMILY on a front porch.                                   
           KIDS drawing figure-8’s with hand-me-down bikes.                                           
           A group of YOUNG MEN gathered on a street corner.  

           EXT. BARBER SHOP - MINUTES LATER

           Virgil’s car parks across the street from “PARADISO CUTS.”

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He looks at the Barber Shop through the passenger side 
           window. Runs his fingers through his long and dense beard.

           Beat.

           He lites up a cigarette and --                              
           Watches...                                               
           Thinks...                                                 
           Braces himself for something...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           TWELVE PLUS PEOPLE chatting boisterously, some waiting for a 
           cut, others just there to socialize. 

           Some inane DAY TIME TALK SHOW plays on a TV in the 
           background. Here we find --

           GEORGE AT WORK  

           Giving VINCE (huge build, 20’s) a haircut.

           Suddenly, the talk show cuts to commercial and our Local 
           Female News Anchor returns...
                                 NEWS ANCHOR’S VOICE 
                        In an exclusive interview with 
                        Channel 7 News last night, Marx’s 
                        mother...

           At which point everyone shuts up and turns to the TV, on 
           which a sickly OLD WOMAN with a gnarly scar over her larynx 
           speaks (MOD) with an ELECTRIC BUZZER to her throat.

                                 NEWS ACHOR’S VOICE
                        ...showed her continued support for 
                        her son's claim of innocence --

           But George is already at the TV and --

           ZAP she’s gone.

           CLOSE ON the SCREEN as George turns it off. 

           The front door suddenly DINGS... 

           Now, reflected in the blank TV glass, is Virgil Marx. 

           George turns. Slowly. Head first. Then body.

           A palpable HUSH. Then --

           Vince is on his feet and moving hard at Virgil...

                                 VINCE
                        You must be outta your god damn 
                        mind.

           Virgil doesn’t budge.

                                 VINCE (CONT’D)
                        You better get the fuck out of here 
                        before something bad happens to 
                        you, boy.

           Virgil meets Vince’s eyes. Their noses almost touching. 

                                 GEORGE
                             (fatherly)
                        Sit down, Vince.

           A beat. Every muscle in Vince’s body straining against 
           physical retribution. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I said, sit your ass down, Vincent!

           Vince holds a moment, then tears the smock from around his 
           neck and throws it at the empty chair.
                                 VINCE
                             (shaking his head)
                        This is some BULL SHIT right here.

           He flips out his cell phone and bumps Virgil’s shoulder on 
           the way out. Sharp DING.

           As the door shuts behind him, we faintly hear --

                                 VINCE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re not gonna fuckin believe 
                        what just happened...

           -- until he’s out of ear shot.

           The remaining Twelve Customers sit frozen, barely able to 
           comprehend the situation. 

           Virgil and George stare at each other. The twenty feet 
           between them seems to buzz with electricity. George barely 
           keeping primal instinct at bay. Finally --

                                 GEORGE
                        Can I help you with something, boy?

           A beat that feels eternal. Then --                         
           Virgil’s voice. Surprisingly quiet. Almost feeble --

                                 VIRGIL
                        I’d like a shave.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m sorry, boy, you’re gonna have 
                        to speak up!

           Virgil breaks eye contact. Moves his gaze. We follow it --

           ANGLE ON: A PHOTOGRAPH ON THE COUNTER

           Douglas and George beaming. In front of the Barbershop. Arms 
           around each other. Next to the photo are flowers and a cross.

           Virgil looks back at George. That thousand-yard stare. 

           What the fuck is this man doing here? Louder now --

                                 VIRGIL 
                        I said, I’d like a shave.

           The Twelve Person audience watches in awe. George is a damn 
           about to break. Long beat. Then --

           He finds his better angels.
                                 GEORGE
                        Sit down.

           The Barbershop audience can’t fucking believe it. A young 
           man, LOGAN, stands abruptly.

                                 LOGAN
                        Mr. Pines, you can’t be --

                                 GEORGE
                        Shut your mouth, Logan.

           Logan sits.

           George walks to the counter and begins to sharpen his razor 
           on a leather strip. Face just as inscrutable as Virgil’s.

           CLOSE ON the razor sliding back and forth in the frame. The 
           goose bump scrape of a weapon being primed.

           Virgil leaves his cane at the entry way and limps to the high 
           chair and sits.

           George prepares shaving soap, more meticulously than normal. 
           Cuts slices from a soap bar. Drops them into a container. 

           He mixes in a bit of warm water and stirs the contents with a 
           shaving brush...

           The foam begins to rise. 

           George pulls out a sheet and ties it around Virgil’s neck. 
           The silence of the shop is visceral. The calm before a storm.

           George begins to gently apply the warm lather to Virgil’s 
           face and throat, careful not to catch his eyes.

           Several beats.

           He finishes. Retrieves his razor. Briefly thumbs its edge.

           Quickly wipes it across his apron and -- 

           BEGINS THE SHAVE

           George works his way down Virgil’s right cheek. Slowly, 
           meticulously, missing nothing... every hair follicle ripped 
           from every pour. Every scrape loud, crisp, vivid. 

           All the while, Virgil is quiet. Deferential. Bending to the 
           will of the Barber’s hands.

           George lifts the dirtied razor from Virgil’s face and turns 
           away. Wipes collected foam and hair across his apron. 
           Beat. Knuckles white on the razor’s polished wooden hand.

           He stares deep into the now glistening blade and --

           CLOSE ON THE RAZOR 

           Both a tool and a weapon.                             
           Reflected back is a sliver of George’s face...               
           Nose to forehead. And his eyes are beginning to well.

           He stifles them. Remember, this is not a man who cries. 

           Finally --

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Why are you here?

           All of Virgil seems to falter. No trace left of the brazen 
           cowboy from earlier. He swallows hard. Choosing his words... 

                                 VIRGIL
                        I need to understand.

           George, back still turned, looks up and locks eyes with 
           Virgil in the mirror.

                                 GEORGE
                        Understand what?

           Beat. Virgil’s sight turns inward...

                                 VIRGIL
                             (sotto)
                        What I’ve done.

           Palpable silence. You could slice it. Every set of eyes glued 
           to the two men. Then --

           George begins to re-sharpen his razor on the leather strip...

                                 GEORGE
                        Logan. Lock the door...        
                        We’re closing early today.

           Apprehensively, Logan does as he’s told. Walks slowly to the 
           door, bolts it, CLICK, flips OPEN SIGN to CLOSED. Then sits.

           George guides the blade gracefully along the leather.     
           Up... down... up again...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t I tell you a story, 
                        Detective, about a good kid who 
                        didn’t deserve to die.
           Beat. Sharpening...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        And when I’m done, you’ll tell me a 
                        story, about a badge that 
                        disagreed.

           Beat. Sharpening...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Then we’ll decide. 

                                 VIRGIL
                        Decide what?

                                 GEORGE
                        Your verdict.

           ANGLE ON the Twelve Customer Audience. Our De facto jury.

           Finished sharpening, George thumbs the blade. 

           Perfect. 

           Then pivots and returns it to the right side of Virgil’s 
           face. He flicks a patch of hair from his jaw.

           See the razor for a moment. Just the razor... 

           AND THEN THE YARN -- 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        It’s the same story every time, 
                        isn’t it. A good kid who falls in 
                        with the wrong crowd. 

           And down the razor SCRAPES.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        A real pity, too.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve been told his father raised 
                        him the best a single father could.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           An inner city public school. The kind that middle class 
           America only knows about from 60 MINUTES. 
           Douglas, sharp, clean cut, a far cry from how we saw him at 
           the beginning, sits in a sea of students taking an exam. He’s 
           wholly focused. 

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Forced him to hit the books like it 
                        was God ordained. Become a man of 
                        letters. Of Deep. Fuckin. Thoughts. 
                        After all, there's only so far a 
                        kid can crawl out of the hood if he 
                        doesn't wake up in the morning with 
                        big questions. 
                             (beat)
                        Wasn’t a half-bad line backer, 
                        either...

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Bright stadium lights. Cheering fans. Commands. Banter.

           Two rival schools go toe-to-toe. 

           We enter JUST AS Douglas intercepts a pass and dodges his way 
           into the opposing end zone. Spikes the ball.

           Fellow players run up. Jubilant. Bumping chests. 

           Douglas trots back to the sideline where his COACH slaps him 
           on the helmet. A smile behind his face guard.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Had a sweet little adoring thing, 
                        too. They called her Beatrice...

           ANGLE ON a black girl in the stands. This is BEATRICE (17, 
           bookish, smart-pretty), a letterman jacket wrapped tightly 
           around her. She only has eyes for Douglas.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Looked like a young Maya Angelou. 
                        Everyone said so. Had the very same 
                        look in her eye. Like an old lady 
                        rocking on a porch trapped in a 
                        teenage body... 

           CLOSER ON Beatrice. George is right. She’s an old soul.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Maybe the boy was an old soul, 
                        too...

           Douglas walks up to Beatrice after the game, takes off his 
           helmet. Two young-love smiles...
                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        Just didn’t have the mind yet to 
                        keep up with it.
                             (beat)
                        But Beatrice made sure and did 
                        something about that...

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Beatrice and Douglas studying in a LIBRARY. She’s the boss.             

           In her BEDROOM, Douglas keeps making advances, but she 
           playfully swats him away. Not until their homework’s done.

           Up against a LOCKER, the couple holds one another. A small 
           but very real kiss.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        The boy’s father set aside half of 
                        his nightly prayers just to thank 
                        the Almighty she took a liking to 
                        him...

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Where George’s razor stops at the edge of Virgil’s jaw line, 
           a swath of clean skin in its wake.

                                 GEORGE
                        But the streets... 

           Razor still perched. Barbershop audience dead quiet.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Well, they have a way of catching 
                        up with a brother, don’t they? And 
                        when they do... 
                             (sotto)
                        ... it’s like quicksand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Douglas snakes through a rundown, two-story house. Packed to 
           capacity. Thirty plus TEENS drinking and smoking. 

           A concerned look. And growing by the second. He’s searching 
           for someone...

           He approaches a small group.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Any of you seen Beatrice?

           They haven’t. He approaches another group. Gets the same 
           answer. His look rapidly evolving from concern to panic.

           He steps into the BACKYARD. Tons more PEOPLE --

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        B?!

           Nothing.

           BACK INSIDE

           He tours the KITCHEN, LIVING ROOM, DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOMS. 
           Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Now he’s freaked.

           He makes his way upstairs. Party SOUNDS diffuse. Steps CREAK. 
           Suddenly -- A LOUD SCREAM!

           Douglas goes full sprint. Stops at the landing and listens. 
           Where did it come from? 

           Another SCREAM! But cut off half-way through, as if a strong 
           hand caught it in the air. 

           He chases the noise source. MUFFLED MOANS grow from behind a 
           bedroom door. He tries to open it. Locked.

           He shakes the knob. Slams his shoulder against the door.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        B?! B?!

           OFF SCREEN, a terrified and strangled SHRIEK.

                                 BEATRICE (O.S.)
                        DOUGLA --

           With all of his might, Douglas kicks the door. CRACK.

           It flies open. Quickly, Douglas’s face goes from shock to 
           fear and finally to rage. This is what we find --

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Beatrice pinned to a bed by a slender but muscular MAN (early 
           20’s). She’s down to her bra and he’s half-way through 
           ripping off her pants. The Man looks up just as -- 

           CRACK! Douglas SLUGS him across the face --
           Then wrenches him off Beatrice and throws him hard against 
           the wall. Paintings fall to the ground and picture frames 
           topple from a beat-up armoire and shatter.

           Despite the Man’s build, he’s no match for the fury surging 
           through Douglas’ veins.

           SLUG after SLUG. The Man’s nose bleeds freely now. Beatrice 
           rushes Douglas and tries to pull him back --

                                 BEATRICE
                        Stop, Dougie! Stop!

           Not gonna happen. 

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        Douglas! You’re going to kill him!

           But Douglas is possessed. Suddenly --

           Two new MEN appear in the busted doorway. Tall. Built. And 
           vibrating. They’re unmistakably gangbangers. Beatrice turns. 
           Terrified. She knows what’s going to happen next --

           But wait, reader, we know these two men. They were in the 
           living room at the beginning when Virgil busted in.

           They RUSH Douglas full throttle and --

           BAM! As Man 1 yanks Douglas by the shirt collar, Man 2 
           punches him in the stomach. The two then proceed to 
           mercilessly kick his ass. Beatrice erupts --

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        No! Please! Please stop!

           But stop they won’t. CUT TO --

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Battered and bloody, Douglas is dragged out the front door, 
           Beatrice yelling in his wake. 

           Down the lawn they take him. Then toss him like a rag doll 
           onto the sidewalk. Barely conscious, Douglas is a limp tangle 
           on the cement. 

           The entire party has gathered outside to watch the violence.

           Beatrice slaps and claws at Man 1. Her nails suddenly tear 
           skin from just beneath his eye and -- 

           He whips around and back-hands her to the ground. 
           A beat.

           CLOSE ON her face... tears cut down flushed cheeks, ruffled 
           hair, a look of dead-end desperation.

           Man 1 drags Douglas to the edge of the curb. Kneels. Clutches 
           the back of his neck. In a vicious, sotto voice --

                                 MAN 1
                        I was thinkin about lettin you off 
                        with a good beating. 

           He wipes blood from the gash beneath his eye. Examines it.

                                 MAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        But your bitch just changed my 
                        mind.

           He starts to moved Douglas’ face closer to the curb edge.

                                 MAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        Time to bite the curb, nigga.

                                 BEATRICE
                        NOOOO!!

           Beatrice leaps to her feat. But Man 2 catches her around the 
           waist and holds her writhing body.

           The entire party watches as Douglas, too broken to put up a 
           fight, allows Man 1 to open his mouth and clamp it around the 
           curb. As Beatrice SCREAMS in Man 2’s arms --

           Man 1 steps back.

           Everyone in the crowd is too scared of these men to protest.

           DEAD SILENCE.                                                
           An eternity.                                                  
           Then --

           Man 1 lifts his foot, and is JUST about to stomp when --

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        LUCKY!

           The Man known as LUCKY turns, foot hanging in the air.

           The crowd parts as Beatrice’s assailant from upstairs 
           saunters to the curb. He’s physically smaller than the other 
           two but far grander in presence. The ring leader.

                                 LUCKY
                        Let me end this fool, Wolf.
                                 WOLF
                        Back the fuck off, Lucky. 
                             (uncannily kind)
                        Can’t you see this boy is 
                        terrified.

           Lucky steps aside for Wolf, who kneels down and turns Douglas 
           onto his back, head against the curb. He wipes blood from his 
           own mouth, compliments of Douglas’ fist.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        If it isn’t little Dougie Pines. 
                        Beatrice’s pet project.
                             (pause)
                        She’s trying to make you into a 
                        brainy nigga, ain’t she?

           Beatrice has stopped squirming.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        Well let me tell you something 
                        about brainy nigga’s...

           He leans in real close...

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        ... They’re always the first ones 
                        to die.

           Douglas blinks heavily. Eyes red and watery. Nostrils and 
           teeth smeared in blood.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        But you know what? I’m feelin 
                        strangely generous today. I don’t 
                        know what it is. Maybe it’s your 
                        face. You’ve got a nice face to 
                        look at, Dougie. Anyone ever told 
                        you that?

           Douglas neither confirms nor denies.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        What do you think of my face, 
                        Dougie? You like my face? My mama 
                        always said I looked mean.

           Wolf turns to Lucky.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        You think I have a mean face, 
                        Lucky? Be honest.
                                 LUCKY
                        You look like a fuckin angel.

           Wolf emits a quiet laugh. Then back to Douglas --

                                 WOLF
                        You hear that, Dougie. I look like 
                        an angel. And you know what Angels 
                        are, don’t you? They’re generous. 
                        So that’s what I’m gonna be. I’m 
                        gonna be generous and offer you a 
                        deal. Give you a chance to rectify. 
                        But I wanna warn you right now, 
                        Dougie, if you don’t hold up your 
                        end of the bargain...

           He grabs Douglas by the jaw and tilts his face in the 
           direction of Beatrice, still wrapped up by Man 2.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        ... I might just forget how 
                        generous I am and finish what I 
                        started upstairs.
                        Cuz we both know what the Big Bad 
                        Wolf did, don’t we...?
                             (beat)
                        He ate ‘a bitch.

           He turns Douglas’ face back. Releases his jaw. 

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        You understand me, Dougie? I mean, 
                        FULLY understand me?

           A long, unresponsive beat.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        Let me know you understand me.

           Finally Douglas’s voice. A cracked and splintered voice:

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I understand you.

                                 WOLF
                        That ‘a boy. 
                             (pause)
                        Now here’s what you’re gonna do.

           Wolf moves his mouth up to Douglas’ ear and CUT TO --

           A SLOW PUSH IN on Beatrice’s face, as Wolf (voice unheard) 
           changes Douglas’ life forever. A few seconds. Then --
           ANGLE BACK ON WOLF AND DOUGLAS

           Finished talking, Wolf hoists a limp Douglas to his feat. He 
           straightens Douglas’ posture, irons out the wrinkles in his 
           shirt and then cups his face like a father would.

           Douglas meets Wolf’s eyes. Perversely nice eyes. Beat.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna be just fine, kid.

           He releases him. Then a wide and gracious smile --

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE GET MY BROTHER 
                        HERE A DRINK?!

           He starts to back away --

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                             (sotto to Douglas)
                        I’ll see you tomorrow.

           LAWRENCE (formerly Man 2), releases Beatrice, who instantly 
           rushes to Douglas’ aid. He collapses into her arms.

           CLOSE ON Douglas’ battered face --

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BARBERSHOP - PRESENT DAY 

           Douglas’ face is replaced by his father’s. Stone-still. As is 
           the razor, paused half-way down the ridge of Virgil’s left 
           jaw.

           There’s a kind of quiet awe in the room. As if the Customers 
           had been on the lawn themselves, watching Douglas tormented.

           Finally, George brings us back to the room --

                                 GEORGE
                        You believe in God, son?

           Beat. Virgil swallows. The blade undulates --

                                 VIRGIL
                             (sotto; cracked)
                        On my better days.
                                 GEORGE 
                        And on those days... you suspect He 
                        plans this dog and pony or is He 
                        just rolling the dice for His own 
                        sick amusement?

           Virgil remains silent. Razor almost carving into his skin.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (inwardly)
                        If it’s dice, that boy sure as hell 
                        got the wrong kind of snake eyes.

           Beat. Then Virgil finds his voice --

                                 VIRGIL
                        Where do you stand?

                                 GEORGE
                        This isn’t about me.             
                        This is about you.

           Another beat. 

                                 VIRGIL
                        Dice.

           Suddenly, George’s expression morphs. It’s hard for us to put 
           a finger on. He pivots to his counter. Wipes the hair laden 
           blade across his apron and gently places it down.

                                 GEORGE
                        Excuse me.

           The Barbershop Customers watch in silence as George walks to 
           the back and disappears into the --

           BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           -- where we find him staring deep into the mirror, hands 
           gripping the sink edge. 

           He parts his collar and squeezes the Rosary dangling from 
           around his neck. Then, sotto, to himself: 

                                 GEORGE
                        Thou art the living fountain of 
                        hope. So great and so availest, 
                        that whoso would have grace and has 
                        not recourse to thee, would have 
                        his desire fly without wings...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM 

           Night of Douglas’ beating.

           George (looking roughly the same age) leans in a recliner and 
           reads from DANTE’s DIVINE COMEDY: PARADISO.

                                 GEORGE
                             (sotto)
                        ... Thy benevolence not only 
                        succors him who asks, but 
                        oftentimes freely foreruns the 
                        asking. In thee mercy, in thee 
                        pity, in thee whatever of goodness 
                        is in any creature, are unite --

           FRANTIC KNOCKS at the door!

                                 BEATRICE (O.S.)
                        MR. PINES! MR. PINES!

           George drops his book, whips on glasses and rushes to the 
           door. Opens it to find --

           A disheveled Beatrice barely managing to hold Douglas up. 
           It’s raining outside now and they’re both drenched.

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Mr. Pines! They almost killed 
                        him! They almost killed him, Mr. --

                                 GEORGE
                        Slow down, girl!

           George takes hold of his son and carries him to the couch. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                             (to Beatrice)
                        My first aid kit. Under the sink.

           He places his hand against his son’s forehead.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Who did this to you?

           Beatrice is back. George begins to tend to the wounds. His 
           hands move from muscle memory, like he’s done this a thousand 
           times before. Hydrogen peroxide, gauze, butterfly bandages...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Talk to me, boy. Who did this to 
                        you?

           But Douglas is barely with us. Swimming in and out...
           Beatrice kneeling close. To George --

                                 BEATRICE
                        He calls himself Wolf.

           George stands. Turns. Thinking. Then a realization -- 

                                 GEORGE
                        Like father like son.

                                 BEATRICE
                        What?

                                 GEORGE
                        His name is Walter Wallace. Wolf 
                        was his father’s nickname. Got 
                        fifty years in the Pen for 2nd 
                        degree murder.

                                 BEATRICE
                        We have to call the Police.

           George shakes his head.

                                 GEORGE
                        And then what? They’ll pretend to 
                        file a report, offer me some lip 
                        service because I wear glasses and 
                        then forget about the whole thing 
                        after Denny’s.

           One hand on Douglas’ forehead, Beatrice looks up --

                                 BEATRICE
                        So what do we do?

           Another beat of George thinking. Then CUT TO --

           INT. GEORGE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Moving with military-like precision, George opens a closet 
           and retrieves a long, rectangular box. We know what’s inside.

           He kneels. Dials through a COMBINATION LOCK. Click. Revealed 
           is a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN. 

           George squeezes it in his hands. A memory-lane look. But it’s 
           a reticent one. Maybe guns used to be an every day appendage. 
           Not anymore. CUT TO --
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George beelines it for the door. Quick stop --

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll be back in an hour. Give him 
                        600mg of ibprofen for the swelling 
                        and start with an ice pack in 20 
                        minutes.

                                 BEATRICE
                             (scared)
                        What are you going to do?

                                 GEORGE
                        Protect my baby.

           EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Hard, pelting RAIN.

           George walks to his car like a man possessed. Gets in. Sawed-
           off across his lap like a deadly pet. Ignition growls. 

           He’s off. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

           George parked in front of a house that wears the daily 
           beatings of poverty. 

           Downpour continues. Little rivers of rain water on the 
           windshield cast abstract shadows on George’s face.

           He looks at the house. Clutches the shotgun. Deep breath. 

           EXT. LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

           George moves at the house like a hand-maiden of fate and --

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! AT THE DOOR

           George waits. Gun hidden behind his back. Beat.

           Door peeks open. A mid 20’s WOMAN (maybe Wolf’s girlfriend), 
           holding a baby, appears. Face the worse for wear.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is Wally here?
                                 WOMAN
                        Who wants to know?

                                 GEORGE
                        I do.

                                 WOMAN
                        And who the fuck is you?

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 WOMAN
                        Well you’re on my porch, mister, so 
                        it sure as fuck IS my business.

           Beat. Her eyes study him. 

           JUST as she catches a sliver of the sawed-off hidden behind 
           George’s back, the distinct pitch of Wolf’s VOICE OFF SCREEN.

           George shoulders her out of the way. PRIMES his gun.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        WALLY!

           George tears in, traces the noise until he comes upon --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where Wolf, Lucky, and Lawrence play Texas Hold’em. 

           All eyes look up as heat-packing George enters and KICKS over 
           the table. Poker chips and bills scatter everywhere. 

                                 LUCKY
                             (getting up)
                        What the --

                                 GEORGE
                        SIT DOWN, BOY!

           He sits. The BABY is now CRYING somewhere in the house. 
           George aims directly at Wolf. Wolf stares back. Unfazed.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I'm going to start talking and 
                        you're going to start listening. I 
                        hope that the meaning of my 
                        presence in your home is self-
                        evident. But in case it is not, I 
                        am going speak as plainly and  
                        concisely as possible. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        If ANY of the words that come out 
                        of my mouth do not match that 
                        description, this is your one and 
                        only chance to say so, because this 
                        will be the last congenial 
                        conversation we ever have. Do you 
                        understand me? 

           Beat. Nada. George cocks the sawed-off. Aims tighter.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

           Wolf essays George. A father operating on pure instinct. A 
           father prepared to spill blood. And he knows it. George's 
           arms flex as he aims even tighter. Finally, Wolf nods...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        It's come to my attention that you 
                        and my son were introduced earlier 
                        this evening. The good news: apart 
                        from two black eyes and a busted 
                        nose, he's going to be fine. The 
                        bad news: he has two black eyes and 
                        a busted nose and I’d put money on 
                        my late wife’s tombstone that 
                        that’s only half the story. So 
                        here's how we're going to proceed: 
                        if I ever catch wind that your eyes 
                        have so much as GLANCED in Douglas' 
                        direction, if I hear from B or any 
                        other little birdie who may have 
                        accidentally floated by that your 
                        very scent wafted within a ten-foot 
                        radius of him...
                             (ablaze)
                        ... As God is my witness, I will 
                        come crashing down on you with a 
                        wrath the likes of which you’ve 
                        never seen before, boy. And then 
                        we'll all get to see just how bad 
                        the Big Bad Wolf really is.

           A beat. George letting the scene soak up his words.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        There are two types of people in 
                        the world, Wally: those who build, 
                        and those who destroy. You're still 
                        young enough to change your mind 
                        about which one you're gonna' be.

           He lowers his gun.
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’m done talking. But you shouldn’t 
                        be done listening.

           With that, George is gone. But we sit tight for a beat. 

           SLOW PUSH IN on Wolf, who almost, ALMOST looks embarrassed to 
           be himself. The world has momentarily stopped making sense.

           INT. GEORGE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Paternal adrenalin waning. George, clutching the sawed-off 
           tightly to his chest, vibrates. Really vibrates. Deep breath.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BARBERSHOP BATHROOM 

           Present day George, knuckles white around his cross. He 
           splashes water on his face. Another glance at his reflection.

           INT. BARBERSHOP MAIN ROOM - SAME TIME

           Pin-drop silence. 

           Twelve pairs of disdain bore into Virgil’s back. His eyes are 
           shut... Traveling some inner landscape... Suddenly --

           He opens them and looks into the mirror. Staring directly 
           back is the oldest gentlemen present (maybe 70). Unlike the 
           others, he neither looks angry nor hateful. Something closer 
           to fascination. Virgil is an exotic animal.

           They study each other through the mirror. Then --

           George re-enters the scene. Picks up his razor from the 
           counter, wipes it across his apron and turns to Virgil.

           He’s apparently shed his emotion from the previous scene.

                                 GEORGE
                        You know it took me ten years of 
                        saving to put a down payment on 
                        this place? Ten years. I was pickin 
                        up pennies on the fuckin sidewalk.

           George thumbs away a dime of leftover hair from beneath 
           Virgil’s ear. Pushes the razor back into his skin...

           And down it SCRAPES.
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        After the first month of 
                        negotiating with the bank, some 
                        drug dealers from the neighborhood 
                        offered to loan me 50K to get 
                        started. But you know how that 
                        works. They scratch your back... 
                        then you’ve gotta scratch their’s 
                        even harder. 

           He wipes the blade on his apron and continues.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Would’ve saved me years of working 
                        over time, though: spending 
                        weekends at the factory, missing 
                        family gatherings, football games, 
                        graduations... Countless nights I 
                        found myself with a phone in my 
                        hand about to dial that number. 

           He pauses the razor...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        But in the end, I turned it down. 
                             (beat)
                        You want to know why?

                                 VIRGIL
                             (sotto)
                        Why?

           George leans in a little closer.

                                 GEORGE
                        Because inside every man are two 
                        kinds of dog... 
                             (beat)
                        The bad.   
                             (beat)
                        And the good. And everyday they 
                        bare their teeth and fight for the 
                        permit on your soul... 

           Virgil’s eyes slowly move south.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Which dog wins in the end?

                                 GEORGE
                        Whichever dog we feed the most.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Douglas, still wearing the beating, sits next to Beatrice.  
           She steals several concerned sideways glances. 

           Every student has ANN PETRY’s novel THE STREET on their desk. 
           A female teacher, MS. WILCOX, reads a passage aloud:

                                 MS. WILCOX
                        “The creeping, silent thing that 
                        she had sensed in the theater, in 
                        the beauty parlor, was here in her 
                        living room. It was sitting on the 
                        lumpy studio couch. Before it had 
                        been formless, shapeless, a fluid 
                        moving mass -- something 
                        disembodied that she couldn’t see, 
                        could only sense. 
                             (beat)
                        Now, as she stared at the couch, 
                        the thing took on form, substance. 
                        She could see what it was. It was --

           Suddenly a quiet tap on Douglas’ shoulder. 

           A STUDENT hands him a NOTE. Confused, he opens it -- 

           CLOSE ON NOTE: “Change of plans. Back entrance. 3:30.”                                            

           Douglas whips around. But no Lucky. No Lawrence. No Wolf. 
           When he turns back, Ms. Wilcox is staring at him.

                                 MS. WILCOX (CONT’D)
                        Is there a problem, Douglas?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        No, no problem. Sorry, Ms. Wilcox.

           EXT. SCHOOL BACK ENTRANCE - LATER THAT DAY

           Douglas and Beatrice waiting. Shoulder to shoulder.

           She’s freaked. He’s weirdly calm.

                                 BEATRICE
                        Please don’t do this, Douglas.

           No response. He’s zeroed in on some undefined future.

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        Douglas. Please.

           He snaps to. Turns. Looks hard at her --
                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’m not going to let anything 
                        happen to you, B. That’s the deal. 
                        I do what he says and you don’t get 
                        hurt. That’s all that matters. 

                                 BEATRICE
                        I can take care of myself.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I didn’t say you couldn’t.

                                 BEATRICE
                        Then why?

           Suddenly, the tricked-out HUM of a low rider Car turning a 
           distant corner and heading towards them. It looks alive.

           Beatrice grabs Douglas. By the shirt collars. Urgent.

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        My Grandma used to say that it 
                        wasn’t violence she feared. Men and 
                        woman do horrible things to each 
                        other every day. She said it was 
                        the silence behind it. A creeping 
                        silence that’s been there since the 
                        beginning. She said she could smell 
                        it everywhere. But it wasn’t evil. 
                        She didn’t believe in any of that. 
                        It’s the Street, Douglas. That’s 
                        what she said. The street is the 
                        silence. Do you understand me?

           The low-rider is now twenty yards away. She cups his face 
           with strong hands. Bores into him...

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a good man, Douglas Pines. 
                        You’re so good. And I love you. But 
                        if you get in that car...

           Ten yards away...

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        ... Your whole life was just an 
                        arrow heading straight for that 
                        silence. And there’s no turning 
                        back. Wolf is a one way ticket. 

           The low-rider stops beside them, engine growling. The tinted 
           driver-side window rolls down. A smiling Wolf appears. He 
           quickly looks at Beatrice, privy to her last ditch efforts.
                                 WOLF
                        You ready, Dougie? We’ve got a big 
                        day ahead of us.

           Beatrice balls up Douglas’ shirt and won’t let go.

           Douglas anchored on Wolf. Beatrice anchored on Douglas. 

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                             (smiling)
                        I promise I’ll have him back by 
                        nightfall so that you two can get 
                        your home work done.

           Beatrice can feel Douglas drifting away. Her face says it. 

           Grip loosens. A beat.

           He slips through her fingers and enters Wolf’s tinted world.

           INT. WOLF’S CAR - LATER THAT DAY

           Korea Town.

           We’re parked across the street from a nondescript building. 
           Above a small entrance door is a sign: KOREAN CLEANERS.

           Wolf behind the wheel. Lucky in the front. Lawrence and 
           Douglas in the back.

           Wolf puts on his “friendly and understanding” face.

                                 WOLF
                        I wanted this shit to be clean, 
                        Dougie, I really did. But then your 
                        old man had to go and do something 
                        stupid. And now... well, shit just 
                        ain’t so clean anymore.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LUCKY
                        Papa Pines made a house visit.

                                 LAWRENCE
                        And it wasn’t particularly... how 
                        did he put it, “congenial.” Even 
                        made Wolf’s baby cry.
                                 LUCKY 
                        Which is saying somethin, because 
                        not even Lawrence makes Wolf’s baby 
                        cry and he looks like the fuckin 
                        Elephant Man.

           A beat. Douglas genuinely shocked.

                                 WOLF
                        Apparently I don’t smell good 
                        enough to be Dougie Pines’ buddy.

           Lucky and Lawrence chuckle. Wolf reaches over and gives 
           Douglas’ face a friendly rub. Douglas almost flinches.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        But I still like this face...

           Wolf studies Douglas like he’s some old, antique relic.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        It’s like there’s two of you in 
                        there and they’re battling to 
                        figure out which one it’s gonna be.
                        It’s fuckin inspiring.
                             (beat)
                        So after a shit ton ‘a soul 
                        searching, I’ve decided to give you 
                        another shot. Look outside.

           ANGLE ON KOREAN CLEANERS

                                 WOLF (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Looks like your run-of-the-mill 
                        Asian dry cleaners, right? Think 
                        again. This is where Sueños 
                        Norteños launders their skrill.

           BACK INSIDE THE CAR

                                 WOLF
                        But today, the spicks are gonna 
                        come home to find an empty piggy 
                        bank. 
                             (beat)
                        Get the shit.

           Lawrence gets out of the car. Moments later, he’s back with a 
           large duffle bag. It’s unzipped. Inside we find --

           A small army’s worth of weaponry. Two Shot guns. An assault 
           rifle. 
           Three hand guns, ammo galore, as well as something entirely 
           unexpected: Four PLAGUE DOCTOR MASKS (same ones we saw at the 
           beginning). As Lawrence pulls them out --

                                 LAWRENCE
                        What the fuck are these?

                                 WOLF
                        Ask the brainy nigga.

           Lawrence looks to Douglas. A beat. He knows.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Plague masks.

                                 WOLF
                        Exactly. And what are they for?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Doctors used to wear them. Thought 
                        the beak protected them from the 
                        plague.

                                 LUCKY
                        What plague?

                                 WOLF
                        Mexican voodoo, nigga. What do you 
                        think?

           Lucky chuckles. Wolf hands a WALTHER P99 PISTOL to Douglas.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        You ever used one of these before?

           Douglas’ silence says, no.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        Just aim. Pull the trigger. Shit 
                        dies. Masks on, boys.

           Moments later and we’re staring at four Plague Doctors 
           packing serious heat. Lawrence and Lucky look giddy.

                                 LUCKY
                        Feels like Halloween.

           Wolf PUMPS his shotgun. CHICK CHICK.

                                 WOLF
                        Let’s go trick or treating, then.
           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Total silence. IN SLOW MO we see --

           Beaked and armed, three gangsters and an honor student step 
           out of the car and make towards KOREAN CLEANERS. It’s an 
           eerie vision to behold in broad daylight. 

           Suddenly, GEORGE’S VOICE --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        I took this literature class in 
                        high school once. It was senior 
                        year though and all I cared about 
                        were pretty girls and cheap beer... 

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Where George moves his razor up Virgil’s neck. The right side 
           of his face is now bare skin.

                                 GEORGE
                        Probably showed up all of five 
                        times the entire semester. But the 
                        teacher liked me for some reason. 
                        Said she’d pass me if I memorized a 
                        poem and recited it in front of the 
                        whole class. So that’s what I did.

           George grabs a towel. Wipes away some excess foam.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Yeats, I believe it was. Irish 
                        poet. You ever heard of Yeats, 
                        Detective? 

           Virgil says nothing. It was a rhetorical question, anyway.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I still remember it. Word for word.

           George gently tilts Virgil’s head to the side, places the 
           razor on his opposing cheek. 

           Beat. 

           And down it SCRAPES. Poem in tow --

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Turning and turning in the widening 
                        gyre, the falcon cannot hear the 
                        falconer...
           BACK TO THE STREET

           Where our four Plague Doctors huddle around the front door of 
           KOREAN CLEANERS. 

           All DIAGETIC SOUND is gone. GEORGE’S VOICE is our only guide.

           Wolf raises a hand. On three: One. Two. Three!

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Things fall apart; the center 
                        cannot hold...

           AND BAM! 

           INT. KOREAN DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

           They burst into the shop waving their weapons. Not Douglas, 
           though. He’s forgotten how to use his body. Arms pinned to 
           his sides. Gun barrel aimed uselessly at the ground.

           Wolf’s mouth says, EVERYBODY ON THE FUCKIN’ GROUND!

           Three KOREAN WOMEN drop to their stomachs SCREAMING. 

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Mere anarchy is loosed upon the 
                        world. The blood-dimmed tide is 
                        loosed, and everywhere, the 
                        ceremony of innocence is drowned...

           Wolf towers over WOMAN 1. Crouches. Grabs a mound of her hair 
           and ROARS into her face, WHERE’S THE FUCKIN’ MONEY?

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...The best lack all conviction, 
                        while the worst are full of 
                        passionate intensity...

           Wolf motions for Douglas to guard the door, then drags the 
           screaming rag doll Woman into the back. Lawrence and Lucky 
           follow him. 

           SLOW PUSH IN on our man...

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Surely some revelation is at 
                        hand. Surely the Second Coming is 
                        at hand. The Second Coming!...

           Suddenly, WOMAN 2 is off the ground and breaking for the 
           door, but Douglas is too frozen to even register the escape. 
           A beat as we watch her dash.

           He snaps to -- 

           Catches her half-way out the door and drags her kicking and 
           screaming back inside. She claws at his face and tries to 
           wiggle free. He strengthens his hold. Hating himself for it. 

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Hardly are those words out when 
                        a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi 
                        troubles my sight...

           A SIDE DOOR bursts open! Now, standing across the room, is a 
           MEXICAN MAN brandishing a pump-action shotgun.

           Douglas spins. BANG!

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Somewhere in the sands of the 
                        dessert, a shape with lion-body and 
                        the head of a man, a gaze blank and 
                        pitiless as the sun, is moving its 
                        slow thighs...

           But it’s not the Mexican Man who shot first. It was Douglas. 

           Mind unhinged, he stares down at his own outstretched arm, at 
           his own finger curled around his own freshly pulled trigger. 

           Across the room, Douglas’ victim is slumped against the wall. 
           Bleeding from the gut. A confused beat. Then --

           Douglas releases the writhing Woman (who bolts out the door), 
           rips off his Plague Mask and rushes to the dying man’s side.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...While all about it reel shadows 
                        of the indignant desert birds. The 
                        darkness drops again...

           Sheer panic. Douglas on his knees. Vibrating uncontrollably. 
           Arms turning red as he tries to hold the Dying Man up.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...But now I know, that twenty 
                        centuries of stony sleep, were 
                        vexed to nightmare by a rocking 
                        cradle...

           Dying Man meets Douglas’ eyes. Expressionless but still 
           alive. It’s a weirdly intimate tableaux. His is the last face 
           this man will ever see. But then --
           Dying Man spits a thick wad of blood into Douglas’ face. A 
           look of pure, unadulterated hate. 

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Just as George glides his razor up Virgil’s chin.

                                 GEORGE
                        ...And what rough beast, its hour 
                        come round at last --

           But Virgil cuts him off and finishes the poem --

                                 VIRGIL
                        -- Slouches toward Bethlehem to be 
                        born.

           George stops the shave. Mildly in awe. Impressed. But 
           wouldn’t dare show it. 

           He turns to his counter. Wipes off the razor and proceeds to 
           sharpen it on his strip of leather. 

                                 GEORGE
                             (back turned)
                        That’s right. You almost fail Ms. 
                        Landingham’s English class, too?

                                 VIRGIL
                        Yeates was my father’s favorite 
                        poet... Used to whisper it to 
                        himself during Sunday Mass.

           George sharpening...

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m curious then, what beast you 
                        think he’s really talking about?

           Radio silence... 

           Done sharpening, George dips the razor into warm water, wipes 
           it across his apron, turns back to Virgil. 

                                 VIRGIL
                        The devil?

           George angles his blade just below Virgil’s chin.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not quite.
                                 VIRGIL
                        What then?

           Beat. George zeroed-in on the perched blade.

                                 GEORGE
                             (almost to himself)
                        The devil inside.

           HARD CUT BACK TO --

           INT. KOREAN DRY CLEANERS - DAY

           All DIAGETIC SOUND COMES ROARING BACK.

           Choking blood. Light leaving his eyes. The dying Mexican Man 
           manages to sputter out --

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                             (in Spanish)
                        You’re a dead man, bitch. 
                             (Louder, in English)
                        YOU HEAR ME, MOTHER FUCKER?! YOU’RE 
                        FUCKIN’ DE--

           But he chokes on the last syllable. Gone from this world. 
           Douglas stares down in awe. This can’t be real. CUT TO --

           EXT. DRY CLEANERS - SAME TIME

           As two SUV’s SCREECH to a halt across the street. Out steps a 
           Bull Elephant of a MAN. Mexican, mid-30’s, tatted-up floor to 
           ceiling. We’ll know him later as SAN SUPAY.

           In his wake, five additional MEN emerge. One of them tosses 
           San Supay a SHOTGUN. He catches it mid-air. Pumps it.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                             (in Spanish)
                        Nobody dies. I want all these 
                        little puntas alive.

           BACK INSIDE KOREAN DRY CLEANERS - SAME TIME

           Wolf, Lawrence, and Lucky tear back into the main room, 
           clutching duffle bags of CASH... 

           Korean Woman 1 in their wake, YELLING. Wolf spins, cold-cocks 
           her to the ground. Then kneels beside our man.
                                 WOLF
                             (RE: handgun)
                        I thought you never used one of 
                        these before.

           Wolf removes his mask. Grins. Pats Douglas on the back.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        See. You ain’t JUST a brainy nigga. 
                        Nobody’s just one thing.

           Douglas silent. Hypnotized by his own unexpected act of 
           violence. Wolf notices. Gets philosophical --

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        It’s a trip, isn’t it? Watching the 
                        light leave another man’s eyes. 

           Wolf reaches down. Gently glides his hand over the dead man’s 
           eyes... they close.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        But you’ll get used to it...
                             (beat)
                        Now get up and help me carry this 
                        booty. We’re fuckin’ kings now --

           GUN BLASTS! Our Plague Doctors whip around to find San Supay 
           and his Entourage pouring in, GUNS BLAZING.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        GO! GO! GO!

           They dash towards a back door and fly through. Hundred dollar 
           bills spraying into the air, ripped apart by bullets --

           EXT. KOREAN DRY CLEANERS BACK ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Douglas, still mask-less, duffle bag slung over his shoulder, 
           runs with the gang down an alley. 

           San Supay materializes 20 yards back. PUMPS. BLASTS! A nearby 
           escape ladder SINGS upon impact. His crew opens fire.

           POP! Pump. POP! Pump. POP! It’s a shower of lead.

           Our Plague Doctors go full steam ahead. They reach a large 
           wooden fence. Toss over the bags. Time to scale it. 

           Fingers are linked, hands cupped around feet, bodies hoisted 
           up and over. Douglas is last to go. Wolf reaches down an arm. 
           Douglas takes it. Up he goes. But then --
           The wood next to his head EXPLODES. He loses Wolf’s grip and 
           drops to his feet. THUD. He turns. Looks down. Fuck. He left 
           his gun inside. This is the end.

           Still 20 yards back, San Supay suddenly stops. And for a beat 
           that lasts forever, he and Douglas lock eyes. Finally --

                                 SAN SUPAY 
                        You killed my favorite brother, 
                        punta. That wasn’t a good idea.

           JUST as he raises his gun --

           We hear SHOTS FIRED O.S. WIZZING past Douglas’ head.

           Supay’s right shoulder jerks back. He’s hit. But barely even 
           stumbles. Apparently it takes a lot more than just one bullet 
           to bring this man to his knees. 

           Behind him, though, a Second Man crumples. Then a third. 
           Bullets to the chest. ANGLE 180 degrees to find --

           Wolf mere feet behind Douglas, double-fisting two handguns. 

                                 WOLF
                        GO, NIGGA! GO!

           As Douglas is hoisted over the fence by Lawrence, Wolf fills 
           up the alley with ROUND after ROUND.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                             (to San Supay)
                        I WAS HOPIN’ WE’D MEET THIS WAY, 
                        MOTHER FUCKER!

           POP! POP! POP! CUT TO --

           EXT. A RESIDENTIAL BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Where Douglas, frozen, watches Lawrence and Lucky scramble to 
           cram fallen cash back into their duffle bags. 

           More SHOTS FIRED O.S. Douglas snaps to --

                                 DOUGLAS
                        JUST LEAVE IT! WE GOTTA GO!

           Lawrence and Lucky don’t budge. Desperate to salvage their 
           losses. More SHOTS FIRED O.S.

           Suddenly, something bordering on leadership possesses 
           Douglas. He runs over, kicks aside a bag and grips Lucky. 
                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Are you really prepared to die over 
                        some pieces of fucking paper?!

           Lucky looks floored. Lawrence stops. Then--

           The wooden fence behind them RATTLES with the SOUND of large 
           bodies scaling it.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        LET’S GO!

           As one, they dash towards the back entrance of the house and 
           burst through a screen door into --

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Where a KOREAN MAN stammers into a phone. Police Dispatch on 
           the other end. Behind him are his WIFE and young DAUGHTER. 
           Both freaked. He sees our boys. Stops. Drops the phone --

                                 KOREAN MAN
                        Please no harm! I tell no one!

           They sprint past, into the LIVING ROOM. Just as they open the 
           front door -- BANG! Door frame explodes. 

           San Supay (eerily calm) and two new ACCOMPLICES are walking 
           up the lawn with purpose. Our boys backpedal.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           They run through the Korean Girl’s bedroom. SCREAMS O.S.        
           Clamber out the window and land in --                      
           The next yard over. They’re down to one duffle bag now.            
           POP! POP! POP! San Supay in pursuit.                         
           They SCALE fence after fence after fence.                  
           Perfect blue sky above. Sun beating down on them.                             
           Dogs BARKING. Throats straining against chains. Finally --

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           One last fence and they’re out of the woods. THUMP. They 
           land. Hunch over. Hands on knees. PANTING heavy. Suddenly, a 
           familiar VOICE, but wracked with pain --

                                 WOLF (O.S.)
                        DOUGLAS!

           ANGLE ACROSS THE STREET, where we find Wolf clutching his 
           stomach, wincing in pain. Shirt stained red.
           We race to Wolf’s aid. Douglas stands back. Watches as Lucky 
           and Lawrence support his sagging body. Laboured breaths.

           Wolf lifts his eyes to Douglas.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        You did good.

           Douglas meets them, realizing that he’s holding the last 
           remaining bag of money. A BEAT. His face hardens.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Fuck you.

           Just then --                                               
           SPANISH VOICES YELLING in the distance.                          
           Here comes San Supay and Company.                            
           But Wolf’s car is blocks away...                             
           Our boys are royally fucked. 

           And then it happens --

           Operating on pure instinct, Douglas reaches into the back of 
           Lucky’s belt, pulls away a handgun, walks into the middle of 
           the street and aims directly at an oncoming car.

           Which SCREECHES to a halt. DRIVER throws up his arms. 

           Silently, almost gracefully, Douglas circles round to the 
           driver side. Opens it. Deposits the Driver into the street 
           and then looks at the gang. Get the fuck in.

           Which they do, Lucky and Lawrence hauling the bloodied Wolf 
           into the backseat. Douglas, knuckles white on the wheel, now 
           the de facto leader, kicks it into gear -- Then BANG!

           Back window SHATTERS.

                                 LUCKY
                        GUN IT, DOUGIE!

           Douglas peels off, sprays of bullets in pursuit. He glances 
           back through the shattered window just long enough to see --

           San Supay, dead calm, gun lowered, put a thumb up to his 
           throat and make a slicing motion. 

           INT. HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Small and run down. Meager furnishings. Dust particles pick 
           up afternoon light through grimy windows.
           Our Plague Doctors BURST IN. While Lucky and Lawrence lay 
           Wolf down on the couch, Douglas shuts all of the blinds. Then 
           stands in the corner. Silently watching. Disdain on his face.

           Lucky grabs a towel and tries to stop Wolf’s blood flow.

                                 WOLF
                        Get the fuck off me!

           Taken aback, feelings almost hurt, he does as he’s told.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                             (blood in his mouth)
                        Douglas. Get over here.

           Douglas’ face is in shadow. SLOW PUSH IN. Something deep 
           inside him is calcifying. Turning to bone. Maybe his soul.

           Finally, he walks over and kneels beside Wolf.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        Saying something smart. 

           Radio silence.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        Please talk to me, Dougie. I’m 
                        fuckin dying.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I have nothing to say to you.

           Beat.

                                 WOLF
                        You know I have a kid, right?

           With his last remaining strength, Wolf reaches up and grabs 
           Douglas by the shirt collars. Desperate. Dying.

                                 WOLF (CONT’D)
                        I HAVE A FUCKIN KID!

                                 DOUGLAS
                        You should’ve thought of that a 
                        long time ago.

                                 WOLF
                        Please don’t let that be the last 
                        thing I hear before I die.

           Another beat. Douglas stone-cold. Expressionless.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        You tried to rape my girlfriend, 
                        Walter Wallace. And now you’re 
                        gonna rot in hell for it.

           Wolf coughs up blood. It coats his lips. And then he starts 
           to cry. It’s soft. But very real.

                                 WOLF
                        I’m beggin you, Dougie. Please. 
                        Something smart. Anything.

           Douglas considers. Beat. Finally, with quiet conviction --

                                 DOUGLAS
                        My father always says that God is  
                        benevolent. Now I know he’s wrong.
                             (beat)
                        God is angry.

           And with that, we watch as Wolf, born Walter Franklin 
           Wallace, dies on the couch with a final look of agony.

           The room is dead quiet. Douglas stands. Wipes his hands down 
           his face as if the afternoon might wipe away with it.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                             (sotto, RE: San Supay)
                        He saw my face.
                             (beat)
                        He saw my face.
                             (beat)
                        HE SAW MY FUCKING FACE!

                                 LUCKY
                        You’re in it now, Dougie.

           Douglas whips around. Vicious now.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        My name is Douglas. You understand 
                        me? Douglas. And what kind of a 
                        name is Lucky, anyway? Considering 
                        the circumstances it’s laughable.

                                 LUCKY
                        Come on, nigga, there’s no reason 
                        to get  --

                                 DOUGLAS
                        JUST SHUT UP AND LET ME THINK FOR A 
                        SECOND! Can you do that? Are you 
                        capable of doing that? 
           Lucky and Lawrence slowly back away. These two are not 
           leaders. They’re followers. And Wolf’s death may have just 
           passed the torch.

           Douglas paces, rubbing his temples in slow, contemplative 
           circles. Mustering every iota of his body not to lose it.

           Finally -- He moves quickly to the door.

           Lucky, almost scared, a new reverent tenor in his voice, 
           steps into his path.

                                 LUCKY
                        Where you goin, Dougie--             
                        I mean Douglas.

           But Douglas drills past him. Door SLAMS. He’s gone.

           INT. GEORGE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           George in his recliner, reading DANTE, a pen underlining 
           passages, when SUDDENLY --

           The front door opens hard and his son rushes past him. He 
           gets up from his chair, puts on glasses and follows suit. 
           When he gets to Douglas’ bedroom door, it’s shut. 

           KNOCK KNOCK... Radio silence.

                                 GEORGE
                        Douglas?

           Still nothing.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Douglas? Where have you been? It’s 
                        past dinner time.

                                 DOUGLAS (O.S.)
                        Leave me the fuck alone, George.

           Whoa. First name. A beat. He creaks open the door to find --

           His son, turned away, staring out through the window at an 
           endless matrix of chain-link fences. 

           George walks on egg shells. Unsure of the moment.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’ve never called me George 
                        before.
                                 DOUGLAS
                             (vicious)
                        Get used to it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Douglas, please turn around.

           And so he does. But slowly. George’s eyes immediately widen 
           at the state of his son’s bloodied appearance.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s name have you done, 
                        boy?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        What have I done?
                             (beat)
                        WHAT HAVE I DONE?!

           Douglas is enraged.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        It was supposed to be clean. I do 
                        what he says and nobody gets hurt. 
                        But you had to be a fucking soldier 
                        boy, didn’t you?

                                 GEORGE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        You went to his home. You 
                        threatened him.

                                 GEORGE
                             (hard)
                        I was trying to protect my son.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Well take a good hard look at what 
                        that means.

           Douglas thrusts his blood-stained arms in the air.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t my blood, George. Do you 
                        want to know who’s blood this is? 
                        It’s actually a mixture. The first 
                        belongs to a Mexican thug whose 
                        brother is a ten foot tall, trigger 
                        happy psychopath now hell bent on 
                        slicing my throat. The second 
                        belongs to Wolf’s intestines. Oh, 
                        and worth noting... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        they’re both dead.
                             (beat)
                        So YOU TELL ME, Soldier Boy, was 
                        the juice worth the squeeze? ‘Cuz 
                        in my book, this is a million miles 
                        away from “protecting my son.”

           Long beat. George moves toward Douglas.

                                 GEORGE
                        Let me see you.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Stay away from me.

           He means it, too. But George doesn’t back off. Tries to grab 
           his son’s arms. Douglas wrenches them away. George tries 
           harder. And then it happens --

           Douglas’ fist is suddenly swinging through the air --

           And BAM, PUNCHES his father hard in the face. George stumbles 
           back, his glasses flying off and cracking against the wall.

           The Douglas of old might have snapped back to reality, rushed 
           to his father’s aid, turned remorseful. But not new Douglas. 
           He’s different now. Crossed an irreversible threshold.

           Father and Son, breathing hard, stare at each other ten feet 
           apart. The space between them seems to be ripping in half.

           LONG SILENCE... then GEORGE’S OMNISCIENT VOICE --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        You ever had that feeling like 
                        you’ve walked into the wrong story?

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Where George glides his razor down the ridge of Virgil’s 
           right jaw line. Wipes the grey-peppered hair across his 
           apron.

           WE TRACK across the faces of the Barbershop Jury...

                                 GEORGE
                        You keep telling yourself, this 
                        can’t be right, this isn’t my 
                        story. Somebody must have gotten it 
                        wrong... 
           George pivots to the counter and dips a brush into the warm, 
           soapy water. Suddenly, he and Virgil locks eyes through the 
           mirror. It’s electric. A peculiar, almost lonely exchange.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RUNDOWN HOUSE - DAY

           DOUGLAS BECOMES THE WOLF

           He oversees two gruff-looking ARMENIAN MEN roll Wolf’s body 
           into a cocoon of thick saran wrap. Then get to work on 
           cleaning the place of the dead man’s blood.

           GEORGE’S VOICE GUIDES US --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Maybe fate got confused. Maybe 
                        you slipped through the clouds 
                        while the angels were arguing...

           Douglas pays the Men. A Blank, neutral affect.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Beatrice barely listening to a lecture. Keeps looking over at 
           an empty chair beside her. The absence feels huge.

           INT. GEORGE’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           George seated at a small table. It’s set for two. Just in 
           case. Two plates of salad and spaghetti. 

           He slowly crosses his fingers in prayer --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ... Either way, you know, you know 
                        in your bones, this just ain’t your 
                        story...

           INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY

           Douglas in a chair. Shirt off. A tattoo artist needling an 
           elaborate image onto his back...

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...You’ve heard the story a 
                        thousand times. Sure. But you’d 
                        been told it was already cast. 
                        Promised, even. The set built. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Lights hung. All the lines 
                        rehearsed and memorized...

           The needle is pulled away to reveal --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...You were gonna be the one too 
                        busy to go to the show...

           A WOLF. STARING BACK AT US. 

           Not a vicious-looking wolf, however, with cruel eyes or 
           bloodied fang. But rather the essence of one. A survivor that 
           does what it does exactly because it is meant to do so.

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY, BACK YARD - NIGHT

           Bumping. Loud MUSIC. People drinking from plastic cups. 
           Cigarette and blunt smoke form pungent curls in the air.

           Amidst it all -- Douglas, in a wife beater, short dreadlocks 
           now, sits in a lawn chair reading Machiavelli’s THE PRINCE.

           Laser focus.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...But the whole time, Fate, or the 
                        Angels, or maybe just some hack 
                        writer who had dirt on God, 
                        secretly had you in mind for the 
                        understudy. And you just never even 
                        knew it...

           A scantily-clad WOMAN approaches Douglas.

                                 WOMAN
                        Wutchya’ readin, Dougie.

                                 DOUGLAS
                             (not looking up)
                        It’s Douglas.

                                 WOMAN
                        Jesus. Sorry. Wutchya readin, 
                        Douglas?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Shit you wouldn’t understand.

                                 WOMAN
                        Psh. Fine, then.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Fine, then.

           Douglas turns a page.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...And then it happens: the day 
                        when the lead actor comes down with 
                        a back case of the flu...

           The Armenian “cleaners” pull into a junk yard. Get out and 
           toss Wolf’s saran wrapped body into a CAR CRUSHER. They lite 
           up cigarettes and wait for the metal jaw to finish chewing.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Douglas, Lucky and Lawrence all brandishing shot guns. As 
           one, they put on Plague Doctor masks and jump out --

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Our Doctors marching towards the entrance...

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...So now it’s your turn. The 
                        understudy. And you’re backstage 
                        sweating. You can hear the audience 
                        breathing behind the curtain...

           They reach the door.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ... it’s show time.

           AND BAM!

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           They storm in YELLING. Everybody freaks. Arms to the sky. 

           While Lucky and Lawrence heard the cattle, Douglas walks up 
           to the CASHIER and calmly requests he empty the register.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Your first night goes well... 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A huge bag of money dropped onto the floor. Lucky and 
           Lawrence look up at Douglas smiling. He doesn’t smile back.
                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...Too well, in fact, and now your 
                        audience is hungry for more. And it 
                        feels good to be wanted, doesn’t 
                        it? There’s nothing wrong with 
                        that. So you give it to them...

           QUICK SHOTS 

           The Plague Doctors robbing a GAS STATION --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...You think you’ll do a few more 
                        shows and that’ll be that...

           Plague Doctors robbing a 7 ElEVEN --

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...You’re the understudy, after 
                        all. But night after night the lead 
                        star’s still coughin in bed while 
                        you’re out there wooing the 
                        crowd... 

           INT. GEORGE LIVING ROOM

           George on the edge of his couch. Watching the 5 o'clock News.

           ON THE TV, a FEMALE ANCHOR --

                                 FEMALE ANCHOR
                        ...a series of robberies in South 
                        Central LA this past week by a gang 
                        calling themselves, The Plague 
                        Doctors...

           B ROLL FOOTAGE shows a blurry, SECURITY CAM VIDEO of our 
           Plague Doctors holding up a SMALL BANK, guns wielding.

           Then, the SECURITY FOOTAGE turns into the real thing --

           INT. BANK - DAY

           Twenty plus PEOPLE on their stomachs. As a terrified CLERK 
           helps our gang fill up duffle bags, a VOICE PIPES up O.S.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Fuckin niggers.

           Abrupt stop. Lucky swivels. It came from a COP, stomach down 
           but chin up. Hate in his eyes. Lucky makes for him...
                                 LUCKY
                        THE FUCK YOU JUST SAY TO ME, WHITE 
                        BOY?!

           He’s JUST about to kick the cops’ head when --

                                 DOUGLAS
                        LUCKY! Settle down.

           Lucky steps aside as Douglas walks over. Crouches down. Leans 
           his PLAGUE BEAK in real close. The cop doesn’t bat an eye.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        You know what I just realized?

                                 COP
                        What?

           A beat. Douglas tilts his head to the side. Thoughtfully.

                                 DOUGLAS
                             (to Lucky)
                        Get me a sharpie.

           QUICK SHOTS of the Cop squirming as Douglas and company rip 
           off his shirt, gag him and tie him to a chair. Then --

           Douglas writes something (unseen) onto his chest. CUT TO --

           INT. SAME BANK - MINUTES LATER

           SWAT TEAM pours in to find the collateral damage. But no 
           Doctors. They take off their masks. Catch sight of the cop. 
           All their faces aghast...

           Written on the COPS CHEST in big red sharpie is:

           “I AM THE PLAGUE.”

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...And before you know it, nobody’s 
                        calling you the understudy anymore. 
                        It’s just you. You’re the man the 
                        spot light’s jonesing for...

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Masks off. Douglas behind the wheel. Slaloming through 
           traffic. Lucky and Lawrence giddy in the back.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...And the worst part of it is...
           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           The moment the Plague Doctors stumble in, Douglas grabs Lucky 
           by the shirt collars and SLAMS him hard against the wall.

                                 GEORGE (V.O.)
                        ...You realize that you’re actually 
                        really fucking good at it.

           A beat. Douglas x-raying Lucky.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Are you drunk, Lucky?

           Lucky shakes his head no but his eyes tell a different story.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                             (menacing)
                        You sure about that, Lucky. ‘Cuz 
                        your breath says otherwise. 

                                 LUCKY
                             (freaked)
                        It was a only a few, Douglas. I 
                        swear.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Elaborate on that for me, Lucky. 
                        What does a few mean you?

                                 LUCKY
                        I don’t know... two?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Two? You sure about that?

           Lucky, still pinned to the wall, gives up the ghost.

                                 LUCKY
                        Maybe it was three.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Three. Good. I like prime numbers.

           Douglas takes a step back, raises his arm to the sky and then 
           BACK HANDS Lucky hard across the face.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        One.

           BACK HANDS him again.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Two.
           And then again.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Three.

           Lucky, face now burgundy red, rises slowly from the beating.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        You ever drink on the job again and 
                        I’ll put you to bed six feet under 
                        the ground without a proper 
                        funeral. Is that understood?

           Douglas turns to Lawrence, who’s been watching at a distance.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        You have something you wanna say?

           No. No he doesn’t.

           EXT. CLUB - SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Douglas and his crew waiting in a long queue. The BOUNCER 
           catches eyes with Douglas. Covert nod. Waves him over.

           EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - SAME TIME

           Beatrice, dressed to the nines, travels in a caravan of other 
           dolled up ladies. All talking over each other. She casually 
           glances across the street... Eyes widen -- 

           Stops dead in her tracks. Double takes... it’s really him.

           Pain and anger visibly negotiate on her face.

           BACK OUTSIDE THE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Douglas and company are just about to be waved in, when --

                                 BEATRICE (O.S.)
                        DOUGLAS PINES?!

           Douglas turns just as -- SLAP!

           Beatrice lands a mighty, open-fisted crash across his face.

           She’s vibrating so hard she can barely breath. He looks up, 
           stunned, the Douglas of old almost stealing through.

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        I can smell it on you.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        What?

                                 BEATRICE
                        The silence.

           Long beat as the former lovers stare at each other. Finally --

                                 BEATRICE (CONT’D)
                        You’re The Wolf now.

           Her face looks like it’s about to break... but it doesn’t.

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Total silence. Only breathing heard. 

           Then -- the sandpaper SCRAPE of George shaving clean the rest 
           of Virgil’s upper lip. He wipes off leftover foam.

                                 GEORGE
                        Douglas was only 8 years-old when 
                        his mother passed. After the wake, 
                        he told me that he hated God. And 
                        asked why the best ones always die.

           He turns to his counter. Wipes his hands on a towel.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        The question haunted me for weeks. 
                        I couldn’t give him a good answer.
                             (beat)
                        But then one night I had a dream... 
                        I’m walking through a meadow at 
                        sunrise. The meadow is split in 
                        two. Beautiful flowers on the 
                        right, ugly ones on the left. 
                        Suddenly, in the distance, I see my 
                        wife approaching. I want to make a 
                        bouquet for her, have something 
                        nice to give her when she arrives. 
                             (beat)
                        And then it hits me. Clear as day. 
                        Which flowers are you gonna choose, 
                        George? The worst. Or the best.

           Suddenly, the two men catch eyes in the mirror.

           CLOSE ON VIRGIL’S FACE

           Something new there. But what is it?
                                 VIRGIL
                        Excuse me for a moment, Barber.

           Slowly, George unties his smock. Lays it over the chair. 

           And then the Barbershop Jury watches as the Detective limps 
           his way across the room and disappear into the back --

           INT. BARBERSHOP BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Virgil boring into the mirror. Into himself. Suddenly --

                                 VIRGIL
                             (sotto)
                        We sit in the fire...              
                        We bleed ashes...                 
                        And then we stand back up.             

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GAS STATION FOOD STORE - AFTERNOON

           Six years ago.

           Virgil off-duty. Younger, brighter, clean shaven. No limp. 

           He stands at the register with his WIFE (Sarah) and their 
           eight year-old SON. They make a quiet but happy trio.

           The Son puts an ALMOND JOY onto the counter.

                                 SARAH
                        No sugar before dinner.

                                 SON
                        But there’s coconut in it.

                                 SARAH
                             (warm laugh)
                        And that’s supposed to make it 
                        healthy? Nice try, kiddo.

                                 SON
                        Our Health Ed teacher said that 
                        coconut oil improves blood 
                        cholesterol levels. 

           Virgil smiles. Kid’s are born lawyers. He hands the candy bar 
           to the CASHIER. Sarah smirks.

                                 VIRGIL 
                        That’ll do it.
           Then BAM! The FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN as TWO MEN wearing ski 
           masks storm into the store. Waving handguns recklessly.

                                 MAN 1
                        EVERYBODY ON THE FUCKING GROUND!

           FIVE OR SO PEOPLE do as their told.

                                 MAN 2
                             (to Man 1)
                        I’m ‘a check the back. You deal 
                        with the punjab.

           He disappears. 

           MAN 1 aims at the Cashier. Throws a bag at him.

                                 MAN 1
                        Hurry up, Punjab! 

           Virgil and his family are flat on their stomachs. Slowly, 
           imperceptibly, Virgil inches his fingers towards the back of 
           his pants. A concealed GUN. Sarah notices --

                                 SARAH
                             (sotto)
                        Virgil, no.

                                 VIRGIL
                             (sotto)
                        Just stay down.

           He locks eyes with his Son. A silent understanding. Stay put. 

           Virgil stands. Slowly. Unholsters his gun. Aims at Man 1.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a Glock 23 aimed at you 
                        right now, son, with 15 magazines 
                        of lead desperately interested in 
                        exploring the back of your head.

           Man 1 doesn’t budge.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        So let’s just calmly put the gun 
                        down and place our heads over our 
                        head. How does that sound.

           Long beat. Man 1 frozen.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not gonna ask you --
           Suddenly -- Man 2 materializes on the far side of the room. 
           Raises his gun. COCKS. Virgil doesn’t see it. But Sarah does.

                                 SARAH
                        NOOOO!!

           She springs.

                                 SON
                        MOM!!

           He springs.

           Just as Man 2 FIRES OFF TWO ROUNDS -- 

           Sarah and the Boy have entered the BULLETS PATH --

           They collapse like broken toys at Virgil’s feet.

           Man 1 finally turns around.

                                 MAN 1
                             (off bodies)
                        Holy shit.

           He looks to Virgil, whose gun is now lowered. Paralyzed. 
           Gazing down at something that can’t possibly be real.

                                 MAN 1 (CONT’D)
                             (to Man 2)
                        We gotta roll, Barry. Like double 
                        quick. C’mon!

           But the ski-mask-obscured man known as Barry is paralyzed. 
           Feet like anvils. What’s going on behind that mask?

                                 MAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        You deaf, Barry?! C’MON!

           Still nothing.

                                 MAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it. I’m gone.

           Sharp DING as the door flies open and Man 1 disappears.

           And then it happens --

           Barry drops his gun to the floor. Or, to put it another way, 
           the gun drops him. They no longer suit each other. 

                                 BARRY
                             (sotto)
                        Oh my God.
           He takes off his mask...

           Revealed is not a hostile face. Not even close. You might 
           even call it kind. The face of BLACK MAN (30’s) who just 
           happened to have been born on the wrong block.               
           On the wrong day.                                            
           In the wrong year.                                           
           In the wrong life. 

           A rag doll of circumstance.

           He looks directly at Virgil. Their eyes lock. His face 
           struggling to find some sort of appropriate expression. 

           Finally --

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Please kill me.

           And he means it.

           Virgil points his gun at Barry. The total some of his body’s 
           blood pulsing in a single trigger finger...

           SLOW PUSH IN ON VIRGIL 

           No longer a man. A pawn in a fucked-up game of chance.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON, LOS ANGELES COUNTY - DAY

           Six years later.

           And Virgil’s face wears them heavily.

           We’re at SECURITY CHECK IN -- where he drops his gun, badge, 
           and keys in a plastic bin, then walks through a METAL 
           DETECTOR. Several familiar nods exchanged.

           BEEP BEEP. Virgil forgot about his DOG TAGS.

           Takes them off. Delicately. Places them into the plastic bin.

           INT. PRISON CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME TIME

           Twenty INMATES (all different ages), sit in a window-less 
           room. It’s fucking depressing. But their faces, ironically, 
           are somewhat lit up, captivated, hungry for something...

           ANGLE 180 degrees to find --
           The MAN who killed Virgil’s family: Barry Jones. 40 now. 
           Built. Handsome. Confident disposition. A Bible in one hand. 

           We find him mid sentence --

                                 BARRY
                        Now I want y’all to throw away that 
                        God’s wrath business. Okay. God’s 
                        anger. Fire and brimstone. 
                        Armageddon. All that Old Testament 
                        shit. We’re throwin it all right 
                        out the window. ‘Cuz I got news for 
                        you: there ain’t no such thing as 
                        Hell. God and the Devil ain’t 
                        fighten for your soul. Heaven and 
                        Hell are decided right here.

           He points authoritatively at the ground.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        RIGHT HERE. On Earth. This is where 
                        we get to decide which kingdom we 
                        gonna build. You understand me?

           All of the Inmates nod as one.

           Barry opens his Bible to an ear-marked passage.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Isaiah 43: 25 through 26. God says, 
                        “I am he who blots out your 
                        transgressions, for my own sake, 
                        and remembers your sins no more. 
                        Review the past for me, let us 
                        argue the matter together; state 
                        the case for your innocence.”

           A beat. Barry shuts the Bible.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        State the case for your innocence.

           He paces the front. Essays the room.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Now a lot ‘a folks out there gonna 
                        say I’m tryin to debunk personal 
                        accountability. But that ain’t what 
                        I’m doin. When we say, “state the 
                        case of your innocence,” what we 
                        really talkin about is you takin a 
                        microscope to each and every moment 
                        of your past to figure out what 
                        shit was beyond your control. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Cuz I’m looking around the room 
                        right now and I can’t seem to find 
                        a single bad man...

           Passionate nods. They want to believe him. Desperately.

                                 BARY
                        No, sir! Not an evil man in the 
                        house tonight! What I see is a 
                        bunch a strong, good men, who just 
                        happen to lose their way.
                             (BEAT)
                        But we gonna find it again, 
                        gentlemen, I assure you that. So 
                        make your case. What were you up 
                        against?

           Suddenly, a PRISON GUARD quietly steps in and approaches 
           Barry. A certain reverence with which he does so --

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Detective Marx is here for you.

           If Barry is troubled by this news, he doesn’t show it.

           INT. PRISON VISITORS ROOM - SAME TIME

           Several metal tables scattered throughout. Wives, Mothers 
           Sons, Daughters, all interacting with men who may or may not 
           be ever coming home. It’s a bitter sweet tableau.

           Virgil sits at a table for two. Fingers crossed, almost in 
           prayer. Wholly focused on a patch of floor.

           The ANGRY SOUND of a security door unlocking and he looks up--

           In walks Barry Jones. Bible in hand.

           Moments later, they’re seated across from each other.

           A Beat. Then, with atonement in every syllable --

                                 BARRY
                        Mr. Marx.

                                 VIRGIL
                        You gotta stop calling me that, 
                        Barry. It’s been six years.

           Barry nods. Let’s try that again --

                                 BARRY
                        Virgil.
           Another beat. Months of silence thawing out. Finally --

                                 VIRGIL
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 BARRY
                        Of course.

                                 VIRGIL
                             (Off Bible)
                        You really believe in all that... 
                        savior business?

           Barry lets out a partial, almost exhausted sort of laugh.

                                 BARRY
                        Well, it sure as hell makes my 
                        prison cell seem bigger.

           Virgil smiles a weary smile.  

                                 VIRGIL
                        You know, Barry. Coming here and 
                        talking to you like this has 
                        probably been one of the only good 
                        parts of my life.
                             (beat)
                        Isn’t that strange, how the world 
                        works? You tell this story to 
                        someone, the two of us, talking 
                        like this, they’d say you’re 
                        insane. But it’s true. You might 
                        know me better than anyone else on 
                        this whole damn planet.

                                 BARRY
                        I feel the same way, Virgil.

           They stare at each other. A powerful, convoluted mixture of 
           pain, remorse, anger. Maybe even something like love.

                                 VIRGIL
                        But the thing that breaks my heart? 
                             (pause)
                        I hate you. I hate you, Barry 
                        Jones. More than anyone I’ve ever 
                        known. And I’m not sure I know what 
                        to do about that.

           Barry lowers his eyes.

                                 BARRY
                        I hate me, too. Every single day.
           Beat. Then Barry holds up his Bible. A time-worn thing.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        This is what I do about it.
                             (pause)
                        What do you do?

           Virgil offers a broken grin.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Whiskey.

           Barry laughs.

                                 BARRY
                        Shit. If I’m gonna be entirely 
                        honest with myself, I could use a 
                        stiff drink, too.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Well maybe in another life we can 
                        grab one sometime.

                                 BARRY
                        I’ll be lookin forward to it.

           They share a smile. It’s a genuine, unspoiled one.

           Beat. Barry studying Virgil. Finally --

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        There a particular reason you here 
                        today, Virgil?

           Virgil, staring at the floor, takes a deep breath.

                                 VIRGIL
                        You’re gonna hear about me on the 5 
                        o’clock news tomorrow, Barry, and I 
                        just wanted you to know...

           He looks up.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        ... I want you know that I didn’t 
                        do it out of any... misguided sense 
                        of revenge. You’ll never fully 
                        understand, but I’m doing it for 
                        the right reasons. I need you to 
                        believe that.

           Barry takes this in. Nods gravely.
                                 BARRY
                        If you want me to believe you, 
                        Virgil, then I’ll believe you.

           Suddenly, a LOUD BUZZER.

                                 PRISON GUARD (O.S.)
                        Visiting time is over.

           A beat. Then --

           We watch as these two broken men do what we can only assume 
           is a years-old catechism.

                                 BARRY
                        We sit in the fire.

                                 VIRGIL
                        We bleed ashes.

                                 BARRY
                        And then we stand back up.

           They stand and shake hands. It’s a full-bodied shake.

                                 VIRGIL
                        You’re a good man, Barry Jones.
                             (pause)
                        You always were.

                                 BARRY
                        Same goes for you, Virgil Marx.

           And with that, Barry watches Virgil disappear. 

           EXT. VIRGIL’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Virgil lets himself in. A carton of NICORETTE under one arm.

           The place is small, a little claustrophobiac. The maximum 
           comfort that Social Security checks can get you. 

           But it’s cozy, too. Feels lived-in. 

           Virgil enters the DINING ROOM, where a half-smoked cigarette 
           leans against an ashtray. Still burning. He sits.

                                 VIRGIL
                        I’m here, ma.

           A beat. Then --
           MAGGIE MARX (the Old Woman from our earlier news footage) 
           enters the room. She’s mid-70’s, a shriveled grape, gnarly 
           scar over her larynx. But despite it all, it’s clear she used 
           to be quite the looker.

           In her right hand is an ELECTRIC BUZZER.

           She sits down across from Virgil. Crosses her legs. Picks up 
           the burning cigarette and drags deep. 

           She looks at the Nicorette carton and smirks. 

           NOTE TO READER: Every time Maggie speaks, she will place the 
           Electric Buzzer against her throat. 

           Out comes an eerie, metallic voice --

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nice try.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Ma, you’ve got a hole in your lung 
                        for Christ’s sake.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Quality of life. Not Quantity, boy. 
                        I don’t understand why everyone’s 
                        so keen on this immortality 
                        business. You ask me?... Life is 
                        poor, nasty, brutish and short. And 
                        it’s ’sposed to be that way.
                             (beat)
                        Who was it said that? One of them 
                        famous depressed guys, I think.

           Virgil almost laughs. His mom’s an impenetrable force.

           A beat. Virgil openly pensive. Drumming on the table.

           Suddenly, he reaches over, pulls a cigarette out from his 
           mother’s pack and lights up. Deep drag.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Those’ll kill you, ya know?

           He throws her a playful fuck off look.

           Mother and Son smoke in silence. Just the cigarette hiss of 
           their inhales. Finally, she squints hard at him --

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What’d you do, boy?
                                 VIRGIL
                        What do you mean?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You got that same look on your face 
                        you used to get when you was gonna 
                        confess to sumthin stupid as hell.

           Virgil remains quiet. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Well out with it, boy.

           He meets his mama’s eyes --

                                 VIRGIL
                        You’re gonna have the media 
                        swarming all over your lawn like 
                        cockroaches in the next couple of 
                        days.

           Beat. She takes a drag. Squints at him even harder.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You fixin to do sumthin stupid?

                                 VIRGIL
                        Depends on who you ask.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m asking you.

           Virgil takes a final drag. Cashes it in the tray. Stands. 

                                 VIRGIL
                        No. Not stupid. Dumb, maybe. But 
                        not stupid.

           Maggie smiles.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll take dumb over stupid any day.

           INT. FRONT ENTRY WAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Virgil and Maggie at the door. She cups her hands around his 
           face. Knuckles like tree knots and fingers stained yellow.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (a scratchy whisper)
                        You ain’t half as mean as you think 
                        you are, Virgil Jon Marx.
           She lowers his head and kisses him on the forehead.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BARBERSHOP BATHROOM - PRESENT DAY

           Where Virgil is glued to his reflection. A beat. Deep breath.

           INT. BARBERSHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Virgil limps back into the main room. The collective GAZE of 
           the Customers following him back to the chair.

           He sits.

           George’s back is turned. Sharpening the razor. Suddenly --

           He and Virgil catch eyes in the mirror. Linger a moment...

           George averts. Turns. Ties a fresh smock around Virgil’s 
           neck. Retrieves an already soapy brush and begins to apply 
           the warm lather to the hair around his Adam’s Apple.

           Several seconds of silence. Brushing...

           Finished, George gently pushes on Virgil’s forehead with his 
           left hand. Balances the razor on his throat with the right.

                                 GEORGE
                        Your turn.

           Virgil yields to the razor, craning his neck. Exposed 
           jugular.

           SMOOTH, CRISP SCRAPES as the razor makes semicircles around 
           Virgil’s bulging Adam’s Apple.

           He closes his eyes. Goes somewhere inside. And then --

           THE YARN

                                 VIRGIL
                        I heard a story once about a cop at 
                        the end of his rope... 

           Beat. He opens them. Anchors to the ceiling.
                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Dead wife. Dead son. He’s paid his 
                        dues, faked the straight and 
                        narrow, put on a god damn smile for 
                        ten fuckin years and now he’s ready 
                        to cash in and call it quits. 
                        Retire on a deserted beach 
                        somewhere.
                             (beat)
                        Somewhere without human voices.

           George wipes the razor clean. Returns it to Virgil’s throat. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        And then it happens. Signs. Omens. 
                        Harbingers. Everywhere. Cropping up 
                        all over town. Like the universe 
                        itself was talking right to him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           We’re looking up through the WINDSHIELD. 

           Briefly, but just long enough to see it, a sagging telephone 
           wire passes our field of vision. Dangling from it -- 

           A lynched VOODOO DOLL (maybe one foot tall) wearing none 
           other... than a Plague Doctor Mask.

           We PAN DOWN to reveal Virgil, behind the wheel, looking up at 
           the eerie death totem.

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        Sueños Norteños was sending a 
                        message. A deafening message. 
                             (beat)
                        Douglas Pines is a dead man.

           QUICK SHOTS of more VOODOO DOLLS dangling from different 
           telephone wires. All wearing the beaked mask. PRE LAP --

           INT. NEWS ROOM STUDIO

           FEMALE ANCHOR speaking into the camera. B ROll in the corner.

                                 FEMALE ANCHOR
                        An eerie sight cropped up in the 
                        Southland this week. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FEMALE ANCHOR (CONT'D)
                        What appears to be a voodoo doll of 
                        the notorious Plague Doctor gang, 
                        hanging from telephone wires all 
                        over the city. 

           EXT. RUNDOWN STREET - DEAD OF NIGHT

           WIDE ON a large, crumbling brick wall. 

           We hear the rhythmic shake of several spray paint canisters. 

           THREE SHADOWY FIGURES enter the frame with ladders. Which 
           they lean against the wall.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                             (in Spanish)
                        This should get his attention.

           A beat. Then the spray cans get to work.

           EXT. SAME - EARLY MORNING

           The warm, honeyed glow of Magic Hour now lights up the wall.

           What we see is a startling vision. Something right out of 
           Dante’s Inferno. A Graffiti masterpiece A la Gustave Doré's 
           illustrations of the epic poem. And at the center of it all -- 

           A solitary Plague Doctor, hunched, surrounded by hell hounds. 
           Mouths gnashing. About to lunge. A darkly beautiful sight.

           WE PULL BACK to reveal a LARGE CROWD amassed. A quiet sense 
           of awe. Among them are Lucky and Lawrence. 

           They look at each other. Terrified.

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Virgil’s throat almost horizontal. George’s razor gliding 
           gracefully upward. Clean skin in tow.

                                 VIRGIL
                        So the cop saw his chance.
                             (beat)
                        And he took it.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Somewhere in Echo Park. The part not gentrified yet.

           WIDE ON A SMALL HOUSE

           A police car pulls up to the curb and parks. 

           INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Virgil in the passenger seat. Behind the wheel, NINA GOMEZ, 
           Latina, late 30’s, a fiery tom-boy.

                                 NINA
                        So how are we doing this?

                                 VIRGIL
                        I go in. Have a nice little chat. 
                        If I’m not out in 15 minutes you 
                        come in with the warrant.

                                 NINA
                        Why do they call him San Supay?

                                 VIRGIL
                        He’s the Incan God of Death.

                                 NINA
                        Jesus. Homeboy’s got an ego on him.

           Virgil half-guffaws. You can say that again.

           He reaches into the glove box. Pulls out a PISTOL fashioned 
           with a SILENCER.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        15 minutes. Not a second more. 
                             (pause)
                        And no John Wayne shit. Choose your 
                        words carefully. This guy kills 
                        with impunity.

           Virgil nods. Just as he opens the door to get out --

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Virgil.

           He turns.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        Why you bringing the silencer?
                                 VIRGIL
                        Too lazy to take it off.

           Holsters it. Shuts the door.

           EXT. SAN SUPAY’S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Virgil KNOCKS. Not even remotely nervous. Or at least that’s 
           the vibe he’s radiating. Wait a moment. And then --

           The door opens. But just a sliver. The face of a MEXICAN MAN 
           appears. Without skipping a beat, he laughs. Loud and cocky.

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                        No. Fucking. Shit.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                             (in Spanish)
                        Who is it?

                                 MEXICAN MAN 
                        The pigs.
                             (beat)
                        What you want, white boy? 

                                 VIRGIL
                        A word with San Supay.

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                        You got a warrant?

           Virgil matches the Man’s cocky smile.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Listen, vato, I’m guessing you’ve 
                        been playing this game long enough 
                        to know it doesn’t make a fucking 
                        difference one way or the other.

           A beat.

                                 SAN SUPAY (O.S.)
                        LET HIM IN!

           The door opens further and the Mexican Man lets Virgil 
           through. Hovering close. Chest grazing his movements.

           INT. SAN SUPAY’S RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

           Where we find five MEMBERS of Sueños Norteõs gathered around 
           a couch. All packing. Gun handles poking through their pants. 
           Sitting on the couch is their ring leader -- San Supay. Say 
           what you will about him, the man’s presence is huge. 
           Piercing, intelligent, creative-looking eyes.

           He seems to be seeing everything at once.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        Take a seat, officer.

           Virgil sits in an armchair directly across from San Supay.

                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for you?

                                 VIRGIL
                        It’s pretty simple, actually.
                             (beat)
                        Pay me to kill Douglas Pines.

           San Supay and company all break out into raucous laughter.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                             (in Spanish)
                        We got ourselves a fucking comedian 
                        up in here, boys!!

           Laughing continues. It’s kind of contagious. Virgil joins in.

           Then suddenly addresses San Supay in Spanish. Which 
           immediately shuts every body up.

                                 VIRGIL
                             (in Spanish)
                        You know what’s even funnier? My 
                        partner’s waiting outside with a 
                        warrant for your arrest and she’s 
                        gonna be knocking on the door in...
                             (check his watch)
                        ... ten minutes. Which gives us 
                        just enough time to make ourselves 
                        a little deal.

           Beat. 

           Pin-drop silence. San Supay doesn’t look so bubbly anymore.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        What deal?

           Virgil reaches into his shirt, at which point everyone 
           reaches for their guns. He holds up a calming hand --

           Don’t worry.
           Retrieved is a simple piece of paper. Virgil places it on the 
           coffee table. Taps it with his forefinger and we CUT --

           CLOSE ON THE PAPER

           Where a blurry SECURITY CAM STILL shows a MAN in a ski mask 
           clutching an Assault Rifle, mid robbery. Particularly 
           noticeable is the Man’s arm, which dons a tattoo of the 
           Virgin Marry with the Ouroboros (snake eating its own tail) 
           coming out of her mouth and wrapping a figure eight around 
           her body. Mouth and tail meeting over her chest.

           Virgil smiles. Points to San Supay’s right arm --

           He’s got the same tat.

                                 VIRGIL
                        You know, you’re probably the only 
                        vato in town that I can think of 
                        who has that tattoo. Which means...
                             (beat)
                        ... that you’re also probably the 
                        only vato in town who hit up the 
                        Chase Bank in Eagle Rock last 
                        Tuesday. So you either go to the 
                        fucking prom with me, San Supay, or 
                        I let your time run out.

           He checks his watch.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Seven minutes.

           INT. POLICE CAR - SAME TIME

           Nina. Antsy as hell. Keeps checking the time... 

           BACK INSIDE SAN SUPAY’S

           We’re a rubber band about to snap. 

           A beat. San Supay reigns his confidence back.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        You know what Sueños Norteõs means, 
                        offcier?

                                 VIRGIL
                        Northern dream.
                                 SAN SUPAY
                        That’s right. Es verdad. And you 
                        know why we call ourselves that?

                                 VIRGIL
                        I haven’t the faintest idea.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        Irony.

           He leans towards Virgil. Crosses his fingers.

                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT’D)
                        You know what irony is, don’t you, 
                        officer?

           Virgil is a blank stare.

                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT’D)
                        It’s like a surprise. At the end of 
                        a story. When the meaning is the 
                        opposite of what you thought.

                                 VIRGIL
                             (checks watch)
                        Six minutes and counting...

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        It’s ironic, because we come to 
                        this country looking for a dream...

           He waves his arms around the room...

                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT’D)
                        ... But all we find are nightmares.

           Beat. Virgil and San Supay stare at each other. Finally --

                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT’D)
                        You familiar with the Mexican 
                        American War, officer?

                                 VIRGIL
                        Vaguely.

           Virgil couldn’t care less. Checks his watch.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Five minutes.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        In the Spring of 1845 your country 
                        stole what you now call Texas. But 
                        that wasn’t enough, esse, was it? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT'D)
                        Manifest Destiny’s a fucking 
                        drug, no? 
                             (taps his vein)
                        Gotta get that fix. So then you 
                        took little more.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Four minutes.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        In 1846, you marched into Alta 
                        California, what is now Los 
                        Angeles, and laid waste to my 
                        ancestors. Then wrote up a little 
                        treaty to legitimize your blood 
                        lust. What was it called?

                                 MEXICAN MAN (O.S.)
                        Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        That’s right. The Treaty of 
                        Guadalupe Hidalgo. Crazy, no? What 
                        a little piece a paper can get you? 

                                 VIRGIL
                        Yeah. It sure is. Two minutes.

           INT. POLICE CAR - SAME TIME

           Nina checks her watch. Time’s just about up. She reaches into 
           the glove box and pulls out the WARRANT. 

           BACK INSIDE SAN SUPAY’S

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        So let’s just say, hypothetically, 
                        that Sueños Norteños did hit up 
                        that bank in Eagle Rock last 
                        Tuesday. Wouldn’t we just be takin 
                        back what’s rightfully ours?

           A Beat. Virgil picks up the blurry PHOTOGRAPH of San Supay’s 
           tattooed arm. Then pulls out a cigarette lighter. Flicks it. 
           Holds the flame an inch below the paper.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Listen to me very closely, San 
                        Supay, or whatever the fuck your 
                        real name is. Maybe some other time 
                        can we argue the finer points of 
                        American imperialism. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VIRGIL (CONT'D)
                        But right now, I’m not speaking in 
                        hypotheticals. I’m blackmailing 
                        you. So you can either pay me half 
                        for Pine’s death and this goes 
                        away...

           The flame hits the photograph. Catches fire. Virgil places it 
           down on the coffee table as it burns.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        ... or you start praying to God 
                        that you don’t become someone’s 
                        prison bitch.

           Long beat. Supay’s fierce, creative eyes boring into Virgil.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                             (in Spanish)
                        How do I know you’re not gonna 
                        double cross me?

           Suddenly -- Virgil throws his BADGE into the air and whips 
           out his SILENCER. Everyone present rapidly draws their guns. 

           But Virgil isn’t aiming for them. He’s zeroed in on the 
           BADGE. And CLICK --

           A MUFFLED PING as the BADGE bounces off the wall.

           He re-holsters his gun. 

                                 VIRGIL
                             (in Spanish)
                        That’s why.

           A beat. Then --

           San Supay CLAPS his hands hard and starts laughing.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        FUCK! HOMIE’S GOT BALLS!

           His Posse begins to laugh as well. But apprehensively. Is 
           this friend or foe laughter?

                                 SAN SUPAY (CONT’D)
                        I like that. I FUCKIN like that.

           Virgil pulls out another piece of paper. Taps it. An address.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Money is here by 330 tomorrow or 
                        the deal is off.
           Then he reaches into his pocket and pulls out what looks to 
           be a small bottle of CONCEALER. Places it on the table.

                                 SAN SUPAY
                        What the fuck is that?

           EXT. SAN SUPAY’S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Nina walking aggressively up the foot path. 

           Just as she gets to the door -- it OPENS! Virgil just 
           stepping out. He nods at her.

                                 VIRGIL
                        We’re all good here, Gomez.

                                 NINA
                        Let me see it.

           Virgil lightly pushes Nina back.

                                 VIRGIL
                        He’s not our man. We got it wrong.

                                 NINA
                        Let me fuckin see it!

           Smiling, San Supay steps into view and stretches out his arm--

           Blank skin. No tattoo to speak of.

                                 NINA (CONT’D)
                        But I thought --

                                 VIRGIL
                        Let’s get outta here, Gomez.

           Nina turns. Baffled. Heads towards the car...

           Just as Virgil turns with her --

                                 SAN SUPAY
                             (sotto to Virgil)
                        Kill’em slowly. For my brother.

           He and Virgil share one final cryptic glance, then Virgil 
           follows Nina back to the car.

           INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Nina turns on the ignition.
                                 NINA
                        What’d he say to you back there?

                                 VIRGIL
                        Nothing.

           BACK INSIDE SAN SUPAY’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Grinning, San Supay turns from the door, licks his finger and 
           wipes it across his forearm. A sliver of the Virgin Mary and 
           her cannibalizing snake comes back to life.

           INT. VIRGIL’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           A weak dawn light seeping in through the windows.          
           Virgil wide awake in bed.                                     
           He hasn’t slept yet. A beat.                                  
           Swivels to the edge of his bed.                            
           Looks around the room. 

           CLOSE ON A RECORD PLAYER

           Erik Satie’s Gnossienne No.1 is unsheathed. Needle touches 
           vinyl and the eerie, meditative sonata CRACKLES to life. 

           It’s the kind of piece a man listens to who deals with his 
           emotions intellectually.

           AS SATIE PLAYS, WE SEE THE FOLLOWING:

           Slow, expressionless, Virgil packs up his home. Everything 
           going into boxes. Clothes. Kitchen ware. Books. Furniture 
           bubble wrapped and tucked into the living room corner. 

           An entire life disassembled.

           Finally, all that’s left is his bed and an armoire. On top of 
           which is the PHOTOGRAPH of his late wife and son.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - LATER THAT DAY

           Erik Satie continues...

           Ominous grey sky above. Pregnant with lightening.

           Virgil approaches two adjacent TOMBSTONES with flowers. 

           The larger one reads: Sarah Marx.                          
           The smaller: George Marx.

           Virgil kneels. Gently lays down the flowers. Closes his eyes. 
           A beat. Virgil traveling some inner landscape. 

           EXT. DECREPID APARTMENT BUILDING, BACK ALLEY - LATER

           Satie continues...

           A Car parks next to a metal stairwell.

           Out steps Virgil. Holding a large duffle bag. 

           He climbs the steps to a door that looks like it hasn’t been 
           opened in eons. Under the matt is a key.

           INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           “Apartment” is generous. A room. A decrepit room. The same 
           one, in fact, as the very beginning of our story. 

           Flaking walls, peeling linoleum, holes in the plaster that 
           reveal the rotting wooden guts of its infrastructure. But 
           nobody’s bleeding to death on the floor just yet. 

           Not yet.

           Just beside the door is a METAL BRIEFCASE. SNAP. Virgil opens 
           it: a large collection of bills. San Supay followed through.

           Virgil unzips his duffle bag and pulls out the following:

           Domestic cleaning supplies.                                         
           Black leather gloves.                                    
           Metal pliers.                                                                               
           A Ziplock bag.                                                 
           A hair buzzer and razor.                                                  
           A business suit.                                              
           A fifth of whiskey.                                        
           Duck tape.                                                                             
           And lastly... a Glock 23.

           Across the room are two wooden chairs, one free standing and 
           the other bolted to the wall. The latter has hand cuffs 
           dangling from one of its arms.

           In a word, the place looks like a torture chamber.

           SAME - LATER

           QUICK SHOTS of Virgil, gloves on, cleaning the room top to 
           bottom. Wall to wall. Not an inch overlooked.
           Finished, he takes stock. Satisfied with his work. Forensics 
           couldn’t hold a candle to this place. 

           He’s ready. 

           EXT. SMALL RUNDOWN HOUSE - DAY

           Same one Virgil raided at the beginning.

           Erik Satie finishes his sonata. 

           And now we’re caught up. Minutes away from where our story 
           began. Virgil parks at the curb. Kills the engine.

           Above and around -- a dense, metal-grey sky. Lightening makes 
           blue gashes in the distance. Low growl of THUNDER.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Virgil stares through the window at the ramshackle house...

           He doesn’t look like a man capable of evil. Capable of what 
           we know he’s about to do. Instead, we see a sad, war-haunted 
           vet doing everything in his power to stave off fear.

           Long beat. Finally --

                                 VIRGIL
                        Get out of the car, Marx.
                             (beat)
                        Get out of the car.
                             (beat)
                        GET OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR!

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Virgil EXPLODES out of his car with purpose. Utterly 
           transformed. Mr. Hyde with a glock and badge.

           Up the unkempt lawn.                                         
           A bat outta hell.                                           
           Body vibrating.                                                   
           He looks fucking deranged. 

           VIRGIL’S SHAKY POV

           The front door racing at us and -- 

                                                                CUT TO:
           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Where George shaves off another swath of hair.

                                 VIRGIL
                        It was almost too easy. The kid was 
                        a sitting duck. You think he 
                        would’ve been smart enough to read 
                        the signs and skip town. But power 
                        has a way of blinding a man, 
                        doesn’t it? He thought he was black 
                        Napoleon. Towering above the 
                        streets.
                             (long beat)
                        The cop put that fantasy to rest.

           FLASHING IMAGES FROM THE BEGINNING

           - Virgil kicks the door open, fires into the ceiling.

           - SLUGS Lucky to the floor.

           - The Pit bull comes rushing.

           - BANG!

           - Virgil wrenches Douglas back through the window. 

           - SLUGS him.

           - The Woman in bed SCREAMS.

           - Virgil wrestles Douglas through the living room.

           EXT. RUNDOWN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Virgil shoves Douglas up against his car, cuffs him, then 
           stuffs him into the back. 

           EXT. DECREPID APARTMENT BUILDING, BACK ALLEY - DAY

           Same one from earlier. The car pulls up.

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        He took him to a little room that 
                        he keeps for a rainy day. A room 
                        that no one ever comes out of.

           Virgil hoists Douglas out of the car and drags him up the 
           stairs and through the small door.
           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Chilling Silence. Long beat.

                                 VIRGIL
                        That’s where the cop tortured him.

           George’s arm freezes. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        For information.

           A vein twitches just above George’s left eye. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Sueños Norteños wanted to know 
                        where The Plague Doctors kept their 
                        spoils. 

           George’s hand quivers. The blade vibrates on Virgil’s throat. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        And he did it slowly... Just like 
                        they asked.

           An eternity passes. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Do you wanna’ know how he did it?

           Suddenly, George’s hand jerks and he punctures Virgil’s neck. 
           Ever so slightly. A spec of blood boils up. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        You’re hands are shaking, Barber. A 
                        barber’s hands should never shake.

           George grabs a cloth and dabs the slight puncture. Then 
           returns his blade to Virgil’s throat and we CUT TO --

           INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - DAY

           Douglas sits on a small wooden chair, his head limp, hands 
           cuffed behind his back, duck tape over his mouth.

           Virgil takes a swig of whiskey straight from the bottle. 
           Wipes his mouth with a forearm. Then pulls up the second 
           chair inches in front of Douglas. Sits and leans back.

           Long beat. 

           Virgil quietly examines Douglas, whose eyes are now bright 
           and veiny-red, streaming with tears. 
                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        There’s nothing more poetic than 
                        those first, fresh minutes just 
                        after a man’s ego has been 
                        destroyed. That pathetic look on 
                        his face as he watches his own 
                        house of cards come crashing 
                        down...

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           Just as George’s razor slides vertically up Virgil’s neck. 
           Another clean patch of skin leftover.

           Suddenly, the two men lock eyes. They share a look that’s 
           hard for us to put a finger on. Almost covert.

                                 VIRGIL
                        The cop saw that look. And he 
                        almost felt pity.

           BACK TO THE RUNDOWN APARTMENT

           Just as Virgil rips the duck tape off of Douglas’ mouth.

           Douglas looks up. Beat. Then SPITS in Virgil’s face.

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        But the kid put up a fight, and the 
                        cops’s pity vanished just as fast 
                        as it came. He increased the pain.

           Strangely, however, Virgil doesn’t look enraged, not even 
           angry. He simply wipes his face clean of Douglas’ spit and 
           calmly takes another drag of whiskey.

           Beat.

           He retrieves the dog tags from inside his shirt and holds 
           them in front of Douglas’ face.

                                 VIRGIL
                        You see these? 

           Douglas refuses to look. Virgil gives him a light slap.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what these mean?
                             (beat)
                        They mean that you’ve got two 
                        options now, Douglas Pines. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Option A, I let you walk out that 
                        door and you get a bullet through 
                        your brain by night fall. 
                             (beat)
                        Option B, you let me help you.

           Douglas suddenly looks confused. Virgil un-cuffs him.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you five minutes to 
                        decide. After that you’re on your 
                        own. But I’ll warn you, San Supay’s 
                        not just some local thug. He’s got 
                        eyes and ears in every major 
                        American city. He will hunt you 
                        down. And he will kill you. 
                             (beat)
                        I found the last guy who pissed him 
                        off in a dumpster out in Echo Park. 
                        He had his own dick in his mouth.

           Virgil heads to the door, pulling out a cigarette.

                                 DOUGLAS
                             (cracked; barely audible)
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        The kid still wouldn’t play nice, 
                        so the cop had to give him a little 
                        incentive: showed him a photograph 
                        of his old man.

           Virgil turns, pulls out his wallet and tosses it to him. 

                                 VIRGIL
                        Look inside.

           He exits.

           Douglas opens the wallet. Sifts through a few bills until he 
           finds an old, worn PHOTOGRAPH. He pulls it out and we see --

           Younger versions of VIRGIL and GEORGE standing side-by-side. 
           Arms around each other. Stoic grins. Both hold rifles. The 
           whitewashed desert of Afghanistan stretches out behind them.

           EXT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT, STAIR LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           Virgil lights up a cigarette. Deep drag. Long exhale.
           SLOW PUSH IN on his smoke-obscured face and -- 

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. MUD AND BRICK HUT - DAY

           Kandahar, Afghanistan. Early 2000’s.

           Remember Virgil’s fable at the dive bar.                 
           That’s where we are now. Come to life.

           He’s more than ten years younger. Crouched beside an AFGHANI 
           BOY (intensely focused) in a claustrophobic panic room. The 
           Boy reads from a book. A picture book of Aesop’s Fables.

           CLOSE ON: A cartoon CRANE, neck sunk deep down a WOLF’S maw.

           FLIP THE PAGE: The Crane, bone in his beak, holds a Wing out 
           for his reward. The Wolf wears a duplicitous grin. Suddenly -- 

           GUNFIRE OFF SCREEN!

           Virgil swivels. Waits. More GUNFIRE. He grabs the Boy’s 
           shoulder. So paternal. He’ll make a good father.

                                 VIRGIL
                             (in Pashto)
                        Stay here.

           He crawls up through the trap door. Draws his M4 RIFLE and 
           crosses a small kitchen and out into a dense maze of mud and 
           brick walls. A Qalat Fortress. Bullets rain and then -- 

           BOOM! as an IED EXPLODES just behind us.

           Virgil is tossed through the air in a cloud of dust and 
           mortar. He slams against a wall and slumps to the ground. 
           Over his stomach, his fatigues ripped and soaking red.  

           The sound of chaos dims. Like we’ve dropped under water. But 
           still, through it all, a MAN’S VOICE penetrates --

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        MARX!... MARX! 
                        Look at me, god damnit!

           Virgil loosing consciousness... then -- a pair of arms enter 
           frame, clutch his shirt and shake him to the core.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! Come back! This isn’t 
                        where you die, you understand me! 
                        This is NOT where you die!
           Virgil’s eyes lift open. He coughs blood and we --

           CUT WIDE to reveal GEORGE hoisting Virgil up and over his 
           shoulders. Watch as he wields a free arm like a machete, 
           chopping their way through epic plumes of dust and debris.

           BACK TO THE STAIR LANDING - PRESENT DAY

           Virgil blowing out smoke. Beat. Pulls his mind back.

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        The cop gave him a five minute 
                        rest. A little time to imagine his 
                        old man buried prematurely six feet 
                        under the ground.

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           The COLLECTIVE EXPRESSION of the Twelve Customers is one of 
           hate, pain, anger...

           George’s razor has paused again.

                                 GEORGE
                             (quiet)
                        What happened next?

                                 VIRGIL
                        The kid exploded. 
                             (chuckle)
                        The most stubborn son of a bitch 
                        the cop had ever seen.

           BACK TO THE RUNDOWN APARTMENT

           Where Virgil steps back inside to find Douglas pacing 
           frantically. His wallet and photo are on the floor.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        So just because you and my old man 
                        killed some ragheads together back 
                        in the day I’m supposed to lay my 
                        fucking life in your hands?! Fuck 
                        you! I own this fucking town! This 
                        is ALL ME up in here! You can take 
                        your “big brother” bull shit 
                        somewhere else, mother fucker!

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        But the cop straightened him out 
                        quick.
           Suddenly, Virgil picks Douglas up by the shirt collars and 
           slams him hard against he wall.

                                 VIRGIL
                        You think I give a shit about you, 
                        boy?! Huh?! Do you?! I don’t give a 
                        fuck about you, you understand me?! 
                        I’m doing this for your father! 
                        That’s it! 
                             (beat)
                        Do you wanna’ know why?! Do you?!

                                 DOUGLAS
                             (struggling to get free)
                        Fuck you!

           Virgil slams him hard against the wall again.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Because my guts were spilling out 
                        of my god damn stomach and your 
                        father carried my ass 20 miles 
                        through the most desolate hell 
                        you’ve ever seen. And here you are, 
                        the prodigal son, pissing away the 
                        life he made for you from the sweat 
                        off his back. You think you’re hard 
                        core? You ain’t hard core till’ 
                        you’ve seen your friend explode 
                        into a million pieces because he 
                        stepped on the wrong patch of 
                        fucking earth! 

           Douglas’ breathing has calmed, the violence in his eyes 
           melted. Virgil lets go of his shirt and steps back. Beat.

           Then, as if in a dream, Douglas glides to the wooden chair 
           and sits down. Virgil sits as well, pulls out a cigarette, 
           lites it, then hands it to Douglas. He drags deep. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                             (calm)
                        Your father is the best man I’ve 
                        ever known.

           Douglas puts his face in his hands. 

           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           We TRACK across the Customers...
                                 VIRGIL (O.S.)
                        And when the cop got all the 
                        information he need... 

           ANGLE ON VIRGIL

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        ... He put a bullet in the kid’s 
                        brain.

           BACK TO THE RUNDOWN APARTMENT

           Douglas looks at Virgil. An internal sea change.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        What do I need to do?

           * MONTAGE SEQUENCE * 

           -- Virgil holds a buzzer up to Douglas’ head and shaves off 
           his short dreads. A mound of hair builds on the floor.

           -- Virgil takes a big swig of whiskey and then hands the 
           bottle to Douglas, who chugs... and chugs... and chugs... 

           Finally, he wipes his mouth with a forearm.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        OK. Let’s get this shit over with.

           He sits down in the wooden chair and opens his mouth. Virgil 
           approaches with a pair of pliers. He sinks them deep into 
           Douglas’ mouth. 

           Douglas’ eyes widen in preemptive agony.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                             (mumbled)
                        Fuck fuck fuck...

           Virgil clamps the pliers around a back molar. With his free 
           hand he grips the back of Douglas’ head. They lock eyes. 

                                 VIRGIL
                        One. Two...

           And YANK! Douglas SCREAMS. 

           Virgil stumbles back as Douglas starts coughing up blood. 

           Virgil pulls out a ziplock bag. Places the bloody molar 
           inside.
                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        See. That wasn’t that bad.
                             (beat)
                        Now one more.

           They get back into position. Douglas spitting up blood.

           -- Wearing gloves, Virgil wipes off his Glock with a 
           disinfectant-soaked cloth. Then hands it to Douglas.  

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Get your prints all over it.

           Finished, Douglas places the gun into a ziplock bag.

           -- Douglas walks out of the bathroom and stands before 
           Virgil. Apart from a swollen cheek, he’s a brand new man. 
           Buzzed head, shaved face, suit and tie.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How do I look?

           Virgil sizes him up.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Almost respectable again.

           -- Night has fallen. Virgil and Douglas step outside. But 
           Douglas suddenly stops. Steps back inside. Pensive.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        My dad used to say that when you 
                        cross a threshold you should always 
                        step with your right foot first.

           Beat. Douglas staring at the empty space between the door 
           frame. An invisible threshold that only he can see. The 
           official boundary, perhaps, of a new personal epoch. 

           And Virgil affords him this. Doesn’t rush him. Finally --

                                 VIRGIL
                        Right foot forward, Douglas. You’ve 
                        got a plane to catch.

           Douglas takes a deep breath. Then steps through. 

           * END MONTAGE * 
           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Virgil and Douglas driving freeways at night.

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        Once the kid was dead, the cop 
                        stuffed him in the trunk and drove 
                        him out near LAX.

           Virgil’s car pulls up to an LAX PASSENGER DROP-OFF curb. 

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Virgil hands Douglas a large envelope.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Passport. Plane tickets. Five 
                        thousand in cash. And you’ve got an 
                        offshore account with a little 
                        extra money to get you started.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How’d you pay for all this?

                                 VIRGIL
                        You really want to know the answer 
                        to that question?

           Douglas nods.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Your father’s retirement.

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Same one from the opening. We enter just as --

           Virgil pockets a large envelope of money. Pounds a shot glass 
           and stands.

                                 VIRGIL
                        Second the jaws open, I stick my 
                        neck down as far as it’ll go. 

           Suddenly, emerging from the shadow, George Pines. He stands.

           The two war brothers stare at each other for a beat. A 
           fraternal bond deeper than blood. Then --
           George grabs Virgil’s head with both of his hands and brings 
           their foreheads together. He’s holding back tears.

                                 GEORGE
                        Promise me this works.

                                 VIRGIL
                        I promise, George.
                             (beat)
                        You just stay as far away as 
                        possible.

           BACK INSIDE VIRGIL’S CAR

           Where Douglas’s chin drops heavy to his chest. Deeply, deeply 
           ashamed. The colossal effect of his life decisions weighing 
           on him. And then, slowly, he begins to cry.

           Virgil doesn’t interrupt. The boy needs to purge.

           Several seconds pass. Then --

                                 VIRGIL
                        Hey. Look at me.

           Douglas lifts his chin. Their eyes meet.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        No matter how deep into the woods 
                        we get, the path is never lost. 
                        This is the part of your story 
                        where you find it again. 

           Virgil lands a hand on Douglas’ shoulder.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Now go make your father proud.

           Douglas’ lips part. He wants to say thank you, but the words 
           don’t come. His look says it all. He gets out of the car and 
           Virgil watches as LAX swallows him forever. 

           INT. CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Virgil parks in a DISCREET ALLEY. Kills the engine.

           EXT. DISCREET ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           He gets out, loops around to the trunk and opens it...                 

           There’s a MALE CORPSE crammed inside.
           * INTERCUT SEQUENCE *

           INT. MORGUE - GRAVEYARD SHIFT - SOMETIME BEFORE

           Virgil follows a MORTICIAN down a dimly lit hallway, who 
           swipes an electronic fob at a heavy metal door -- 

           It CRANKS open. 

           Virgil nods covertly, hands him a fat envelope of bills. 

           Mortician leaves without a word. Virgil enters.

           Stench of formaldehyde. Sickly green fluorescent lights.

           TRACK ACROSS walls lined with modular mortuary cabinets. 
           Virgil inspects red tags that dangle from icy toes. He stops.

           CLOSE ON A TAG: “John Doe.” Virgil slides the drawer out.

           BACK TO DISCREET ALLEY

           Virgil drags the corpse around the car to the driver’s seat. 
           Awkwardly crams the lifeless mass into position. Places it’s 
           cold dead hands on the dashboard. Cuffs them to the wheel.

           The corpse falls forward, smashing against the steering 
           block. Virgil pushes the head back against the headrest. Jaw 
           falls open... grey-blue toothless gums.

           Virgil pulls out the ziplock bag with Douglas’ molars.     
           Tosses them into the John Doe’s lap.

           BACK TO MORGUE

           Hunched over an operating table. Virgil, donning latex gloves 
           and surgical pliers, systematically wrenches out all of the 
           dead man’s teeth. A nearby tray piles up with enamel.

           BACK TO DISCREET ALLEY

           Where Virgil pulls a JUG OF GASOLINE from the trunk and soaks 
           the corpse, then douses the rest of the car.

           Finished, he backs away and lites up a cigarette. 

           A few drags. Silver exhales drifting through the night. 

           VIRGIL’S VOICE AGAIN --

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        And then the cop lit his ass on 
                        fire.
           Without further ado, he flicks his cigarette onto the gas-
           drenched car. Watch it spin through the air. Watch the 
           burning cherry kiss the gas. And then --

                                 VIRGIL (V.O.)
                        Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

           WIDE ON THE ALLEY

           Virgil walking away as the car is engulfed in fire. Bright 
           flames licking upward into the night. A beat --

           Then BOOM! The whole fucking thing EXPLODES.

           INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - SOMETIME LATER

           Virgil steps in. Puts on the leather gloves. Retrieves his 
           Glock (covered in Douglas’ prints), grabs his bottle of 
           whiskey and sits down on the wooden chair... 

           Then cuffs himself to it.

           He takes a long swig. Beat. Huge, HUGE breath. Then --

           He puts a small wooden stick into his mouth.                      
           Closes his eyes.                                          
           Bites.                                                 
           Needles the Glock into his thigh.                              
           One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one --

           Fuck it. Now or never and -- 

           BANG! as he FIRES a bullet into his own leg.                                        

           ANIMAL ROAR 

           The stick drops from his mouth.

           He pales over. Blood leaking from under him. He takes off the 
           gloves, sinks his teeth into his undershirt and rips a swath 
           free. Fashions a makeshift tourniquet around his thigh and -- 

           SQUEEZES 

           Suppressed moans of agony.

           He pulls out his cellphone and dials 911.                     
           MOS, he mumbles into the phone.                               
           It drops from his wet red fingers.                            
           Hits the ground.                                                   
           So does his face. 

           SLOW PUSH towards him. Eyes glazing. Life losing definition --
           BACK TO THE BARBERSHOP

           We’re dead quiet. George’s razor perched on Virgil’s throat. 
           Only a small patch of hair is left. DOG TAGS slip through 
           George’s collar and dangle from around his neck.

                                 GEORGE
                             (quiet)
                        Tell me, Marx, what would you do if 
                        you were me?

                                 VIRGIL
                             (equally quiet)
                        I’d wait for a collect call.

           And with that, George quickly and gracefully shaves the last 
           patch of hair on Virgil’s throat. 

           He turns around and cleans the blade in a glass of warm 
           water. Calmly, he takes a hot towel and wipes away the 
           remaining lather from Virgil’s face and throat.

           Then, he rubs aftershave into his palms and applies it. 
           Slowly, meticulously, as if Virgil were just like any other 
           customer. As if Virgil were not the protector of his son. 

           Finished, he unbuttons the sheet from around Virgil’s neck.

           Virgil stands. Examines his reflection.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        That’s a clean shave if I’ve ever 
                        seen one.

           He pulls out his wallet, but George waves it away. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        No. I insist.

           He hands George a folded hundred dollar bill. 

           CLOSE ON George’s hands unfolding it. Inside is a small piece 
           of paper with a BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER written on it. George is 
           gonna get his retirement fund back. Compliments of San Supay.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Keep the change.

           Everyone watches silently as Virgil limps his way to the 
           front door and grabs his cane. 

           Just before leaving, however, he stops --
                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                             (facing the door)
                        I heard this story once about a guy 
                        who went in to have his wisdom 
                        teeth taken out.

           Virgil turns to his audience. 

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        A routine procedure. But the guy’s 
                        body didn’t sit right with the 
                        general anesthesia and he croaked.
                        Everyone starts freaking out. The 
                        doctor calls an ambulance, and 30 
                        minutes later the medics arrive. 
                        But get this: just as they’re 
                        lifting the sad sack onto the 
                        gurney, his heart beat just...

           He snaps his fingers --

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        ... pops back to life and he 
                        rejoins the land of the living. 
                        Naturally, one of the medics asks 
                        him if he remembered anything from 
                        the other side. The guy replied in 
                        kind, “I went to heaven.” So the 
                        medic asks him, “What did heaven 
                        look like?” And you know what the 
                        guy says? You’ll never believe it. 
                             (beat)
                        “Heaven looks a lot like Norway.”

           Virgil smiles.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe that? I always 
                        thought heaven would be somewhere 
                        in the Caribbean, but apparently 
                        heaven gets four months of snow a 
                        year.

           Virgil and George share one, final, cryptic look. An 
           understanding silently exchanged. 

           Virgil puts on sunglasses.

                                 VIRGIL (CONT’D)
                        Norway. I’ll be damned.

           And with that, he opens the door, DING, and steps outside.
           EXT. BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Virgil stands on the front step. Several cars are now parked 
           at the curb, surrounded by at least thirty PEOPLE. All of 
           whom share the same expression --

           Solidarity.

           Virgil feels his freshly shaven neck with the whole of his 
           hand, then makes the slow, limping walk to his car.

           INT. BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           As George walks to the front door, Logan pipes up --

                                 LOGAN
                        What was that shit about a collect 
                        call?

           But George doesn’t hear him. His attention fixed on the spot 
           where Virgil spun the final yarn. He stops at the door.

           A long beat as he watches Virgil part the crowd, get into his 
           beat-up station waggon, and drive away.

           Suddenly, he notices something dangling from the door handle.

           Something light and metallic.

           Moments later and George has Virgil’s DOG TAGS clenched 
           firmly in his palm.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK
