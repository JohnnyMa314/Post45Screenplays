                                 MAGGIE MCGOWAN COHN
           EXT. DENSE WOODS (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - EARLY MORNING (1985)

           A LARGE BUCK walks amongst the trees, golden sunlight 
           highlighting its short brown fur. It stops, noses a tree 
           trunk, tearing off the bark, chewing.

           OFF TO THE SIDE: an ELDERLY COUPLE on an early morning stroll 
           talk QUIETLY, pointing at the buck. It really is a pretty 
           deer.

           -RIFLE SCOPE POV: a scope scans the trees. It lands on the 
           Elderly Couple before finding the deer. Then it returns to 
           the unsuspecting couple, aiming. 

           But finally, reluctantly, it snaps back to the animal. The 
           cross-hairs settle between the deer’s eyes. 

           There’s an EXHALE and a POP. Then the MUTED THUD of the deer 
           falling onto the ground. Followed by the SHOCKED YELPS of--

           ELDERLY COUPLE--

           Horrified, they clutch each other, turning in the direction 
           of the shooter. 

           ANGLE ON SHOOTER--

           This is not your average hunter. Or person. This is LOU 
           (female, older), a wrinkled warrior whose aging body belies 
           her keen mind. She’s lived twice as hard as anyone else and 
           will never learn the rules to shuffle board.  

           Lou gives the Elderly Couple a curt wave. 

                                 LOU
                        Morning. 

           They wave back, afraid of what will happen if they don’t. 
           They watch as Lou makes her way to the deer, passing a sign 
           that reads: SAN JUAN NATIONAL PARK. NO HUNTING.

           ANGLE ON DEER--

           Glassy eyes reflect a cloudy sky. There’s still a slight lift 
           to the chest. It’s alive. LOU’S BOOTS appear beside the body. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Hm. 

           She pulls a large HUNTING KNIFE from the pocket of her 
           flannel jacket, unsheathing it as she kneels.

           Her fingers brush along the deer’s fur. She finds the artery 
           and plunges her knife deep. The deer passes quickly.
                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Wasn’t supposed to be like this. 
                        Sorry about that. 

           Lou holds her bloody fingers in the air, eyeing them with 
           disdain as they tremble. The Elderly Couple scurries away 
           down the path.  

           Behind her, the BUSHES SHAKE and JAX, a mangy, mixed breed 
           dog emerges from the leaves. Like Lou, he moves slower than 
           he use to. He’s a good dog who’s seen better days. 

           He SNIFFS the dead deer. Then looks back at Lou. Wearily. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I’m not going to ask 
                        for help. 

           And with that, Lou slits the deer’s throat, draining the 
           blood.

           EXT. SAN JUAN ISLAND (WASHINGTON STATE) - ESTABLISHING

           An AERIAL VIEW of the craggy island situated off the coast of 
           Washington, a heavily wooded place with a few pockets of 
           civilization and a gorgeous harbor. The type of place where 
           everyone knows your name whether you want them to or not. 

           EXT. ROAD/PARKING LOT (SAN JUAN BANK) - AFTERNOON

           Lou steers an old rusted F-150 truck, held together with duct 
           tape and stubbornness, into the parking lot. 

           The lot is full of similar looking vehicles, making it 
           difficult to tell if all the cars are old or we’re in 1985.

           ANGLE ON TRUCK BED--

           The butchered deer bounces beneath a piece of heavy canvas. 
           Jax sleeps soundly on top, despite the bumpy ride. 

           INT. SAN JUAN BANK (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou enters and chooses between two open tellers. The UN-
           CHOSEN TELLER looks relieved. RITA (30’s), the chosen teller, 
           smiles, making the best of it. Her enormous shoulder pads and 
           bold eye shadow confirm we’re definitely in the eighties.

                                 RITA
                        Hi Lou! How can I help you today? 

                                 LOU
                        Here’s my account number. I’d like 
                        to withdraw all my money.
           Lou slides a piece of paper across the counter. Rita types 
           the info into a primitive-looking computer. 

                                 RITA
                        That’s quite a large sum, Lou. 

           She talks to Lou slowly and loudly, a nursing home 
           intonation. If possible, Lou’s scowl deepens. 

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure if there’s protocol 
                        for such a large withdrawal. Let me 
                        get my manager. You stay here a 
                        minute, alright?

                                 LOU
                        Hm. 

           Lou watches Rita depart. She clocks the bank’s generic 
           furniture, fake plants and Orca themed posters from the San 
           Juan tourist department, finally landing on a wall mirror.

           Lou’s reflection reads,”how the hell did I get here?”

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE (BANK) - MOMENTS LATER

           Rita and MR. LANCASTER (40’s), the bank manager, stand 
           together looking out the window. The sky darkens ominously. A 
           storm’s brewing.

                                 MR. LANCASTER
                        If she’s erratic, we should contact 
                        her family. 

                                 RITA
                        I’m not sure she’s got family.

                                 MR. LANCASTER
                        She seem like she’s lost her mind?

                                 RITA
                        She seems like...Lou.

           They turn, looking at Lou through the cubicle’s glass walls.

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        Is that blood? 

           They step closer to the glass for a better look, behaving as 
           if it was opaque. 

           ANGLE ON LOU--

           The cuff of Lou’s shirt is indeed stained a dark, rusty red. 
           Next to her, the Teller smacks open a ROLL OF QUARTERS. It 
           explodes, sending coins across the counter. 

           Lou reacts, catching them with astonishing agility. For any 
           age. Her eyes glimmer. This makes up for the deer. Almost. 

           ANGLE ON MANAGER’S OFFICE-- 

                                 MR. LANCASTER
                        Just give her the money. And if you 
                        and Betsy got to leave early to 
                        avoid the storm, that’s fine by me. 

                                 RITA
                             (nodding)
                        You stopping by my place tonight?

           Mr. Lancaster fidgets. He’s wearing a wedding ring. Rita is 
           not. He shakes his head, “no.”

                                 MR. LANCASTER
                        Got to keep an eye on the pump 
                        tonight. Every time the basement 
                        floods, the mold gets real bad. 

           Rita frowns, unsatisfied with his answer. She sashays her way 
           back to Lou as Mr. Lancaster eyes her ample behind.

           EXT./INT. HARDWARE STORE/LOU’S TRUCK - DAY

           STORM PREPPERS stream into the hardware store to stock up. 

           Lou sits in her truck, scowling at people’s efforts to feel 
           safe. But like any small town, a big storm is big news. The 
           only news really.

           Lou exits the truck, forcing herself to join them. She looks 
           at Jax lying in back. 

                                 LOU
                        Want to come inside?

           Jax opens an eye. Looks at Lou. Then shuts it. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Good choice.

           INT. HARDWARE STORE (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - MOMENTS LATER

           The aisles bustle with Storm Preppers.  

           Lou stands at a shelf, looking at the tarp selection. She’s 
           not finding what she wants. 
           She spots a SALES ASSOCIATE, hustles to reach him, beating 
           out another CUSTOMER seeking his attention. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        How may I--

                                 LOU
                        Tarps. Black. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        We’ve got plenty of blue? 

                                 LOU
                        I need black. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        Sure. Let’s see what I can find. 

                                 LOU
                        Find a black one.

           INT. CASH REGISTER (HARDWARE STORE) - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou watches the Sales Associate ring up several dusty 
           packages of BLACK TARPS. 

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        You got enough flashlights?

                                 LOU
                        Only need the tarps.

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        You sure? This storm’s supposed to 
                        be a doozy. Big time wind. The 
                        island’s definitely losing power.

                                 LOU
                        The island always loses power.  

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        Best to be prepared ‘specially out 
                        by you. Aren’t you worried being so 
                        far out from town?

                                 LOU
                        Weather doesn’t scare me. People 
                        do. 

           Lou impatiently holds out her hand for the change. 
           EXT. PARKING LOT (HARDWARE STORE) - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou exits the store, holding a brown paper bag. She heads 
           toward her truck and isn’t happy to see CHIEF RANKIN (50’s) 
           petting Jax, who wags his tail with surprising vigor. 

           Rankin is the island’s seasoned police chief, well versed in 
           handling small town crime with a fair and steady hand.

           Lou throws her paper bag on the heavy canvas. Scared, Jax 
           BARKS at it. Lou glares at him. His tail stops wagging. 

                                 RANKIN 
                        Hi Lou. 

                                 LOU
                        Rankin.

                                 RANKIN
                        There isn’t, by any chance, a deer 
                        back here? 

                                 LOU
                        No. 

                                 RANKIN
                        ‘kay. ‘Cause the season ended ages 
                        ago. And I didn’t see your name on 
                        the license list. 

                                 LOU
                        It wouldn’t be. I don’t hunt.

           Rankin nods and leans against the back of the truck. A THICK 
           RIVER of BLOOD pours beneath the hatch onto the dirt parking 
           lot. Rankin looks at it. Then at Lou. 

           There’s an understanding between them and that understanding 
           is, “we’re too old for this shit.” Rankin SIGHS. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Alright Lou. You have a good day. 
                             (beat, joking)
                        You hear a storm’s coming?

           Rankin tips his hat with a small smile, side-stepping the 
           BLOOD PUDDLE on the way back to the patrol car. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD (TRAVELING) - LATER

           Lou’s truck cruises down the two lane road. The space between 
           homes increases and finally dissolves into nothing but trees. 
           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - DAY

           Two women sit on the trailer’s metal steps, smoking. This is 
           HANNAH and her friend KAYCEE, twenty-somethings embracing 
           80’s fashion with gusto. From the way they’re GIGGLING, 
           they’re clearly enjoying something stronger than tobacco. 

           Hannah has a carefree smile but her eyes are focused on--  

           VEE (5), her daughter, playing around in the woods, near a 
           sign that reads: ACCESS ROAD 72. She’s holding onto MR. 
           HIPPO, her best toy, a purple stuffed hippopotamus.

           ANGLE ON TRAILER--

           Kaycee exhales, passing the “cigarette” to Hannah.  

                                 KAYCEE
                        You got any flashlights?
                             (Hannah nods)
                        What you need is a generator. 

                                 HANNAH 
                        Yeah. I need a lot of things. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        Which brings me to -- bachelor 
                        number three. 

           Kaycee raises a newspaper folded to the classified section. 

                                 KAYCEE (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        Hardworking fisherman looking for 
                        SF. All the seafood you ever wanted 
                        in exchange for love and a home 
                        cooked meal. Musts are good 
                        teeth...

           Hannah smiles. White and straight. Check. 

                                 KAYCEE (CONT’D)
                        ...Long hair....

           Hannah shakes her curly perm. Check. 

                                 KAYCEE (CONT’D)
                        ...and...

           She stops. Hannah smiles knowingly. 

                                 HANNAH
                        And no kids. 
                                 KAYCEE
                        Fuck him. Bet his balls smell like 
                        seaweed and chum. 

           The women GIGGLE. Hannah takes a long toke. 

                                 KAYCEE (CONT’D)
                        It’d be easier to set you up if you 
                        didn’t live in the middle of 
                        nowhere. You gotta move closer to 
                        the Harbor.

                                 HANNAH
                             (exhaling)
                        Rent’s too good out here. She 
                        doesn’t know what this place is 
                        worth.

           Kaycee glances back at the trailer.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, I’m paying even less than 
                        that. Been five years since I moved 
                        back to the island, rent’s never 
                        gone up. Trailer was brand new too.

                        But your landlord-- 

                                 HANNAH
                        She’s more bark than bite.  

           LOU’S TRUCK appears at the end of the long, dirt driveway.

                        Speaking of the devil.

                             (re: the joint)
                        Shoot. Hide that thing! 

           EXT./INT. LOU’S TRUCK/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Lou glares at the trailer, watching Hannah comically wave 
           away the smoke. She doesn’t like what she sees.

                                 LOU
                             (to herself)
                        Not supposed to smoke. 

           Her truck bounces over the pitted driveway.
           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           Hannah’s hands return to her sides as Kaycee hides the joint 
           under the trailer’s steps. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        You think the rumors are true? 
                        About Lou? 

                                 HANNAH
                        Nah.

                                 KAYCEE
                        Come on. Not even a little?

                                 HANNAH
                             (considering)
                        I mean, she seems pretty tough.

                                 KAYCEE
                        I could see her killing a man. Lou  
                        -- the super spy!

                                 HANNAH
                        I thought she was an assassin.

                                 KAYCEE
                        There’s a difference?

                                 HANNAH
                        An assassin kills people.

                                 KAYCEE
                        A spy can’t kill someone?

                                 HANNAH
                        Sure. But I think they have to spy 
                        on them first. An assassin doesn't 
                        need to do that. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        So a spy can be an assassin but not 
                        the other way ‘round? 

           Hannah thinks about this. 

                                 HANNAH
                        That doesn’t sound right either.
                             (beat)
                        What do you think her secret weapon 
                        was? 

                                 KAYCEE
                        A bad attitude. 
           The women LAUGH. Then SUDDENLY -- Hannah jumps from the 
           trailer steps, sprinting forward with an unexpected burst of 
           kinetic energy.

                                 HANNAH
                        STOP! STOP! 

           She runs at Lou’s truck, waving her arms. 

           EXT./INT. TRUCK CAB/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Lou sees Hannah from the corner of her eye. She slams the 
           breaks. The front wheels of the truck LOCK, the back 
           fishtails as the truck shudders to a stop. 

           - Jax’s face smashes into the truck’s metal exterior. DEER 
           BLOOD sloshes all over him. But he’s not about to let this 
           interrupt his nap. 

           Lou looks out her windshield, over the hood and finds Vee, 
           wide-eyed, frozen in front of the truck’s fender. 

           She watches as Hannah reaches her daughter, scoops her up and 
           SMACKS her on the ass. Hard. Hannah isn’t playing. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What’d I tell you about the 
                        driveway? Stay away from it! It’s 
                        not safe!

           Lou unrolls her window, hoping to interrupt the punishment.  
           It works. Hannah blushes, embarrassed by her questionable 
           parenting technique.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        She’s fine. Aren’t you, Vee?

           Vee nods, wiping her eyes. 

                                 VEE
                        Hi Lou.

                                 LOU
                        Hm.

           Hannah sets Vee down. She runs past Hannah’s beloved car, a 
           VW Rabbit, to Kaycee, who waits by the trailer.  

           Hannah turns back to Lou.

                                 HANNAH
                        Sorry about that. Listen, I know 
                        rent’s late. Vee got an ear ache 
                        and the medicine was really--
                                 LOU
                        With a name like Vee, you can 
                        hardly expect her not to run in 
                        front of trucks. 

           Hannah bites her tongue. Lou’s her landlord after all. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        You like deer?

                                 HANNAH
                        Sure. 

                                 LOU
                        I got a bunch in back. Fresh.

           Hannah glances at the back of the truck, sees Jax COVERED IN 
           BLOOD and quickly realizes Lou’s talking about dead deer. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, I thought you meant -- um, 
                        we’re vegetarians. 

                                 LOU
                        Oh, for Pete’s sake.
                             (her tolerance evaporates)
                        Drop the rent off tomorrow. Come in 
                        and put it on the table. It’ll just 
                        get wet in the mailbox. Just leave 
                        it on the table. Don’t bother 
                        trying to say hello. I’m busy.

           Lou throws the truck in gear and speeds up the driveway. She 
           watches Hannah in the REARVIEW MIRROR, shaking her head. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Vegetarians. 

           ANGLE ON TRAILER--

           Hannah returns to the steps, helping Kaycee to her feet. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Everyday she’s a darker shade of 
                        crazy. 

           Vee runs around, pointing her finger.  

                                 VEE
                        Lou! Lou! Lou! She’ll point -- a 
                        gun at you! 
                                 HANNAH
                             (trying not to smile)
                        Did Miss Kaycee teach you that?
                             (to Kaycee)
                        Want to stay for dinner?

                                 KAYCEE
                        Nah, I gotta take off. If I don’t 
                        get some beer before the storm 
                        hits, Deacon’s gonna be pissed. 
                        I’ll swing by tomorrow. Make sure 
                        you haven’t blown away. 

           The women give each other silly air kisses before Kaycee 
           jumps in her car and pulls out. 

           EXT. LOU’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           An outdoor light illuminates POUNDING RAIN and SWAYING TREES. 
           As predicted, it’s a “doozy” of a storm.  

           INT. KITCHEN (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           Lou cleans her rifle at the dining table, methodically 
           working the metal. She finishes and sets the firearm down, 
           taking a moment to massage her arthritic fingers. 

           She looks at Jax, resting on the floor. His fur is clean from 
           a bath, highlighting his muzzle that’s white with age.  

                                 LOU
                        When did we get so old, huh?

           Jax slowly stands, moving over to Lou. He sits again, 
           settling down on top of her bare feet. He’ll keep them warm.

           INT. HANNAH’S KITCHEN (TRAILER) - NIGHT

           Hannah cuts a roll of store bought cookie dough in her small 
           galley kitchen. She gives the slices to Vee, who with Mr. 
           Hippo’s help, sets them on a greased cooking sheet.    

                                 HANNAH
                        You guys are doing a real good job. 

           Vee smiles, her face stained from dinner. She looks at a 
           plate of cookies resting on the counter, already wrapped in 
           cellophane. 

                                 VEE
                        Can we have a cookie?

                                 HANNAH
                        Those are for Lou.
                                 VEE
                        Why?

                                 HANNAH
                        Sometimes ya’ gotta kill’em with 
                        kindness. 

                                 VEE
                        Huh?

                                 HANNAH
                        Sometimes you got to be nice to 
                        people who don’t deserve it, to get 
                        what you want. So when you can’t 
                        pay rent, you make cookies. 
                        Understand?

                                 VEE
                        Yep. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Good. And if you want your own 
                        cookie, you got to take a bath 
                        first. 

                                 VEE
                        No way! 

           Vee jumps off her stool, running away with her toy. Hannah 
           smiles and finishes lining the pan with dough.

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - NIGHT

           A minimally decorated room which could easily be mistaken for 
           a monastery furnished by a yard sale. 

           Lou sits at a desk by the window, looking down at a blank 
           sheet of paper. She begrudgingly puts on a pair of reading 
           glasses before picking up a pen. She writes.  

                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        I hate writing letters so I’ll keep 
                        it short...

           INT. FIREPLACE (LIVING ROOM) - MOMENTS BEFORE

           Lou kneels by a raging fire, a LOCK BOX beside her. She feeds 
           papers and photographs from the box into the flames. 

           Finally, she lifts SEVERAL PASSPORTS from the box. All 
           brightly colored, all foreign. She throws them into the fire. 
                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        ...I’m not going to elaborate on 
                        the “why” of it all. There’s not 
                        much to say really. Sometime’s you 
                        just got to know when to fold’em...  

           INT. BEDROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - MOMENTS BEFORE

           Again minimally decorated. Lou’s on the floor, some of the 
           wood floor boards have been removed. She tucks the BANK 
           ENVELOPES beneath them. 

                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        ...There’s money in the upstairs 
                        bedroom. Under the floorboards. I 
                        hoped there’d be more. Oh, well...

           She settles the floor board back into place and folds the rug 
           over the top. 

           INT. BASEMENT (LOU’S HOUSE) - MOMENTS BEFORE

           Lou’s face glows in the light of an INDUSTRIAL FREEZER. She 
           looks down at rows of carefully packaged deer meat. 

                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        ...There’s a lot of meat in the 
                        freezer. I didn’t know you were a 
                        vegetarian. You could trade it for 
                        something. Don’t be a fool. It’s 
                        worth a pretty penny. That’s good 
                        meat... 

           Lou shuts the lid to the freezer. The wind HOWLS outside.

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - CURRENT

           And we’re back in the living room where Lou continues putting 
           pen to paper. 

                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        ...And there’s one final thing you 
                        should know. I’d say sit down but, 
                        knowing you, you probably already 
                        are. So here goes. You have to make 
                        choices in life. And if you live 
                        long enough, sometimes the right 
                        choices eventually become the wrong 
                        ones. What I’m trying to say is--

           Lou pauses, looking at the paper, unsure. Then she starts 
           writing again, fast, in case she changes her mind. 
           INT. HANNAH’S KITCHEN (TRAILER) - NIGHT

           Cookies bake in the oven. Dirty dishes soak in the sink. 
           HAPPY NOISE can be heard coming from the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM (TRAILER) - CONTINUOUS

           Hannah HUMS “Hey, Diddle, Diddle...” as she gives Vee a 
           bubble bath. She hasn’t bothered to roll up her long sleeves 
           and her shirt’s soaked through.

           She reaches for a wash cloth and sees a RED WELT on Vee’s 
           back. A vestige of today’s punishment. Hannah stops humming. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m sorry about today. In the 
                        driveway when I spanked you. 

           Vee ducks into the water. She doesn’t want to talk about it. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I made a big mistake. But I made it 
                        ‘cause I love you so much and I 
                        don’t know what I’d do without you. 
                        But I got to find a better way to 
                        show that. Okay?

           Hannah holds out her pinkie. Vee reaches her hand from the 
           bubbles. They pinkie promise as the ceiling light FLICKERS. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Let’s get you dry before 
                        we have flashlight fun time! 

           Hannah wraps Vee in a towel and lifts her from the tub. 

                                 VEE
                        Watch out! 

           Startled, Hannah tightens her grip on Vee, who frantically 
           points at the ground: water’s dripping on Mr. Hippo. 

           SIGHING, Hannah sets Vee down and picks up the toy. She leans 
           out the bathroom door and gently lobs him into Vee’s room. 

           ANGLE ON VEE’S BED--

           Mr. Hippo plops onto Vee’s pink duvet cover. 

           BING. BING. BING. The oven timer rings. 

                                 VEE (CONT’D)
                        Cookies!  
                                 HANNAH
                        You stay here and dry off.  

           Hannah exits the bathroom, moving to the kitchen. The BINGING 
           gets louder. The lights FLICKER. Then go out completely. 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        Mom?

                                 HANNAH
                        Shit. 
                             (louder)
                        I’ll be right back. 

           Hannah pulls outs the cookies. Sets them on the counter and 
           grabs a flashlight. The lights flicker back on. Hannah looks 
           up at the fixture.  

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, you can do it--
                             (the lights stay on)
                        Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

           She looks back at the cookies. Picking one up, she pops it 
           into her mouth. And immediately spits it out into the sink, 
           fanning her burnt tongue. 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        Where are you? 

                                 HANNAH
                        Hold your horses!

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        I don’t have any horses!

           -- CRASH. GLASS SHATTERS. 

                                 VEE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Mommy! Mommy!

           Hannah sprints back to the bathroom.

           She finds Vee facing the wall in her towel, shivering. The 
           WINDOW HANGS FROM THE FRAME, broken by a tree branch.

                                 HANNAH
                        It’s okay, it’s just the storm-- 

                                 MAN
                        Hi sweetheart. 

           A MAN DRESSED IN BLACK steps out from behind the shower 
           curtain. Hannah recognizes him. 
           She swings the FLASHLIGHT at his head. He catches it, yanks 
           her forward and holds a WET CLOTH over her mouth. 

           Hannah struggles but he holds firm, overpowering her.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        I like what you’ve done with your 
                        hair. Look at the curls -- you’ll 
                        have to tell me how they do that. 

           Hannah blinks, fighting to stay awake. But she can’t. Her 
           eyes shut and she finally goes limp. The world goes dark.  

           PRE-LAP: The sound of WAVES and a FRANTIC SQUEAKING. 

           EXT. FRIDAY HARBOR (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - NIGHT

           Boats lashed to wood docks bob manically in the storm’s grip, 
           making the horrible SQUEAKING SOUND. 

           Next to them, the choppy water GLOWS BRIGHT ORANGE reflecting 
           an ENORMOUS FIRE burning on shore. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Lou sits at the desk. An envelope with Hannah’s name on it 
           rests beside a modest glass of whiskey. She picks up the 
           glass and empties it. 

           CAMERA TILTS DOWN REVEALING: Lou’s finger wrapped around the 
           trigger of her rifle. The black tarps have been taped to the 
           floor and the wall behind her.  

                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        --I know it won’t be pretty but you 
                        can handle it. You don’t really 
                        have a choice. Take care. Lou. P.S. 
                        Please feed my cat. She’s in the 
                        basement.

           Lou raises the gun and points it across the room at Jax. He’s 
           resting on his own black tarp. He stares at her. Alert. Lou 
           cocks the gun, checks her aim.

           Suddenly, Jax stands. Lou waits. 

                                 LOU
                        It’s your choice, buddy. No one’s 
                        going to make you do something you 
                        don’t want to do.

           Jax SIGHS. And exits the room. Lou swallows and nods. Then 
           she grabs the pen, writing something else on the paper. 
                                 LOU (V.O.)
                        Looks like you’re taking care of 
                        the dog too.

           Lou raises the gun once again. But this time she settles the 
           barrel into her mouth. Closing her eyes, she EXHALES--

           -- BANG. 

           Lou’s eyes shift to the FRONT DOOR. Someone’s banging on it. 

           -- BANG. BANG. BANG. 

                                 HANNAH (O.C.)
                        Lou!  

           Lou considers this unexpected development. Then she sets down 
           the rifle.

           INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR (LOU’S HOUSE) - NIGHT

           Lou cracks the door and finds Hannah clinging to the porch 
           railing, struggling to remain upright and conscious. 

                                 LOU
                        I told you to drop the rent off 
                        tomorrow. Come back then.

           She starts to close the door. Hannah doesn’t move. Her speech 
           is thick, slurred. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I tried calling the cops.

           Lou pauses, re-opening the door. 

                                 LOU
                        What? 

                                 HANNAH
                        He cut the phone lines. Bet he cut 
                        yours too.

           Lou squints into the rain, trying to figure Hannah out.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Is it true? What everyone in town 
                        says about you? 

                                 LOU
                        Stop talking crazy. Where’s Vee?

                                 HANNAH
                        He took her.
           This gets Lou’s attention. She steps outside into the rain, 
           grabbing Hannah by the arm. 

                                 LOU
                        Who did? Who took her?

                                 HANNAH
                        He did. 

                                 LOU
                        He who?

                                 HANNAH
                        Her damn dad.  

           Hannah blacks out. Lou doesn’t attempt to catch her. She just 
           watches her slump to the ground. 

           EXT. SAN JUAN AIRPORT (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - NIGHT

           A small commuter facility with one runway that takes off over 
           the harbor. 

           Chief Rankin stands next to his patrol car watching a 
           SMOULDERING FIRE, the flames contained by the incessant rain.  

           He motions to OFFICER BERRY (20’s), an eager young buck and 
           the only other officer on the island. Berry swishes over in 
           his large yellow rain slicker. 

                                 BERRY
                        Guess we got lucky with this one. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Lucky?

                                 BERRY
                        With the rain and all. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Nothing lucky about arson at an 
                        airport. I hate to say it but we’d 
                        better get the FBI on the horn.

           Berry’s eyes widen at the thought. 

                                 BERRY
                        The FBI? Why?

                                 RANKIN
                        Protocol. They like to check things 
                        out when an airport explodes.  

           The men turn to look at the fire. 
                                 BERRY
                        Well, what should we do ‘til then?

                                 RANKIN
                        Hope the fire goes out before it 
                        stops raining.

           Officer Berry nods, accepting their mission. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           Once again, Lou stands by the black tarps. She looks down at 
           the gun in her hand. Then toward the front door where Hannah 
           lies on the floor, still unconscious. 

           Then she reaches forward and RIPS the black tarp down.

           INT. FRONT DOOR (LOU’S HOUSE) - MOMENTS LATER

           Hannah opens her eyes and finds herself staring into JAX’S 
           FACE. She realizes where she is and sits up. Too quickly. She 
           throws up on the floor. 

           Lou watches from the doorway. 

                                 LOU
                        You’re wet. Put these on.

           Lou drops outdoorsy looking clothes near Hannah, avoiding the 
           vomit. Then she grabs the truck keys off the wall. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Where are you going?

                                 LOU
                        We’re going to your trailer.

           INT. LOU’S TRUCK/DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Lou speeds down the driveway. Hannah bounces beside her in 
           the borrowed clothing and a heavy rain coat, still groggy. 

                                 LOU
                        Tell me what happened. Exactly. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t remember--

           Lou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Hannah braces herself to avoid smashing 
           into the windshield. This wakes her up.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Careful! 
                                 LOU 
                        I’ll be careful when you start 
                        remembering. 

                                 HANNAH
                        He came in the bathroom window. He 
                        grabbed me. Held something over my 
                        face. And everything went black. 
                        Then I woke up. Vee was gone so I 
                        tried calling the cops but the 
                        phones were out. You check your 
                        phone?

                                 LOU
                        Phone’s dead. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (nodding)
                        I didn’t know what else to do so I 
                        came up to see you.

           Hannah glances over at Lou. It’s clear that she’s not so sure 
           about her decision to involve her neighbor. 

                                 LOU
                        It’s quarter to twelve now.

                                 HANNAH
                        Bath time’s at six thirty. 

           Hannah TEARS UP, realizing how long it’s been. Lou reaches 
           over and gives her a pinch. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Damn it Lou! 

                                 LOU
                        Tears don’t help much and they make 
                        me uncomfortable. 

           Lou stops the truck. They’ve reached the trailer. 

           INT. HANNAH’S TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou enters the tight living space, looking around. 

           ANGLE ON BATHROOM--

           Lou sees the broken window, the torn shower curtain, the damp 
           rag on the floor.  

           She sniffs the air. 
                                 LOU
                        Chloroform. Hm.

           She scowls, disappearing from the door frame.   

           INT. VEE’S BEDROOM (TRAILER) - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou surveys this pink kingdom, looking out of place in her 
           dark outdoor jacket. Hannah appears in the doorway, slowly 
           regaining her strength. She points at Vee’s bed.  

                                 HANNAH
                        Where’s Mr. Hippo? 

           She throws off the covers, searching.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Hippo was right here on the 
                        bed. He was right here. 

                                 LOU
                             (understanding)
                        He take anything else? 

           Hannah looks around the room.

                                 HANNAH
                        Her blanket. 

                                 LOU
                        Good. He wants her to be 
                        comfortable. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Nothing’s good about this. 

                                 LOU
                        Could be worse. 

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s only something folks say 
                        when things are real bad. 

           Hannah picks up a SHINY BLUE EASTER EGG from the window sill. 
           It’s one of those plastic kinds that split apart.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t Vee’s. I don’t know what 
                        this is. 

           Hannah opens the egg. A NOTE falls into her palm.

                                 LOU
                        Well?
                                 HANNAH
                             (opening the note)
                        It says “See you soon, Mom.” And 
                        then some numbers. Forty eight N, 
                        one hundred twenty three W.

                                 LOU
                        They’re coordinates. He wants you 
                        to follow him. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Follow him? To where?

                                 LOU
                        Into the woods. It’s a game.

                                 HANNAH
                        This isn’t a guy you follow, it’s a 
                        guy you run from. 

                                 LOU
                        Not when he has your daughter.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOU’S HOUSE (VARIOUS ROOMS) - NIGHT

           Lou moves from ROOM to ROOM shoving outdoor essentials: 
           compasses, maps, water bottles, medical kit into a backpack. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - NIGHT

           Lou opens her bathroom cabinet, revealing ORANGE PRESCRIPTION 
           BOTTLES. She grabs one, tucking it into her pocket.  

           She looks up and finds Hannah’s concerned reflection in the 
           mirror. Lou pushes past her and clomps downstairs.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS (LOU’S HOUSE) - NIGHT

           Lou grabs the handle to the basement door, stopping short. 
           Hannah, following close behind, slams into her back.

                                 LOU
                        Just stay put.

                                 HANNAH
                        Where are you going?

                                 LOU
                        To feed my cat and get my guns. 

           Lou opens the door and disappears down the stairs. 
           INT. BASEMENT (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           Lou descends the crooked wood steps. She passes a prehistoric 
           GENERATOR, crossing to a cardboard box in the corner. 

           ANGLE ON BOX--

           A bundle of SQUIRMING KITTENS suckle on an EXHAUSTED MOM CAT.

           Lou grabs a bag of cat food and dumps it on the floor. She 
           shoves an empty water bowl beneath a leak from the window.

                                 LOU
                             (to cat)
                        Good luck.

           Next, she moves to a METAL UTILITY CLOSET. A used paint stick 
           is shoved between the handles, keeping the doors shut. Lou 
           pulls out the stick, taking spider webs with it. 

           The doors open, REVEALING AN ARSENAL of weapons. Lou is not 
           happy to see them. Nonetheless, she selects TWO HANDGUNS and 
           a LARGE HUNTING KNIFE. 

           Then the LIGHTS flicker out. For good this time.

           INT. KITCHEN (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           A GENTLE HUM comes from the basement as the generator kicks 
           in. The lights dimly return showing Hannah at the kitchen 
           table, her head between her hands. 

           Lou appears from below with the weapons, placing them on the 
           table. Hannah balks at the knife and guns. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What do you think you’re going to 
                        do with those?

           Lou opens a cupboard and pulls packages of AMMUNITION from a 
           CROCK POT. She drops the boxes beside the guns.  

                                 LOU
                        I’m going into the woods. I’m going 
                        to find your daughter. And I’m 
                        going to kill the man who took her. 

           Hannah stares at Lou, not quite believing what she’s hearing. 

                                 HANNAH
                        The man who took my daughter is a 
                        monster. 
                                 LOU
                        I’m good at killing monsters.

           EXT. WOODS (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - NIGHT

           Wind, rain and leaves whip around, every which way.

           The usual STORM SOUNDS prevail plus the sounds of WELL PACED 
           WALKING and HEAVY BREATHING.

           A LOOMING FIGURE dressed for the extreme conditions trudges 
           into frame. This is PHILIP LEVINE (40’s), a man with dark 
           brown eyes who most would consider handsome. He’s also the 
           man in black who attacked Hannah.

           Philip’s strapped into a heavy-duty CHEST HARNESS. From the 
           back of the harness, two cords extend to an ALL TERRAIN CART. 
           And mounted to the cart is a PLASTIC PLAYHOUSE CASTLE. It’s 
           pink, pretty, and completely out of place in the wilderness.

           SUDDENLY -- an alarm on Philip’s wristwatch begins to BEEP. 

           ANGLE ON WATCH--

           A DAY-GLO TIMER illuminates, counting down from 00:10.

           00:09

           00:08

           INT. KITCHEN (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           Lou looks at Hannah. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know Lou. I just don’t--

                                 LOU
                        You came to me because you need 
                        help. This is how I help.

           Outside, there’s a LOUD EXPLOSION. 

           ANGLE ON WINDOW--

           Down the hill, a BALL OF FIRE burns near Hannah’s trailer. 

                                 HANNAH
                        My car. My car just--

           There’s another EXPLOSION. Closer. The windows RATTLE. Lou’s 
           truck goes up in flames. Lou’s eyes narrow into a focused 
           rage. The line has been crossed. 
                                 LOU
                        Hm.

           EXT. LOU’S YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou strides across her yard, the backpack and rifle case 
           slung over her shoulders. Her handguns are holstered by her 
           hips.

           Hannah stumbles along, struggling to keep up. And behind her, 
           Jax follows; a WHITE GARBAGE BAG has been wrapped around him 
           as a make-shift raincoat. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (yelling over the storm)
                        So it’s true -- what people in town 
                        say about you?

                                 LOU
                             (keeps walking)
                        What do they say?

                                 HANNAH
                        That you’ve done things in your 
                        past. Bad things that can help me 
                        get Vee back.

                                 LOU
                        If the things I’ve done in my past 
                        help get your daughter back, are 
                        they still bad?

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know. So you’re not just 
                        some--

           Lou stops at the edge of the yard, only a couple steps from 
           the dark woods. Rain and wind swirls around her. 

                                 LOU
                        -- some old lady?

                                 HANNAH
                        I was gonna say, “someone like me.” 

                                 LOU
                        I can assure you, I’m not someone 
                        like you.
                             (beat)
                        Are you coming?

           Lou holds the HUNTING KNIFE out to Hannah. Hannah hesitates.
                                 HANNAH
                        He’s a crazy person, Lou. He’s not 
                        right in the head. You’re gonna 
                        need help. A lot of help. 

                                 LOU
                        I thought you were help. 

           Hannah looks at the knife...into the woods...back at Lou’s 
           house. 

           Then she grabs the knife and straps it around her waist. 

           With only a few steps forward, Hannah and Lou fade into the 
           woods. Jax makes sure they’re gone before starting back 
           toward the house.  

           Beat. Then:

                                 LOU (O.C.) (CONT’D) 
                        Jax! Come on! 

           He reluctantly turns and follows them into the trees, 
           tripping over his garbage bag raincoat. 

           EXT. HUNTING SHACK (WOODS) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A decrepit, forgotten structure buried deep in the trees. Its 
           broken windows glow with a SOFT LIGHT.

           INT. HUNTING SHACK (WOODS) - CONTINUOUS

           A one room building, damp from the storm. RAIN POUNDS on the 
           corrugated metal roof. An electric camping lantern glows next 
           to the PINK PLAYHOUSE CASTLE, giving us a better look. 

           It’s thick and plastic, one of those backyard children’s 
           toys. The only differences are the METAL LOCK attached to the 
           door and the HEAVY DUTY WHEELS at its base. 

           Philip kneels beside it, UNLOCKING the door.

           ANGLE ON PLAYHOUSE INTERIOR--

           Vee sleeps soundly inside. Philip watches her, smiling, happy 
           to see his daughter. He adjusts her blanket under her chin. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Sleep tight Vee. 

           He gently closes the door. Then he reaches into his pocket, 
           removing a BRIGHT RED PLASTIC EGG. 

           He places it on the shack’s floor and DIMS the lantern.
           EXT. FRIDAY HARBOR (SAN JUAN ISLAND) - DAWN

           The sun rises behind a veil of clouds. The waves are rough 
           from the high winds, but at least, it’s stopped raining. 

           INT. BEDROOM (RANKIN’S HOUSE) - DAWN

           A CLOCK RADIO clicks on, playing an OLD COUNTRY SONG. A dark 
           form rises from bed. The light flicks on. It’s Rankin. 

           He swings his legs to the floor. They land next to the pants 
           he walked out of the night before. He speaks quietly to the 
           bed’s other occupant.

                                 RANKIN
                        I know I just went to bed but it’s 
                        gonna be a helluva day, Millie. 
                             (rubs his eyes)
                        Costa Rica sounds pretty good right 
                        about now. A nice little cabana on 
                        the ocean. They’ve got monkeys 
                        there. They just walk around like 
                        they’re at a zoo. But it’s your 
                        backyard. Monkeys in your backyard. 
                        Can you believe it?

           He turns, facing the other side of the bed. IT’S EMPTY. 
           There’s no Millie. Still, he pauses to listen to her reply.

                                 RANKIN (CONT’D)
                        Of course, I’ll be careful. I 
                        always am. Cross my heart. 

           He smooths the covers over the empty spot. From the sad 
           expression on Rankin’s face, we know that side of the bed 
           used to be the center of his universe. 

           RING! 

           The moment is interrupted by Rankin’s phone, RINGING on 
           bureau. He looks at it. This can’t be good news. 

           As he stands, the RINGING morphs into a BEEPING SOUND and 
           we’re with--

           INT. HUNTING SHACK (WOODS) - EARLY MORNING

           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

           Philip’s watch goes off in the darkness. The LANTERN turns 
           on. It levitates through the shack toward the playhouse.  

           Philip slides the lock and opens the door. Vee wakes up, 
           frowning at him, shielding her eyes from the light.
                                 VEE
                        Go away.

                                 PHILIP
                        You don’t have to be scared.

                                 VEE
                        I’m not. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Do you want to come out?

                                 VEE
                        No.

                                 PHILIP
                        Why not?

           Vee begins to cry. Philip is crushed but he keeps trying.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got something for you. 

           He disappears. Vee sniffles. Suddenly, Mr. Hippo appears in 
           the doorway. 

                                 PHILIP (O.C.) (CONT’D) 
                             (British accent)
                        Why hello Vee! It’s time for 
                        breakfast! Would you like some tea? 
                        Or, perhaps, a biscuit?

           Vee grabs the toy from Philip. 

                                 VEE
                        He doesn’t talk like that. And he 
                        doesn’t like tea.

                                 PHILIP
                        Well, does he like cookies? 

           Philip holds up Lou’s PLATE OF COOKIES, stolen from the 
           counter last night. Vee eyes them, tempted. 

                                 VEE
                        Those are Lou’s. 

                                 PHILIP
                        She won’t mind if we have one. 

           Vee reaches forward, grabbing a cookie. And immediately 
           retreats to the back of the playhouse to glare at Philip. She 
           looks like an angry, trapped raccoon. 
                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t know me but I’m a 
                        friend, just like--

           He points at her stuffed toy.

                                 VEE
                        His name is Mr. Hippo. 

                                 PHILIP
                        -- I’m a friend just like Mr. 
                        Hippo. This is an adventure, Vee. A 
                        great big, fun adventure which ends 
                        with us finding Mom. How does that 
                        sound?

           Vee shrugs and pulls her pink blanket over her head. 

           EXT. WOODS (LOU AND HANNAH) - EARLY MORNING

           Lou and Hannah trek through the woods. Lou leads, scanning 
           the horizon. Hannah follows with Jax, his white garbage bag 
           brown with mud. Having walked all night, they look exhausted. 

                                 HANNAH
                        How much longer till we get there? 

           Lou pauses to check the compass hanging around her neck. Then 
           resumes walking. She doesn’t bother answering Hannah.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I just want to know when I’m going 
                        to see Vee. 
                             (beat)
                        Why’d you bring me if you aren’t 
                        going to talk to me?

                                 LOU
                        I didn’t.

                                 HANNAH
                        You didn’t what?

                                 LOU
                        Bring you. You decided to come.

           Lou hits the side of her leg, signalling for Jax to join her 
           up front. He picks up the pace, trotting toward her. 

                                 HANNAH
                        We should get to know one another. 
                        I don’t know a thing about you.
                                 LOU
                             (under her breath)
                        God help me. 

           Hannah hears this and pounces. 

                                 HANNAH
                        See? Right there. I didn’t know you 
                        were religious. Had no idea. 

                                 LOU
                        I’m not religious.

                                 HANNAH
                        Me neither! I mean, I received 
                        communion. But it didn’t stick. 
                        Wasn’t too good at that whole state 
                        of grace thing. Hey Lou? You got 
                        any kids?

           Lou addresses Hannah but she doesn’t turn around. 

                                 LOU
                        We don’t need to know one another 
                        to get Vee back. In fact, it’s 
                        better if we don’t. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Just making small talk.
                             (beat)
                        Wait. What do you mean “better”? 

                                 LOU
                        I already know everything I need to 
                        know. Additional information will 
                        only confuse things. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Isn’t knowing half the battle?

                                 LOU
                        The losing half.

           Then Lou STOPS. Thinking. Maybe Hannah’s right?

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Actually, there is something you 
                        can help me with. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah? 
                                 LOU
                        I don’t know how Vee will react to 
                        this. To being taken. What do you 
                        think she’ll do?

                                 HANNAH
                        She’ll fight. She’ll try to get 
                        away. She’s feisty. Like me.

                                 LOU
                        And what if he’s nice to her?

                                 HANNAH
                        It could make a difference. She 
                        likes attention. She also gets that 
                        from me. 

           The wheels in Hannah’s head begin to spin.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        You think I should have gotten Vee 
                        baptized? Maybe I should have, just 
                        in case. You know? Just in case? I 
                        should have done it. 

                                 LOU
                        A little water on the forehead 
                        isn’t going to help her now.  

           Hannah SNIFFLES. Tears are imminent. Lou realizes she’s said 
           the wrong thing. She MOTIONS to Jax. He reaches over and NIPS 
           Hannah’s leg. 

           She straightens up and keeps walking. Crisis adverted. 

           EXT./INT. ROAD/POLICE CRUISER - MORNING

           SEVERAL LOCAL MEN with CHAINSAWS work on dismantling an 
           ENORMOUS TREE that’s fallen across the road, blocking it 
           completely. Berry supervises the production, turning as-- 

           Rankin pulls up in his police cruiser. INSIDE -- a picture of 
           MILDRED, taped to the dashboard, stares into the car. It’s a 
           J.C. Penny portrait that shows off her classic beauty. 

           Berry jogs toward cruiser, motioning for Rankin to roll down 
           the window.  

                                 BERRY
                        Hey Boss. We got a call at the 
                        station this morning. About a tree 
                        blocking the road. 
                                 RANKIN
                             (patient)
                        I can see that. 

                                 BERRY
                        Well, one of the guy’s got 
                        something interesting to tell ya’ 
                        about it, about the tree.  

           MOMENTS LATER: Rankin and a LOCAL MAN stare at the TREE 
           STUMP. It’s cut clean across. 

                                 LOCAL MAN
                        So we’re about ready to move this 
                        thing but something isn’t right. 
                        This tree. It didn’t fall. This 
                        tree was cut. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Cut?

                                 LOCAL MAN
                        Yeah. Look how clean it is. If it 
                        fell, the stump would be like this-- 

           The Local Man makes a zig zag motion with his chain saw. 
           Rankin quickly steps back, avoiding the blade. 

                                 LOCAL MAN (CONT’D)
                        Whoever did it, did a real good job 
                        too. Fell right where he wanted it. 
                        Across the road I guess. Why’d 
                        someone cut a tree down in a storm?

                                 RANKIN
                        I suppose they didn’t want anyone 
                        getting by.  

                                 BERRY
                             (joining them)
                        Does anyone even live out here? 

                                 RANKIN
                        Yeah. 

                                 BERRY
                        Who?

                                 RANKIN
                        Lou.

           MOMENTS LATER: Berry watches Rankin’s police cruiser SPEED 
           past the cut-up tree, in the direction of Lou’s house.
           EXT. WOODS (PHILIP AND VEE) - MORNING

           Philip walks into frame pulling the playhouse. He maneuvers 
           the cart with relative ease, considering the rough terrain. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Hey Vee. If you need to use the 
                        bathroom, just yell, “Hey Buddy! I 
                        got to go!” Okay, Vee? 
                             (beat)
                        Vee?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. VEE’S PLAYHOUSE (WOODS) - CONTINUOUS

           Vee sits cross-legged in the playhouse holding Mr. Hippo’s 
           face up to the FROSTED PLASTIC WINDOW. 

                                 VEE
                        What do you see? 

           She lets Mr. Hippo look before bringing his mouth to her ear. 

                                 VEE (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. He does look mean.

                                 PHILIP (O.C.)
                        Vee? You hear me?

           Vee continues to not answer Philip. She settles back, 
           bouncing as the wagon moves over the uneven ground.

           Philip’s face falls, upset at being ignored. He shrugs. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Kids. 

           EXT. DRIVEWAY (LOU’S HOUSE) - MORNING

           CLOSE-UP ON: the SMOULDERING REMAINS of Lou’s truck. CAMERA 
           PULLS BACK, REVEALING Rankin staring at the burnt mess. 

           Then he looks down the driveway at the DARK CIRCLE by 
           Hannah’s trailer.

           MOMENTS LATER: Rankin talks into his CB handset. 

                                 RANKIN
                             (into hand set)
                        Berry. Whoever hit the airport has 
                        something to do with...whatever’s 
                        happening up here at Lou’s place. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANKIN (CONT'D)
                        We got similar incendiary patterns. 
                        When’s the FBI getting here? Over.

                                 BERRY
                        They’d be here but the ferry’s not 
                        running Chief. Over. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Well, tell’em to start swimming! 
                        Over.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOME) - LATER

           Rankin stares at the balled-up black tarps on the floor. He 
           sniffs the empty glass of whiskey, sees the notepad and pen. 
           He knows what almost happened last night. 

           The only thing missing from the table is LOU’s NOTE to 
           Hannah. INSTEAD -- there’s a note in shaky handwriting with 
           KAYCEE’s name on it. 

           Rankin picks it up, opening it. 

           ANGLE ON NOTE-- “We went into the woods. 48 N, 123 W. Vee’s 
           dad took her. Lou’s got guns. Get the police.”

           SUDDENLY -- through the window, Rankin sees a TRICKED-OUT ATV 
           fly from the woods and onto Lou’s massive backyard.

           Rankin’s hand shifts to his GUN as he moves to the back door.  

           EXT. BACKYARD (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           Kaycee waves to Rankin from the back of the ATV driven by her 
           boyfriend DEACON (30’s). The ATV is an homage to BIGFOOT, the 
           infamous blue and white monster truck, just smaller. It has 
           all the bells and whistles.  

           They stop. Kaycee dismounts. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        You got our phone call! About the 
                        tree!  

                                 RANKIN
                        We did. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        The g.d. road  was blocked. Had to 
                        turn back and get Bigfoot. 

           She kicks the back of the ATV. Deacon winces.
                                 RANKIN
                        You’re here now. That’s good. I got 
                        some questions.

           Rankin glances at the NOTE still in his hand. 

                                 KAYCEE
                             (re: the burnt spot)
                        Is that Hannah’s car?

                                 RANKIN
                        Think so. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        What happened? Did lightning hit 
                        it?

                                 DEACON
                        Don’t know lightning could do that.

           Deacon tucks a large wad of chewing tobacco into his lip.

                                 RANKIN
                        It wasn’t lightning. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        So where are they? Where’s Hannah? 

                                 RANKIN
                        She’s gone. 

           Kaycee looks from the burn spot in front of Hannah’s trailer 
           to the burn spot in front of Lou’s house. Her eyes narrow. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        This is Lou’s fault.

                                 RANKIN
                        You don’t even know what this is.

                                 KAYCEE
                        Don’t need to. Where’d Hannah go?

                                 RANKIN
                        From what’s been reported, Vee’s 
                        father took her. My guess is Hannah 
                        wasn’t too happy about that so she 
                        came up here and got Lou.

                        Vee’s dad? Philip? 
                                 RANKIN
                        That’s what this note says. You 
                        know anything about their custody 
                        arrangement?

                                 KAYCEE
                        There wasn’t one. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Alright. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        Because he’s dead. 

           Rankin tries to hide his surprise. 

                                 RANKIN
                        You said he was dead?

                             (nodding)
                        Vee’s dad was a real wild card. 
                        That’s why Hannah lived in the 
                        sticks. She thought she was safe 
                        out here. But he died in a prison 
                        fight a couple months back. He had 
                        a mouth on him.

                                 DEACON
                        He wasn’t so tough.

                                 RANKIN
                        You knew him?

           Deacon shakes his head, ”no.”

                                 KAYCEE
                        Hannah was with him on the main 
                        land. 

                                 DEACON
                        Didn’t know him but I bet I coulda 
                        kicked his ass.

                             (her lip quivers)
                        Hannah’s gonna be pissed. She loved 
                        that car. 

           Rankin’s brow furrows. His gaze turns to the woods. 

           PRE-LAP: OVER THE TREES.
                                 LOU (O.S.)
                        Maybe you were seeing things. 

                                 HANNAH (O.S.)
                        I was seeing things. I was seeing 
                        Philip standing in my bathtub! 

                                 LOU (O.S.)
                        But you said Vee’s father was dead.

           EXT. WOODS (LOU/HANNAH) - CONTINUOUS

           Lou remains in front but Hannah has the compass now, double 
           checking their direction. Jax is nowhere in sight.

                                 LOU
                        You sure it was him?

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m sure. The Devil probably threw 
                        him out ‘cause he didn’t want the 
                        competition. I know how it sounds. 
                        But when everything about a person 
                        surprises you, you just come to 
                        expect it. 

                                 LOU
                        So what kind of person was he, 
                        besides surprising?

                                 HANNAH
                        Philip? He was nice at first. 
                        Bought me funny gifts when he 
                        traveled for work. 

                                 LOU
                        What’d he do? For work?

                                 HANNAH
                        Not sure. I didn’t really want to 
                        know. He was always tired when he 
                        came home. Covered in bruises. One 
                        time it looked like, well, it 
                        looked like he’d been shot. When I 
                        got a pregnant, I got the heck out 
                        of there. I knew we were better off 
                        without him. He got so mad. Went on 
                        and on about me abandoning him. 
                        Then he-- 

           Hannah pauses. 

                                 LOU
                        Some stories are best left untold. 
           Hannah ignores her and pulls back her shirt, revealing a 
           series of VERTICAL SCARS running up her forearm. We now know 
           why she left her sleeves down while giving Vee a bath. 

                                 HANNAH
                        He took me to a house in the middle 
                        of nowhere and tied me to a 
                        radiator and he gave me a knife. 
                        There was one way off that radiator 
                        and it was using that knife. Thing 
                        was, both sides of the knife were 
                        sharp, real sharp. If I used it, I 
                        was going to cut myself.

           Lou walks faster. She doesn’t want to hear Hannah’s story. 
           She pushes through a thicket of trees, letting the tree 
           branches swing back into Hannah’s face.

           But Hannah persists. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I waited twenty-seven hours tied to 
                        that damn radiator. He’d call and 
                        leave messages on the answering 
                        machine, saying all sorts of nasty 
                        stuff. Finally, he called and said 
                        if I waited any longer the baby was 
                        going to die. So I just--

           Hannah makes a cutting motion. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I know I seem soft Lou but I’ve got 
                        edges. I got them from my dad, I 
                        got them from my bosses. I got them 
                        from Philip. But living life hard 
                        is no way to live. 

           Beat. Lou can’t take it anymore. 

                                 LOU
                        That’s crap. If you don’t live life 
                        hard, you’ll get trampled on. You 
                        let him make you victim. You got 
                        knocked up by a sociopath.

                                 HANNAH
                             (quietly)
                        Well, all I know is -- it was a 
                        good thing you moved to the island 
                        and rented me that trailer. No one 
                        else would have helped me like 
                        that. Then or now. So thank you. 
                                 LOU
                             (WHISTLING)
                        Where’s the damn dog? 

           Jax trots out of the trees. Lou reaches down and tears off 
           the garbage bag as a GUST OF WIND swells through the forest. 
           Leaves tumble down. 

           ANGLE ON--

           A FALLING LEAF as it...

           EXT. DIRT DRIVEWAY (LOU’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           ...lands in front of Rankin walking amongst the ashes of 
           Lou’s truck. He reaches down, picks up an INCENDIARY DEVICE. 

           He hands it to Kaycee. She grabs it, drops it into a ziplock 
           bag. She and Deacon now wear bright orange volunteer vests.

                                 DEACON
                        Kaycee! You got to have the gloves 
                        on. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        It’s in the bag now. It doesn’t 
                        matter. 

                                 DEACON
                        Then why’d Chief give us gloves?

                                 KAYCEE
                        Does it matter Chief?

           Rankin looks past them at a BRIGHT RED RENTAL CAR with a 
           KAYAK tied to its roof, making it’s way up the driveway. 

           SUDDENLY -- the wind catches the boat, RIPPING it off the car 
           and onto the ground. The car stops. A TALL MAN in a FBI 
           windbreaker gets out. He struggles to return the boat to the 
           roof. He fails. 

           ANGLE ON--

           Rankin, Kaycee and Deacon, looking at the man, confused.  

                                 RANKIN
                             (to Kaycee)
                        Don’t worry about the gloves. 

           Kaycee gives Deacon an “I told you so,” look as the red car 
           pulls up next to them. 
           A FAX MACHINE rests on the backseat wrapped in waterproof 
           plastic. The tall man gets out. 

           This is ASSISTANT SPECIAL AGENT INATOMI (30’s), he’s as green 
           as a four-leaf-clover but far less lucky. He flips open a FBI 
           BADGE revealing a sea-sickness band around his wrist.

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        Special Assistant Agent Inatomi 
                        from the Seattle division. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Chief Rankin. San Juan PD. 

           From behind Rankin:

                                 KAYCEE
                        An FBI agent?!

                                 DEACON
                        Kaycee!

                                 KAYCEE
                        Stop yelling at me Deacon! 

                                 RANKIN
                             (to Kaycee)
                        Don’t go spreading that around 
                        town. Don’t want people getting 
                        nervous about the FBI being here. 

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        People should be nervous. 
                             (off Rankin’s look)
                        I mean, they should be aware. 

                                 RANKIN
                        What’s with the kayak?

           Inatomi smiles, happy that someone asked. 

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        I’m somewhat of an extreme sports 
                        enthusiast. You may have heard of 
                        me, Michael Inatomi, “the wonder of 
                        the white rapids.” 

                                 RANKIN
                        Can’t say I have.

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        Well, the ferry wasn’t running so I 
                        improvised. 
           Inatomi sees the EVIDENCE BAG in Kaycee’s hand. 

                                 AGENT INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        You should be wearing gloves. 

           Deacon looks up at Kaycee, claiming his victory. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        Chief said it was fine.

                                 DEACON
                             (under his breath)
                        Chief ain’t no FBI agent.

                                 RANKIN
                             (to Inatomi)
                        Why don’t I fill you in on the 
                        situation? 

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        Sounds good.

                                 RANKIN
                        I’ve got a feeling--

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        Just stick to the facts. 

           Rankin locks eyes with Inatomi. Inatomi eventually looks 
           away.

                                 RANKIN
                        I got a feeling he’s working alone. 
                        Whoever blew up the airport, also 
                        blew up these cars before taking 
                        the little girl. He blocks off 
                        access to this part of the island. 
                        Hannah, the mom, most likely tries 
                        calling the police. She can’t. The 
                        phone line’s been cut. She has no 
                        other option so she asks her 
                        neighbor, Lou, for help. And they 
                        go into the woods to get her 
                        daughter back. What we need to 
                        figure out is why he blew up an 
                        airport at all, why not--

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        How do you know they went into the 
                        woods? 

           Kaycee holds up a ziplock bag containing the NOTE from 
           Hannah. 
           Inatomi reads it, jotting down the coordinates in his 
           notepad. 

                                 AGENT INATOMI (CONT’D)
                             (to Kaycee)
                        And you are?

                                 KAYCEE
                        Hannah’s best, best friend.

           Inatomi immediately discounts her.

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                             (to Rankin)
                        And who’s Lou?

                                 KAYCEE  
                             (to Inatomi’s back)
                        She’s a piece of work.

                                 RANKIN
                        Lou’s got a reputation around town. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        Lou was a spy assassin. You’ve 
                        probably heard of her. 

                                 AGENT INATOMI
                        Sure. She plays in our alumni 
                        softball game every year. 

           Kaycee stares at Inatomi blankly. Then to Deacon:

                                 KAYCEE
                        Is he kidding?

                                 DEACON
                        Yeah babe. 

           Inatomi shifts to fully block Kaycee from the conversation.

                                 INATOMI
                        You know what Chief, I’m with you 
                        on this one.

                                 RANKIN
                        Good. So let’s get a couple guys 
                        out here. I’ll lead the search 
                        party, I know the woods real well. 

                                 INATOMI
                        No one’s going into the woods until 
                        we run background checks on--
                                 KAYCEE 
                             (interrupting)
                        You need to tell him, Chief. You 
                        need to tell him about Philip. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Philip?

                                 KAYCEE
                        Vee’s dad. 

                                 INATOMI
                             (to Rankin)
                        What about him?

           Rankin doesn’t want to tell him. He doesn’t trust him. So 
           Inatomi faces Kaycee, finally interested in her.

                                 KAYCEE
                        Before I tell you anything, I’ve 
                        got something to say. First, I 
                        don’t like your attitude. Second, I 
                        don’t like your tone. Third, I 
                        don’t like you insinuating we don’t 
                        know what we’re doing.  

           Remembering, she quickly hides her un-gloved hands behind her 
           back.  

           EXT. WOODS (PHILIP AND VEE) - DAY

           Philip SINGS as he pulls Vee’s playhouse behind him. He’s 
           still trying to establish a connection with his daughter. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Hey, diddle, diddle, the ANTEATER 
                        and the fiddle -- 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        That’s not right!

                                 PHILIP
                        It’s not?

           Philip smiles. He’s got her.

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        No.

                                 PHILIP
                        Well, Princess Vee, how does it go?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:
           INT. VEE’S PLAYHOUSE (WOODS) - CONTINUOUS

           Vee’s tucked into the playhouse corner, her blanket gathered 
           around her legs. She holds Mr. Hippo tightly to her chest. 

                                 PHILIP 
                        There are two things I know about 
                        princesses. One, they live in 
                        beautiful pink princess houses. And 
                        two, they love to sing. 

                                 VEE
                        What do they sing?

                                 PHILIP 
                        Good question! Maybe you could tell 
                        me. You’re a princess? What do you 
                        sing?

           Vee considers this question then takes a deep breath.

                                 VEE 
                             (sudden, enthusiastic)
                        All the children say, We don’t need 
                        another heeeeee-ro, We don’t need 
                        to know the way home. All we waaaaa- 
                        ant is life beyond the thunderdome. 

                                 PHILIP
                        That’s some good singing Vee. 

                                 VEE
                        Princess Vee!

           Philip trudges forward, amused by her confidence. 

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING (FBI SEATTLE FIELD OFFICE) - DAY

           A boring, brick building with an FBI sign out front - a very, 
           small discrete sign. If you didn’t know what you were looking 
           for, you wouldn’t find it. 

           INT. SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OFFICE (SEATTLE) - CONTINUOUS

           Special Agent in Charge, AGNES WARNER (60’s) a hard looking 
           woman, glares at TWO FILES lying side by side on her desk. 
           One is labeled PHILIP LEVINE. The other is labeled LOUISE 
           ADELL.

           In front of her stands, SPECIAL AGENT BRADFORD (30’s), a 
           pudgy paper pusher who had the misfortune of delivering the 
           folders - the background checks - to her desk. 
                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER
                        Who do we have out there?

                                 BRADFORD
                        Assistant Special Agent Inatomi. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER
                        Let me guess. He’s not our top guy.  

                                 BRADFORD
                        He’s new, ma’am. But he did manage 
                        to get us some coordinates. He’s 
                        also a very good kayaker.  

           Warner grabs the files, shaking them at Bradford.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER
                        These files. These files are not 
                        good. 

                                 BRADFORD
                        No. They are not, ma’am. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER
                        I thought files couldn’t get this 
                        bad unless they had to do with 
                        those commie sons of bitches. But 
                        these, these have proved me wrong. 

           She drops the files on her desk, making sure they don’t touch 
           any other work material as though they were contagious.

                                 BRADFORD
                        They’re bad files, ma’am.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER
                        I have to take these files 
                        upstairs. And by upstairs, I mean 
                        the CIA. Because I’m already at the 
                        top fucking floor. And I hate 
                        talking to CIA. You know why?

                                 BRADFORD
                        Because sometimes they make us look 
                        bad?

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER
                        Because they’re assholes and 
                        nothing good ever happens when I 
                        talk to them. All we’re going to do 
                        is make a new file. A thicker file. 
                        And in twenty years, someone’s 
                        gonna have to deal with the shit 
                        file we’re about to make. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (CONT'D)
                        It’s a vicious fucking cycle. Makes 
                        me think that we should just start 
                        flipping coins to make decisions. 
                        Leave less of a paper trail. And 
                        we’d probably have better odds of 
                        getting it right. 

           She finishes her rant and picks up her phone. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (CONT’D)
                        Get me Gary. 

                                 GARY (PRE-LAP)
                        This is Gary. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE (MISSION CHIEF/CIA) - MOMENTS LATER

           A different though nearly identical office but instead of an 
           FBI insignia, it’s the CIA plastered on the wall. 

           GARY GRIERSON (50’S), the Northwest Mission Chief, holds the 
           phone. The “BRADFORD” of the CIA stands in front of his desk, 
           holding files labelled Adell, Louise and Levine, Philip.

                                 CHIEF GARY
                             (into phone)
                        We’re already on it. 
                             (responding)
                        I know it’s domestic. But we’re not 
                        completely uninvolved. I mean, 
                        you’ve seen the files. 
                             (beat)
                        So are you telling me, you would 
                        prefer we didn’t sort it out? 
                             (responding)
                        I already got the coordinates. 
                             (answering)
                        Call a plumber. Your office is 
                        leakier than the sink at my first 
                        apartment. In the meantime, you can 
                        consider the matter taken care of.

           Gary hangs up the phone, looking at CIA Bradford.

                                 CHIEF GARY (CONT’D)
                        We’re about to make a massive file. 

           He dismisses the subordinate with the wave of his beefy hand. 

           INT. OFFICE (FBI) - CONTINUOUS

           And Warner does the same thing. But as FBI Bradford leaves--
                                 WARNER
                        Wait. Lock these up. 

           Bradford returns to grab the files from her hand.

                                 BRADFORD
                        Who is Louise Adell? 

                                 WARNER
                        Lou’s the reason we’ve got any oil. 
                        She’s also the reason they burn the 
                        US flag in Iran. Admittedly, it’s a 
                        conflicted legacy. 
                             (beat, thinking)
                        And one that needs to end. Put a 
                        team together. 

                                 BRADFORD
                        But the CIA is taking care of it.

                                 WARNER
                        That’s like asking an armless man 
                        to tie your shoe. 

                                 BRADFORD
                        I’ve seen some really talented 
                        armless-

           Warner raises an eyebrow. Bradford shuts the hell up and 
           exits with the files. 

           ANGLE ON--

           A BUNCH OF GUNS.

           INT. KITCHEN (LOU’S HOUSE) - DAY

           Rankin and Inatomi stare at the kitchen table where Lou’s 
           REMAINING ARSENAL rests on the worn wood. 

                                 INATOMI
                        No one normal has this many guns. 

                                 RANKIN
                        They’re all legal.

                                 INATOMI
                        Ten bucks says the ones she’s 
                        carrying aren’t. 

           Inatomi holds out his hand to shake on the bet. Rankin looks 
           at it and frowns. 
           So Inatomi diverts and pretends he was just reaching to 
           adjust an evidence tag. 

                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        Maybe she’s a survivalist? We’ve 
                        raided some insane places. One guy 
                        had twelve thousand cans of tomato 
                        sauce. Twelve thousand. All 
                        expired. Or maybe she was looking 
                        for an opportunity to use these 
                        things. Looking for some 
                        excitement. Maybe Lou made herself 
                        an opportunity.

                                 RANKIN
                        You think Lou had something to do 
                        with kidnapping that little girl?

                                 INATOMI
                        What about this whole scenario 
                        makes you think she didn’t?

                                 RANKIN
                        Let me show you something.  

           INT. BASEMENT (LOU’S HOUSE) - MOMENTS LATER

           The lid of the industrial freezer opens. Rankin and Inatomi 
           look down at PACKAGES OF DEER MEAT shining beneath the bulb. 

           Inatomi raises an eyebrow, looking to Rankin. 

                                 INATOMI
                        There’s nothing about this that 
                        makes her seem less crazy. 

           Rankin picks up a package of deer meat and reads from it. 

                                 RANKIN 
                        Cook two hours. Low heat. Good for 
                        stews. She left cooking 
                        instructions. For someone. And as 
                        far as I know the only person she 
                        knew, that she would leave 
                        something for, is Hannah. She 
                        doesn’t want to hurt her. Or her 
                        daughter.

                                 INATOMI
                        All I’m saying is I’ve seen less 
                        suspicious serial killers. 
                             (suddenly)
                        What the hell!?
           Inatomi jumps back, unholstering his gun, pointing it at his 
           feet. 

           Rankin clicks on his flashlight. The beam reflects off the 
           shiny coat of LOU’S CAT. Inatomi backs up. The cat follows, 
           rubbing against his legs. Rankin CHUCKLES.

                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        Bundy had cats! Lots of them.

           EXT. HUNTING SHACK (LOU AND HANNAH) - DAY

           Lou and Hannah stare at the HUNTING SHACK through the trees. 
           Hannah double checks the coordinates in her hand.

                                 HANNAH
                        We’re here. 

                                 LOU
                        Hm.

           Hannah holds her knife out in front of her. It’s BACKWARDS.  
           Lou pushes her hand down, pulls a GUN from her hip and moves 
           forward. Hannah quickly steps in front of her. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (whispering)
                        Wait! What if you shoot Vee?

                                 LOU
                        I’m not going to shoot Vee.

                                 HANNAH
                        You have really good aim?

           This strikes a nerve. 

                                 LOU
                        Yes. Very good aim. 

                                 HANNAH
                        How good?

                                 LOU
                        Good enough that I can stand on my 
                        front porch, shoot into your 
                        trailer, and lay you flat on the 
                        floor. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Okay. That sounds pretty good.
           Lou moves past Hannah, scanning the woods. She reaches the 
           SHACK DOOR. She goes to kick it open, pauses, then tries the 
           handle. The door pops open-- 

           ANGLE ON SHACK FLOOR--

           Resting on the floor of the shack is the BRIGHT RED PLASTIC 
           EGG sitting on Lou’s empty cookie plate. The egg’s been 
           opened, a LITTLE PHOTO lies beside it. 

           The open egg doesn’t sit well with Lou. She scoops it up with 
           the photo. Hannah and Jax appear in the doorway. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        They’re not here. 

                                 LOU 
                        Nope.

           Lou pulls out her reading glasses and looks at the photo. Jax 
           rushes over to the cookie plate, licking it. Hannah pushes 
           him away and picking up the plate. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (quietly)
                        It’s part of a set. I’m taking it 
                        home.

           ANGLE ON PHOTO--

           It’s Vee’s school photo. A NEW SET OF COORDINATES are inked 
           at the bottom.

           Hannah peeks over Lou’s shoulder to get a better look. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god! Those photos were 
                        supposed to come in the mail but 
                        they never did. I thought the 
                        postman took’em. You know? The 
                        creepy one? I thought he was a 
                        peeper, peeping on Vee. I got him 
                        fired. 
                             (looking at Lou, confused)
                        That was weeks ago.

                                 LOU
                        Then Philip’s been watching you. 
                        For weeks. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I had no idea.
                                 LOU
                        Because you let your guard down.  
                        You heard he was dead and didn’t 
                        give it another thought. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What else was I supposed to do? 

                                 LOU
                        You shouldn’t have listened. For 
                        Vee’s sake. 

           Hannah throws her hands up, exasperated. Jax FLINCHES.

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t need you calling me a bad 
                        mom. What do you know about it up 
                        on that hill, in that house all by 
                        yourself? 

           Something out the window catches Lou’s eye. She sees TWO MEN 
           IN CAMOUFLAGE, stalking through the woods, armed with ASSAULT 
           RIFLES. 

           She watches as they move toward the shack in an overly 
           complicated TACTICAL MANEUVER. She’s not impressed.

                                 LOU
                             (to Hannah)
                        I know more than you think.

           Lou checks to make sure Hannah’s out of their line of vision.

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah? Like what?

           About a dozen yards away, the Men separate; MAN #1 GOES 
           RIGHT, MAN #2 GOES LEFT. Lou sees it all. 

                                 LOU
                        Hm. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (oblivious)
                        What’s with the noise. What does it 
                        mean? Is it a tic? I don’t get it. 

           Lou scans the cabin, looking for something. She clocks a 
           DUSTY KEROSENE LANTERN and some OLD RAGS. 

                                 LOU
                        Tell me about the plate. 
                                 HANNAH
                        What?

                                 LOU
                        I need to take a breather. Outside. 
                        To cool off. It’ll help if you keep 
                        talking. Tell me about the plate. 
                        You collect them?

           Hannah looks down at the plate in her hand.

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh. Yeah. I got a set of twelve 
                        from the grocery. For free! 

                                 LOU
                        Talk loudly. I really want to hear 
                        this story. 

           Lou looks at Jax, INDICATING he stays with Hannah. Then she 
           discretely grabs the lantern and a rag.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. HUNTING SHACK - CONTINUOUS

           Lou exits, sneaking around the wall of the hunting shack, out 
           of sight of the MEN, who are also circling it. She pulls out 
           a lighter, lighting one of the rags. She stuffs it into the 
           lantern. It flames with old fuel. 

           Then she COCKS her gun. 

           ANGLE ON JAX--

           He watches as Hannah wraps an extra shirt around the plate.

                                 HANNAH 
                        You got a stamp with every ten 
                        dollars you spent at the grocery. I  
                        saved thirty stamps. That’s three 
                        hundred dollars. Took me so long. 

           She gently slides the plate into her backpack.

           ANGLE ON LOU--

           Lou heaves the lantern over the shack’s flat metal roof. 

           ANGLE ON MAN #1--

           He slides around the shack, moving in Lou’s direction until--
           The lantern EXPLODES on the ground beside him. It’s only a 
           quick BURST OF FLAME but it distracts him long enough for Lou 
           to get her gun to his temple. 

                                 HANNAH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        What was that? 

                                 LOU
                        I tripped. 

                                 HANNAH (O.C.)
                        You okay?

                                 LOU
                        Just fine! 

           Lou disarms Man #1 and motions for him to move with her 
           around the house. As they move quickly--

                                 HANNAH (O.C.)
                        Well, anyway, once I collected the 
                        thirty stamps, I had enough for 
                        eleven plates. But who wants an odd 
                        number of plates? I don’t know if 
                        that’s bad luck, but it should be. 

           Lou and Man #1 reach his partner, Man #2, who’s too busy 
           peering around the corner to notice them behind him. 

                                 LOU
                             (to Man #1)
                        I really hope he likes you. 
                             (to Hannah)
                        So how’d you end up with twelve? 

           Man #2 hears Lou and whips around, seeing his buddy with a 
           gun to his temple. 

           ANGLE ON HANNAH--

                                 HANNAH
                        Right! Well, Kaycee, you know 
                        Kaycee, she’s my best friend.

           ANGLE ON LOU--

           Lou keeps her gun to Man #1’s head, walking backwards with 
           him into the woods. Man #2 reluctantly follows, his gun 
           trained on them. 

           Lou stops, whispering to her captive.
                                 LOU
                        Take off your clothes. Slowly. Tell 
                        your friend to do the same. 

           Man #1 reaches for the portable radio attached to his chest. 

           ANGLE ON HANNAH--

           She paces inside the cabin, getting into her story.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, Kaycee’s boyfriend Deacon, 
                        works at the grocery. Until he got 
                        fired but that’s a long story. So 
                        Deacon, started shorting people 
                        stamps to give to me. Rich people 
                        who probably didn’t even want free 
                        plates. Like Robin Hood. Kind of. 

           ANGLE ON LOU--

           Lou kneels down, looking at MAN #1 and MAN #2. They’re tied 
           together, in their underwear. Their mouths are bound.

                                 LOU
                        You were going to hurt that girl in 
                        there, weren’t you?

           They look away, guiltily. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        She’s made mistakes but none so bad 
                        she deserves to die. 

           Beat.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. One day you’ll wake 
                        up and you’ll realize that when you 
                        thought you were making the world a 
                        better place, you were only helping 
                        to make it worse. Time will not 
                        heal the wounds you make. It’ll 
                        only make them fester. It’s not a 
                        good way to live. Trust me. Get out 
                        while you can.

           ANGLE ON HANNAH--

                                 HANNAH
                        And that is how I got twelve 
                        plates! Lou? I’m coming out. I hope 
                        you had enough time to calm down. I 
                        feel better. 
           She picks up her backpack. The pocket’s still open. The plate 
           slips out, CRACKING on the ground. Jax jumps back, scared. 
           From the doorway: 

                                 LOU
                        And after all that work. With the 
                        stamps.

           Hannah SIGHS, picking up the pieces. 

                                 HANNAH
                        It’s okay. I’ll glue it back 
                        together. I’m not gonna have eleven  
                        plates. 

                                 LOU
                        That’s the spirit. Let’s go. 

           Lou looks out the window. She can just barely see MAN #1 and 
           MAN #2 hidden in the woods. 

           EXT. ROCKY CLIFF (WOODS) - DAY

           A ROCKY CLIFF rises upward from the forest floor. It extends 
           deep into the woods in both directions, creating an enormous 
           natural fence. If you’re in a hurry, there’s no way around it 
           except up. And it’s a hard climb.

           Vee and Philip sit on a colorful picnic blanket at the bottom 
           of the cliff, eating lunch. Philip spreads raspberry jam on 
           white bread, followed by peanut butter. He holds up a jar of 
           MARSHMALLOW FLUFF.

                                 VEE
                        Mom says I can’t have fluff. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Moms say a lot of things. And you 
                        know what? They’re probably right. 

           Philip goes to throw the fluff into the woods. 

                                 VEE
                        But--  

                                 PHILIP
                             (lowering his hand)
                        Should it be our little secret? 

           Vee nods her consent.  

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        You promise not to tell her when we 
                        see her? 
                                 VEE
                        Promise. 

                                 PHILIP
                        When you make a promise to someone 
                        you should look them in the eye. 
                        That way, they know you mean it.

           Vee looks up, making eye contact with Philip. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        And remember, never make a promise 
                        you can’t keep.

                                 VEE
                        I promise. 

           Vee reaches her pinkie out toward Philip. He considers Vee’s 
           small, little finger.

                                 PHILIP
                        What’s this?

                                 VEE
                        It’s a pinkie promise. 

                                 PHILIP
                        That’s adorable. 

           He wraps his giant pinky around hers and holds on. They look 
           into each other’s eyes. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        What do you think about calling me 
                        dad?

                                 VEE
                        I don’t have a dad. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Well, just think about it. Maybe 
                        give it a try. See how it feels. 

           They unhook fingers and Philip hands Vee the fluff sandwich.  

           EXT. WOODS (LOU AND HANNAH) - DAY 

           Lou tears into a package of BEEF JERKY as she walks. She 
           bites into the dried meat, chewing it. Then she takes it out 
           of her mouth and feeds it to Jax, who hungrily gulps it down.

           Behind them, Hannah lags, limping in her borrowed boots. 
                                 HANNAH
                        Wait up. 

           Lou doesn’t slow down. Frustrated, Hannah charges ahead, 
           passing her. Jax BARKS at her. 

                                 LOU
                        Don’t do that. Walk behind me. 

           Hannah ignores her and keeps pushing through the brush. Lou 
           motions to Jax who runs after Hannah, nipping at her legs. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Back off Jax!

           Jax runs in front of her, lying down, blocking her path. 
           Hannah steps over him and this is when Lou sees it -- a THIN 
           WIRE stretching between the trees. 

                                 LOU
                        Hannah! Stop!

           Hannah ignores her. Her boot catches the wire. She trips over 
           it, tumbling onto the ground. 

           She freezes looking up at Lou. Afraid. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Lou?

                                 LOU
                        Don’t move. You’ll be okay. Just 
                        don’t move. 

           Suddenly -- a BLACK METAL OBJECT swings down from the trees. 
           Hannah raises her hands, SCREAMING as it slams into her head.

           Then QUIET. The object SPINS in the air, until Hannah grabs 
           it. It’s just a TAPE DECK. 

                                 HANNAH
                        There’s a note. 

                                 LOU
                        What’s it say?

                                 HANNAH
                        “Push play.”

                                 LOU
                        Well? Push it. 
                                 HANNAH
                        Me?
                             (Lou SIGHS)
                        Okay, okay.

           There’s a beat, and then the tape deck plays an EERIE 
           RECORDING of Hannah and Vee singing nursery rhymes. Their 
           voices MORPH into a MAN CHANTING AN ISLAMIC PRAYER. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s he saying? 

                                 LOU
                        Something to me. Turn it off. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What do you mean “to you”?

                                 LOU
                        Just turn it off! 

           Lou reaches for her gun, aims. Hannah SCRAMBLES out of the 
           way. Lou shoots the tape deck. It EXPLODES. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What was that about?

           Lou whips around and SLAPS Hannah across the face. 

                                 LOU
                        You didn’t listen to me. This won’t 
                        work unless you listen to me.

           Beat. Lou takes a step back, signalling the attack is over. 
           Hannah is crushed by the scolding. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m sorry Lou.

                                 LOU
                        You’re all Vee’s got. Do you know 
                        that? 

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah. I do. 

                                 LOU
                        And I’m all you’ve got. I can keep 
                        you safe but only if you listen to 
                        me. 

           Lou glares at Hannah and holsters her gun.
                                 HANNAH
                        Okay. 

                                 LOU
                        Let’s keep moving. 

                                 HANNAH
                        There’s nothing you want to say to 
                        me?

                                 LOU
                        No. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Nothing at all?

                                 LOU
                        You talk too much?

                                 HANNAH
                        Alright. You don’t have to 
                        apologize for hitting me. I know 
                        you did it because you care. 

           Hannah reaches forward, rubbing Lou’s back. Lou STIFFENS and 
           quickly steps away from Hannah’s touch. 

           EXT. LOU’S BACKYARD (WOODS) - DAY

           Rankin stares into the trees bordering the grass. He’s real 
           conflicted, uncomfortable with doing nothing. 

                                 RANKIN
                        I got a bad feeling Millie. I got a 
                        feeling they’re in way too deep. 

                                 BERRY (O.C.)
                        Hey Boss!

           Berry saddles up next to Rankin carrying the EVIDENCE BOX and 
           a steaming cup of coffee.

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        Penny for your thoughts. 

                                 RANKIN
                             (taking the coffee)
                        Did Inatomi say when search and 
                        rescue is getting here? 

                                 BERRY
                        He said soon. 
                                 RANKIN
                        What’s soon mean? 

                                 BERRY
                        Not sure, Boss. 

           Rankin looks into the evidence box and sees the bag holding 
           Hannah’s note with the COORDINATES. He takes it, looks at it,   
           making up his mind. 

                                 RANKIN
                        I need to go into those woods, 
                        Berry. When people start asking 
                        questions and you don’t know what 
                        to say, don’t say anything. And you 
                        don’t know much, do you?

                                 BERRY
                        No, Boss. 

           As if he’s sensed Rankin’s plan, Inatomi runs from the house 
           holding a FOLDER full of FAX PAPER. He’s replaced his FBI 
           windbreaker with a heavy duty outdoor jacket. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Big news guys! Big news! Just got 
                        word. Reenforcements are coming. 

           Rankin eyes Inatomi’s fancy outdoor jacket. It’s pretty nice.  

                                 RANKIN
                        That’s fantastic. Can I borrow your 
                        jacket?

                                 INATOMI
                        Why?

                                 RANKIN
                        I just need a better jacket.

                                 INATOMI
                        For what?

                                 RANKIN
                        For when I go into the woods. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Did you hear me? Help’s coming. You 
                        don’t need to go into the woods. 
                        Actually, we’ve been ordered NOT to 
                        go into those woods. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Give me your jacket. 
                                 INATOMI
                        No. This isn’t department issued. I 
                        had to spend my own money on it. 

           Rankin takes a step toward Inatomi. Inatomi steps back, 
           bumping into Berry. 

                                 RANKIN
                             (to Berry)
                        Shoot him. But not in the chest. I 
                        don’t want a hole in my new jacket. 

           Inatomi clutches the folder. Berry reaches for his side arm.

                                 INATOMI
                        What? No. Listen. We just need to 
                        wait before we do anything. Okay?

                                 RANKIN
                        Give me one good reason to wait. 

           Inatomi glances at the folder. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Okay. If I tell you something, do 
                        you promise not to tell anyone?

           Rankin SNATCHES the folder from Inatomi. He opens it. 

           ANGLE ON FOLDER--

           The fax paper is covered in THICK BLACK LINES.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLIFF (WOODS) - DAY

           Vee continues to sit on the picnic blanket enjoying an 
           animated after-lunch conversation with Mr. Hippo when she 
           realizes -- Philip’s gone. She’s alone.  

           A BRANCH CRACKS somewhere close by. Vee startles. She holds 
           up Mr. Hippo, forcing him to peek into the trees. 

                                 VEE
                        What do you see? 

           MR. HIPPO’S POV: TWO MEN IN CAMOUFLAGE creep toward the 
           picnic blanket. 

           They see Vee, look to each other for confirmation. Then they 
           RAISE THEIR WEAPONS and move forward until-- 
                                 PHILIP (O.C.)
                        Oh, come on boys. She’s just a kid. 

           Philip steps into frame behind the men. Before they know 
           what’s happening, he quickly wraps a METAL LANYARD with TWO 
           LOOPS around their necks. He sweeps his leg behind their 
           shins, dropping them to their knees.  

           ANGLE ON VEE--

           The hand holding Mr. Hippo begins to shake.

                                 VEE
                             (to Mr. Hippo)
                        What’s going on? 

           ANGLE ON PHILIP--

           He drags the men to a nearby tree, securing their necks to 
           the trunk with a well practiced slip knot. 

           Then he steps back to watch -- if one man pulls on the wire, 
           the other begins to suffocate. 

                                 PHILIP
                        I could do this for hours but I’ve 
                        got baby-sitting duty. 

           Philip salutes the men, turns around and walks back to Vee. 
           It’s now that we see that the wire is attached to a large 
           spool that Philip holds in his hand. 

           As he moves further from the tree, the spool unwinds. 

           Vee opens her eyes, seeing Philip approach.

                                 VEE
                        I heard a noise. 

                                 PHILIP
                        What did it sound like? 

                                 VEE
                        Mr. Hippo will tell you.  

           She holds Mr. Hippo up so he and Philip can chat.

           ANGLE ON PHILIP’S BACK--

           The spool of wire has reached its end. Philip feels the 
           strain. Smiling, he takes one step forward toward Mr. Hippo.

           ANGLE ON MEN--
           They frantically grab at the wire as it transitions from 
           tight to suffocating. They struggle. Then go limp.

           ANGLE ON PHILIP--

           Philip feels this play out along the wire. And he enjoys it. 
           He tosses the spool to the side and takes Mr. Hippo. He holds 
           the toy up to his ear, listening.  

           Then he looks Mr. Hippo in the eye. 

                                 PHILIP
                        I appreciate your vigilance. But 
                        let me assure you, there are 
                        absolutely no monsters in these 
                        woods. I’ve made sure of that.
                             (to Vee)
                        Do you think he feels better?

           Vee nods, taking Mr. Hippo back. Philip’s watch BEEPS.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Good. Now I need you to answer my 
                        next question truthfully. Does Mr. 
                        Hippo like amusement park rides? 

           Vee gives Philip a small smile. 

           EXT. LOU’S BACKYARD - DAY

           Rankin rifles through the folder then glares at Inatomi.

                                 RANKIN
                        What in the hell am I looking at?

           Inatomi points at the BLACK FAX PAPER. 

                                 INATOMI 
                        It’s Lou. You’re looking at Lou. 
                        Her file’s completely redacted. 
                        Files like this were urban legends 
                        at the academy. I’ve never seen 
                        anything like it.

                                 RANKIN
                        What does it mean?

                                 INATOMI
                        It can only mean one thing: Lou’s 
                        been in some shit. And when someone 
                        like this disappears into the 
                        woods, you stay as far away from 
                        the smell as possible. Yesterday, 
                        she emptied her bank account. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 INATOMI (CONT'D)
                        Most likely to pay whoever she’s 
                        working with. Which brings me to 
                        Philip, her partner in crime--

           Rankin opens Philip’s file next. He squints at the papers. 

                                 RANKIN
                        My God--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. CLIFF/PLAYHOUSE - DAY

           Philip now stands at the TOP OF THE CLIFF strapped into a 
           CLIMBING HARNESS. A rope runs from the harness to a METAL 
           PULLEY lodged deep in a TREE that overhangs the side of the 
           cliff. 

                                 INATOMI (O.S.)
                        This guy’s a real sicko. The type 
                        of guy who’d have weird groupies if 
                        we could keep him locked-up long 
                        enough.

           ANGLE ON PLAYHOUSE--

           Ropes are attached to each of the four sides. The ropes 
           tighten. And the playhouse rises off the ground.  

                                 INATOMI  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Problem is, he escapes wherever we 
                        put him. Minimum security, maximum, 
                        it doesn’t matter. Frankly, I think 
                        he enjoys a good challenge. 

           ANGLE ON PHILIP--

           He walks backwards pulling the rope. The wind picks up. 

           ANGLE ON PLAYHOUSE--

           The playhouse swings in the wind, twisting. Suddenly--

           SNAP. 

           - A ROPE BREAKS. The house lurches from the three remaining 
           ropes, smashing into the rock. 

           In the playhouse, Vee slides down the floor, hitting the 
           door. It holds. She shields herself as the plastic window 
           BREAKS into the house. 
           Philip’s muscles stain as he quickly pulls up the playhouse. 
           It scrapes against the rock, leaving a trail of bright pink 
           paint in its wake. 

                                 INATOMI (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        This last time he escaped, he 
                        smashed a guy’s face in beyond 
                        recognition. The coroner I.D.’ed 
                        based on the jumpsuit. Which was 
                        Philip’s. Only, you guessed it, it 
                        wasn’t him. Needless to say, he’s 
                        not the type of guy you’d want your 
                        kid around.

           Philip pulls the house over the cliff’s edge and opens the 
           door. Vee leaps out, JUMPING INTO PHILIP’S ARMS, HUGGING HIM. 

           EXT. LOU’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Rankin throws his coffee cup on the ground, pointing his 
           finger at Inatomi. 

                                 RANKIN
                        I don’t know who Lou is but I do 
                        know when a guy like that wants 
                        everyone to where he’s going, he 
                        knows exactly what he’s doing. 
                        Those ladies need our help. But I’m 
                        not sure they need the help you 
                        guys intend to give them. Get your 
                        director, commander, whoever you 
                        report to, on the phone. Now.

                                 BERRY
                             (softly)
                        You still want me to shoot him, 
                        Boss?

           Rankin shakes his head, walking back toward Lou’s house.  

                                 RANKIN
                        Shoot him, don’t shoot him. I don’t 
                        really care. Accidents happen all 
                        the time. But let him make that 
                        phone call first.

           Inatomi looks nervously at Berry. Berry WINKS at him.

                                 BERRY
                        Don’t worry. I’m not gonna shoot 
                        you. 

           Inatomi relaxes. Berry’s hand jumps back to his gun. 
                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        Or am I?

           EXT. WOODS (LOU/HANNAH) - DAY

           Hannah, Lou and Jax pass through a dense underbrush. Branches 
           grab at their clothes. Their pace is methodical but steady.

           There’s a break in the clouds and a beam of SUNLIGHT falls 
           directly in front of Hannah. She steps into it, the light 
           warms her face. It feels good. 

           Up ahead, Lou continues walking when Jax starts WHIMPERING 
           and CIRCLING her. He pushes his body against her legs. Lou 
           looks down at him. 

                                 LOU
                        Shit. You sure? 

           Jax continues to block her path, SITTING in front of her. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Damn it. 

           SUDDENLY, Lou clutches her chest in pain and stumbles 
           forward, collapsing onto the ground. Expecting this, Jax does 
           his best to break her fall. 

           Hannah opens her eyes. Sees Lou on the ground.

                                 HANNAH 
                        Lou? Are you tired?
                             (beat, realizing)
                        Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  

           Hannah runs to Lou. 

                                 LOU
                             (gasping)
                        Pocket! 

           Hannah’s hand moves to her own breast-pocket. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Idiot. My pocket. 

           Hannah pats Lou down, finding a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. She 
           opens it and shakes out a SNAPCAP VIAL of AMYL NITRATE, an 
           upper used for heart arrhythmia.  

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Break it. Under my nose. 

           Hannah obeys, SNAPPING THE CAP. Lou inhales deeply. 
           -LOU’S POV: Time slows. Colors intensify. THE WORLD SURGES.

           Lou sits up, revived, too revived. She grabs Hannah by the 
           shirt, pulling her so close their faces nearly touch. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me.

                                 HANNAH
                        Okay.

                                 LOU
                        You listening?

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah, yeah, I’m listening.

                                 LOU
                        You need to keep looking for beauty 
                        in the world. Pure, true beauty, 
                        hidden beneath the muck and filth 
                        of humanity. If you wipe it all 
                        away, you’ll find a diamond created 
                        by the weight of our general 
                        malady. I’ll help you find your 
                        diamond -- we’ll preserve it, if 
                        only for an instant, to remind 
                        ourselves of what is good. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (whispering)
                        That sounds awesome. 

                                 LOU
                        Vee will be our diamond. She will 
                        be what makes it all worth it 
                        because without these moments of 
                        purity, you have nothing. Do you 
                        understand? 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m not sure. 

           Lou continues, undeterred.

                                 LOU
                        I’ve been lost, Hannah. But not 
                        now. My mission is clear. I will 
                        finally make things right. For you 
                        and Vee, I’m going to make them 
                        right. 

           Lou SPRINGS to her feet. Jax BARKS excitedly. Hannah, 
           shocked, remains kneeling.  
                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go! 

           Hannah looks at Lou’s prescription bottle still in her hand, 
           amazed by its capabilities. Then she looks at Lou. 

                                 HANNAH
                        What just happened?

                                 LOU
                        Ticker’s not what it used to be. 

           Lou bends down and snatches the orange bottle from Hannah’s 
           hand, tucking it back into her pocket. 

           INT. LOUNGE (SAN JUAN AIRPORT) - EARLY EVENING

           Rankin and Inatomi sit by the terminal window. A LARGE EARLY 
           MODEL CELL PHONE stands on the table between them. 

           The carnage at the airport is visible through the glass as 
           are HALF DOZEN FBI AGENTS, shooting the shit, waiting for 
           orders.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (O.S.)
                        Why the hell am I on speaker phone?

                                 RANKIN
                        Ma'am? It’s Rankin here. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (O.S.)
                        Who are you?

                                 RANKIN
                        San Juan Police Chief. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Ma’am, we’re just hoping to have a 
                        better understanding of our plan so 
                        we can assess how to best help you. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (O.S)
                        And who the hell are you?

                                 INATOMI
                        Assistant Special Agent Inatomi, I--

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (O.S.)
                        The kayaker. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Correct, the kayaker.
                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (O.S.)
                        We’re wrapping this thing up 
                        tomorrow. You can help by making 
                        sure no one goes into those woods. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Not to be contradictory but I’d 
                        like to go into the woods. Now. Get 
                        those women back safe and sound.
                             (pushing)
                        If that’s the end goal.

           Beat. Warner doesn’t answer. Maybe it’s a bad connection. 
           Inatomi moves to fidget with the phones antenna when--

                                 SPECIAL AGENT WARNER (O.S.)
                        What else would the end goal be? 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. WARNER’S OFFICE (FBI SEATTLE DIVISION) - CONTINUOUS

           Warner’s desk is covered in files with bright red TOP SECRET 
           STAMPS on them. She picks up a 9 X 11 photograph from one of 
           the files, WINCING at whatever she sees on it. 

                                 RANKIN  (O.S.)
                        That’s what I’d like to know. 
                        Because there’s this one detail 
                        that keeps pestering me -- why’d 
                        he’d blow up the airport? I’ve been 
                        thinking on it and the only thing I 
                        can figure is, Philip wanted us to 
                        make a connection. He knew I’d call 
                        the FBI about an explosion at an 
                        airport. And once I saw the blown 
                        up cars, I’d lead you right to him. 
                        So then I asked myself, why would 
                        he want the FBI on his trail? 

           Warner sets down the photo, giving Rankin her full attention. 

           INT. LOUNGE (SAN JUAN AIRPORT) - CONTINUOUS

           Inatomi looks at Rankin. It’s beginning to dawn on him that 
           Rankin may be on to something. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Well, Philip wouldn’t want the FBI 
                        here just so he could get caught. 
                        Where’s the point in that? So then 
                        it struck me. Philip knows you 
                        don’t want to catch him. He knows 
                        you’re going to do something else. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANKIN (CONT'D)
                        So I’m going to ask again, what’s 
                        the end goal? What is going to 
                        happen in those woods?

           Agent Warner leans toward the phone.

                                 AGENT WARNER 
                        Stay. The. Fuck. Out. Of. The. 
                        Woods. That’s an order.

                                 INATOMI
                        Okay! Thank you ma’am -- I want to 
                        say it’s been a pleasure--

           Warner picks up the phone on her desk and SLAMS it back down, 
           hanging up. 

           She looks at Agent Bradford, lingering in front of her desk. 

                                 AGENT WARNER
                        We’re nothing more than janitors, 
                        wheeling our mop bucket from mess 
                        to mess. While we’re cleaning up 
                        puke in the bathroom, someone’s 
                        splitting their lip in the gym. And 
                        this mess right here, Lou and 
                        Philip, this is a moldy sandwich in 
                        the teacher’s lounge. No one wants 
                        to take responsibility because then 
                        you’d be admitting it’s your mess. 
                        The CIA didn’t take care of it. 
                        We’re the last line of defense. 
                        It’s time to throw this sandwich 
                        away. 

                                 BRADFORD
                        Ma’am?

                                 AGENT WARNER
                        I’m giving Operation Hoagie the go-
                        ahead.

           She picks up her phone, dialing. 

           INT. LOUNGE (SAN JUAN AIRPORT) - CONTINUOUS

           Inatomi looks at Rankin.

                                 INATOMI
                        Well. I guess that settles it. 
                        We’re out of the action.
           He throws his hands in the air, hoping Rankin will share his 
           exasperation. He does not. Rankin stands, sweeping TWO SETS 
           OF CAR KEYS from the table into his hand. 

                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you got my keys by accident. 

           Inatomi watches as Rankin exits the airport and throws 
           Inatomi’s rental keys into an overflowing DRAINAGE DITCH. 

           ANGLE ON--

           INATOMI’S KEYS sinking into the thick, muddy water. Then a 
           HIKING BOOT plunges into the muck and we’re with--

           EXT. WOODS (HANNAH AND LOU) - DAY

           --Lou, Hannah, and Jax as they trudged through a wet lowland 
           area. After what happened with Lou’s heart, Hannah’s sticking 
           close until-- 

           Jax begins to GROWL. Lou looks up, seeing SEVERAL DEER in the 
           distance. 

           She slings her rifle off her shoulder and lowers herself onto 
           a rock, removes the gun from its case and aims.

                                 HANNAH
                        You sure you should be doing this 
                        after taking funny pills?

                                 LOU
                        You ever use a gun before? 

                                 HANNAH
                        A couple of times. At the dump. We 
                        took turns shooting cans. 

                                 LOU
                        This is better.

           Lou pulls Hannah close so she can look through the scope. 
           Hannah obeys, disturbed by Lou’s visible pleasure.

           -SCOPE POV: The cross-hairs hover over the deer. 

                                 LOU  (O.C.) (CONT’D) 
                        You can aim for the boiler room --
                        the heart and the lungs. That’ll 
                        kill him but it’s not real humane. 
                        The best shot, in my opinion, is 
                        the head, between the eyes, right 
                        through the brain. It’s faster and 
                        they feel less. 
           Hannah removes her eye from the scope.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Stay down there. It’s your turn. 

                                 HANNAH
                        You want me to shoot a deer?

                                 LOU
                        Yes. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’ve never killed anything before. 

                                 LOU
                        That’s why I want you to shoot a 
                        deer. 

           Hannah reluctantly takes the gun. It settles naturally into 
           her shoulder.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        All you need from the deer is for 
                        it to die. 

           Hannah aims, finding a DEER. She moves her finger to the 
           trigger, uncomfortable.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Good, now exhale slowly and pull 
                        the trigger.

           Hannah EXHALES and--

           BANG. 

           She intentionally fires into a nearby tree. 

           The DEER SPRINT OFF. Unharmed. Hannah drops the gun on the 
           ground. She stands. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Come on Lou. What’s shooting a deer 
                        got to do with anything?

                                 LOU
                        You said you’d listen to me. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Not when you’re talking crazy. 

                                 LOU
                        When it comes down to it you need 
                        to be ready to use the gun.
                                 HANNAH
                        On Philip? No way. We need to talk 
                        to him, try to reason--

                                 LOU
                        Look at your arm. Remember what he 
                        did to you. He’s not a man of 
                        reason. He’s not going to just give 
                        Vee back. 

                                 HANNAH
                        If we have to use guns, we’re going 
                        to lose. Vee’ll get hurt. She won’t 
                        be a diamond or whatever. She’ll be 
                        a dead kid. I don’t know what you 
                        were in your past, but now -- I 
                        know you’re trying but -- well, we   
                        can’t risk it. 

           It’s clear Hannah’s words have hit their mark. Lou quickly 
           wipes down her rifle. Hannah continues--

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        But if he’s already done something 
                        to her. If he’s hurt Vee, he 
                        doesn’t deserve fast. I want Philip 
                        to feel everything. I want him to 
                        die slowly.  

           Lou looks at Hannah, seeing her in a new light. 

                                 LOU
                        It’s one thing to kill a man 
                        because he’s got to be killed. It’s 
                        another to do it in a way that 
                        serves an idea as arbitrary as 
                        justice. Think about what it really 
                        means.

                                 HANNAH
                        Maybe it means I’m learning. I’m 
                        learning something from you. 

                                 LOU
                        No. I didn’t teach you that. 

           Lou shakes her head and returns her rifle to its case.  

           EXT. LOU’S BACKYARD - SUNSET

           Rankin straddles Bigfoot preparing to go into the woods.
           Beside him, Deacon shows off the machine’s various gadgets. 
           He flicks a switch. The trees in front of the ATV light up, 
           showcasing powerful headlights.

           Kaycee watches them, hugging herself against the cold. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        Good luck Chief. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Everything’s gonna be just fine.  

           Rankin REVS Bigfoot’s powerful engine as Inatomi runs around 
           the house. His pants are covered in DITCH MUD.

                                 INATOMI
                        Wait! Wait! 

           Rankin looks over his shoulder at him. 

                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        Saving these women isn’t going to 
                        bring her back. Millie’s gone 
                        Rankin, she’s gone. You don’t need 
                        to be a hero. 

           Beat.

                                 RANKIN
                        That’s all you’ve got?

                                 INATOMI
                        I thought it would be more 
                        convincing. 

                                 RANKIN
                        ‘Kind of just made me more mad. 

                                 INATOMI
                        I can see that. What do you want me 
                        to tell my boss?

                                 RANKIN
                        You do what you gotta do, Inatomi. 
                        But I’ve got to do this. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Hold on. 

           Inatomi shrugs off his coveted outdoor jacket. 
                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        It’s made out of Gore-Tex. It’ll 
                        keep you dry and warm without added 
                        weight. It’s top of the line. 

           He holds the jacket out to Rankin. Rankin takes it, THROTTLES 
           UP and drives off into the woods.  

           Kaycee glares at Inatomi. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        What in the hell is wrong with you? 
                        Bringing up a man’s dead wife? It’s 
                        not right.

                                 INATOMI
                        He’s going to get himself killed. 
                        Along with those women.

           Inatomi, Kaycee and Deacon stare into the woods as Rankin 
           disappears amongst the trees. 

           Beat.

                                 DEACON
                        You think Bigfoot’s gonna be okay?

                                 INATOMI
                        Bigfoot?

                                 KAYCEE
                        The ATV. 

                                 INATOMI
                        No. Definitely not.

                                 DEACON
                        Shiiiiii--iiiiitt. 

           Deacon hawks a wad of tobacco onto the ground. 

           EXT. CLIFF (WOODS) - NIGHT

           A FLASHLIGHT BEAM crawls along the rock face, landing on the 
           ROPE PULLEY SYSTEM that hangs from the top. 

           Lou holds the flashlight, pondering the set-up. Behind her, 
           Hannah looks for the next egg. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t find it. 

                                 LOU
                        Hm. 
                                 HANNAH
                        How will we know where to go if we 
                        can’t find it?

                                 LOU
                        Are you afraid of heights?

                                 HANNAH
                        Totally. And leeches. And being 
                        buried alive and--

                                 LOU
                        Tomorrow we have to climb this 
                        rock.  

                                 HANNAH
                        How?

           Lou points her flashlight at the CLIMBING HARNESS that Philip 
           left hanging from the rope.

                                 LOU
                        With that. 

                                 HANNAH
                        And we’re just going to do what he 
                        says?

                                 LOU
                        For now. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Okay, okay. 
                             (beat)
                        Yep. Okay. Alright.

           Lou watches Hannah turn around and disappear into the woods.  

           Hannah reemerges with a BIG STICK. And goes ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.  
           Hitting the rock. The ground. Wood flies everywhere. 

           Jax WHIMPERS, hiding behind Lou’s legs. 

                                 LOU
                        Hannah!   

           Hannah looks up from her tantrum. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        You’re scaring the dog. 
                                 HANNAH
                             (regaining herself)
                        Sorry Jax. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAVE (PHILIP AND VEE) - NIGHT

           Philip and Vee hunker down beside a small fire inside a 
           shallow cave. He makes SHADOW PUPPETS against the wall. Vee 
           GIGGLES, her lips covered in white fluff.

                                 PHILIP
                        Quack, quack! 

                                 VEE
                        A duck! 

           Vee holds up her hands. 

                                 VEE (CONT’D)
                        Do me! 

           Philip can barely open Vee’s sticky fingers as he forms them 
           into a dog. He shows her how to make the dog’s mouth move. 

                                 VEE (CONT’D)
                        Woof! Woof! 
                             (beat)
                        Another one! 

                                 PHILIP 
                        I have something else we can do. 

           Philip reaches forward, taking a charred stick from the fire. 
           He presses his hand against the wall of the cave and uses the 
           stick to draw an outline of his palm. 

           Then he takes Vee’s small hand, presses it against the wall 
           and draws her palm outline inside of his. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        You and me. We go together. 

                                 VEE
                        Okay, Dad.

           She places her small hands on either side of his face and 
           kisses his nose before settling back into his lap. Philip 
           looks down at her. 
                                 PHILIP
                             (quietly)
                        I didn’t know if I’d be any good at 
                        this. The whole dad thing. I didn’t 
                        have a great role model. My dad, he 
                        wasn’t a nice guy. 

           Vee eyeballs the open FLUFF JAR. She doesn’t understand what 
           Philip’s getting at. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        So this is exceeding my 
                        expectations.

           Philip smiles, pleased with himself. He looks back down at 
           Vee. She’s scooping fluff directly from the container into 
           her mouth.

           EXT. NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

           A THICK CLOUD COVER moves quickly over the dark sky, offering 
           momentary glimpses of the bright stars and moon beyond. 

           EXT. WOODS (RANKIN) - NIGHT

           Rankin drives quickly through the woods. If Bigfoot can’t go 
           over something, Rankin finds he can easily go around it. He’s 
           going so fast he doesn’t notice a STEEP DROP in the terrain. 

           The ATV flies off the ground, sailing through the air. It 
           lands with a THUD. Rankin lurches forward over the handlebars 
           and when he leans back, he has a HUGE SMILE on his face, the 
           first we’ve seen.

                                 RANKIN
                        Oh, come on, I didn’t have the time 
                        to find a helmet, Millie. 

           He REVS the engine and continues on. 

           EXT. CLIFF (LOU AND HANNAH’S CAMP) - NIGHT

           Lou and Jax rest against a tree, watching a SMALL FIRE burn. 

           Lou sips from a water bottle. She tries screwing the cap back 
           on but her hand shakes too much. 

           Across the fire, Hannah notices. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Can I get some of that?

           Lou hands her the water and the cap. She knows Hannah’s 
           covering for her.  
                                 LOU
                        At first, growing old was charming. 
                        I knew more. I was wiser. Didn’t 
                        sweat the small stuff. But then, at 
                        some point it switched. And every 
                        year meant knowing less, doubting 
                        myself, feeling weaker. Having too 
                        much time to reflect.
                             (remembering)
                        I use to think I was spectacular, 
                        Hannah. Absolutely spectacular. And 
                        then one day realized I wasn’t 
                        anymore. That maybe I never was. 

           Hannah reaches over, squeezing Lou’s hand. Lou’s very 
           uncomfortable with this physical gesture but Hannah holds on. 

                                 HANNAH
                        My grandma used to knit. I mean 
                        really knit, these beautiful 
                        scarves and sweaters. They looked 
                        so good, they looked like they were 
                        from China. You know what I mean? 

                                 LOU
                        They were -- intricate.

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah. Exactly. Real intricate. Then 
                        one day she had a stroke. No more 
                        knitting. It broke her heart even 
                        more than Pop-Pop passing. Is it 
                        like that? Wanting to knit but not 
                        being able to?

                                 LOU
                        Sounds similar. 

           Lou settles onto the ground, closing her eyes.

                                 HANNAH
                        Lou?

                                 LOU
                        Go to sleep.

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t. I’m worried about Vee. 

                                 LOU
                        Worrying won’t help. 
                                 HANNAH
                        But I’m always worried about Vee. 
                        That she’ll end up like her dad, 
                        all bad and no good. 

           This comment gets Lou’s attention. 

                                 LOU
                        What’s she done to make you think 
                        that? Torture a squirrel?

                                 HANNAH
                        Nothing like that. 

                                 LOU
                        You wake up with her standing over 
                        your bed with a knife?

           Hannah glances at Lou, horrified by the thought. 

                                 HANNAH
                        ‘Course not. 

                                 LOU
                        Then go to sleep. 

                                 HANNAH
                        But what if she changes?

                                 LOU
                        You’d already know. A mother always 
                        knows. That’s what they say right?

                                 HANNAH
                        I guess so. 
                             (beat)
                        Hey Lou?

                                 LOU
                        Yes?

                                 HANNAH
                        Can I sleep with Jax tonight?

                                 LOU
                        Be my guest. 

           Lou nudges Jax, encouraging him over to Hannah. She receives 
           him with wide opened arms, burying her face in his fur. 

                                 HANNAH
                        You sure you won’t get lonely?
                                 LOU
                        I’ll be fine. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Promise?

                                 LOU
                        Don’t worry about me. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Wouldn’t do me any good anyway.

           Lou smiles to herself as a log breaks in the fire, sending a 
           plume of SPARKS into the dark night air.  

           INT./EXT. VEE’S PLAYHOUSE/CAVE - NIGHT

           Philip looks inside the playhouse at Vee. She’s sound asleep. 
           Mr. Hippo is beside her, his eyes wide-open, staring out at 
           Philip. 

           Philip holds a finger to his lips, telling Mr. Hippo to keep 
           quiet as he closes the playhouse door. 

           EXT. CLIFFS (LOU AND HANNAH’S CAMPSITE) - NIGHT

           Hannah and Lou sleep beside the RED EMBERS of the fire. 

           SUDDENLY -- Lou’s eyes flick open, an instant before a GLOVED 
           HAND clamps across her mouth. She reaches for her handgun but 
           a knee pins her arm to the ground. 

           Philip grabs Lou’s gun and points it at Hannah. He leans 
           down, WHISPERING into her ear.

                                 PHILIP
                        I don’t want her to die now. So 
                        let’s be quiet about this, okay?

           Lou nods her agreement. Philip releases her mouth. Over his 
           shoulder, Lou sees JAX STEALTHILY APPROACHING.

           Philip reaches down to help Lou to her feet. She accepts his 
           hand. Standing, she motions for Jax to lie down. He doesn’t. 
           Lou motions again and he finally obeys.  

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Lou stands next to a tree; her arms wrapped around its trunk. 
           She watches Philip bind her wrists together with a zip tie. 

           Next to them, are the STIFF BODIES of Philip’s earlier 
           victims. Philip catches Lou staring at the men’s contorted 
           faces.  
                                 PHILIP
                        Oops. 

           Lou scowls. Unflappable. Philip gently cups her face. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I wondered how much you 
                        knew about me. If you even cared to 
                        know anything.

                                 LOU
                        I know who you are. I know what 
                        you’ve done. 

                                 PHILIP
                        So you know I followed in your 
                        footsteps? Well, maybe not exactly 
                        but in the same general direction.

           He shines his flashlight onto Lou’s face, inspecting it, 
           taking his time. Finally-- 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        I have your eyes, Mom.
                             (he tilts his head)
                        Maybe a bit of your nose? Dad had 
                        the stronger features. Handsome 
                        features. I’m sure he wasn’t your 
                        worst assignment.

           Lou whips her head to the side, pulling her chin from 
           Philip’s grasp. 

                                 LOU
                        Leave Vee’s coordinates with Hannah 
                        and do what you want with me.   

                                 PHILIP
                        You want me to kill you?

                                 LOU
                        You didn’t tie me to a tree so you 
                        could give me a hug. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Sorry. I’m not in the martyr making 
                        business. 

           Philip sits. He encourages Lou to do the same, watching as 
           she shimmies her arms awkwardly down the tree trunk. He finds 
           it amusing. 
                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Dad told me about you. They weren’t 
                        appropriate conversations to have 
                        with a kid but he was bitter. Smart 
                        men manipulated by attractive young 
                        women often are. You had a child 
                        with him. What could be more 
                        convincing? You really fooled him. 
                        And you toppled an empire. 
                             (shaking his head)
                        But now look at you. Dismissed by 
                        everyone. Even the country you 
                        spread your legs for. If you ask 
                        me, it’s disrespectful. But I don’t 
                        think anyone’s going to ask me.

           SUDDENLY -- from the campsite. 

                                 HANNAH (O.C.)
                        No. Stop!  

           Lou looks at Philip  wondering what he’ll do. Philip smiles. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Listen. It’ll get better. 

                                 HANNAH (O.C.)
                             (sleepy, barely conscious)
                        Lou -- the pigs ordered Chinese 
                        again and ate it in your bed. It’s 
                        a mess. The swine are naughty. 

                                 PHILIP
                             (to Lou)
                        It’s adorable. She talks in her 
                        sleep. It’s the only time I liked 
                        to listen to her. 

           Philip leans his back against the tree, his face inches from 
           Lou’s. They wait to see if Hannah will say something else. 
           She doesn’t. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        I don’t remember much about my 
                        childhood. But I remember that 
                        promise you made. 

           He looks at Lou. She remembers too. 

                                 LOU
                        To come back and get you. 
                                 PHILIP
                        I waited. But you never came. Why 
                        not, why’d you leave me behind?

           Lou SIGHS. She’s not willing to sugar coat the truth, not 
           even now.

                                 LOU
                        Because you were a monster. Just 
                        like your dad. I didn’t want 
                        anything to do with you.

                                 PHILIP
                        I was just a kid. 

                                 LOU
                        Still, I could tell you were no 
                        good. And I was right. Look at you. 

                                 PHILIP
                        It’s because you left me. With him. 

                                 LOU
                        A better man would learn from a bad  
                        example. Only a monster would be 
                        inspired by it. You could have been 
                        like me. You could have left your 
                        kid alone.

                                 PHILIP
                        Leave Vee out of it. 

                                 LOU
                        That’s what you should have done.

           Lou’s indignation makes Philip furious.  

                                 PHILIP
                        You really think there's some big 
                        difference between you and me? 

                                 LOU
                        I do.

                                 PHILIP
                        Because I killed for a paycheck and 
                        you killed for a pension?

                                 LOU
                        It wasn’t just a paycheck for you, 
                        was it? You got more from it. 
                             (re: the tree)
                        You didn’t have to kill those men. 
                        You wanted to kill those men. 
                                 PHILIP
                        So tell me, how do you know when a 
                        man truly deserves to die? There 
                        must be some way for you to know 
                        that all the death you've caused 
                        has been worth it. That you haven't 
                        made the same mistake over and over 
                        and over again, simply because some 
                        government said it was right and 
                        just. Otherwise, I'm not sure how 
                        someone like you, someone who can 
                        say there’s a difference between 
                        us, could live with yourself. So 
                        how do you know it’s been worth it? 

           Philip looks to Lou, waiting for her to answer. She doesn’t. 
           He knows she can’t. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        It’s why you bought the tarps. 
                        Because you don’t have an answer. 
                        And you want to pay for your sins.
                             (whispering, sincere)
                        I’ll help you do that. But not now.

           Lou can’t hold back any longer. She lunges forward like an 
           angry snake. 

                                 LOU
                        If I believed in mistakes, I’d say 
                        I’ve made my share of them. And I’d 
                        say my greatest mistake was letting 
                        you live. My boss told me to kill 
                        you and I didn’t listen. And look 
                        where it got me. Tied to a tree in 
                        the middle of a night. You better 
                        kill me now, Philip or else-- 

           Philip GRABS LOU’S THROAT, pinning her face against the tree. 
           Unclipping a knife from his belt, he places the tip against 
           her forehead and begins writing something. 

           Lou winces. Blood drips in her eyes. Philip scrunches his 
           face, he’s having trouble with one of the letters. 

                                 PHILIP
                        I’ll die tomorrow. I’ll die with my 
                        family. I’ll save them from this 
                        world. And you’ll get to die 
                        knowing you didn’t make a 
                        difference for them or anyone else.   

           He finishes with Lou’s forehead, taking a moment to admire 
           his work. Then he kisses it, getting her blood on his face. 
           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It’s Philip’s watch. Time to leave.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        See you tomorrow.  

           And with that, he slams the gun onto Lou’s skull, knocking 
           her unconscious. Lou’s face slumps against the tree revealing 
           her forehead. It reads “MOM” in bloody letters. 

           The “O” is pretty wonky. 

           EXT. HUNTING SHACK (WOODS) - NIGHT

           Rankin steps from the shack, holding VEE’S SCHOOL PHOTO with 
           the coordinates. He tucks it into his pocket. Suddenly -- 
           there’s MUFFLED MOVEMENT in the dark.

           Rankin steps toward the noise, scanning the woods with his 
           flashlight. 

           The FLASHLIGHT BEAM comes across the stripped down CIA 
           operatives. They’re trying to get his attention. 

           He walks over to them. 

                                 RANKIN
                        If I untie you, what are you going 
                        to do? 

           Rankin pulls the gag from MAN #1’s mouth. 

                                 MAN #1 
                        Nothing. We’ll do nothing. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Nothing? Might as well leave you 
                        tied up then. 

                                 MAN #1
                        But what if she comes back?

           Beat.

                                 RANKIN
                        Lou did this to you? 

           The Men look down. Ashamed. 

                                 MAN #1
                        She’s a lot tougher than she looks. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Which is exactly why I got to talk 
                        to her before I let you go. 
           Rankin gently re-gags the Man’s mouth and returns to Bigfoot. 

           The men PROTEST as they watch Rankin drive away, disappearing 
           into the dark.  

           EXT. CLIFF (LOU AND HANNAH’S CAMPSITE) - EARLY MORNING

           - CLOSE ON SLEEPING HANNAH: a FLY buzzes about, finally 
           landing on her face. She slaps at it, hitting herself awake. 

           Opening her eyes, she finds a PINK EGG sitting directly in 
           front of her. She grabs it.

                                 HANNAH
                        Lou! I found the egg! 
                             (realizing)
                        Wait. Philip was here. He was right 
                        here. Lou! Where are you? Lou?

           Hannah looks around. She sees Lou tied to the tree. Jax is 
           beside her limp body. Hannah runs to her. 

           She pulls out her KNIFE, cutting the zip tie around Lou’s 
           wrists. Unsupported, Lou falls onto the ground. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Did he do this to you? Did that 
                        S.O.B.--

                                 LOU
                        Get water. 

           Hannah disappears, racing back to the campsite, leaving the 
           PINK EGG behind. Lou sees it. She reaches for it--

           Hannah returns and stoops down, picking up the egg before Lou 
           can get it. She gives Lou the water bottle.   

                                 HANNAH
                        Drink. We’ll read it in a second.

           She smooths Lou’s hair back, looking at her forehead to 
           inspect the damage. She sees the bloody “MOM.” 

           Hannah blinks.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Your forehead. It says something.

                                 LOU
                        It’s fine. It doesn’t hurt much. 

                                 HANNAH
                        It’s not fine. Not fine at all.
           Lou reaches up, tracing the letters with her finger. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        It says, “mom.”

           Lou looks at Hannah, considering her options. She EXHALES and 
           pulls the trigger. 

                                 LOU
                        Awhile back, you asked if I had any 
                        kids. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I was making small talk.

                                 LOU
                        I did. I do. A son.

                                 HANNAH
                        You have a son. 

                                 LOU
                        I named him after the town I grew 
                        up in. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t want to ask. 

                                 LOU
                        You need to ask.

           Beat.

                                 HANNAH
                        Where’d you grow up?

                                 LOU
                        Philadelphia. 

           Hannah yanks the water bottle away from Lou, angry. Lou tries 
           to explain.

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to protect you from him. 
                        It’s why I moved to the island. 
                        It’s why you’re in my trailer. 
                        Cheap rent. A yard for Vee. I made 
                        it so you couldn’t say no. And when 
                        I heard he was dead, I thought you 
                        were safe. I thought my mission was 
                        over. I was the one who let my 
                        guard down. Not you.

           Hannah stands up, unsure of where to go or what to say. 
                                 HANNAH
                        Why didn’t you tell me? 

                                 LOU
                        The less you know the better. 

                                 HANNAH
                        This is me not knowing anything. 

                                 LOU
                        Just open the egg. 

           Hannah thinks this over. She shakes her head.

                                 HANNAH
                        No. The weather’s cleared. Help’s 
                        going to come and we’re going to 
                        wait.

                                 LOU
                        We can’t wait. 

           Lou reaches for the egg. Hannah hides it in her jacket 
           pocket.

                                 HANNAH
                        No way. You’ll have to kill me 
                        first. 

                                 LOU
                        I won’t have to. If help comes, 
                        they’ll kill you. They’ll kill 
                        Philip and me and they won’t really 
                        care whether Vee gets hurt in the 
                        process.  

                                 HANNAH
                             (faltering)
                        I don’t understand when you talk 
                        like this. 

           Lou thinks, trying to find a way to make Hannah get it.

                                 LOU
                        When you read Vee a book, its 
                        usually got a happy ending?

                                 HANNAH
                        She likes the happy ones, yeah. 

                                 LOU
                        Of course. We all do. But there are 
                        many ways for the same book, the 
                        same story to end well. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                        It just depends on which character 
                        you are. A happy ending for the 
                        Princess, isn’t a good ending for 
                        the witch. Us dying, for some 
                        people, isn’t a bad ending. It’s 
                        the best, cleanest one with no 
                        loose ends. But if we get there 
                        first, we can write the ending. Do 
                        you understand?

                                 HANNAH
                        Vee and I -- we haven’t done 
                        anything. How can you be so sure 
                        someone’s going to hurt us?

                                 LOU
                        I used to be the witch. 

           Hannah steps backward.

                                 HANNAH
                        Then this is your fault. All of 
                        this. You led Philip to us. And now  
                        whoever’s after you guys is after 
                        us. 

           Lou gets to her feet, going after her.  

                                 LOU
                        You’re right. It’s my fault but I 
                        can still help you. I’m not the 
                        person I use to be. I’m better.  

                                 HANNAH
                        If I don’t give you this egg... 
                        you’ll take it from me anyway? 

                                 LOU
                        Yes. I would. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Then you haven’t changed enough. 

           Hannah opens the egg and EATS THE COORDINATES. 

                                 LOU
                        Why’d you do that? 

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re on a need to know basis. And 
                        right now all you have to know is 
                        that we need to climb this cliff. 

           Hannah grabs the harness and swings her leg through it.
           EXT./INT. CAVE (WOODS) - MORNING

           Vee brushes her teeth by the cave’s entrance. Philip steps 
           into his boots, buttoning his shirt. He looks nicer today, 
           like he’s going to a party. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Last night was fun, right? 

           Vee spits out her toothpaste and nods. 

                                 VEE
                        Are we going to see Mom today? 

                                 PHILIP
                        We are. We’re going to have a 
                        picnic with her. 

                                 VEE
                        Good.

           Vee wipes her mouth. Knowing the drill, she crawls into her 
           playhouse. Philip begins to close the door -- 

                                 VEE (CONT’D)
                        Can we leave it open? 

                                 PHILIP
                        Promise me you’ll stay inside? 

           Vee pokes her head out. Looking Philip in the eye, she holds 
           out her pinkie to him.     

                                 VEE
                        Pinky promise. 

           EXT. CLIFF FACE (WOODS) - MORNING

           Hannah clings to the rock face, strapped into the climbing 
           gear. She’s scared out of her mind but she’s not going to let 
           that stop her. Thankfully, she’s nearly at the top.

           ANGLE ON GROUND--

           Lou keeps tension on the lines. 

                                 LOU
                        Use your legs. 

           Hannah does what’s easiest, reaching up with her arms. The 
           rock crumbles, leaving her nothing to grip. She slips off the 
           cliff, FALLING. 

           THLUMP. 
           The line tightens and catches. Hannah floats from the 
           harness. 

           ANGLE ON GROUND--

           Lou steadies herself. Jax watches

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                             (to Jax)
                        She never listens.

                                 HANNAH
                        What?

                                 LOU
                        Grab the wall, hurry up!  

           Hannah swings back onto the cliff. Then, using her legs, she 
           pushes herself over the top, disappearing from view. 

           MOMENTS LATER: JAX DANGLES MID-AIR as he’s hoisted up to the 
           top of the cliff. 

           Hannah reaches over, grabbing him, pulling him to safety. She 
           releases him from the harness. 

           Then Hannah steps to the edge and looks down at Lou. 

           ANGLE ON LOU--

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Throw it down! 

           Lou sees Hannah hesitate. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you’re thinking, it’s a 
                        bad idea. Throw the harness down 
                        and we’ll reverse the lines like I 
                        showed you. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m thinking, I’m not sure I want 
                        to live in a world where I need 
                        someone like you to get my daughter 
                        back. Thank you for trying but I’m 
                        going to get her back myself. 

           Hannah disappears. Lou’s bruised face hardens knowing she’s 
           not coming back.

                                 LOU
                        Hm.
           Beat. Then JAX’s FURRY FACE appears, peeking down at Lou from 
           the cliff’s edge.  

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Someone’s gotta keep an eye on her. 

           Lou motions a command. And he disappears.

           Then she places a hand on the rock and using her legs, she 
           pushes herself up, beginning a free climb. 

           It won’t be pretty but it’ll work. 

           EXT./INT. VEE’S PLAYHOUSE/FIR GLEN - MORNING

           The playhouse comes to a halt in a glen of tall firs. It’s 
           looks like a Christmas tree farm. Curious, Vee peers out the 
           door at Philip. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Gotta see a man about a horse. 

           Vee watches Philip walk a polite distance away before he 
           starts to take a piss. 

           She looks into the trees, sensing an opportunity. Does she 
           dare? 

           She does.

           Grabbing Mr. Hippo, Vee sneaks through the door, QUIETLY 
           RUNNING away from the playhouse. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - MORNING

           Inatomi sits in an easy chair. The cord of the house phone 
           stretches across the floor to his ear. Lou’s cat PURRS on his 
           lap. The KITTENS play at his feet. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Thank you for the update, ma'am.
                             (repeating her)
                        You want to know where Rankin is?

           Inatomi looks down at the cat, distraught, considering his 
           response. Finally--

                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                        Rankin’s around ma’am. He’s a bit 
                        p.o.’ed, you know local cops. Would 
                        you like to speak with him?
                             (beat)
                        Alright, I’ll keep an eye on him. 
                        But if I may, I’d like to ask-
                                 (MORE)
                                 INATOMI (CONT’D)
                             (he looks around, making 
                              sure he’s alone)
                        What is the actual plan? 

           EXPLETIVES pour from the phone. Inatomi holds the receiver 
           from his ear. Then the line goes dead. 

           EXT./INT. PLAYHOUSE/FIR GLEN - DAY

           Philip’s smiling face peers through the door into Vee’s 
           house. It’s empty. His smile disappears. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Vee!
                             (yells into wood)
                        Vee! You pinky promised!

           ANGLE ON VEE--

           She’s running as fast as her little legs will go. 

           INT. CAVE (HANNAH) - MORNING

           Hannah and Jax stand inside the cave. The remains of last 
           night’s fire still smoke. She stares at the HAND PRINT 
           OUTLINES on the cave wall. 

           She reaches her hand out, placing it between Vee’s small 
           outline and Philip’s larger one. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (to Jax)
                        What a creep. 

           EXT. FIR GLEN (PHILIP AND VEE) - MORNING

           Philip looks for Vee, checking his watch. He’s not happy 
           about the time this unplanned distraction is taking. 

                                 PHILIP
                        I’m not mad, honey. I just want you 
                        to come back. I miss you.

           ANGLE ON VEE--

           She has scooted beneath a tree, hiding under the boughs of an 
           enormous fir.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Where did I go wrong with her?

           -VEE’S POV: Philip’s boots circle the tree she’s hiding 
           under. 
                                 PHILIP (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        Promises are important Vee. They 
                        keep us from behaving like animals. 
                        But I’m going to go ahead and chalk 
                        this up to a learning experience. 

           Philip’s boots disappear from view. Vee breathes a sigh of 
           relief UNTIL Philip jerks up the pine bough, revealing Vee’s 
           hiding spot. 

           She scrambles away from him, running. Philip picks up a 
           forgotten Mr. Hippo, amused. He looks back at Vee -- that’s 
           when he sees it. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Vee! Stop! Right now! Or Mr. Hippo 
                        gets hurt.

           His grave tone stops Vee dead in her tracks. She looks down 
           and finds herself inches away from a gaping, rusty metal BEAR 
           TRAP, forgotten by a hunter long ago. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move. Or I’ll hurt him.

           Vee’s eyes widen. She watches Philip approach. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Be still. 

           He reaches down, gently picking her up. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s okay. Look at me. Let me 
                        see those pretty eyes. 

           Vee looks up, simultaneously whipping her small hand across 
           his face, leaving a red streak of TORN FLESH. 

           Philip stumbles, surprised, still holding onto Vee but 
           dropping Mr. Hippo. His foot lands INCHES from the jaws of 
           the bear trap. 

           He gives Vee an angry shake. A piece of the BROKEN PLASTIC 
           WINDOW drops from her hand. Blood drips down Philip’s face.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you do it Vee? Why? We were 
                        having a good time.
                             (he drops her)
                        Answer me! 
                                 VEE
                             (from the ground)
                        I wanted to kill you with the 
                        kindness.

           Philip looks up at the sky, trying to calm down. While he 
           does this, Vee’s little hand searches for -- a ROCK.

           Regaining himself, Philip bends down to Vee’s level, placing 
           his right hand on a nearby boulder. 

                                 PHILIP
                        It’s not your fault. I don’t know 
                        what your mother’s been teaching 
                        you but that’s really fucked up. 

           Vee takes the rock and slams it on top of Philip’s hand, 
           CRUSHING it on the boulder. Philip SCREAMS. 

           He grabs Vee, SLINGING her over his shoulder. Vee sees Mr. 
           Hippo lying on the ground. 

                                 VEE
                        Mr. Hippo!

           Philip turns, STOMPING on the soft animal with his heavy 
           boot, crushing his face into the earth. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Actions have consequences Vee. It’s 
                        about time you learned that.

           EXT. CLIFF (LOU) - MORNING

           Lou rests against the rock face, almost at the top. She looks 
           down at the ground. She’s high enough that a fall would kill 
           her. All she has to do is let go. 

           She SIGHS. Then uses her legs to push herself over the edge. 

           EXT. OCEAN (FRIDAY HARBOR) - MORNING

           It’s a peaceful morning by the water. Waves, sunshine, 
           tranquility, until-- 

           --in the distance, a LARGE BLACK ZODIAC with a WHINING MOTOR 
           speeds by the harbor creating a TUMULTUOUS WAKE.

           EXT. BLACK ZODIAC (FRIDAY HARBOR) - CONTINUOUS

           A SPECIAL OPS TEAM dressed in military tactical gear sit on 
           the boat’s floor. They pass around a LAMINATED SHEET. The 
           back has Philip’s PHOTO on it. The front has a photo of a 
           YOUNGER LOU. Beneath it reads: OPERATION HOAGIE. 
           The UNIT LEADER stands up. He’s identified by a RAMBO LIKE 
           BANDANA. He looks at the shore with a pair of binoculars. 

           -BINOCULAR POV: Rita and Mr. Lancaster, the bank manager, are 
           on the beach, rolling around on a brightly colored towel. 

           EXT. BEACH (FRIDAY HARBOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Rita pauses their romp on the beach. She wants to talk. 

                                 RITA
                        I missed you so much. 

                                 MR. LANCASTER
                        Me too. Me too. 

           Rita senses insincerity. She sits up, her shirt’s pulled down 
           to her waist, exposing her bra. 

                                 RITA
                        Being alone during that storm put a 
                        lot of things into perspective for 
                        me. Mainly, I don’t like being 
                        alone.

                                 MR. LANCASTER
                        You’re not alone. You’ve got -- 
                        you’ve got your work at the bank. 

           Rita grabs a handful of sand and throws it into his face. 

           -BINOCULAR POV: Rita stands, pulls up her shirt, then yanks 
           the towel out from under Mr. Lancaster, sending him toppling 
           onto the beach.  

           ANGLE ON BOAT--

           The Unit Leader lowers his binoculars as the boat disappears 
           around the coast line.

           EXT. FIR GLEN (HANNAH) - DAY

           Hannah walks among the Christmas trees, checking her compass, 
           looking less confident in her decision to leave Lou behind. 
           Jax is nearby, rubbing his hind quarters on a tree trunk.

           Somewhere in the woods a BRANCH BREAKS. Hannah’s hand jumps 
           to her KNIFE. Jax’s EYES NARROW but he keeps scratching.

           Hannah turns, looking for the source of the noise and steps 
           directly onto Mr. Hippo. Excited, she picks him up, showing 
           Jax. 
                                 HANNAH
                        Vee’s here! Find her Jax!

           Jax sniffs the toy. Then the air. But doesn’t move. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Go find her! 

           Jax still doesn’t move. 

           Hannah tucks Mr. Hippo into her shirt so his head PEEKS over 
           her collar. She begins running through the trees. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Vee? You here? Vee! Where are you? 
                        Mommy’s here! 

           Silence. Hannah’s desperate now.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Vee! Vee!

           We see the rusty, old  BEAR TRAP. Hannah does not. Jax BARKS  
           but it’s too late.

           SNAP!

           EXT. WOODS (LOU) - CONTINUOUS

           Lou has finished the climb. Without the coordinates, she’s 
           forced to squint at the ground, following Hannah’s tracks 
           until she hears--

           DISTANT SCREAMING. 

           Lou starts running. 

           EXT. WOODS (PHILIP AND VEE) - CONTINUOUS

           Philip turns in the direction of Hannah’s SCREAMS. His jaw 
           tightens. This was not in the plan. He’s no longer the calm 
           man we saw last night.

           Vee BANGS on the playhouse door. 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        Let me out!

           Her little hand reaches through the broken window.

                                 PHILIP
                        I can’t take it Vee, I just can’t 
                        take it. You’ve got to shut up.
           He KICKS the wall of the playhouse near the window. Vee’s 
           hand quickly disappears back inside. 

           EXT. WOODS (BEAR TRAP) - DAY

           Lou runs through the trees until she sees Jax. She follows 
           him as he leads her to Hannah. 

           Hannah’s leg is caught in the trap’s teeth. Years of rust 
           have prevented it from fully closing. The leg’s a mess but 
           her bone’s still intact. 

                                 HANNAH
                        It’s bad, Lou. 

           Lou tightens her belt around Hannah’s thigh. 

                                 LOU
                        Hm. It’s not too bad. 

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s only something people say 
                        when it’s real bad. 

           Hannah CHUCKLES, clearly in the throes of numbing adrenaline. 
           Lou jams a rock between the jaws of the bear trap to keep it 
           from shutting further.

                                 LOU
                        I’ll come back. Give me the 
                        coordinates. 

           Ignoring her, Hannah grits her teeth and yanks on her trapped 
           leg. The pain’s spectacular now. Lou realizes her only option 
           is to help. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        On three, you pull. One, two, 
                        three--

           Lou pulls on the upper jaw of the trap, giving Hannah a few 
           more precious millimeters. The teeth cling to Hannah’s flesh, 
           ripping it further as she extracts her leg. She’s free. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Hannah. I need the coordinates. 

           Beat. Hannah knows Lou is Vee’s only hope. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Keep going north, to the shore. 
                        We’re close. You need to get there 
                        first.  
                                 LOU
                        I will. But I need your help.

           She lobs the prescription bottle of amyl nitrate at Hannah. 

                                 LOU (CONT’D)
                        Careful. They’ve got some kick. 

           And with that, Lou disappears into the woods. 

           EXT. CLIFF (WOODS) - DAY

           Rankin sits on Bigfoot at the bottom of the cliff. He looks 
           up the steep wall. There’s no way he’s going to climb it.  

                                 RANKIN
                        I hear ya, Millie. But if I retire, 
                        I’ll have too much time on my 
                        hands. 
                             (beat; responding)
                        I hate fly fishing. 

           Rankin pulls a MAP from Bigfoot’s console. 

           ANGLE ON MAP--

           Rankin’s finger circumvents the cliff using a logging road 
           and comes to a stop on a NEARBY HILL -- higher ground for a 
           better perspective. 

           On foot, the road would take too long, but on Bigfoot, Rankin 
           can fly. 

           EXT. LOU’S BACKYARD - DAY

           Kaycee and Deacon stand in the grass watching a MILITARY 
           HELICOPTER approach in the distance. 

           Inatomi’s off to the side, frantically waving a FLARE, 
           directing the helicopter to a nearby LANDING ZONE. The 
           helicopter gets closer. Inatomi keeps waving.

           The helicopter HOVERS OVER them then BUZZES PAST. Inatomi, 
           Kaycee and Deacon watch as it becomes a speck on the horizon.

                                 KAYCEE
                        Weren’t they supposed to stop? 

                                 INATOMI
                        Yes. Yes, they were. 
                                 DEACON
                             (still looking at the 
                              ‘copter)
                        Cool. 

           Inatomi, frustrated, throws his flare into the landing area. 
           Then, unable to help himself, he quickly runs over to stomp 
           out the bright, sparky flame.

           EXT. GRASSY CLEARING (WOODS) - DAY

           A treeless clearing abutting a steep drop into the ocean. The 
           grass is long, untended. It’s most likely an old cow pasture. 
           The type of place that could host a romantic picnic. Instead--

           PHILIP

           --steps into the clearing, pulling the cart behind him. He 
           looks around, satisfied with the location of his denouement. 
           He opens the door to the playhouse.  

           Vee’s on the floor, covering her face with her hands. 

                                 PHILIP
                             (peering inside)
                        Come outside, it’s beautiful. 

                                 VEE
                        I want Mom. 

                                 PHILIP
                        She’ll be here soon. 

           Vee eyes the red scratch running down Philip’s cheek.  

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I know you didn’t mean it. I’d 
                        be sad if you thought I loved you 
                        any less because it.

           Philip extends his good hand, a peace offering. Vee recoils. 
           She’s not coming out. Philip SIGHS. Then he grabs Vee’s leg 
           and yanks her from the playhouse. 

           He stands, holding her upside down by her ankle. He enjoys 
           watching her struggle. Then he flips her over, enveloping her 
           in an uncomfortable bear hug. 

           WHOMP. WHOMP. WHOMP. 

           The MILITARY HELICOPTER flies overhead. Philip checks his 
           watch.  
                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        Impeccable timing. 

           He gives the helicopter a friendly wave. 

           EXT. HILL/CLEARING (RANKIN) - DAY

           Rankin speeds up to the top of the hill -- his chosen 
           destination. He throws Bigfoot into neutral and lifts a pair 
           of binoculars to his eyes. 

           -RANKIN’S BINOCULAR POV: Trees. Trees. More trees. Then -- 
           the clearing. He easily spots Philip, Vee and the pink 
           princess playhouse. 

                                 RANKIN (O.C.)
                        What in the hell--
                             (answering Millie)
                        I don’t understand it anymore than 
                        you do.

           Seeing something, Rankin quickly swivels with the binoculars. 

                                 RANKIN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do it, Lou. Don’t do it. 

           -RANKIN’S BINOCULAR POV: Lou stands off to the side, watching 
           Philip and Vee, partially obscured by the trees.

           She unholsters her handgun. On the hill, Rankin GROANS.

           ANGLE ON CLEARING--

           Lou steps into the clearing, away from the trees, revealing 
           herself. 

           Philip turns, seeing her. He smiles.

                                 PHILIP
                        You made it! 

           ANGLE ON RANKIN--

           Rankin drops the binoculars around his neck, starts Bigfoot 
           and takes off down the hill toward the clearing.   

           EXT. WOODS (HANNAH) - DAY

           Hannah’s lower left leg barely holds together as she 
           struggles through the woods. Jax walks in front, leading.

           Mr. Hippo, once again, peers from the collar of her shirt. 
                                 HANNAH
                             (singing to herself)
                        Lou. 
                             (step)
                        Lou. 
                             (step)
                        She’ll point--
                             (step)
                        -- a gun at you. 

           SUDDENLY -- JAX STOPS, sensing something. Hannah ducks, 
           looking around. Through the trees, she sees the SPECIAL OPS 
           TEAM from the boat moving up the hill. 

           Watching them, Hannah reaches into her pocket. She pulls out 
           one of Lou’s pills, breaks it under her nose, INHALING 
           DEEPLY. Her pain evaporates.  

           She tosses the capsule aside and keeps moving. Nothing’s 
           going to stop her.   

           EXT. CLEARING (LOU/PHILIP/VEE) - CONTINUOUS

           Lou’s on one side of the field. Philip and Vee are on the 
           other. Philip clutches Vee to his chest, using her as a 
           shield. 

           Lou knows she can’t shoot at Philip, she can’t risk hitting 
           Vee. And Philip knows this, too. 

                                 PHILIP
                             (to Vee)
                        The picnic’s about to start. Are 
                        you excited?

                                 VEE
                        Lou’s here. 

           Vee raises her hand, giving Lou a small wave. Lou gives her a 
           small wave back. 

                                 VEE (CONT’D)
                             (to Philip)
                        She’s got guns.

                                 PHILIP
                        So do we. 

           Lou’s pilfered gun GLINTS in Philip’s hand.

                                 VEE
                        Why?
                                 PHILIP
                        Because it’s rude to show up at a 
                        picnic empty-handed
                             (addressing Lou)
                        You made it. What about--

           He doesn’t want to say Hannah’s name for Vee’s sake.

                                 LOU 
                        She got caught up. Like most family 
                        reunions, this one’s jumped the 
                        rails.

                                 PHILIP
                        I wish I’d inherited your sense of 
                        humor. Maybe I would have had more 
                        friends. 

                                 LOU
                        Doubtful. Your hand’s hurt. If I 
                        remember correctly, that’s your 
                        trigger finger. 

                                 PHILIP
                        So we’re even. I’m injured and 
                        you’re old. Like that dog of yours.

           Suddenly, Vee elbows Philip’s injured hand. He HOWLS in pain, 
           dropping her. She makes a break for Lou. But Philip’s too 
           quick, he grabs the hood of her jacket, dragging her 
           backwards toward the playhouse.

           He throws Vee inside, strategically positioning himself in 
           front. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        It’s a special day, Lou. I wish 
                        Hannah could be here but maybe it’s 
                        better, just the bloodline-- 

                                 LOU
                        I didn’t leave you as a kid to 
                        listen to you now. Besides, we’ve 
                        got company. 

           She motions to a REFLECTION UP ON THE HILL. 

           EXT. HILL (SPECIAL OPS TEAM) - CONTINUOUS

           The Special Ops team have positioned themselves on the hill. 
           Sunlight reflects off the Leader’s binoculars as he watches 
           Lou and Philip. 
           Behind him, his men break off into teams: SNIPERS AND 
           SPOTTERS. 

           INT. LOU’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Inatomi paces back and forth. He’s pointing his finger and 
           YELLING into the phone.

                                 INATOMI
                        No, you listen to me, ma’am! I 
                        don’t know much but I know what’s 
                        happening in those woods is not a 
                        search and rescue. And if that 
                        little girl doesn’t come back safe 
                        and sound -- I’ll tell the world! 

           He quickly hangs up, beating Warner to the punch. Then he 
           does a SPASTIC KAYAK PADDLING MOTION with his arms. Finished, 
           he looks up and finds Deacon watching him. 

                                 DEACON
                        You need a beer, man? 

           Inatomi nods, gratefully.

           EXT. CLEARING (WOODS) - DAY

           Lou and Philip continue to square off when they hear the ROAR 
           of Rankin’s approaching ATV.

           Rankin speeds up to the clearing and dismounts. He goes for 
           his gun but thinks better of it -- too many guns already. He 
           holds his hands up, stepping into the grass. 

                                 LOU
                        Rankin, this isn’t your fight. 

           Rankin looks between Philip and Lou.

                                 RANKIN
                        You’re right about that. 
                             (to Philip)
                        Let the girl go and I’ll give you 
                        two some privacy. 

           Philip looks at him. Then back at Lou. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Is he kidding? 

                                 LOU
                        He’s a good man. Not like us. You 
                        were right Philip. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                        There wasn’t a difference between 
                        us. But now there is. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Come on son, let her go.  

                                 PHILIP
                        Don’t call me son. 

           Philip quickly lifts his gun and shoots Rankin TWICE IN THE 
           CHEST. Rankin flies backwards, sprawling over Bigfoot. 

                                 LOU
                        Your aim’s off. 

           Lou raises her gun. Philip swivels around, pointing his gun 
           at her. It’s a draw but there’s only ONE SHOT.

           BANG. 

           A FLOCK OF BIRDS scatters from the tree tops, SQUAWKING. 

           CLOSE ON: Philip’s eyes, surprised. 

           CLOSE ON: Lou’s eyes, hazy. She falls to her knees. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Well, that was disappointing.

           ANGLE ON LOU--

           A SCARLET STAIN blossoms through her jacket, saturating the 
           fabric. With the last of her energy, Lou aims her gun -- INTO 
           THE GROUND. She fires. 

           BAM. BAM. BAM.  

           ANGLE ON RANKIN--

           He BLINKS AWAKE at the sound of the GUNSHOTS. The collar to 
           his shirt is open, revealing a bullet proof vest.

                                 RANKIN
                             (to himself)
                        What’s she doing Millie? 

           BAM. BAM. BAM. Lou keeps firing. All into the ground. 

           The handgun’s magazine empties. Lou slumps over, unconscious. 

           ANGLE ON PHILIP-- 

           He smiles. He’s won. Not necessarily in the way that he 
           wanted but he’ll take it. 
           ANGLE ON LOU--

           Her eyes flutter open. She summons the energy to say a final 
           word. 

                                 LOU
                        Kill. 
                             (again louder)
                        KILL.

           Philip looks confused until--

           --from the woods, JAX SHOOTS OUT INTO THE CLEARING. He’s fast 
           agile, a blur of fur, unlike the animal we’ve come to know. 

           He runs straight at Philip, TEETH EXPOSED, GROWLING, leaping 
           into the air when--

           BAM. 

           Philip fires his gun, hitting Jax’s hindquarters, sending the 
           dog spiraling onto the ground with a THUD. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Jesus. 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        I want mommy!

                                 HANNAH (O.C.)
                        I’m here Vee. 

           CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING -- Hannah and Mr. Hippo standing 
           directly behind Philip. A KNIFE BLADE appears along his 
           throat. She’s used Lou’s distraction to sneak up on him.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                             (to Philip)
                        Hi sweetheart.  

                                 PHILIP
                        Hello Hannah.

                                 HANNAH
                             (unsure)
                        Let go of -- drop the gun. 

           Philip smiles, amused. He knows Hannah won’t hurt him.

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        Mom!?

                                 HANNAH
                        Hold on Vee. 
           Hannah’s just barely holding on herself, she’s lost a lot of 
           blood.

           Vee RATTLES the door to the playhouse, wanting out. A line of 
           blood appears on Philip’s neck beneath the QUIVERING blade. 

                                 RANKIN (O.C.)
                        I’ll take it from here, Hannah.  

           Hannah glances over and sees Rankin lying across Bigfoot, his 
           gun pointed at Philip. He’s steady, he’s got the situation 
           under control. 

                                 RANKIN (CONT’D)
                        Just put the knife down and move to 
                        the side. He’s not going to hurt 
                        you or Vee anymore. Are you, 
                        Philip?

                                 PHILIP
                        I was never going to hurt them. I 
                        was only here to help. 

           Philip drops his gun, giving up. 

           Hannah closes her eyes. Relief sweeps over her face. She 
           removes the knife from Philip’s throat--

           --and PLUNGES THE BLADE THOUGH HIS BACK -- into the BOILER 
           ROOM. Philip GROANS and drops, falling onto his face. 

           Hannah watches as he struggles. BLOOD BUBBLES on his lips.

           SUDDENLY -- BULLETS rain down from the hill, puncturing 
           Philip’s lungs. 

           Hannah grabs the base of Vee’s playhouse, pulling it 
           backwards into the woods, taking cover.  

           Rankin drops behind Bigfoot. 

           ANGLE ON LOU--

           Lou’s body jumps as several rounds hit her chest. 

           ANGLE ON HILL--

           The Special Ops Leader lowers his binoculars and speaks into 
           an INDUSTRIAL WALKIE TALKIE.  

                                 LEADER
                        Targets one and two have been 
                        terminated. Over. 
                             (beat, listening)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEADER (CONT'D)
                        A kayaker said what? 
                             (beat, listening)
                        Fine by me.
                             (to his men)
                        Disregard targets three and four. 
                        Mission accomplished. 

           The Snipers quickly set to dismantling their weapons.

           EXT. CLEARING (WOODS) - MOMENTS LATER

           Rankin kneels beside Lou. She looks peaceful, despite the 
           bullet holes. Her suicide note is clutched in her hand.  

           Rankin gently pulls it from her fingers.

           ANGLE ON PLAYHOUSE--

           Hannah leans against the house, holding Vee’s hand through 
           the broken window. 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        I wanna come out. 

           Hannah surveys the carnage. Vee should stay where she is. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Look, I found Mr. Hippo. 

           She pulls the toy from her shirt, putting him in Vee’s hand. 

                                 VEE
                        Where’s Dad?

           Hannah looks at Philip. Blood drips from his mouth.  

                                 HANNAH
                        He had to leave.  

                                 VEE
                        Good. 

           Rankin appears around the side of the house. He looks at 
           Philip. Then at Hannah -- he hands her the note from Lou.

                                 HANNAH
                             (knowing better)
                        Is she -- ?

                                 RANKIN
                             (shakes his head)
                        You know how animals disappear into 
                        the woods when they know their 
                        time’s come? Well, Lou knew. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANKIN (CONT'D)
                        She knew she wasn’t coming out of 
                        these woods. She’s found her peace. 

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        Mom?

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah?

                                 VEE (O.C.)
                        I have to tell you something. 

           Hannah glances nervously at Rankin. She kisses Vee’s hand. 

                                 HANNAH
                        You can tell me anything. 

                                 VEE
                        I ate fluff. A lot of it. 

           Hannah relaxes and closes her eyes, tucking Lou’s note into 
           her jacket.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL - LATER 

           A small building with a police cruiser parked in front.

           INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - CONTINUOUS

           Berry STANDS GUARD outside a hospital room door, keeping an 
           eye on things. Across from him is a MOBILE X-RAY READER. 

           TWO DOCTORS gather by the reader and throw a piece of film 
           onto the screen. The light flicks on, illuminating the x-ray. 
           It clearly shows an ACTION HERO FIGURE that’s been stuck -- 
           really stuck -- in someone’s rectum. 

                                 BERRY
                        WHOA.

           The Doctors turn around, eyeing Berry. He averts his eyes and 
           holds up a hand to apologize. Straightening up, he returns to 
           his post, just in time to see Rankin and Inatomi walking down 
           the hallway. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Thanks for keeping watch Berry. 

           Inatomi looks up and down the hallway suspiciously, not 
           seeing the X-ray glowing behind him. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Notice anything suspicious? Any 
                        unusual activity? 
                                 BERRY
                        Um.

           The Doctor clicks the screen off. The image disappears. 

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        Nope. Nothing unusual. 

           He opens the hospital room door for the men. As Rankin passes 
           Berry, he pats him on the shoulder. 

                                 RANKIN
                        Good job. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hannah rests on a bed with a heavy bandage on her leg. Vee’s 
           beside her, playing with the bed’s remote. Kaycee’s on the 
           end of the bed, playing with the television remote.  

           Rankin and Inatomi enter the room.

                                 RANKIN
                        Agent Inatomi needs to ask you some 
                        follow-up questions. They won’t be 
                        good ones and they’ll probably be 
                        his last for the FBI so bear with 
                        him.

           Inatomi pulls up a chair and clicks on a RECORDER.

                                 INATOMI
                        Let’s start at the beginning. Who 
                        was Lou? 

                                 HANNAH
                        She was my landlord. 

                                 INATOMI
                        Did you know anything else about 
                        her?

           Beat.

                                 HANNAH
                        She  was a good landlord.

                                 INATOMI
                        More specifically, is there 
                        anything that can explain the past 
                        few days?

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah. 
           Inatomi motions for her to keep talking. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        She’s Lou. 

           SUDDENLY -- the door BURSTS OPEN as Deacon enters, dodging 
           Berry’s reach.  

                                 DEACON
                        I came as soon as I heard. 
                             (turns to Rankin)
                        Where’s Bigfoot? 

                                 KAYCEE
                        For Christ’s sake Deacon!

                                 DEACON
                        I mean, I’m glad everyone’s okay. 
                             (beat, to Rankin)
                        Is he--

                                 RANKIN
                        He’s at the station. He’s fine.

           Rankin reaches into his pocket, retrieves Bigfoot’s keys and 
           throws them to Deacon.  

           INT. LOU’S BEDROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - WEEKS LATER

           Hannah balances on a cane, watching Kaycee and Vee playing in 
           the backyard from Lou’s bedroom window. Behind her, the 
           floorboards have been removed.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM (LOU’S HOUSE) - MINUTES LATER

           Hannah limps past the fire place. Something catches her eye. 
           She bends down, reaching into the ashes. She pulls out a 
           charred piece of a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. 

           ANGLE ON PHOTO-- 

           A YOUNG LOU looks into the camera, holding an infant. She is 
           neither happy or sad. She’s Lou.

           INT. KITCHEN (LOU’S HOUSE) - NIGHT

           The burnt picture is taped to the refrigerator. The BANK 
           ENVELOPES sit on the kitchen table. Stuffed with cash. Kaycee 
           sits beside them, shaking her head. 

                                 KAYCEE
                        Guess she wasn’t so bad after all. 
           Hannah nods, reaching for a plate of DEFROSTED VENISON. She 
           drops the raw meat onto a hot skillet. It SIZZLES.

                                 KAYCEE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were vegetarian? 

                                 HANNAH
                        It shouldn’t go to waste. It’s good 
                        meat.

           She flips the venison. And lets out a SHARP WHISTLE. A moment 
           later, Vee and JAX, MINUS HIS BACK LEG, run into the kitchen.

           Hannah plates the meat and sets it on the floor. She watches 
           Jax gobble it up, licking his bloody lips.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Hm.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
