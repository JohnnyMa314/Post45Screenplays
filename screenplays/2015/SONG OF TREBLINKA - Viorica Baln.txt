                                   FIRST MOVEMENT:  ARRIVAL

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - POLAND - 1942 - DAY 

           A TRAIN clatters past peasant farmers tilling the land. They 
           stop working, their curious eyes follow the train. They shift 
           their gaze skyward at thin curls of grey smoke -- the 
           apparent destination of the passing train.

           INT. BOXCAR - DAY

           From inside the train, through a small grated window, bucolic 
           countryside whips past. 

           We are watching through the eyes of ARTUR GOLD (35). He turns 
           his head to reveal cramped, anxious passengers packed tightly 
           inside a sweltering boxcar. Some dead, some alive, they stand 
           in mute despair, clinging tightly to bundles and suitcases - 
           their most valued possessions. Babies cry, mothers calm them. 
           A thirsty child licks sweat off his mother’s neck. An old 
           woman urinates on herself. 

           Artur and his brother HENRYK (30) clutch violin cases. 

           A sudden SCREECH of BRAKES, the train CLICKS to a halt. 
           Bewildered eyes dart back and forth.

           Artur peers out the window at the dense forest.

           The wagon DOOR is abruptly THROWN open. A UKRAINIAN GUARD 
           clad in a sinister black uniform trains his rifle at them. 

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD
                        Bring out the dead bodies! 

           Men pull out bodies, drop them on the ground along the track. 
           Passengers collapse on the floor, finally able to sit. 

           The guard tosses in a burlap sack. 

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Put your valuables in this sack. 
                        Money, jewelry, watches.

           They hesitate. He strikes a man with his rifle. 

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD  (CONT’D)
                        Do it now, vermin! 

           Terrified, they quickly follow orders. 
                                 ARTUR
                        Please, can we have some water?  

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD
                        You must pay. How much do you have?

           The guard pulls out a canteen. Artur searches his pockets. 

                                 ARTUR
                        A few zlotys. 

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD
                        Give me your watch. 

           Artur hands it over. Guard thrusts the canteen at him. Artur 
           takes a sip, hands it to Henryk. Guard snatches it back. 

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD (CONT’D)
                        He must pay. 

           Artur slides off his gold pinky ring, hands it over.

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD (CONT’D)
                        No more water. 

                                 ARTUR 
                        Excuse me, but where are we going? 

           DOOR is SLAMMED shut. A distinguished man in glasses, DR. 
           CHORAZYCKI (50) sits next to the brothers.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Those damned Ukrainians kill Jews 
                        with more fervor than the Nazis.

           A HEAVY-SET WOMAN eats bread with butter. A PRETTY MOTHER and 
           her LITTLE BOY gape hungrily at her. 

                                 LITTLE BOY 
                        I’m so hungry, mama. 

           Pretty mother reaches into her bag, pulls out a silk blouse. 

                                 PRETTY MOTHER
                        Excuse me, ma’am, I have this 
                        lovely silk blouse. Would you have 
                        any interest in making a trade? A 
                        bite of your bread for this blouse? 

                                 HEAVY-SET WOMAN
                        What on earth would I want with a 
                        silk blouse? 
                                 PRETTY MOTHER 
                        It’s a tailored blouse. You could 
                        sell it. Make some money perhaps? 

                                 HEAVY-SET WOMAN
                        I don’t want it.

                                 PRETTY MOTHER
                        Can my son please have a piece of 
                        your bread then?

                                 HEAVY-SET WOMAN
                        I don’t have enough. 

           She packs away her food. 

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Will I be back in time for the 
                        first day of school? 

                                 PRETTY MOTHER
                        Yes, of course. 

           Artur reaches into his satchel, pulls out a bread loaf 
           wrapped in newspaper. He hands it to Pretty Mother.  

                                 ARTUR
                        Here you go, miss. 

           She accepts the bread, unwraps the newspaper.  

                                 PRETTY MOTHER 
                        Thank you. We’re so hungry. We went 
                        to the umschlagplatz because the 
                        Germans promised bread and jam to 
                        anyone who volunteered to work in 
                        the east. We get there and they 
                        shove us into this boxcar. 

           Artur reads the discarded newspaper: JULY 23, 1942, GHETTO IN 
           WARSAW EMPTIED. JEWS TRANSPORTED TO WORK SITES IN EAST. 

           Dr. Chorazycki shakes his head at the article. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Newspapers report abductions and 
                        imprisonments, but they only talk 
                        about Poles, nothing about what’s 
                        being done to Jews. Work camps? 
                        Look around. There are babies, 
                        pregnant women, elderly. 

           An OLD WOMAN interjects, waving a letter in her hand. 
                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Don’t be a fool. You see here, this 
                        is a letter from my brother Antoni. 
                        In it he tells me that he’s working 
                        in a quarry in Ukraine. He says I 
                        can settle into the countryside and 
                        work the land with plenty of food 
                        and fresh air. See? 

           She shoves the letter in Dr. Chorazycki’s face. 

                                 OLD WOMAN(CONT’D)
                        That’s his writing. I tell you 
                        we’ll be fine. My brother would 
                        never lie to me. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        As my father would say, there are 
                        those who are hopeful and those who 
                        are blind. 

           A baby in a YOUNG MOTHER’S arms begins to wail. 

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Can’t you make that baby shut up? 
                        It’s giving me a headache. 

           Young mother rocks her crying baby, softly hums a tune. 

           A WEEPY FATHER and his TEEN DAUGHTER hold each other. 

                                 TEEN DAUGHTER
                        Papa, please don’t cry. 

           She wipes tears from her father’s face. 

                                 WEEPY FATHER
                        I know something horrible is going 
                        to happen. I feel it. 

           Dr. Chorazycki offers Artur a cigarette. Artur declines. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Take it, might be your last. My 
                        name is Julian Chorazycki. I’m a 
                        laryngologist from Lodz. I see you 
                        brothers are musicians.

                                 ARTUR
                        I’m Artur. This is Henryk. We play 
                        all over Poland, mostly in Warsaw.

                                 HENRYK
                        Hopefully we’ll go back home soon. 
           An ANGRY YOUNG MAN scoffs.

                                 ANGRY YOUNG MAN
                        What home? My home, my entire 
                        village was burned down. Those 
                        Germans and Soviets have carved up 
                        our country like a flank of beef.

           A distraught MAX BERLINER weeps alone in the corner. Dr. 
           Chorazycki offers him a cigarette. 

                                 MAX BERLINER
                             (heavy accent)
                        Thank you. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Where are you from? 

                                 MAX BERLINER
                        I’m from Argentina. 

                                 CHORAZYCKI
                        Why in God’s name are you here?

                                 MAX BERLINER
                        My wife and I were visiting Warsaw 
                        with our daughter. It was her bat 
                        mitzvah gift. Then the invasion 
                        happened. Those goddamned Polish 
                        authorities wouldn’t let us leave. 
                        One day I step out for cigarettes, 
                        when I return, they’re gone. The 
                        landlady told me they’d been taken 
                        away only minutes before. 

           He breaks down sobbing. 

                                 MAX BERLINER (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, what crime have our 
                        children, our wives and mothers 
                        committed?

           Artur gazes out the window, spots a sign:  TREBLINKA 20 KM.  

                                 ARTUR
                        We’re near Treblinka. 

                                 HENRYK
                        We’ve never played there have we?

                                 ARTUR
                        No. It’s a small hamlet on the Bug 
                        river. It’s the middle of nowhere.  
           Baby wails again. From above a heavy BOOT STOMPS the roof. 

                                 UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Quiet in there!

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Shut that baby up, you’re going to 
                        get us killed!

           Little boy points out the window. 

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Look, mama, we’re in the forest!

           Little boy tries to peek out the window, but can’t reach. 
           Artur hoists him up, Little boy reaches his arm out touches a 
           leaf on a tree, he squeals in delight. His mother smiles. 

                                 PRETTY MOTHER
                        He’s excited because there weren’t 
                        any trees in the ghetto. 

           INT. BOXCAR - NIGHT 

           The train continues its standstill. Passengers sleep. Young 
           Mother SINGS a HEBREW LULLABY to her baby. Henryk shivers in 
           the cold. Artur pulls a brown woolen blazer over Henryk. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Put your coat on, you’re shivering. 

           Suddenly, from the grated rooftop, white powder is sprinkled 
           into the wagon. Terrified passengers shriek, claw at the 
           walls and rub their burning eyes. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Chlorine. It disinfects the wagon. 
                        The Germans disinfect everything. 
                        They’re obsessed with it.

           INT. BOXCAR - SUNRISE

           Train lurches forward, WHISTLE BLOWS. It continues its 
           journey, snaking thru forest toward the feathery, grey smoke. 

           Artur awakens, rubs his eyes, smearing blood all over his 
           face. Baffled, he looks down, spots a trail of blood that 
           leads to Weepy Father and Daughter who have slashed their 
           wrists during the night. 
           INT. BOXCAR - LATER - DAY 

           The train slows down. Collective SIGHS fill the boxcar as 
           passengers become hopeful that the agonizing journey is over. 

           Passengers grimace, cover their noses at a stench.   

                                 ARTUR 
                        Dear god, that smell!  

           Young mother’s baby wails. She pulls out a small brown 
           bottle, pours a clear liquid on a handkerchief. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 YOUNG MOTHER
                        Chloroform. Puts him to sleep. 

           Artur peeks out the window, his eyes widen at the horror 
           below -- corpses lay scattered everywhere. The grey smoke is 
           right above their heads now. 

                                 HENRYK 
                        What do you see? What is it?

           Fear overcomes them as harsh GERMAN VOICES shout commands OS.

           TRAIN SCREECHES to a halt. Boxcar doors FLY OPEN then -- 

           CHAOS.

           They’re greeted by a terrifying view -- dead bodies in bloody 
           cesspools, masses of clothing, personal items, and suitcases 
           lay abandoned. Gaunt workers mill about. German and Ukrainian 
           guards bark orders and brandish rifles. 

                                 HENRYK (CONT’D)
                        Brother, we are lost.  

                                 GERMAN/UKRAINIAN GUARDS
                        Raus! Off the train! Schnell!

           Under a hail of beatings, families are torn apart, sobbing 
           children are ripped from mothers’ arms. They’re kicked, 
           beaten, shoved to the ground, mauled by German Shepherds.

           Guards on roofs take indiscriminate POT SHOTS into the crowd.

           Artur stumbles out gripping his violin. They’re inside a camp 
           in the middle of a dense forest.  

           Henryk reaches into his satchel. 
                                 ARTUR
                        What are you doing? 

                                 HENRYK
                        I want a piece of bread. I’m so 
                        hungry.

                                 ARTUR
                        There’s no time for that now!

           Henryk drops his satchel, follows Artur. Blows from whips and 
           truncheons rain down on them from all sides. Hundreds of 
           passengers are dragged off boxcars. 

           Artur gazes back along the train tracks -- rotting corpses 
           lie all along the track, 50 cars long.  

           Dr. Chorazycki falls in with workers. He grabs a wheelbarrow, 
           begins to pick up fallen items -- he blends in unnoticed.

           Lording over the chaos with a sadistic grin, whipping victims 
           is COMMANDANT IRMFRIED EBERL (32). 

           IVAN MARCHENKO (31) corrals screaming women with a saber. 

                                 IVAN MARCHENKO
                             (laughing)
                        Just because we’re going to kill 
                        you is no reason to cry! 

           Guards usher terrified passengers toward a smoldering, fiery 
           ditch -- the source of the grey smoke we saw from the train.

           Holding her chloroformed baby, Young Mother runs past. Her 
           baby suddenly starts crying. A guard snatches the bundle, 
           SLAMS it against the wall -- the baby falls silent. Guard 
           hands her back the limp bundle and shoves her away.

                                 SS GUARD
                        Get over there whore!

           A passenger hops off the wagon, dashes off into the forest, 
           escaping unnoticed amidst the chaos.

           Artur stops a haggard worker. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Please tell me, where are we? 

           Fearful, the worker runs away in silence. 

                                 SS GUARD 
                        Leave belongings on the ground, 
                        make your way to the ditches! 
           Artur and Henryk follow the others toward a deep, smoldering 
           pit, his eyes follow the thin grey smoke rising high above. 

           Eberl stops Artur and Henryk. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        Can you work? We need builders!

           Eberl spots the violins, slaps them to the ground, aims a 
           kick at Artur toward the smoldering pit.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        We need workers not musicians!

           A haggard WORKER trundles a wheelbarrow full of shoes. An SS 
           kicks the wheelbarrow, it falls, spilling its contents.  

                                 SS GUARD
                        Pick it up! 

           Haggard worker collects the fallen shoes, re-fills the 
           wheelbarrow. The same guard topples the wheelbarrow, spilling 
           its contents again. 

                                 UKRAINIAN GUARD
                             (laughing)
                        Pick it up you swine! 

           Along with other victims, Artur and Henryk reach the ditch.

                                 GERMAN GUARDS
                        Undress!

           With rifles pointed at them, they quickly undress. Artur 
           helps Henryk out of his brown woolen blazer. 

           Naked victims are marched to the ditch with hands raised. 
           Along the way, guards stand with arms linked in a human chain 
           so that no one escapes their whips. 

           Women are dragged by the hair, babies are yanked from 
           mothers’ arms, tossed into the fire. Crippled people are 
           shoved in. A Hasidim’s sidelocks are ripped off his face.

           Prisoners are positioned on one side of the ditch, a firing 
           squad faces them at the opposite end. Some fall to their 
           knees and beg for mercy, others, resigned to their fate, 
           stoically pray in Hebrew. 

           Guards lift their rifles, SHOOT the prisoners, their dead 
           bodies tumble into the ditch. 

           The next group of condemned are brought to the ditch. 
           Henryk leans on Artur as they await their fate in front of 
           the ditch. Guards lift their rifles to shoot. 

           Suddenly, Max Berliner lunges at an SS with a knife, killing 
           him. A guard grabs a shovel, pummels Berliner to death. 

           Livid, Eberl storms up with pistol in hand.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        On the ground!

           They drop. Eberl slowly steps over victims -- he counts and 
           SHOOTS, aiming at their heads.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        One...two...three... 
                             (BLAST!)

           He moves mechanically from person to person as he SHOOTS. He 
           reaches the brothers. Eyes squeezed shut, Artur braces. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        One...two...three

           BLAST! 

           Artur’s eyes fly open -- Henryk is dead, shot in the head, 
           his eyes open in a blank stare, blood streaming down his 
           face. Weeping, Artur reaches for his brother.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        Throw these bodies into the ditch! 

           Survivors scramble to their feet. Working in pairs, they lift  
           bodies, haul them to the pit and pitch them inside. 

           A barefoot worker runs up, takes Henryk’s shoes, slips them 
           on. Artur and another prisoner lift Henryk’s body. In tears, 
           Artur tosses his brother’s body, still warm, into the ditch. 

                                 GUARD 
                        Schnell! Hurry lazy bastards!

           Inside the ditch Artur finds mounds of corpses, some of whom 
           he recognizes from the train ride over. 

           A guard shoves Artur with his boot, he falls to the ground. 

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up! 

           Artur quickly hoists another body, tosses it into the 
           smoldering ditch. He does this over and over again. 
           EXT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Exhausted workers stands in line. From the kitchen window 
           Artur receives a paltry meal of watery soup and moldy bread. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAY 

           Artur and Dr. Chorazycki sit on the floor, eat meager lunches 
           alongside another worker with a rabbinical air, RABBI 
           GALEWSKI (50). TOMASZ (45) ladles coffee into tin cups. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Drink as much coffee as you can. 
                        There is not a drop of water in the 
                        barracks. Commandant Frankenstein 
                        tortures us with thirst.

                                 TOMASZ
                        I’m sorry I can’t give much.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Let’s be happy that they give us 
                        this. He that rejoices in his 
                        portion is a rich man. 

                                 CHORAZYCKI
                        Thank god, I’m dying of thirst. 

                                 ARTUR
                        You still believe in God, doctor? 

           Dr. Chorazycki shrugs with sad resignation. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        I believe that when you die, you 
                        must answer to God for your sins. 
                        After today I think he should 
                        answer to us for his. I’m sorry but 
                        that’s how I feel. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Don’t apologize, brother. Talmud 
                        teaches to hold no man responsible 
                        for what he says in grief.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        It also teaches that one who can 
                        protest an injustice but does not 
                        is an accomplice to the act. God is 
                        an accomplice. 
                                 ARTUR
                        I don’t believe in God. I don’t 
                        believe in the devil. I believe in 
                        human beings doing what’s right.

           A GUARD enters, knocks the food out of their hands. 

                                 GUARD
                        Back to work, Bolsheviks!

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY 

           Belongings of dead Jews lay scattered. Workers sort clothing, 
           jewelry, toys, furniture, etc., into piles. Artur gazes down 
           at the heartbreaking array of items at his work station.

           Guards SNAP their WHIPS at workers. 

           Photos, birth certificates, diplomas and all paper documents 
           are thrown into a fire inside a wooden barrel. 

           Tomasz works alongside Artur. He cuts Star of David patches 
           off of garments. 

           Artur stands, Ivan Marchenko beats him with a truncheon, 
           blood trickles down Artur’s face. 

                                 IVAN MARCHENKO
                        You’re not allowed to stand!

                                 TOMASZ 
                        Be especially careful of that one, 
                        we call him Ivan the Terrible. 
                        Always stay bent over. Inspect each 
                        garment as carefully as possible.  
                        Empty every pocket. Always carry a 
                        bundle larger than yourself. Follow 
                        these rules or he’ll kill you. 

           Blood trickles down Artur’s face. Tomasz throws him a towel. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        Clean your wound. If you can’t 
                        work, you don’t live. Remember, the 
                        Germans can’t sort these things 
                        without us. Sorting is the only 
                        thing keeping us alive. 

           Artur wipes blood off his face. Tomasz tosses him a cap. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        This is the most essential item. 
                        Take it off in front of any SS. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        Wear it at line-up. Most 
                        importantly, it will protect you 
                        during beatings.

           INT. SHOE HUT - DAY  

           Artur enters carrying a sack of shoes. He is stricken by a 
           staggering sight -- mounds, 4 storeys high of unpaired shoes. 
           He empties the sack of shoes, hurries out. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY  

           Artur fills a burlap sack with jewelry, watches, coins. He 
           walks over to two valises overflowing with valuables. One 
           filled with gold, the other with silver. He dumps the 
           contents of his sack and heads off. 

           EXT. LINEUP YARD -  DAY 

           Eberl marches down the line slowly, carefully inspecting 
           workers. He pulls out a sickly man barely standing. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        Run in place! 

           Eberl SNAPS his WHIP, the worker is unable to lift his legs. 
           Eberl shoots him in the neck. 

           EXT. FRONT GATE - DAY 

           Artur and Galewski load heavy bundles onto a truck.

                                 ARTUR 
                        Where is this truck headed?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Germany. These bundles are property 
                        of the Third Reich. And so are we.  

           Galewski indicates the strewn wares amidst rotting corpses. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        These people assumed they were 
                        being resettled to a new life so 
                        they brought their most treasured 
                        possessions. This place is filled 
                        with anything your heart desires. 
                        Instead, they ended up at a giant 
                        death factory. It’s not a labor 
                        camp, it’s a death camp. 
           Galewski points up at the sky. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        And the only way to escape is that 
                        way. 

           Artur’s gaze follows Galewski’s finger -- it lands on the 
           thin, curling smoke rising from the smoldering death pits. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           Workers prepare their bunks. Many sleep on the floor. Tiny, 
           homemade candles flicker throughout the large room. Huddled 
           in a corner, a group of Hasidim pray by candlelight. 

           Galewski sits on his bunk. Artur settles on the hard floor. 
           He slips off his shoes, uses them as a pillow. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Artur, your forehead is bleeding. 

           Dr. Chorazycki dresses Artur’s forehead. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Take care. Cuts, bruises, illnesses 
                        mean instant death. You’re lucky to 
                        have made it this far. We’ve been 
                        here a week so we’re veterans. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Every Jew in Poland has been handed 
                        a death sentence. Last night 
                        another man was occupying the spot 
                        Artur is sleeping on now. He was 
                        caught with a piece of sausage, so 
                        they tied him to a post. He had to 
                        stand in the sun until he died. 
                        They’ll kill you for any reason, 
                        real or not. Unless you can find an 
                        SS who favors you. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I say we plan an escape.

           Tomasz looks around, apprehensive. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Impossible. For every worker who 
                        even attempts to escape 
                        Frankenstein kills 50 of us. The 
                        only real chance for escape is a 
                        mass revolt. But be careful who you 
                        trust.

                        A stool pigeon will stab you in the

                        But where would we go?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        With our partisan brothers living 
                        in the forest. Or find a farmer 
                        who’ll hide you.

                        If you talk for too long, it looks 
                        like you’re planning something so 
                        they kill you on the spot. With 
                        only 300 guards and 1000 of us, an 
                        uprising is what they fear most. 

           THUNDER RUMBLES. Rain droplets land on Artur, he looks up, 
           there’s a hole in the roof. 

                                 ARTUR
                        The night weeps along with us. 

           Galewski spots a Ukrainian guard STREBEL (40) peering in 
           through a window beckoning him. Galewski climbs off his bunk. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        There’s Strebel, my contact.

           Through the window we see Galewski hand Strebel money in 
           exchange for a package. Galewski re-enters. From the package 
           he prepares a meal, cooking over a small burner made from a 
           tin can and a candle. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        If it weren’t for food from 
                        transports, we’d starve for sure. 
                        The food we get in here is better 
                        than what we had in the ghetto. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Be careful not to get caught. 
                        They’ll lash you to death for 
                        stealing a piece of candy. 

           Galewski hands each man a morsel.
                                 GALEWSKI
                        Be mindful that your food isn’t 
                        stolen. When you’re treated like a 
                        savage, you begin to act like one.

                                 ARTUR
                        It’s not enough to kill us. But 
                        they have to humiliate us. Look at 
                        these barracks. They’re not made to 
                        house people, but to destroy them. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Brothers, let’s invoke evening 
                        prayers. Every night we sing 
                        kaddish and end with El Male 
                        Racbamim for our fallen brothers. 

           Workers stand, Galewski intones the Hebrew blessing.

           EXT. PRISONER BARRACKS 

           Two guards stand outside the door. They lean in, listening to 
           GALEWSKI’S CHANTING as they share a bottle of vodka. 

           INT. LIVING BARRACKS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Galewski finishes kaddish. Guards outside POUND on the DOOR. 

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Lights out!

                                 GALEWSKI
                        We have to be up for 6 AM roll

                        Suffering is easier to handle in 
                        the dark. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - MIDNIGHT 

           A drunk Eberl, gripping a vodka bottle in one hand and a 
           luger in the other straggles inside.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        At attention! 

           He SHOOTS his PISTOL. Men snap to attention. He walks down 
           the line inspecting them. 
           He collars a worker, drags him to the toilet pail, stuffs his 
           head inside a urine-filled bucket, laughing. He SHOOTS the 
           worker in the head.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        Lights out!

           Eberl aims his pistol at a light bulb, he SHOOTS, misses, the 
           BULLET RICOCHETS. He keeps SHOOTING until the BULB SMASHES 
           into tiny pieces, plunging them into darkness. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - MIDNIGHT 

           Artur is awakened by a SCRAPING sound. A man DRAGS a STOOL, 
           places it under a beam, pitches a rope over the beam, slides 
           his head thru the noose. Artur stands, Galewski blocks him. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Don’t stop him. This is a nightly 
                        occurrence. Last night a father and 
                        son committed suicide together. The 
                        father hung himself first, then the 
                        son used the same strap to kill 
                        himself. Let him die with dignity. 

           The man KICKS the STOOL, chokes and gasps on the noose for a 
           few moments, then falls silent. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAWN

           POUNDING on the DOOR. 

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Aufstehen, wake up! 

           Artur and the others leap from their bunks. More dead bodies 
           dangle in the corner. 

           Workers primp themselves. Galewski shaves in a cracked 
           mirror. He reaches under his bunk, pulls out a bottle of eau 
           de cologne and washes his face. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Look as healthy as possible. Try to 
                        get your hands on shaving supplies.  

                                 ARTUR
                        What about bathing?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Not since I’ve been here. A hot 
                        shower sounds so nice.
           Galewski pinches his cheeks, giving them a ruddy glow. DOORS 
           fly OPEN. Workers march out under a rain of beatings.  

           EXT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Artur devours his bread and coffee. He looks up at the sky, 
           feels the sun’s warmth on his face. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Let’s go Artur, quickly. 

           Artur keeps his eyes closed, savoring the sun’s rays. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I don’t understand how the sun can 
                        shine so brightly on this hell.  

           EXT. ROLL CALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Workers stand at attention. Eberl inspects each one.

           He stops in front of a WORKER, using the grip of his whip, 
           Eberl lifts the man’s face to inspect, his eyes are swollen.

                                 WORKER
                        No, please! I can work! 

           Eberl SHOOTS him. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        The rest are released!

           Workers head to the sorting square. Galewski points out a 
           small, wooden shed to Artur.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        That’s our latrine. 

           Standing watch is a worker dressed in rabbinical vestments. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        It’s a good hiding place. Germans 
                        never use Jewish toilets. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY 

           Artur unzips a suitcase, sorts through it. He watches a train 
           arrive with fresh victims. Yesterday’s events are re-played 
           as terrified victims are dragged out, beaten, and marched to 
           the pyre. Ivan the Terrible draws his saber, slices into a 
           pregnant woman’s belly. She screeches. 
           He then drags a screaming woman into a storage closet, shuts 
           the door behind him. 

           A drunk UKRAINIAN GUARD staggers up. He snatches a bottle of 
           cognac, CRACKS it open and guzzles. He peers at Artur who 
           searches the pockets of a coat. The guard begins to WHIP him. 

                                 DRUNK GUARD
                        Lazy swine! Tear the linings to 
                        make sure nothing is hidden inside! 

           He beats Artur viciously. Artur retrieves the coat, CUTS the 
           lining, American dollars spill out. 

                                 DRUNK GUARD (CONT’D)
                        American dollars. This should 
                        complete my collection. 

           He looks around to see if any SS are watching. He snatches 
           the money, stuffs it into his wallet, staggers off. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Yesterday that guard asked me to 
                        find a nice dress for his wife. Can 
                        you believe it? He wants his wife 
                        walking around in the dress of a 
                        murdered Jewish woman. 

           Artur suddenly stops working, overcome, his eyes widen at 
           something he’s found in his pile -- his brother’s brown 
           woolen blazer. Artur brings the coat to his face, smells it. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        Artur, get back to work! You’re 
                        forgetting yourself!

           Artur defiantly ignores him, he examines the cherished coat 
           from every angle. With tears in his eyes, he slips it on. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        You’ll get killed! 

           Artur goes back to work with a smile. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Standing in front of mounds of potatoes, Artur peels 
           potatoes, then drops them into buckets.  

                                 GUARD
                        Quickly! This pile needs to be 
                        finished by lunch time today.
           Famished, Artur takes a bite. From behind a guard swiftly 
           belts him with his rifle, snatches the potato from him. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - LATER - DAY 

           Artur heads to his station, passes a tall mound of clothing. 

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Psst! 

           Artur stops walking. He squints into the pile, finds a 
           frightened man hiding inside, OSKAR (30). 

                                  OSKAR 
                        Please, brother, help me!

           Artur looks around. They speak in whispers.

                                 ARTUR
                        What is it?

                                  OSKAR 
                        I arrived today and I was headed to 
                        the pit with the others, but I hid 
                        in here. I found a pair of trousers 
                        and a jacket but I have no shoes. 
                        Can you find me a pair? 

                                 ARTUR
                        I can’t!

                                  OSKAR 
                        If not they’ll kill me. I can be a 
                        worker like the rest of you. 
                        Please, I beg you! 

           INT. SHOE HUT - MOMENTS LATER

           Among the tall mounds of shoes, Artur quickly grabs a pair, 
           stuffs them in a sack. 

           EXT. OSKAR’S PILE - MOMENTS LATER

           Artur hands Oskar the pair of shoes from his sack.

                                 ARTUR
                        Stay at this pile and sort. Work 
                        swiftly, stay bent over, don’t look 
                        anyone in the eye. 

           Artur slips away, Oskar begins to sort. 
           EXT. ARMORY HUT - DAY 

           Eberl and an SS officer get their boots shined by a mute shoe 
           shine boy BENYAMIN (10). 

           Benyamin vigorously shines Eberl’s boots as he converses with 
           the officer. Eberl looks down at Benyamin.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        We’re done here. 

           Benyamin doesn’t hear. Eberl kicks him away with his foot.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        I said we’re done, worthless mute!

           EXT. HUT - NIGHT 

           Artur and Galewski pass a hut with workers hunched over 
           pieces of paper, tears stream down their faces as they write. 

                                 ARTUR
                        What are they writing in there? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Letters to loved ones back home, 
                        telling them to come East, that all 
                        is well and there’s work. The 
                        Germans want to prevent uprisings 
                        in the ghettos so they force us 
                        here to write letters to quell the 
                        remaining populations.

           Artur pauses, recalls the old woman from the train with a 
           letter from her brother. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        There’s no ruse they won’t employ. 

           EXT. MAIN CAMP SQUARE - NIGHT

           Drunk, carousing Ukrainian guards SHOOT their GUNS into the 
           air. They stand at bonfires with local girls SINGING SONGS. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - MIDNIGHT

           Bone-weary workers sleep. At his spot on the floor, Artur 
           uses his brother’s woolen blazer as a pillow. 

           O.S. we hear a TRAIN SCREECH to a halt, wagon DOORS fly OPEN. 
                                 GUARDS (O.S.)
                        Raus! Schnell! Strip, clothes off! 

           Workers stir awake and listen.

           O.S. victims screaming, heavy BOOTS STOMPING, MACHINE GUNS 
           blasting fill the night air. 

                                 ARTUR
                        There’s a new transport. 

           Desperate BANGING on the barracks DOOR. Workers run to the 
           door, pull it open to reveal a terrified ZELOMIR (30). He 
           runs in, hides under a bunk in a dark corner.  

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Hide him, he’s escaped from the 
                        transport! Close the door!

           Screams and SHOOTING continue. Guards enter, grab workers.

                                 GUARDS
                        Workers! All workers out! 

           EXT. MAIN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           A massacre. More dead bodies and luggage lay scattered. 

                                 GUARDS
                        Clean this up!  

           Guards SNAP their WHIPS as workers pick up bodies.

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           Weary workers crawl into their bunks. Zelomir comes out of 
           his hiding place. Galewski hands him a blanket. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        You’re safe now. What’s your name? 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Zelomir Bloch. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Where was that transport from? 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Grodno. In Belarus. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        As far as that? 
                                 ZELOMIR
                        We traveled for days. We decided 
                        that if we felt we were going to be 
                        killed, we’d fight back. When we 
                        arrived and those murderers told us 
                        to strip, we knew what was in 
                        store. So we attacked them with 
                        knives and bottles we prepared 
                        during the journey.

                                  ARTUR 
                        Did you kill any Germans?

                                 ZELOMIR
                        No. Two guards were injured.

                                  OSKAR 
                        That’s too bad. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Did you find any survivors?

                                 ARTUR
                        You’re the only one. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        They killed every Jew in Grodno. 
                        This isn’t like the Spanish 
                        Inquisition when Jews were able to 
                        save themselves by accepting 
                        Catholicism! This is different.

                                 ARTUR
                        Fact is if Jesus were alive today, 
                        he’d be in here with us.

           EXT. GALLOWS - DAWN 

           Workers stand at attention. Three PRISONERS stand on 
           scaffolds with nooses around their necks. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL 
                        These workers were caught in a 
                        nearby village trying to escape. If 
                        you’re caught, the punishment will 
                        be swift. 

           He nods to the henchman. One of the condemned men shouts out. 

                                 CONDEMNED PRISONER 
                        Down with Hitler! Long live the 
                        Jewish people!
           The SCAFFOLD DROPS underneath, his body drops, his neck 
           SNAPS. Rain starts to fall.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        It seems mother nature is not on 
                        your side today. You’ll remain here 
                        until you’ve learned your lesson. 
                        Guards, choose 50 workers and 
                        execute them!

           He retreats to the office as the rain falls harder. 

           EXT. ROLL CALL YARD - DAY

           Rain pummels workers as they continue to stand. Some lay 
           dead, some are barely able to hold themselves up. 

           EXT. ROLL CALL YARD - DAY  

           Hours later. The rain has stopped, workers are soaking wet. 
           Eberl emerges from the office. 

           He steps down the line. He spots the wound on Artur’s head. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        What is that on your face? 

           He lifts his gun to Artur’s neck. Suddenly, a Nazi jeep 
           sweeps in through the main gate. Eberl releases Artur. 

           Eberl plods hastily to greet ODILO GLOBOCNIK (55) his SS 
           boss. Eberl salutes Globocnik with a CLICK of his HEELS. An 
           angry Globocnik alights the jeep. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL (CONT’D)
                        Heil Hitler, Obersturmfuhrer 
                        Globocnik. 

                                 GLOBOCNIK
                        Release these workers to their work 
                        details immediately. 

           INT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY 

           Eberl sits at his desk, a portrait of Hitler hangs 
           prominently on the wall behind him.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        How are you, sir? 

           In a foul mood, Globocnik dispenses with pleasantries. 
                                 GLOBOCNIK
                        I have strict directives from 
                        Berlin to relieve you of your 
                        duties here. Orders are to be put 
                        into effect immediately. 

           Eberl is stunned.

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        But, Herr Officer, with all 
                        respect, may I ask why? 

                                 GLOBOCNIK
                             (angered)
                        Your incompetence! This camp is a 
                        filthy disgrace to not only the 
                        Reich but to the fuhrer himself!

           Globocnik gazes out the window, surveys the mass of rotting 
           bodies and fallen wares. 

                                 GLOBOCNIK (CONT’D)
                        When you were assigned to this camp 
                        you assured me that you would 
                        surpass all other camps in numbers. 
                        But all I see is filth, bloated 
                        corpses, prisoners escaping. 

                                 COMMANDANT EBERL
                        I promise things will change. 

           Globocnik is impassive. 

                                 GLOBOCNIK
                        Treblinka is in a state of 
                        collapse. Reports indicate that 
                        inefficient methods of processing 
                        are being used. Why have these 
                        articles not been packed and 
                        shipped to Germany? When I stepped 
                        out of the vehicle I was knee-deep 
                        in jewelry and money.

           Globocnik reads from an official document. 

                                 GLOBOCNIK (CONT’D)
                        If you were not a fellow German, 
                        I’d have you arrested and brought 
                        before an SS court. Just outside 
                        the camp is a wagon full of 
                        decomposing corpses that need to be 
                        unloaded. You can’t handle the 
                        number of transports coming in now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GLOBOCNIK (CONT’D)
                        In the coming months thousands more 
                        will be arriving. It’s all here!

           Globocnik hands him the report. 

                                 GLOBOCNIK (CONT'D)
                        I’m transferring you to operational 
                        headquarters in the Chancellery. 
                        We’re replacing you with the 
                        commandant from Sobibor. 

                                 SECOND MOVEMENT:  REUNION

           EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY 

           We are low to the ground behind the wheel of a car as it 
           rolls down a dirt road. We pan up to find a Nazi staff car 
           heading towards Treblinka. Light, grey smoke rises up above. 

           EXT. DITCH - DAY 

           Artur and Dr. Chorazycki carry the body of a little boy on a 
           stretcher. Artur drops the corpse. 

           A GUARD whips Artur senseless. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        Pick up that trinket, lazy swine!

           They pick up the body, pitch it into the ditch.

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY

           A battered Artur climbs into a pile of furs. Dr. Chorazycki 
           hands him a vodka bottle. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Hide in here for now. Sip on this 
                        to ease the pain. 

           The Nazi staff car sweeps in through the front gate, comes to 
           a halt in front of the main office. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        That must be the new commandant. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        I hope he’s better than 
                        Frankenstein.
                                 ARTUR
                        Don’t hope too much. There’s a fine 
                        line between hoping and lying to 
                        yourself. 

           Wearing a crisp, white tunic, a towering FRANZ STANGL (35) 
           climbs out of the staff car. In polished jackboots, riding 
           crop in hand and a smile on his face, he is in stark contrast 
           to the dreary camp. A Saint Bernard follows at his heels. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        He looks like white death in that 
                        tunic.

                                 TOMASZ
                        What the hell is he smiling about? 

           Following Stangl is the strikingly handsome KURT FRANZ (28). 

                                  OSKAR 
                        Look at that one. He’s so pretty, 
                        he looks like a doll.

           Stangl and Franz enter the camp office, shut the door. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        God help us. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Sorry Rabbi, but I’m not so sure 
                        God is up there. 

                                  OSKAR 
                        God who? 

                                 TOMASZ
                        He delivered us from Egypt. I can’t 
                        help but wonder where he is now.  

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Amidst the glow of tiny candles, Artur lays on Galewski’s 
           bunk. Dr. Chorazycki makes a long incision in his back, Artur 
           grimaces in pain. Galewski hands him a bottle of vodka. 

           Dr. Chorazycki drains the blood from Artur’s back. Galewski, 
           Tomasz and Oskar watch the operation. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        No sign of infection. Good sign. 
                        Sleep on your stomach tonight. 

           Tomasz whispers to the others. 
                                 TOMASZ
                        If we do manage to escape, we all 
                        look like typical Jews. Some of us 
                        can’t even speak good Polish. I’m 
                        from Gdansk and I have a thick 
                        accent. Where will I go, who will 
                        take me in?

                                 ARTUR
                        Yesterday they killed 400, today it 
                        was 500. It goes on without end. 
                        We’re going to die in any case. We 
                        must do it at all costs. That’s why 
                        it must be a mass revolt. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        It seems impossible.

                                 ARTUR
                        What’s the alternative? The four of 
                        us should plan it. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Us?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Artur’s right. We’ll be the 
                        planning committee. As time goes 
                        on, we’ll let others in on it. 

           Strebel emerges, searches the room, spots Galewski. Galewski 
           walks out. Through the window we see Galewski hand Strebel a 
           watch in exchange for a small bundle. Galewski re-enters. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        That’s how we escape, brothers. 

                                 ARTUR
                        How?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        The only thing Ukrainians care 
                        about is money. They sell us food 
                        and things, then take the money and 
                        spend it at brothels. They have no 
                        allegiance. You see how poorly the 
                        Germans treat them. If we can buy 
                        sausage from them, we can buy 
                        weapons.

                        How do we get the money? 
                                 GALEWSKI
                        We’re surrounded by money. Tomorrow 
                        we’ll start collecting as much 
                        money and gold as we can while we 
                        sort. At the same time, I’ll make 
                        plans with Strebel. And now, I have 
                        a little surprise for you. Does 
                        anyone know what today is? 

           The men shrug. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Brothers, it’s Yom Kippur. I’ll 
                        take it you didn’t partake in the 
                        previous mitzvahs, but I think God 
                        will understand.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Oh, God, how I would love a 
                        delicious mikveh right now!

                                  OSKAR 
                        I take it we won’t be finding 
                        potato kugels or noodle puddings in 
                        that little bundle, will we rabbi? 

                                 ARTUR
                        Or cheese blintzes? 

           They laugh. Galewski unwraps the package to find a loaf of 
           bread, sausage, and eggs. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I have one last surprise for our 
                        little feast. 

           He pulls out a bottle of wine. The men gasp. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Bravo, rabbi! 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        That Strebel really came through.

           Galewski lights a candle. He intones a Hebrew blessing. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY

           Artur searches the pockets on a pair of slacks. He pulls out 
           a wallet, finds a stack of bills. He quietly pockets them. 

           At the arrivals area, new victims are dragged off a train.
           Artur comes across a photo album. Family portraits, boys at 
           bar mitzvahs, Hanukkah celebrations, wedding pictures smile 
           back at him. 

           A little GIRL off the train wanders into the sorting area 
           clutching a dry bread loaf. She finds a doll in Artur’s pile. 

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        May I have this doll? 

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes. 

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Thank you, sir.

           Little girl curtsies, floats from worker to worker smiling, 
           peering at bundles. Work comes to a halt as workers forget 
           themselves, watching the happy child. She picks up colorful 
           scarves, tosses them into the air, she laughs, twirls around.  

                                  OSKAR 
                        Get back to work, Artur. White 
                        Death is making his rounds today.

           Oskar points to Stangl in his white tunic, he leads Franz in 
           a survey of the camp, his dog close at his heels.

           Stangl points at sprawled corpses. He covers his mouth with a 
           handkerchief, steps over a corpse in a cesspool. 

           Stangl spots the Little Girl. He pats her kindly on the head, 
           takes her by the hand, ushers her away.

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - LATER - DAY

           Stangl and Franz watch screaming passengers as they’re 
           dragged off a train. Stangl shakes his head at the chaos. 

           EXT. FIERY DITCHES - DAY 

           With disapproval, Stangl observes as victims are SHOT and 
           thrown into the smoldering ditch. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY 

           Stangl and Franz inspect workers. At Artur’s station, an oil 
           painting in an ornate frame catches Stangl’s eye. He picks it 
           up, examines it, sets it down. Stangl whispers into Franz’s 
           ear, then heads off. 
           Franz plucks the oil painting from Artur’s pile, walks off. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Artur quietly crosses over to Galewski’s bunk. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Rabbi, I have something for you. 

           He pulls out the wad of bills he found in his sorting pile. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        Will this plan of ours really work? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        God only knows. But if we burn this 
                        place to the ground, it doesn’t 
                        matter to me if I live or die. 

           The heavy wooden DOOR is UNLOCKED from outside. An SS enters.

                                 SS GUARD
                        Bernard Galewski! You have orders 
                        to come with me immediately. 

           Galewski shoots an anxious glance at Artur, slips on his 
           shoes, follows the guard out.

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAWN

           O.S. a BUGLE BLOWS, jarring workers awake. They jump up, get 
           dressed. The doors fly open, Franz enters. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Aufstehen! Roll call in 5 minutes! 

           EXT. ROLL CALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Workers at attention. In shiny jackboots, a smile on his 
           face, Stangl emerges from his office in a stark white tunic. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Achtung! Herr Commandant Stangl!

           Artur gently kicks Oskar’s leg, whispers in his ear. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Why is he always smiling? 

                                  OSKAR 
                        He seems to enjoy his job. 
                                 ARTUR
                        He must be Satan.  

                                  OSKAR 
                        Who needs Satan? We have Hitler.

           Gripping a riding crop, his Saint Bernard at his heels, 
           Stangl slowly makes his way down rows of workers. Finishing 
           his silent appraisal, he stalks to the front. 

                                 STANGL
                        I am Hauptsturmführer Franz Stangl. 
                        I have been appointed as the new 
                        commandant of Treblinka. Consider 
                        yourselves fortunate. You have the 
                        honor and privilege to serve our 
                        fuhrer as sonderkommando. Your stay 
                        here at the camp will cost you 
                        nothing. All the valuables taken 
                        from here will be used for the 
                        benefit of Jews. 

                                 ARTUR

                                 STANGL
                        As of today, changes will be 
                        implemented. Discipline in the 
                        ranks is essential, violations will 
                        be resolved expeditiously. Deputy 
                        Commandant Obersturmfuhrer Franz 
                        will read the new code of 
                        regulations, effective immediately. 

           Franz reads from a sheet of paper. 

                                 FRANZ
                        A master list of workers will be 
                        drawn up. You’ll be counted three 
                        times daily at roll call. For every 
                        infraction, there’s a pre-
                        determined punishment as follows: 
                        failure to carry out commandant’s 
                        orders: fifty lashes; stealing: 
                        death by hanging, stealing of food: 
                        death by gunfire, possession of 
                        money, jewelry or gold: death by 
                        gunfire. Lastly, for each worker 
                        who escapes: death by gunfire for 
                        50 workers. You’ll be under the 
                        supervision of Bernard Galewski who 
                        has been appointed camp elder. He 
                        will relay all information from the 
                        commandant to workers.

                        The commandant does not, under any 
                        circumstances, deal with workers 
                        personally. All issues relating to 
                        work detail or living conditions 
                        will be relayed to officers through 
                        your camp elder. 

           He motions for Galewski to approach.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I would like to thank Commandant 
                        Stangl and Untersturmfuhrer Franz 
                        for the trust they have placed in 
                        me. I promise to obey all 
                        instructions faithfully, to ensure 
                        order among workers, and to 
                        adjudicate all disputes honestly 
                        and justly. Thank you. 

           Galewski returns to his spot, he shoots a quick furtive wink 
           and smile at the workers. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Dismissed!

           An SS blows a BUGLE, workers set off to work. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAY 

           Galewski sits at his bunk with Artur and the others.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        The commandant apparently took a 
                        liking to me because I speak 
                        perfect German. We’ve run into some 
                        luck brothers. White Death decided 
                        to change tactics. He says keeping 
                        workers alive will ensure that the 
                        work goes well. So now, we have to 
                        make a master list of workers.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Should we give our real names? 
                        We’re not encumbered with documents 
                        or records here, nobody knows who 
                        we are. We can choose any name.

                                  OSKAR 
                        I agree. I say we give fake names.

                        I’m in favor of using real names.

                        Why is that?

                                 ARTUR
                        If we perish in this camp, and if 
                        there is a roster with our real 
                        names, it may survive and someone 
                        might find out who we were.   

                                 GALEWSKI
                        He makes a point. For posterity.

                        Chances are slim this list won’t go 
                        in the fire with the rest of us.

                        Wierzbowa street. 

                                  OSKAR  
                        The most fashionable bar in Warsaw. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        My wife and I had your records. 

           A GUARD enters. 

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Stand if you are a barber!

           Dr. Chorazycki stands, Oskar follows suit. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                             (whispers)
                        Artur, stand. 

           INT. BARBER HUT - DAY 

           Wearing white smocks, ‘barbers’ stand behind empty suitcases. 
           A group of FEMALE PRISONERS standby nervously.

                                 GUARD
                        Commandant has ordered that all 
                        female prisoners must have their 
                        hair cut. You are to spend a 
                        maximum of 2 minutes with each one.  

           GUARD grabs a FEMALE PRISONER, in five quick strokes with a 
           pair of shears, the guard snips all of the woman’s hair. 
                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        By the end of the work day, your 
                        suitcase must be full. 

           He hands each barber a set of shears.

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        If any one of you does not return 
                        the shears, you will each be shot. 

           Panicked weeping is heard as terrified WOMEN enter. 

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Get to work!

           Women stand in front of the ‘barbers’. Artur slowly cuts the 
           thick locks of a young girl. A guard WHIPS him. 

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        You’re too slow! Faster!

           Artur clutches the girl’s hair, in five SNIPS, he cuts it all 
           off, it cascades into the suitcase. Artur looks down at her, 
           taps her gently on the shoulder. 

                                 ARTUR
                        You may go now, miss. 

           She is shoved away. The next terrified WOMAN walks up. With 
           tears in his eyes, Artur cuts her hair. The woman grabs his 
           hand, kisses it, turns to look at him. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Please sir, I beg you, what do they 
                        do to us? Is this it?

           After a moment, he nods. She weeps in despair.

                                 ARTUR
                        The same fate awaits me, too. After 
                        all, I’m a Jew just like you. 

           She convulses in terror. The guard storms up, WHIPS her. 

           A defiant, ANGRY WOMAN runs in, glares at the weeping women. 

                                 ANGRY WOMAN
                        What’s the matter with you? Why do 
                        you cry? You should be laughing! 
                        Let our enemies see that we’re not 
                        going to our deaths in fear!

           Everyone freezes in terror. A guard grabs her, drags her out. 
           After a moment, we hear a GUN SHOT O.S.
                                 GUARD
                        Why don’t we sing a song to make 
                        the day go by faster? What shall we 
                        sing? Something nice. How about 
                        “Fester Schritt”? 

           He WHIPS a worker. 

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Let me hear you sing!

           In tears, workers sing as they cut the hair of weeping women. 

           EXT. LINE-UP YARD - NIGHT 

           Workers stand in rows. Galewski counts heads. A worker is 
           barely able to stand, Galewski straightens him. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                             (whisper)
                        Stand up or they’ll kill you. 

           Galewski checks off his list, hands it to Franz. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        All here and accounted for 
                        Unstersturmfuhrer Franz! 

                                 FRANZ
                        I want them to run in place. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Yes, sir. 
                             (faces workers)
                        Run!

           Workers run in place. A man collapses. Franz turns to an SS. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Shoot him. 
                             (at Galewski)
                        You may release your men now. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - GALEWSKI’S BUNK - NIGHT 

           Artur and the others are deep in conversation as Dr. 
           Chorazycki gives Tomasz a shave.

                                 ARTUR
                        But what could they possibly be 
                        using the hair for?
                                 GALEWSKI
                        Insulation for U-boats. Textiles, 
                        things like that. Hair repels 
                        moisture. These monsters think of 
                        everything. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        They process us like animal 
                        carcasses. 

                                  OSKAR 
                        If they found a way to make soap, 
                        I’m sure they’d do that too. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Everything we have has value. Only 
                        we Jews are regarded as worthless. 

           Franz appears at the doorway. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Achtung! Herr commandant!

           Workers jump to attention. 

           The perpetual smile on his face, Stangl steps inside. He 
           steps past slowly, scrutinizing workers. 

           After the inspection, Stangl FLICKS off the LIGHT, exits. 

                                  ARTUR 
                        My, if the White Death isn’t a 
                        kinder, gentler Nazi.

           EXT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY 

           A trainload of new victims. Their screams fill the air. Artur 
           walks past, lugging a heavy burlap sack. 

           A tearful Hasidim, LIEBESKIND (40) taps Artur on the 
           shoulder. He carries the body of a boy wrapped in a tallit.

                                 LIEBESKIND
                        Sir, you are a worker here, yes? 

           Artur nods quickly, tries to walk away.

                                 LIEBESKIND (CONT’D)
                        Please, I beg you. Can you help me? 

                                 ARTUR
                        If they catch us they’ll kill us.
           Artur turns to leave.

                                 LIEBESKIND
                        Wait, please. My son here, Meshek, 
                        died this morning on the train. 

           Liebeskind removes the tallit, reveals the boy’s face. 

                                 LIEBESKIND (CONT’D)
                        His body is still warm. All I ask 
                        is that I spend this last night 
                        with my son. Just tonight. 

                                 ARTUR
                        There’s nothing I can do. 

                                 LIEBESKIND
                             (begging)
                        I’m a locksmith. I don’t have much, 
                        but I can give you some money.

           Liebeskind reaches into this pocket, Artur stops him. 

                                 LIEBESKIND (CONT’D)
                        I have no illusions about why I’m 
                        here. But if I could spend tonight 
                        watching over the body of my son, 
                        in shemira as the Talmud teaches, I 
                        would be eternally grateful.  

           Artur looks around.

           EXT. LATRINE - MOMENTS LATER

           Artur opens the latrine door, nudges Liebeskind inside. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Wait here until I get you tonight. 

                                 LIEBESKIND
                        Won’t the guards find me?

                                 LATRINE ATTENDANT
                        Germans never use Jewish toilets. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY

           Artur’s work area. Artur sorts through a large pile. 
           Suddenly, he freezes, his eyes widen in amazement at 
           something he’s found. He picks it up -- 

           -- it’s his violin. 
           Transfixed, Artur runs his fingers along the case. He 
           UNLATCHES it, plucks the stick, lifts the violin to his chin. 

           He closes his eyes and begins to PLAY. His MUSIC fills the 
           air. Wide-eyed workers stare at Artur in disbelief. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Artur stop! They’ll kill you!

           Eyes closed, Artur ignores him, defiantly continues PLAYING -- 
           he’s in another world, no longer inside a death camp.  

           EXT. SHOE SHINE STATION

           Benyamin shines Stangl’s boots. Stangl’s ears perk up at the 
           sound of ARTUR’S VIOLIN. He pats Benyamin on the shoulder, 
           hands him a chocolate bar.

                                 STANGL
                        We’re finished here.

           Stangl follows ARTUR’S MUSIC.

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE

           Stangl finds Artur engrossed in his MUSIC, he plays 
           skillfully. 

           Franz storms up to Artur, unholsters his pistol.  

                                 FRANZ
                        Stop that immediately! 

           With Franz’s gun pressed to his temple, eyes closed, a 
           defiant Artur ignores the command, continues playing. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Stop that!

           Stangl appears, TAPPING his riding CROP on polished boots. 

                                 STANGL
                        Officer Franz, lower your pistol. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Sir, this Jew is insubordinate. 

                                 STANGL
                        Take the violin to my office.

           Franz snatches the violin from Artur’s grip.
           With an inscrutable stare, Stangl considers Artur for a long 
           time. Without a word, he turns and leaves.

           Franz throws the violin in the CASE. He pulls out a knife. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Something for your musical ear. 

           Franz slashes Artur’s ear, Artur collapses gripping his ear. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           Workers eat their meager evening meal at their bunks. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I came home from teaching a bat 
                        mitzvah. I stopped off at a bakery, 
                        the one on Bugaj street, and picked 
                        up a warm challah loaf.

                                  OSKAR 
                        Yes, they make the best blintzes.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        My wife made a pot of rum tea and 
                        we sat by the fire. We sipped our 
                        tea, ate the challah and listened 
                        to the radio. We might have 
                        listened to one of your songs, 
                        Artur. It was a nice, quiet evening 
                        with my lovely wife. And you, 
                        doctor, how about your last Sunday? 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        I worked a late shift at the 
                        Damiana Medical Center. Not too 
                        eventful. Sunday nights are usually 
                        slow. I had a late dinner, then 
                        went to sleep in my office. I kept 
                        a small cot for late shifts. I wake 
                        up Monday morning, I hear a roaring 
                        of tanks, people cheering and 
                        marching. It was pandemonium, 
                        terrifying sounds were coming from 
                        the mouths of my fellow Poles. I 
                        look out my office window and there 
                        it was. Nazis in Warsaw! At that 
                        moment the thought in my head was 
                        ‘this is it, this is the end.’  

           He turns to Tomasz who smokes a pipe.
                                 TOMASZ
                        I’d spent a lazy weekend in my 
                        country home with my wife. We were 
                        celebrating a large commission for 
                        a mural I’d received from a 
                        university in the south. Our 
                        spirits were high. Of course I’d 
                        heard all about the German 
                        atrocities, Kristallnacht, the 
                        laws, but we didn’t pay it any 
                        mind. So, we woke up at dawn, had a 
                        quick bite and set off on our road 
                        trip back home. Those were our last 
                        moments of normalcy. Getting into 
                        my car, kissing my wife, stopping 
                        for petrol. I remember my wife 
                        laughing at me because I just 
                        washed the car that weekend and a 
                        bird shit all over the windshield! 
                        Now that I think of it, that was 
                        the last time I heard her laugh. 
                        About noon, just before we stopped 
                        for lunch, we saw them. German 
                        tanks, armored vehicles. It was one 
                        of the few times I was truly 
                        terrified. And you, Mr. Gold, our 
                        celebrated conductor? What was your 
                        last Sunday like?

                                 ARTUR
                        Sundays I usually played the Adria 
                        Club, but we cancelled because our 
                        percussionist was sick. So it was a 
                        rare Sunday that I was able to get 
                        some rest. I enjoyed a quiet dinner 
                        at my favorite restaurant, a small 
                        place, no sign, but they served the 
                        best golabki. Afterwards I visited 
                        a woman I’d been seeing. Before 
                        dawn the next morning, I woke up in 
                        her bed. She was still asleep. As I 
                        lay there looking at her I was 
                        overcome with this feeling that 
                        something wasn’t right. I wasn’t 
                        happy with her. So I got up, put on 
                        my clothes, wrote her a short note, 
                        explaining that we couldn’t see 
                        each other again. I left it next to 
                        her bed, under a glass of water. I 
                        quietly opened her door, began my 
                        walk home in the morning light. 
                        Nothing new for me, I’ve left women 
                        before. There was only one woman in 
                        my life who ever left me.

                        Anyway, when I turned the corner of 
                        Alexi Street, I saw the tanks, the 
                        marching Nazis, the boots. And now 
                        I wonder if maybe that’s what I’d 
                        been feeling in that woman’s bed. 
                        Maybe it wasn’t her after all, 
                        maybe I sensed what was to come. 

           An SS emerges from outside. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        Conductor, out!

           Workers look at one another in confusion. 

                                 SS GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Quickly! Conductor! Come with me!

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Artur, I think he means you. 

           INT. STANGL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Artur waits at the door. The portrait of Hitler hangs above. 
           A speckled Jewish accountant counts piles of cash on an 
           adding machine. Stangl and Franz confer over blueprints.

                                 STANGL
                        ...lastly erect a wall here to 
                        obscure this area...

           Franz takes notes. Stangl steps in front of a mirror. A 
           TAILOR pins the hem of his slacks.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s continue our letter.

           Franz takes Stangl’s dictation. Stangl does not acknowledge 
           Artur standing at the door. 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                             (to Franz)
                        Furthermore, I plan to remedy the 
                        appalling circumstances that 
                        greeted me when I arrived. My 
                        intention is to streamline the 
                        process and make it as efficient as 
                        possible. It must run in the 
                        greatest possible calm in order to 
                        prevent upheaval. I will write soon 
                        with further details. Regards. 

           Tailor finishes pinning the slacks. Stangl examines them.  
                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        No, half an inch longer. That’s 
                        much too short. 

                                 TAILOR
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        You’re relieved. 

           Tailor exits. 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Franz, find me a new tailor. You’re 
                        excused. 

           Stangl pours himself a cognac, finally shifts his focus to 
           Artur. He regards Artur with an inscrutable stare, and then -- 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        You play Vivaldi very well. 

           Artur is stunned. Did he hear correctly?

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Your rendition of his Concerto in G 
                        this morning was impressive. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Thank you, Herr Commandant. 

                                 STANGL
                        It’s a beautiful piece. One of my 
                        favorites actually. Nietzsche once 
                        wrote that life without music would 
                        be a mistake. I’m inclined to 
                        agree. Vivaldi is a favorite of 
                        mine. One of the few things the 
                        Italians have done right. Of course 
                        their literature is also great. 
                        Machiavelli. Dante’s Inferno. But 
                        their music is something else. 
                        Paganini. His Caprice 24 is 
                        exquisite. Would you agree?

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        They called Paganini ‘devil’s son’ 
                        and ‘witch’s brat’.

                                 ARTUR
                        I believe I’ve heard that, sir.
                                 STANGL
                        His audiences, even his admirers 
                        believed he made a pact with the 
                        devil. It’s the only way they could 
                        justify his virtuosity, to be able 
                        to play with such technical 
                        brilliance. People refused to 
                        believe it wasn’t supernatural. 

           Artur nods. 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        I’m also very fond of your own 
                        countryman, Frederyk Chopin. You 
                        must enjoy him. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I do, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        In light of your performance today 
                        I’m assigning you to a new work 
                        detail. You’re to play for my 
                        officers nightly at evening meal. A 
                        divertissement after a hard day’s 
                        work. Am I clear? 

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        Inside that wardrobe you’ll find 
                        the violin. 

           Artur opens the wardrobe, grabs his violin.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Begin tonight. You’re dismissed.

                                 ARTUR
                        Thank you, sir.

           Stangl ignores him, returns to the blueprints. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT 

           A lively meal. Wearing his brother’s blazer and muddy shoes, 
           Artur plays Paganini’s LA CAMPANELLa. The hall is full of 
           rowdy SS eating, guzzling alcohol. They throw food and mock 
           Artur as he plays. Stangl and his officers sit at one end of 
           a long table hovering over blueprints. 
           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - SAME TIME

           Liebeskind sits on the floor tucked in a corner softly 
           singing “Kel Maleh R]achamim” to his dead son. His rueful 
           chanting fills the barracks as workers sleep. 

           EXT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT 

           Artur emerges from the dining hall. On his way back to 
           barracks, he passes a large DIGGER BREAKING fresh ground.

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - MORNING  

           Workers plod to work stations amidst construction and 
           renovation. Foundations poured, fences and watchtowers built, 
           new huts and barracks erected. 

           Some workers carry metal canisters attached to hoses. They 
           spray buildings with disinfectant. 

           Galewski hands Artur pieces of string. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Your work detail today is to hand 
                        these out to arrivals. Have them 
                        tie their shoes together. 

           The sound of clanking METAL TREADS interrupt them -- two 
           behemoth Russian T34 tanks enter camp. Stangl supervises the 
           arrival of the tanks with a smile. 

                                 ARTUR
                        What the hell are the tanks for?  

           Galewski hands off a large stroller to Oskar. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Oskar, here’s your new work detail.

                                 OSKAR 
                        Am I camp wet nurse now? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Collect all the rubbish and burn 
                        it. The commandant is strict about 
                        keeping the yard clean.

           EXT. ARRIVAL PLATFORM - DAY 

           Amidst the chaos of newly arrived victims on a transport, 
           Artur hands out string and tells people to tie their shoes.
           Someone suddenly catches Artur’s eye -- he fixates on a tall 
           man jumping off the train, SAMUEL WILLENBERG (35). Artur 
           pushes through the crowd, wends his way to Samuel. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Samuel!

                                 SAMUEL
                        Artur Gold?

           Samuel regards Artur with mistrust -- they have history. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Samuel, tell them you’re a builder. 

           Samuel narrows his eyes at him. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. The past doesn’t 
                        matter. Tell them you’re a builder! 

                                 SAMUEL
                        But I’m a tailor, you know that. 
                        Why should I trust you?  

                                 ARTUR
                        Your choice. You can either trust 
                        me or that Nazi with the rifle. 

           Artur plods off, Samuel gazes over at an SS. 

           EXT. MAIN SQUARE - DAY 

           Artur pushes a wheelbarrow full of shoes. In the distance, 
           his glance catches Samuel laying bricks on a new building. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Artur and Samuel are huddled on the floor in the dim light of 
           tiny flickering candles. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I made a bet with Jozef Stein. 
                        Remember him? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        The jeweler.
                                 ARTUR
                        When the British began bombing 
                        German cities in the fall of 1940, 
                        I wagered that this war would be 
                        over in six months. I couldn’t have 
                        been more wrong. Last I heard he 
                        boarded a train. He thought he was 
                        going to the east for a job, 
                        perhaps Russia. He was hopeful, 
                        happy to finally be out of that 
                        godforsaken ghetto. Now I know what 
                        happened to him. 

           Artur shakes his head.

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        We made a deal that the winner 
                        would buy the other a beer at Bar 
                        Mleczny. Remember that place? That 
                        was so long ago. When I still cared 
                        about trifles like bets and having 
                        a beer with friends. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        My entire family, 12,000 Jews from 
                        my hometown, all gone. I don’t 
                        understand why I survived. What 
                        universal power granted me the 
                        fortune to be here talking to you? 
                        I can think of 100 people who 
                        deserve to be here more than me. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I thought my father dying when I 
                        was young was the worst thing that 
                        could happen. I’m happy he didn’t 
                        live to see this. 

           Artur turns somber.

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember my brother? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Henryk?

                                 ARTUR
                        Henryk. That’s the first time I’ve 
                        said his name since he died. You 
                        remember him don’t you? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Of course. I actually liked him 
                        more than I ever liked you. 
           Artur chuckles. 

                                 ARTUR
                        We arrived together. They were 
                        beating us and screaming at us. A 
                        few moments before his death, he 
                        tried to get a bite of bread, but I 
                        stopped him. All he wanted was a 
                        little food to eat.

           Tears stream down Artur’s face. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        I sent him to his death hungry.

           Artur breaks down. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        I never said goodbye to him. 
                        Everyday I pray that he’s forgiven 
                        me. When I threw his body into the 
                        pit, it was still warm.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Wherever he is, I’m sure he holds 
                        no grudges.

                                 ARTUR
                        All I have left of him is his coat. 

           Artur runs his fingers along the sleeve of his woolen blazer. 
           He sniffs the collar. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        It still smells like him.

           Artur wipes his tears on his blazer, composes himself. 

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        And your shop on Wilcza Street? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        I did well, for a tailor anyway. 
                        Until they threw us in the ghetto.  
                        Steady stream of customers. I 
                        couldn’t complain. And you? You 
                        became quite a success. I heard 
                        your music often on the radio. You 
                        lived the life, Artur. 

           Artur shrugs it off. They share an uneasy silence, and then -- 

                                 ARTUR
                        So. What about her? 
           Samuel chuckles.

                                 SAMUEL
                        I’m surprised you waited so long to 
                        ask. What do you want to know? I 
                        hope you’re no longer angry at me.

                                 ARTUR
                        She wanted children, stability. But 
                        I was touring for weeks on end. 
                        That’s no life for a family. I 
                        can’t blame her for leaving. I was 
                        a lousy husband. I see now she 
                        chose the better man. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Look, I want to show you something. 
                        It was the only thing I saved 
                        besides the clothes on my back.

           Samuel reaches into his boot, pulls out a photograph. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        This was taken on a Sunday. Do you 
                        see her smile? That was the day we 
                        found out she was pregnant. I’d 
                        never seen her so happy. That was 
                        Sunday, August 31, 1939. The next 
                        day, the Germans entered Poland.

           Artur gazes wistfully at the photo in his hand. 

                                 ARTUR
                        When we met I was studying music in 
                        England with my Uncle Jerzy. One 
                        day I was walking by the library 
                        and there she was, waiting on the 
                        steps for a friend. She was wearing 
                        a lilac skirt, her long hair was 
                        pulled back. Shortly after, we 
                        spent a week in a small, rented 
                        cottage in Cornwall. It had a small 
                        fireplace. She loved fireplaces. It 
                        was miserable, rainy weather the 
                        entire time. It was the most 
                        glorious week of my life. Two 
                        months later we were married. 

           INT. OFFICER MESS HALL - NIGHT 

           Clad in his usual rags and his brother’s woolen blazer, Artur 
           finishes a SONATA on his violin. Boisterous SS eat and drink. 
           His dog at his heels, Stangl is in discussion with other 
           officers. He glances up at Artur.

                                 STANGL 
                        That was a lovely piece, maestro. I 
                        didn’t recognize it. Who was it by? 

                                 ARTUR
                        It’s a sonata I wrote, sir. 

           Stangl nods in approval.

                                 STANGL
                        Have a seat, eat some food.

           SS glower at Artur. He sits alone, a server sets a platter of 
           food in front of him, after weeks of thin soup and moldy 
           bread, it’s a feast. Artur takes a bite, he savors it. An SS 
           spits on Artur’s plate. Artur wipes it off, continues to eat.  

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - SAME TIME 

           Workers are huddled at Galewski’s bunk deep in conversation. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        My lovely wife Sora laid out the 
                        best Shabbat table. Friends would 
                        drop in unannounced! So many 
                        people, we had nowhere to sit. She 
                        was such a gentle soul. She never 
                        turned anyone away.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        That sounds lovely. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        And her potato kugels, my goodness. 
                        Perfectly crisped at the top. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        My grandmother made the most mouth-
                        watering paprika chamins! 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Stop it, brother, you’re torturing 
                        me worse than these Germans with 
                        their ‘thousand year itch’. 

           They laugh. 
                                 ZELOMIR
                             (scoffs)
                        Thousand-year Reich. Not even the 
                        Roman Empire lasted that long! 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Don’t be bitter. Hold onto your 
                        hope. Talmud teaches that customs 
                        are more powerful than laws. 

           Galewski stands.

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of customs, why don’t we 
                        say our Shabbat prayers? 

           He lights two candles. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        As you know, the mitzvah of 
                        lighting the candle is supposed to 
                        happen eighteen minutes after 
                        sundown, but God will pardon us. 

           He waves his hand over the candles. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Let us welcome the sabbath. 

           Galewski covers his eyes, intones the Hebrew prayer. 

           An incensed Samuel glares at them, jumps up. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        What glorious and merciful God are 
                        you praying to? What do sunsets and 
                        lighting candles matter when 
                        hundreds of people died today?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Brother, don’t despair. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        What God are you thanking? There’s 
                        no God! If there were, would he 
                        allow innocent babies to die? Would 
                        he kill people who only want to do 
                        honest work? And you, witnesses to 
                        these crimes remain thankful? 

                                 TOMASZ 
                        Calm down, remember where you are!  
                                 SAMUEL
                        You calm yourself! 

                                 TOMASZ
                        We’re all hurting. Last week my 
                        whole family was killed, yet here I 
                        am. I’ll never forgive myself. I’ve 
                        betrayed them by living.

           EXT. WORK AREA - DAY 

           Bent over a pile, Artur finds a velvet sack with gold coins. 
           He checks for guards, slips the sack into his pocket. 

           EXT. SORTING SQUARE - DAY 

           A row of workers at attention. An angry SS paces in front.  

                                 SS GUARD
                        It has come to my attention that 
                        theft has been committed. 

           He goes down the line searching each worker. Artur begins to 
           sweat, in his pocket he feels the sack of gold coins. 

           The sun beats down on him. He casually slips off his blazer, 
           drops it on the ground. SS tramples up. 

                                 SS GUARD (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 ARTUR
                        I’m sweating, sir. The sun is 
                        especially hot today.

           SS searches Artur’s pockets, he comes up empty. He proceeds 
           to the next worker. Artur releases a sigh. 

           SS finds a gold watch on a worker. He lifts his PISTOL, 
           SHOOTS him on the spot. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        The rest are dismissed.

           Artur fetches his blazer, trudges back to work. 

           INT. METAL SHOP HUT - DAY 

           Standing next to a roaring fire, CAMP BLACKSMITH forges a 
           large iron swastika. 
           INT. PAINTER’S HUT - DAY 

           Tomasz paints a sign that reads ‘TO BIALYSTOCK’. Road signs 
           indicating other cities lay scattered about. Artur enters. 

                                 ARTUR
                        What’s all this? 

                                 TOMASZ 
                        When the White Death found out I 
                        was a painter he gave me orders to 
                        paint road signs. Very odd. This 
                        one says ‘to Wolkowsysk’, this one 
                        ‘to Obermajden’. I don’t get it. 
                        These towns are miles away.

           Galewski enters. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Artur, I need to speak to you. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I have something for you, rabbi. 

           From his pocket, Artur draws out the velvet sack of coins. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I’m afraid this will be the last 
                        time you’ll collect money for us. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Why? 

                                 GALEWSKI 
                        I have a message for you from White 
                        Death. He’s changed your work 
                        detail permanently. 

           EXT. FRONT GATE - DAY 

           Camp blacksmith stands on a ladder. He installs the wrought 
           iron Swastika atop the main gate at the entrance of camp.

                                THIRD MOVEMENT:  SUBTERFUGE

           EXT. POLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 

           Peasant farmers work the land. A TRAIN clatters past. 
           INT. BOX CAR - DAY   

           ANITZA (25) and her MOTHER sit in a corner of the cramped 
           boxcar. A Star of David with blue sapphires hangs around 
           Anitza’s neck, she fidgets with it nervously. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Anitza, honey, be careful with your 
                        pendant, it might break. 

           Anitza peeks through a narrow slit, dense forest speeds by. 
           Her gaze shifts up toward thick, black smoke rising above. 

           The TRAIN slows to a CRAWL. 

                                 ANITZA
                        Looks like we’re arriving, mama. 

                                 MOTHER 
                        Finally. 

           Passengers suddenly fall silent. They sit in disbelief as 
           they listen to something unusual coming from outside --

            -- beautiful MUSIC -- Brahm’s Violin Concerto. 

           Bewildered eyes dart back and forth, can they be hearing 
           correctly? The train slows to a halt, the MUSIC gets louder. 

                                 ANITZA
                        Mama, listen to that lovely music!

           Teary passengers release sighs of relief at the tranquil 
           MUSIC filling the air, setting their worries at ease. 

           INT. BOXCAR - DAY 

           TRAIN SCREECHES to a halt. DOORS SWING open. 

           EXT. TREBLINKA TRAIN STATION - DAY 

           Treblinka is no longer recognizable. 

           It is now a proper, first-class train station. 

           Proper signboards:  TICKET OFFICE, TELEPHONE, STATION MASTER, 
           FIRST-CLASS WAITING ROOM, etc. 

           Timetables for departures to various cities are posted. A 
           clock reading 6 o’clock hangs above. There are benches to sit 
           on, potted flowers line windowsills. 
           Clad in tuxedos, Artur’s five-man orchestra plays BRAHMS.  

           The camp is enclosed by high barbed wired fences. Visibility 
           to other parts of the camp is impossible.

           Workers with shaved heads wear colored armbands.  Blue 
           armband workers unload luggage and assist weak and elderly 
           passengers off the train. 

           Ukrainian and SS guards standby with machine guns. 

           Workers with red armbands hand the arrivals pieces of string.  

                                 RED WORKERS
                        Take off your shoes and tie them 
                        with this string. 

           Passengers are mesmerized by Artur’s MUSIC.

           Anitza assists Mother off the train. She smiles as the 
           orchestra begins to play BEETHOVEN. 

           Fidgeting with her Star of David, she looks at the station 
           clock, it reads 6:00 o’clock. She taps a MAN. 

                                 ANITZA
                        Excuse me, do you have the time? 

                                 MAN
                        Two PM. The clock’s wrong. How do 
                        they expect to run this rail if 
                        they don’t post the correct time? 

           A voice from a LOUDSPEAKER pierces the air.

                                 LOUDSPEAKER 
                        Attention Warsaw Jews! You have 
                        arrived at Treblinka transit 
                        station from which you will 
                        continue on to a destination of 
                        your choice. To prevent epidemics, 
                        clothing and baggage are to be 
                        handed over for disinfection. Gold, 
                        currency, and jewelry are to be 
                        deposited at the cash Office. They 
                        will be returned later. For 
                        physical cleanliness, passengers 
                        must shower before travelling on. 
                        Women will proceed to the 
                        undressing barracks to the left. 
                        Men will undress at the right. 

           Anitza and Mother wait in a long line for the cashier. 
                                 MOTHER 
                        We should go to Bialystok, we can 
                        stay with the Bauers.

                                 ANITZA
                        That’s a good idea.

           Drawn by the music, a BOY stands in front of Artur’s 
           orchestra, sways to the music. His MOTHER runs up, grabs him. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Son, you can’t be here!

                                 BOY 
                        I like the music! 

           The mother looks at Artur pleadingly. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Please, sir, can you tell me if 
                        everything is going to be alright? 

           Artur lowers his eyes and nods. Relieved, Mother smiles, 
           carries her son away.

           EXT. RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

           A FATHER carrying his sick daughter approaches an SS.

                                 FRANTIC FATHER 
                        Excuse me, sir, can you help my 
                        daughter? She’s fallen ill. 

                                 SS GUARD 
                        We’ll take her to the lazarett. 

           He points to a small white hut, a white flag with a red cross 
           flies above. A sign reads LAZARETT.

           He summons two workers with red crosses on their white 
           armbands. They run up, lay the sick child on a stretcher, the 
           father follows them toward the lazarett.

           With a satisfied smile, Stangl observes the methodical, 
           streamlined proceedings from his office door. 

           EXT. CASHIER BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER 

           People leave money, identity papers, and other valuables.  
           Anitza hides her Star of David under her collar. At the 
           window, she hands the cashier her purse. 
                                 ANITZA
                        Hand over your purse, mama. 

                                 MOTHER 
                        But it has all my money. 

                                 ANITZA
                        It’s okay they’re going to keep it 
                        safe until we finish. 

           Reluctantly, Mother obliges. Anitza takes her hand, they make 
           their way toward a long barrack with other women.  

           INT. UNDRESSING BARRACKS - MOMENTS LATER 

           One by one people file down an assembly line to undress -- 
           first jacket, then shirt, pants, underwear, lastly shoes. 

           Anitza unzips her dress. A guard notices her, he summons a 
           WORKER, whispers directions as he points to Anitza. 

                                 WORKER 
                        Miss, you’re being summoned. 

                                 ANITZA
                        Me? What about my mother? 

                                 WORKER 
                        She has to stay.

                                 ANITZA
                        Will I see her after the 
                        disinfection process? 

                                 WORKER
                        Yes, please come with me. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Anitza, please don’t go. 

                                 ANITZA
                        I’ll see you afterwards, mama. Just 
                        do as you’re told and listen to the 
                        beautiful music.

           She leaves. Mother turns to a WORKER.

                                 MOTHER 
                        Please, tell me, I beg you, is 
                        everything going to be alright? Are 
                        they telling us the truth? 
                                 WORKER 
                        Yes, now please hurry, ma’am. 

           INT. BARBER BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Barbers in white smocks cut women’s hair.  A frightened girl 
           puts up a fight, she’s held down by her mother. 

                                 BARBER
                        Settle down, little one. You’re 
                        here to get a nice haircut. 

           Mother is next. She recognizes one of the BARBERS. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Iwo! Iwo Kowalksi. 

                                 IWO 
                        Irena! I can’t believe it’s you! 

                                 MOTHER
                        Iwo, please, what’s going to happen 
                        to us? What can you tell me? 

           SS pass by, Iwo stays silent. He cuts Mother’s hair, 
           lingering a few extra seconds, her long locks fall into the 
           suitcase at his feet. He finishes, taps her shoulder softly.  

                                 IWO
                        You may go now, my friend.

           EXT. PATHWAY ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Clutching soapbars and towels, Mother and a group of women 
           enter a narrow path flanked by tall fences. The path is lined 
           with flowers, it resembles a garden path.

           All throughout, we hear the MUSIC from Artur’s orchestra. 

           Prodded along by workers in black armbands, the women make 
           their way down the path. 

           Mother’s eyes follow thick black smoke rising above her head, 
           her gaze lands on a guard standing inside a watch tower. 

           EXT. ARRIVAL PLATFORM - SAME TIME

           Artur’s orchestra continues playing. Box cars, now empty, are 
           quickly cleaned out by workers.
           Next set of box cars pull up. DOORS OPEN, thousands of 
           passengers disembark, repeating the process all over again. 

           EXT. LAZARETT - SAME TIME 

           We watch the frantic Father from earlier enter the small hut, 
           following the workers who carry his sick daughter on a 
           stretcher. After a moment, we hear two GUNSHOTS.  

           EXT. PATH - SAME TIME

           Mother and the other women reach the end of the path.

                                 GUARD
                        Hurry, showers are this way!

           They come out on a clearing -- they freeze -- GASP as their 
           eyes land on something above their heads that we cannot see. 

           Tears of joy, sighs of relief. Women hug each other, some 
           fall to their knees, raise their arms up at the sight in 
           front of them and give thanks to God. Mother smiles. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Simcha, all is well, sisters!

           EXT. MAIN SQUARE - SUNSET

           End of the workday. A procession of peasants in horse-drawn 
           wagons filled with black ash exits through the front gate. 

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Attention workers, report for 
                        evening roll call at once! 

           EXT. LINE-UP YARD - MOMENTS LATER 

           Workers stand at attention in rows of five. 

                                 GUARDS
                        Fall in!

           Artur’s orchestra plays camp anthem “Fester Schritt”. 
           Prisoners sing along. Galewski counts workers.

           Stangl watches with a satisfied grin, his dog at his heels.

                                 WORKERS
                             (singing)
                        We look straight out at the world,
                                 (MORE)
                                 WORKERS (CONT'D)
                        The columns are marching off to 
                        their work. All we have left is 
                        Treblinka. It is our destiny. 

                                 GUARD
                        Louder!

                                 WORKERS
                             (singing louder)
                        We heed commandant’s voice, obeying 
                        his every nod and sign. We march 
                        along to do what duty demands...

           Galewski BLOWS his WHISTLE.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Herr Commandant, workers are 
                        accounted for. Achtung workers! 
                        About face! Hats off! Eyes left!

           With military precision, workers whip off their caps, SLAP 
           them in unison against their thighs. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Workers are ready for inspection!

           Stangl and Franz make their inspection. A worker collapses. 
           Franz promptly SHOOTS him. 

           Galewski BLOWS his WHISTLE. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Drill exercises! 

           Workers run drills at Galewski’s commands. Guards WHIP 
           stragglers. After drills, Galewski reads from a list. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Yacobski, twenty-five lashes for 
                        being late to roll call. Lipski, 
                        fifty lashes for eating bread from 
                        transport... 

           These workers step out of line-up. Yacobski is tied to a 
           stool. A guard WHIPS him as Yacobski counts. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Artur Gold’s orchestra will now 
                        honor us with a concert. 

           The orchestra plays “Aren’t You Sad Mountain Man?” Exhausted 
           workers, barely able to stand, glower at Artur.
           EXT. FARM FIELD - SAME TIME

           Peasants working the land pause, listen to the faint sound of 
           MUSIC coming from camp.

           Peasants driving the horse-drawn wagons that exited camp now 
           dump black ash on the ground, turning it black.  

           INT. GOLDJUDEN HUT - DAY 

           Surrounded by gold and silver valuables, workers in yellow 
           armbands sort and weigh jewels from that day’s transports. 

           Samuel enters, dumps a sack of jewelry on the table.  

                                 SAMUEL
                        The last from today’s transport.

           As he exits, he discreetly pockets a gold bracelet.  

           INT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT

           A lively party. A lavish feast is laid out on pristine, white 
           table cloths. Drunk SS sway back and forth to ARTUR’S MUSIC.

           Heavily made-up WOMEN in glimmering evening gowns enter. 
           Among the women, wearing an ill-fitting red dress is a 
           distraught Anitza. An SS pours the women champagne.    

           Anitza sips her champagne as SS sit on either side of her.

           SS take girls in their arms and dance with them.  

           A drunk SS fills Artur’s glass with champagne. Just outside a 
           worker is tied to a stool and whipped by Ivan the Terrible. 

           The tortured worker turns his head, spots Artur looking at 
           him from inside the warm dining hall. Artur averts his eyes, 
           plays louder to drown out the worker’s screams. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - SAME TIME

           Tiny candles flicker. Workers lay in their bunks playing 
           cards and conversing. Hasidic Jews chant in the corner. 

           Huddled at Galewski’s corner bunk, cloaked behind a hanging 
           bedsheet are the Planning Committee. They lay out a red table 
           cloth on a small table. Galewski lights a small candle. 

           At the door, Dr. Chorazycki exchanges a wad of bills for a 
           package with Strebel. He opens the package. 
                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        That Strebel is a rascal, but he 
                        always comes through. This bread 
                        cost $100. The ham, 250 Reichsmark. 
                        The vodka cost me a gold broach. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Dig in, brothers. On Judgment Day 
                        we’ll be called to account for 
                        every permissible thing we could 
                        have enjoyed but did not. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Would you like to see the beautiful 
                        gem I found today?

           Zelomir pulls out a silver-plated harmonica. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Do you play, Zelo? 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        My grandfather taught me when I 
                        visited him in Prague every summer. 
                        He had a small house on a lake.

           Oskar downs a shot of vodka.

                                 OSKAR
                        Damn that’s good. Too bad those 
                        Russians don’t make their political 
                        alliances as good as their vodka. 

           A VOICE from the other side of the bedsheet chimes in. 

                                 SAMUEL (O.S.)
                        Brothers, can I join? 

           Samuel pokes his head in. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Did you bring any girls? 

           Samuel pulls out the gold bracelet he’d stolen earlier from 
           the goldjuden hut. Galewski adds it to his stash. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Any special requests? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Can you play “The Last Sunday”? 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Good choice!
           Zelomir PLAYS his HARMONICA. The men devour their feast. 
           Galewski lifts his glass, they toast. 

           Suddenly, a SHOE FLIES at them, KNOCKING out the candle. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Stop making all that racket!

           Without a word, the men collect their things and retire. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Must be one of Hitler’s cousins. 

           EXT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT

           A drunk Artur staggers out gripping his violin. 

           From behind a wall he hears ROARING and RUMBLING from a TANK 
           accompanied by faint SCREAMS.

           He looks up at the sky, thick black smoke rises past a watch 
           tower. A guard eyes him, rifle trained. Artur keeps walking.

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Artur enters to find a man’s lifeless body dangling in the 
           corner. He cuts the man down. Dr. Chorazycki runs up to help. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Poor soul. May he rest in peace.

           Artur stares at the dead man’s tattered clothes, his bare 
           feet full of sores. He looks down at his own clothes -- a 
           tuxedo, polished dress shoes. 

           A drunk Franz suddenly emerges from outside. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Fall in!

           Prisoners bound out of bed. Franz collars a worker CRACKS him 
           hard across the face, his GLASSES CLATTER to the floor. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Put your glasses on, you blind Jew!

           Franz lifts his pistol to his temple, BLAST! He continues 
           down the line, BLAST! Another prisoner with glasses falls. 

           To Artur -- 
                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Maestro, the commandant’s favorite 
                        pet! Play for us! 

           Artur PLAYS his VIOLIN. BLAST! Another worker with glasses is 
           shot. Terrified, Dr. Chorazycki slowly plucks his glasses 
           from his face, slips them into his pocket.

           Franz reaches the end of the row, finds one last worker, 
           BLAST! He scans the room, finds no one else with glasses, 
           exits. Workers scramble to their beds.

           Galewski summons the Planning Committee to his bunk.

                                 ARTUR 
                        If these monsters don’t kill at 
                        least 10 Jews a day they have 
                        trouble sleeping at night.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Dear God, the Doll is a sadist. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        God? I think he’s on holiday.

                                 GALEWSKI 
                        Jaergonski, take your position. 

           JAERGONSKI stands watch at a window, flashes a thumbs up.

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Tomasz, did you finish it? 

           Tomasz unrolls a map. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        I finished it today between 
                        portrait sittings.

           Galewski examines the map. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        It’s getting cold. It’s imperative 
                        we leave before snowfall. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Why?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        If we escape with snow on the 
                        ground we’ll leave footprints. 
                        They’ll catch us in minutes. 
                                 OSKAR 
                        Don’t you know anything about 
                        escaping a death camp, Artur? 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        I have something to show you all 
                        that will make you very happy. 

           He digs under his bunk, pulls out a pistol. The men gasp. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI (CONT’D)
                        Strebel came through. He says he 
                        can get more if we pay him. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        We have enough money now to buy the 
                        entire artillery. And grenades?

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        As long as we pay him he’ll get it.

                                 ARTUR
                        This Ukrainian trusts you so much? 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        I treated him for venereal disease 
                        he got from a local brothel. I 
                        treat their hangovers, colds, 
                        scabies, syphilis. You’d be 
                        surprised how much they like you 
                        when you make the pain go away.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        We won’t be able to give every 
                        worker a weapon, but I’ll give 
                        orders to set fire to buildings 
                        once the signal is heard. 

                                 ARTUR 
                        What’s the signal?

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI 
                        Two gun shots.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        The plan is simple. Mondays many of 
                        the guards go to the Bug River. 
                        It’s best to execute our escape 
                        when there are less to fight. 

           He points to the map as he speaks. 
                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Here are the three zones of the 
                        camp. The living zone, reception, 
                        and the extermination zone.

           Tomasz points to a spot on the map with no details. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        I was unable to give details of the 
                        extermination zone. As you know 
                        those walls hide that area from us.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Which is why we need you Zelomir. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Me? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I put in a request to change your 
                        work detail. We need you in the 
                        death area. As a carpenter it makes 
                        sense for you to have access. We 
                        need you to communicate with those 
                        workers about the revolt. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Whatever it takes. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Be sure to take your caps with you 
                        when you escape. With our heads 
                        shaved, we’re easy to identify. 
                        Anyone will know you’re an escaped 
                        prisoner and gladly turn you in for 
                        reward money. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY 

           Frigid winter day. Workers chop trees on the outskirts of 
           camp. Ukrainian guards huddle over a fire and pay little 
           attention to workers as they pass around a schnapps bottle. 

           Samuel lights a cigarette, gazes out at the empty forest -- 
           escaping would be so easy. Samuel scans the area, spots a 
           steep embankment that would make a good hiding place. 

           He steals one last glance at the guards, they are busy 
           opening a bottle of vodka. Eyes glued to the guards, he 
           begins to release his ax. Just before he makes a run for it, 
           another worker makes a mad dash into the forest -- BLAST! The 
           worker is riddled with bullets.
           INT. PULLMAN TRAIN - DINING CAR - DAY 

           A first class train. Well-dressed passengers in furs and 
           tailored suits dine on mutton as they’re waited on by 
           uniformed servers. Classical MUSIC is piped in from SPEAKERS. 

           EXT. FARM FIELD

           The train speeds past farmers toward the thick billowing 
           black smoke of Treblinka.

           EXT. TREBLINKA TRAIN STATION - MOMENTS LATER 

           The Pullman arrives. Doors are opened by SS. Elegant 
           passengers detrain in total calm, smiling as they listen to 
           ARTUR’S ORCHESTRA. Guards greet passengers courteously. 

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Attention Greek Jews. You are in a 
                        transit camp from which the 
                        transport will continue...

           Artur and Oskar share a cigarette. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Who are these people? 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Greek Jews. Greece is a Nazi ally. 
                        There’s an agreement of some sort. 
                        They may come in fancier trains but 
                        they end up the same as the rest. 

           Workers with blue armbands unload pricey luggage, furniture, 
           food, fine alcohol and load them onto wheelbarrows. 

           A distinguished GREEK DOCTOR approaches an SS, he points to a 
           large, wooden trunk with his name stenciled on it. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Excuse me, sir, I’m a surgeon and I 
                        have irreplaceable medical 
                        equipment. I was hoping it would be 
                        treated with extra care. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        Not to worry, doctor, I’ll 
                        personally watch over your trunk 
                        until you return from the 
                        sanitation procedure. 
           INT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT

           Champagne BOTTLE POPS. A lavish feast from the Greek train is 
           laid out. SS gorge themselves on food and drink. 

           SS hover over a trunk, dig through medical tools. Stenciled 
           on the lid of the trunk: DR. R. YEOSHUA ATHENS GREECE. 

           Costumed as Tristan and Isolde, two OPERA SINGERS finish 
           performing the Wagner opera. They bow, SS applaud fervently.

           Artur plays a SONATA. A drunk Franz staggers up, hurls his 
           glass, cutting Artur’s hand. 

                                 FRANZ 
                        What’s that garbage you’re playing? 

                                 ARTUR 
                        It’s a sonata I wrote.

           Stangl rises from his seat.

                                 STANGL 
                        Leave him alone. 

                                 FRANZ
                        He’s playing degenerate Jew music. 

                                 STANGL
                        Artur, go to the infirmary. 

           Franz scowls at Artur slumped on the floor. 

                                 FRANZ
                        No point wasting time on a virus.

           INT. INFIRMARY - NIGHT

           Dr. Chorazycki tends to Artur’s hand. Convalescing guards 
           sleep as he and Artur speak in hushed tones.

                                 ARTUR
                        I can’t do this much longer. People 
                        put their trust in my music up 
                        until they take their last breath. 
                        I play Chopin for the condemned 
                        during the day and for their 
                        murderers at night. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        We’re all tools of the killing 
                        process. But we must keep on for 
                        our plan to succeed. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI (CONT'D)
                        If only one of us makes it out 
                        it’ll be worth it. Here, I have 
                        something to give you. 

           The doctor reaches into a cabinet, pulls out a small capsule.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI (CONT’D)
                        It’s a cyanide capsule. I keep one 
                        with me at all times. 

                                 ARTUR
                        But you’re a favorite of the 
                        guards. You’re untouchable. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        If you’re a Jew, you’re never safe. 
                        This capsule is my insurance. 
                        Knowing I can take a pill out of my 
                        pocket and use it whenever I want 
                        gives me confidence. It’s easier to 
                        survive when you feel you’re in 
                        charge of your life. I found them 
                        in the pocket of a dead man. I 
                        don’t know if I’ll have the courage 
                        to take it at that critical moment. 
                        To swallow poison of your own free 
                        will takes extraordinary courage. 
                        There’s always hope you’ll survive.

           He slips the capsule and a vodka bottle into Artur’s pocket.

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI (CONT’D)
                        Shalom, my friend, whenever you 
                        pass my clinic, drop in. I’ll treat 
                        you to some good liquor and food. 

           An SS enters. 

                                 SS GUARD 
                        Conductor, the commandant wants to 
                        see you first thing tomorrow. 

           EXT. MAIN CAMP - DAY  

           Artur makes his way toward Stangl’s office.

           A young BOY tends a flock of geese. Artur lights a cigarette, 
           watches the boy feed his geese. Franz walks up, hands the boy 
           a slice of bread, the boy feeds the bread to the geese. 

           Outside the brothel, Anitza and the other women in flashy 
           dresses smoke cigarettes. An SS ambles up, takes Anitza by 
           the hand, leads her into the building. 
           INT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY 

           Artur waits at the door. Stangl poses for Tomasz who paints 
           his portrait. A servant boy MARKUS (13) collects a tunic. 

                                 MARKUS
                        Herr commandant, should I take your 
                        uniform to the laundress?

                                 STANGL
                        Please do.

           Stangl hands Markus a chocolate bar. 

                                 MARKUS
                        Thank you, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        That’s fine, Tomasz, let’s continue 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Very good, sir. 

           Tomasz winks at Artur as he exits. Stangl settles on a couch.

                                 STANGL
                        How’s your hand?

                                 ARTUR
                        Better, thank you.

           Stangl lights a cigar. 

                                 STANGL
                        Tell me about yourself, maestro. 
                        Where do you come from? 

                                 ARTUR
                        I was born in Warsaw.  

                                 STANGL
                        And your family? Any siblings? 

                                 ARTUR
                        I had a younger brother who played 
                        violin as well. My mother was a 
                        classical pianist. My father played 
                        violin for the Warsaw Opera. I 
                        studied classical composition under 
                        him. When he died I continued 
                        studying with an uncle in England. 
                                 STANGL
                        My apologies for your father. 

                                 ARTUR
                        That’s very kind of you, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        Mozart also studied under his 
                        father. I hear you’re quite popular 
                        here in Poland. That you recorded 
                        for Columbia Records in London. 

           Artur nods. Stangl points to the portrait of Hitler. 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Our fuhrer adores music. Did you 
                        know that?

           Artur shakes his head.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        He’s a great patron of the arts. As 
                        a dispatch runner in the Great War 
                        he carried Wagner’s music inside 
                        his knapsack. He’s an avid art 
                        collector. He’s fond of water 
                        colors, oil paintings. Of course he 
                        doesn’t go for all that nonsense 
                        Dada or abstract rubbish. He loves 
                        classical pieces. At his home in 
                        Berghoff he has pieces by Vermeer, 
                        Titian, some Italian masters. He’s 
                        making plans to open a museum in 
                        Linz. Quite a few of my Nazi 
                        brethren are enthusiasts for the 
                        arts. Which brings me to the reason 
                        why I’ve summoned you. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes, sir?

                                 STANGL
                        In a few months, the head of the 
                        SS, Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler 
                        will be visiting our little camp. 
                        In honor of his visit, I’m 
                        commissioning you for an original 
                        composition.  

           Artur stands in stunned silence.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        You’re classically trained, yes? 
           Artur nods.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        You’re a noteworthy musician of 
                        caliber. Your sonatas are 
                        impressive, I enjoy them immensely. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Your words are greatly appreciated.

                                 STANGL
                        I want something dominating, 
                        powerful, something along the lines 
                        of Wagner’s 5th. A piece that 
                        captures the vigor of the Third 
                        Reich. Do we have an understanding?

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes, sir.

                                 STANGL
                        Every talented artist needs a 
                        benefactor. Da Vinci had the 
                        Medici, Beethoven had Prince 
                        Kinsky, Mozart had Emperor Joseph. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - DAY 

           SS eat their lunch as Artur conducts female workers singing 
           GERMAN FOLK MUSIC. He spots Stangl’s car exiting camp.

           INT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT 

           Without Stangl, the hall has devolved into pure debauchery. 

           Artur’s musicians play Bach. No longer in their usual 
           tuxedos, they’ve been made up as clowns with oversized bow 
           ties, clown pants, and painted faces.

                                 FRANZ
                        Bravo maestro! Now, esteemed 
                        musicians, each of you introduce 
                        yourselves to our audience! 

           SS roar with laughter. A humiliated Artur stands. 

                                 ARTUR
                        My name is Artur Gold. I am the 
                        conductor for Aria Club in Warsaw. 

           SS cheer. He takes his seat. Violinist stands. 
                                 VIOLINIST
                        I am Aleksy Niemic, first string 
                        violinist for the Warsaw 
                        Philharmonic.

           The guards erupt in laughter. CELLIST stands. 

                                 CELLIST
                        My name is Slawek Sokoloff. I’m 
                        lead cellist for the Warsaw 
                        National Opera. 

           INT. EMPTY BOX CAR - NIGHT

           Clad in his clown get-up, Artur is on hands and knees 
           scrubbing blood and urine off the floor. Drinking from a 
           bottle of vodka, Franz CRACKS his WHIP on Artur’s back. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           A bloodied, bruised Artur lays on his bunk. Samuel wipes his 
           face with a towel.

                                 ARTUR
                        I’m just lucky he didn’t kill me. 

           Samuel hands him a canteen. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Here, drink some water.

                                 ARTUR
                        Can I maybe have a glimpse of that  
                        picture?

           Grinning, Samuel pulls Ingrid’s picture out of his boot.

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, what happened to her? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        We were kicked out of our home for 
                        a German family to live in it. We 
                        moved into a damp basement on 
                        Wolska street. I had to give up my 
                        shop to SS administrators. Then one 
                        day, Ingrid was summoned to go. On 
                        our last day together we were 
                        walking to the train depot. Out of 
                        curiosity, Ingrid wanted to see her 
                        garden. So we walked to our house. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                        There was a sign on our garden 
                        gate, “NO DOGS NO JEWS”. We stood 
                        there on the street looking up at 
                        our house and imagined our lives if 
                        the war hadn’t come. I pictured 
                        myself sitting on my bench in our 
                        garden, smoking my pipe, reading 
                        the paper. Our little red radio 
                        would be on the windowsill playing 
                        music. Ingrid would be planting a 
                        new bed of hyacinths. She loved 
                        those. I can feel it now, the warm 
                        spring sun on my face. The sweet, 
                        dewy air. The gentle sound of 
                        Ingrid digging in the dirt with her 
                        spade. The reality that I'd once 
                        taken for granted was now a 
                        fantasy. After a few moments we 
                        said goodbye to our home and walked 
                        away. I hugged her goodbye at the 
                        train station. That was the last 
                        time I touched her.

           Artur hands the picture back to Samuel. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m lucky. I was blessed with a 
                        good imagination. If you occupy 
                        your mind with trivial thoughts, it 
                        takes you away from here. That’s 
                        how you survive. Honesty will be 
                        your demise. Not these murderers. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Every morning I wake up and wonder 
                        when I’ll be delivered from this 
                        hell. Will I be punished for my 
                        transgressions? Will there be a 
                        bigger hell after I die?

                                 SAMUEL
                        If that’s how you think, then 
                        you’ve already condemned yourself. 

           EXT. MAIN SQUARE - DAY  

           A makeshift boxing ring. Two bloodied workers in boxing 
           gloves spar. Guards cheer at the ‘boxers’ and bet against 
           each other. Workers watch in dreaded silence. 
           INT. TOMASZ’S WORK HUT

           A harsh wind blows. Walls are lined with portraits of SS and 
           their families. Tomasz pours Artur a cup of hot coffee. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Part of the spoils. They bring me 
                        the best coffee, sausage, 
                        chocolate, you name it. Tell me, 
                        what did Stangl want with you? 

                                 ARTUR
                        He’s commissioned me to write a 
                        piece for a special visitor. 
                        Heinrich Himmler. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Himmler? Quite an honor! It means 
                        your life has been spared. For a 
                        few weeks anyway. But you may not 
                        have to do it after all. 

                                 ARTUR
                        What do you mean? 

                                 TOMASZ
                        You haven’t heard about Chorazycki? 
                        Tomorrow he purchases the arms from 
                        Strebel! It’ll take place after 
                        morning roll call in his clinic. 

                                 ARTUR
                        That’s excellent news! 

           Tomasz frowns at the half-finished portrait of Stangl. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Nothing would please me more than 
                        to burn all this to the ground. My 
                        dream has always been to have my 
                        work survive me, but now, not so 
                        much. These monsters all want 
                        paintings of their families. They 
                        show me photos of their wives, 
                        their mothers, their children. 
                        You’d be amazed how tenderly they 
                        speak of their loved ones. They 
                        describe the color of their hair, 
                        their eyes. It’s hard to imagine 
                        these killers as husbands and 
                        fathers who care so diligently for 
                        their loved ones. 
           He points to a portrait of a little blond girl sitting on a 
           chair with a cat on her lap. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        This one spoke so lovingly of his 
                        daughter. He told me details about 
                        the day she was born, he had tears 
                        in his eyes. Can you believe it? 

           He pulls out a portrait of a beaming newlywed couple, the 
           bride in white, the groom in his SS uniform. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        You’d never guess they’re such 
                        contemptible monsters. 

           He pulls out another portrait, a look of disgust on his face. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        This one is the most popular. 

           It’s a portrait of Hitler. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        I paint several a month. They rave 
                        about this maniac. I’d like to 
                        paint him sitting on the toilet. 
                        They say he was raised Catholic, 
                        sang in the church choir, attended 
                        a monastery school. The good 
                        Catholic became a good Nazi. I’d 
                        rather paint the portraits of 
                        children being killed behind these 
                        walls. Give those Nazis portraits 
                        of Jews they kill, let them take 
                        those home and hang them on their 
                        walls. 

           He pulls out a hidden painting. 

                                 TOMASZ (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been working on this one in 
                        secret. You see, it has piles of 
                        corpses in a pyre. 

                                 ARTUR
                        They’ll hang you if they find that. 

                                 TOMASZ
                        Someone has to stand up for the 
                        victims, Artur. Ashes don’t speak. 
           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           A frigid night. Workers shiver in their bunks. Dr. Chorazycki 
           shoots Artur a thumbs up. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Tomorrow Strebel makes the sale!

           Artur smiles, pulls his brother’s coat over his shoulder. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAWN

           Artur is awakened by the sound of WEEPING. He finds Oskar 
           standing at a window in tears. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Oskar, what’s the matter? 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Today is not the day, brother.  

           Oskar points out the window -- the camp is under a blanket of 
           fresh snow. The men stare out the window heartbroken. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Nature has conspired against us.

                                 TOMASZ
                        God is not on our side.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Forget God, we’re on our own. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I hoped the sun would come to our 
                        aid. Shine just a few more days. 
                        Mother nature covers their sins. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        She’s only obeying the laws of 
                        nature, Artur. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I look up at the sky hoping to see 
                        a glimmer of God. But all I see is 
                        our beautiful Polish sky. 

           EXT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY 

           A bone-chilling day. Snow falls on frozen ground. Artur's 
           orchestra plays as new victims disembark a train. 
           Shivering people are led through the streamlined process of 
           turning in valuables and undressing. Children cling to their 
           mothers to keep warm. 

           His hands nearly frozen, Artur drops his violin. A GUARD 
           plods over, picks up Artur’s violin, hands it to him. 

                                 GUARD
                        Keep playing damnit!

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Workers sleep. Lit by a tiny candle, Artur sits on his bunk 
           composing. He closes his eyes hears the music in his mind, he 
           moves his hand as if playing a violin. He makes adjustments 
           to his manuscript. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAY 

           Barracks are empty save for Artur. Reading from his 
           manuscript, Artur practices on his violin. 

           He’s interrupted by screaming outside his window. An SS whips 
           a worker. Artur begins to play to drown out the screaming. 

           EXT. ARRIVAL PLATFORM - DAY 

           A new transport. Artur searches the crowd through falling 
           snow. He finds TWO MEN holding musical instruments. Artur 
           pushes through toward them. Franz stops him. 

                                 FRANZ 
                        What do you think you’re doing? 

                                 ARTUR 
                        I need musicians for my orchestra.  

                                 FRANZ
                        I’ve watched you all day running 
                        around acting like you own the 
                        place you arrogant Jew. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Commandant gave me permission to 
                        find musicians. I need these men. 

                                 FRANZ
                        I’ll allow you one.

                                 ARTUR
                        What?
                                 FRANZ
                        Choose one. 

                                 ARTUR
                        But I need both!

           Franz backhands him. 

                                 FRANZ 
                        Choose one!

           Anguished, Artur looks at the two men, their eyes plead. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Hurry, or I’ll shoot them both!

           Artur lifts his finger, points to one. BLAST! Franz shoots 
           the one Artur chose.

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        I’ll let you have the other one. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           Reading from his manuscript, Artur plays his violin. Workers 
           lay on bunks, listen to Artur’s music fill the large room. 

           Galewski STRIKES a MATCH, lights the third candle on a 
           homemade menorah. 

                                 FOURTH MOVEMENT:  VISITOR

           EXT. FOREST - DIRT ROAD - DAY  

           Spring. We are low to the ground, behind the wheel of a car 
           headed toward Treblinka. The wheels roll over layers of ash. 

           We pull back to reveal a retinue of Nazi vehicles.

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAY  

           A tuxedoed Artur adjusts his bow tie. He steps back, 
           considers his reflection in a cracked mirror.

           EXT. SHOE SHINE STATION - DAY 

           Artur has his shoes shined by Benyamin. He feels the scornful 
           stares of workers dressed in rags. 
           EXT. CAMP ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER 

           The procession of Nazi cars enters through the front gate. 

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Workers! Line up for roll call! 

           EXT. LINE-UP YARD - MOMENTS LATER 

           Prisoners stand at attention. Artur’s orchestra plays a 
           MILITARY NUMBER. 

           Globocnik and HEINRICH HIMMLER (43) climb out of their cars, 
           they’re saluted by Stangl and Franz.

           EXT. LINEUP YARD - DAY 

           Artur’s orchestra plays a GERMAN MARCHING SONG. Himmler and 
           Stangl make their way down the rows, inspecting workers. 

           EXT. MAIN YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Stangl leads Himmler and Globocnik through various work 
           areas, Himmler nods in approval. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAY 

           Stangl and Himmler inspect prisoners standing at attention. 

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY 

           Himmler observes the streamlined processing of newly arrived 
           victims. Himmler takes it all in, nods, smiles in approval.

           INT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT 

           The mess hall is decked out. Artur’s orchestra is seated on a 
           platform. Himmler and the others take their seats. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS 

           Stangl salutes the roomful of luminaries. 

                                 STANGL
                        I would like to extend a warm 
                        welcome to Reichsfuhrer Himmler and 
                        Obersturmfuhrer Globocnik. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STANGL (CONT'D)
                        I am greatly humbled and honored by 
                        your visit. As a token of our 
                        esteem, I have a gift for you. 

           He turns to Artur.

                                 ARTUR
                        Honored guests, I welcome you on 
                        behalf of the workers. In honor of 
                        your visit, we would like to 
                        present this piece dedicated to 
                        you, Reichsfuhrer Himmler, the 
                        Third Reich, and the Fuhrer.

           Artur lifts his baton, the MUSIC BEGINS. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - SAME TIME

           Galewski intones nightly kaddish prayer.

           INT. SS MESS HALL - LATER

           Artur leads his orchestra in a flourish of music. Stangl is 
           mesmerized, Himmler listens with an opaque smile.

           EXT. MAIN CAMP 

           We float across camp -- Artur’s MUSIC fills the air. 

           EXT. SURROUNDING AREAS OF CAMP

           MUSIC travels through farm fields and forests.

           INT. SS MESS HALL - LATER

           Artur’s orchestra finishes the piece with a frenzied climax. 
           Artur bows to Nazi officials. Himmler stands, applauds, the 
           others follow his lead. Stangl beams.  

           EXT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT - LATER

           Artur and his musicians smoke. An SS pokes his head out. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        The commandant has requested that 
                        you come inside to eat. 

           Artur and his musicians stamp out their cigarettes. 
                                 SS GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Only the conductor. The rest of you 
                        are relieved to your barracks.

           INT. SS MESS HALL 

           Artur sits at a table flanked by SS. A WORKER serves him. 

                                 WORKER
                             (under her breath)
                        Nazi sympathizer. 

           Artur’s smile fades. SS walk by, pat Artur on the back. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - DAY 

           Workers sit at their bunks, eat their lunches. An SS appears.

                                 SS GUARD
                        Conductor.  

           A hush settles on the workers. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes. 

           Guard places a small box on Artur’s bunk. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        This is from the commandant for 
                        your services to the Third Reich. 

           Artur opens the box to find a gold fob watch. He finds an 
           engraving in Hebrew. He feels the eyes of workers on him. 

                                 SS GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Pack your things, you’re being 
                        relocated to new quarters. 

           Artur slips on his brother’s coat, grabs his violin, makes 
           his way toward the door. Scornful glances follow him. 

                                 WORKER (O.S.)
                             (whisper)
                        Traitor.

           EXT. SS LIVING QUARTERS - DAY 

           Artur follows the guard out of the prisoner area into the 
           section reserved for SS. It resembles a small town with 
           manicured gardens and flower beds.
           He passes a bakery, a laundry, a locksmith, a shoe repair 
           hut. We may notice Liebeskind working inside a locksmith hut.

           On a field, SS do their exercises and play soccer. An SS 
           tends a small vegetable garden. 

           He passes a pigsty with pigs. Next, horse stables. Adjacent 
           to that are cages with a painted sign reading ‘ZOO’. Inside 
           are foxes, peacocks and does. 

           He reaches an area of personal huts that are spanking clean, 
           ringed with flower beds.   

                                 GUARD
                        Those are your new quarters. 

           INT. ARTUR’S HUT

           Artur sits on his bed, opens his violin case, begins to play. 
           Markus the cleaning boy enters, begins to sweep the floor. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Will you be cleaning my hut?

                                 MARKUS
                        I clean all SS quarters. I take 
                        their uniforms to the laundress, 
                        have their boots shined. They’re 
                        serious about cleanliness. The 
                        commandant changes his boots three 
                        times a day. I’ve never seen such a 
                        man!

                                 ARTUR
                        How do they treat you? 

                                 MARKUS
                        Very well. Especially when I bring 
                        them valuables I find in the yard. 
                        I know all about their families so 
                        I find special trinkets for them to 
                        take home. You look inside their 
                        quarters and you’d never believe a 
                        Nazi lived there. Over their beds 
                        they hang pretty inscriptions about 
                        love of one's fellow man. Their 
                        furnishings have embroidery with 
                        sayings of love and brotherhood 
                        made by their wives. Many keep 
                        Bibles on their night stand and 
                        have wooden crosses hanging above 
                        their beds.
                                 ARTUR
                        Someone should remind them that 
                        Jesus was a Jew. 

                                 MARKUS
                        They always tell me how much they 
                        miss their homes. Of course I can’t 
                        tell them that I miss my family 
                        because they were killed here. You 
                        know Officer Franz? 

                                 ARTUR
                        The Doll? Yes, I know him too well.

                                 MARKUS
                        He has a photo album in his 
                        quarters with photos from here in 
                        the camp. He calls it “Schöne 
                        Zeite”. Good times. When I was 
                        cleaning his quarters he showed it 
                        to me. Photos of dead people. He 
                        says to me, death by gunshot is 
                        really a privilege. He tells me 
                        that Jews are fair game, anybody 
                        can snatch one off the street and 
                        keep them. He said the best advice 
                        to give a Jew in Europe: don’t have 
                        any children, they have no future. 

           EXT. ARRIVALS PLATFORM/TRAIN STATION - DAY 

           Artur finishes a set as a new transport arrives. He spots 
           UNCLE JERZY (85) holding a violin case climbing off the 
           train. Awestruck, Artur quickly wends his way toward him. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Uncle Jerzy!

           Jerzy turns around, his eyes light up at the sight of Artur. 

                                 JERZY
                        Artur, I can’t believe it’s you! 

           With tears, they embrace. 

                                 JERZY (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a horrendous journey. But 
                        seeing you has made it all better. 
                        Tell me, why am I here? What 
                        happens here? 
           EXT. SS LIVING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Artur races past workshops, searching for someone. Inside the 
           barber shop he spots Stangl getting a shave. 

           INT. BARBER SHOP 

           Artur steps inside.  

                                 ARTUR
                        Sir, I’m sorry to interrupt your 
                        shave but I was hoping to speak 
                        with you about an urgent matter.

                                 STANGL
                        Go ahead. 

                                 ARTUR
                        My uncle, the one I’ve spoken to 
                        you about, you may remember? 

                                 STANGL
                        The one who you studied under.

                                 ARTUR
                        He’s arrived on a train from 
                        Germany. He’s to die in an hour.  

                                 STANGL
                        How old is he? 

                                 ARTUR
                        He’s 85, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        Maestro, you know it’s impossible 
                        to intervene. He’s too old to work. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I understand. I was hoping perhaps 
                        under special consideration I could 
                        take him to the infirmary?

           BARBER wipes his face, Stangl considers himself in a mirror. 

                                 STANGL
                        Excellent. I’ve always said Jewish 
                        barbers were the best. 

           Stangl hands barber a bottle of vodka from his pocket. 

                                 BARBER
                        You’re too kind, sir.
                                 STANGL
                        As far as your uncle, Artur, go and 
                        do what you think is best. Tell the 
                        guards I’ve given my permission.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           Artur watches a famished Jerzy finish a bowl of soup.  

                                 JERZY
                        This is the best food I’ve had in 
                        ages. I was sure we’d come to die. 
                        Imagine my surprise at seeing you. 
                        Do you get any chances to play? 

                                 ARTUR
                        I’ve put an orchestra together.

                                 JERZY
                        That’s wonderful, I brought my 
                        violin. I can join you sometime!

           Artur lowers his eyes. 

                                 JERZY (CONT’D)
                        And what about your brother? 

                                 ARTUR
                        I haven’t heard from him. It’s this 
                        crazy war. It’s madness.

           Jerzy peers up from his bowl of soup. 

                                 JERZY
                        Remember, Artur, no matter what 
                        they do to you, you’re an artist. 
                        There is more power in one note of 
                        music than in the whole of an army. 

           Artur takes Jerzy’s hand in his, kisses it. 

           INT. INFIRMARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Artur lays Jerzy down on a cot. Dr. Chorazycki stands by, a 
           syringe in his hand. 

                                 ARTUR
                        You’ve made a long trip. You can 
                        rest now, Uncle. 

                                 JERZY
                        Sleep would be wonderful, my boy. 
           Artur hold’s Jerzy’s hand. Dr. Chorazycki injects the syringe 
           into Jerzy’s arm. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI S
                        There now. You won’t feel a thing.

           Jerzy closes his eyes, Artur kisses him on the forehead. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - NIGHT

           A wedding party. An SS and his gleaming bride. Two dancers 
           finish an Italian Tarantella played by Artur’s band.

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           Galewski leads the men in a Passover Seder, he chants a 
           prayer over a humble feast of matzos and wine. 

           A GUARD pokes his head in.

                                 GUARD
                        Lights out, you’ve had your fun! 

           EXT. RECEPTION AREA/TREBLINKA TRAIN STATION - DAY 

           A trainload of gypsies arrives. Oskar rolls up with his 
           stroller as Artur smokes a cigarette. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Notice anything about this train?

           Artur shakes his head.

                                 OSKAR  (CONT’D)
                        They’re killing gypsies now. These 
                        Germans are almost finished. Most 
                        of the Jews in Poland are gone. 

           Oskar points to workers smoking cigarettes, lazing about. 

                                 OSKAR (CONT’D)
                        There’s hardly any work left to do. 
                        Once they finish the work here, 
                        they’ll destroy all the evidence, 
                        along with us. 

           EXT. BUG RIVER - DAY

           A sunny day. SS men swim and lounge by the water. 
           Artur wades in the water. Franz wades over to him. He begins 
           to pee in the water next to Artur. He quietly walks away. 

           Artur stretches out on the bank. An SS unwraps a loaf of 
           bread wrapped in newspaper. He tosses the paper, walks off. 

           Artur grabs the discarded paper. He reads the headlines, it 
           piques his interest. He folds it, hides it under his towel. 

           INT. SHOWER STALL - DAY 

           Artur basks in the warm water as he showers. The first time 
           he’s bathed since arriving at Treblinka. 

           EXT. SS LIVING QUARTERS - DAY 

           Artur sits on a bench, smokes a cigarette. He watches the boy 
           tending his geese. An SS walks up, gives the boy a chocolate 
           bar, pats him on the head. A GUARD approaches Artur. 

                                 GUARD
                        The commandant is summoning you. 

           INT. STANGL LIVING QUARTERS - DAY 

           Artur enters Stangl’s hut for the first time. They are 
           tastefully decorated. Oil paintings hang on walls, a forte 
           piano sits in a corner, shelves are lined with books.

           Stangl stands in front of a mirror, getting fitted in a new 
           white tunic by Samuel. Samuel steps back to examine his work. 

                                 STANGL
                        Excellent, this will do. Have 
                        another one made by next week. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Yes, Herr Commandant. 

                                 STANGL
                        I’ll have extra food rations sent 
                        to you for your work.

                                 SAMUEL
                        I appreciate it, sir. 

           He exits. Books on art, poetry, music line the shelves. 

           Hanging on the wall, Artur recognizes the oil painting Stangl 
           had admired from his work pile the day of their first 
           encounter in the sorting yard. 
                                 STANGL
                        Maestro, play us a record. 

           Artur picks a record, puts it on. The booming tenor voice of 
           Enrico Caruso singing “Una Furtiva Lagrima” fills the room. 

           Artur leafs through a book.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        What book is that?

                                 ARTUR
                        Goethe’s Faust. 

           Stangl nods in approval.

                                 STANGL
                        The most conflicted man in Western 
                        literature. His descent into 
                        darkness, wagering his soul to the 
                        wicked Mephistopheles. The 
                        consummate tragic hero. 

           Stangl settles on an armchair, listens to Caruso. Artur 
           savors the moment, he’s miles away from death and torture.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Let me show you the reason I 
                        summoned you. An officer of mine 
                        just returned from a meeting in 
                        Lublin. He came across something 
                        that may interest you. 

           Stangl replaces Caruso with a tango. Artur's jaw drops.

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                             (reading album cover)
                        Gold and Petersburski Orchestra 
                        play tango. This is you, is it not? 

           Artur’s voice shakes with joy. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Yes, Herr commandant. It’s been 
                        ages since I’ve heard it. 

           Stangl taps his foot to the music. Artur loses himself in the 
           music, he takes a seat, he allows himself a smile until --

           BLAST!

           The room shakes from an EXPLOSION. Stangl dashes out. 
           INT. ARTILLERY HUT 

           Panicked guards run in and grab rifles. 

           EXT. MAIN CAMP 

           Guards run to undressing barracks - the site of the blast. 

           INT. UNDRESSING BARRACKS 

           The dead body of a Ukrainian guard lays on the ground. 
           Terrified victims newly arrived are corralled away. 

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        All workers must enter barracks 
                        immediately!

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS 

           Workers are ushered inside. DOORS are LOCKED. 

                                 SAMUEL 
                        Sounded like a grenade went off. 
                        Was it one of our guys? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        I don’t see how. None of us have 
                        access to the artillery closet.  

           Dr. Chorazycki and Artur enter excitedly. 

                                 ZELOMIR 
                        Doctor, what’s the news?

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        I just came from tending to one of 
                        the Ukrainians injured in the 
                        blast. I have exciting news! There 
                        was an uprising in the ghetto!

                                 GALEWSKI
                        What?

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        In Warsaw! It began in April. 
                        People are fighting back! 
                        Apparently there were Nazi 
                        casualties. Out of desperation, the 
                        Germans began burning the ghetto 
                        house by house, driving people to 
                        leap from their burning homes.

                        They tell me that women and 
                        children joined the fight. The 
                        explosion today was a grenade 
                        detonated by one of the captured 
                        rebels from the uprising. He snuck 
                        the grenade into the train with 
                        him. He had it hidden in his coat. 
                        He pulled the pin, hurled the 
                        grenade at the receiving guards, 
                        injuring two and killing one. 

                                  ARTUR
                        Jews are fighting back! These 
                        Germans are afraid!

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Word is that the rebellion was so 
                        strong the Nazis had to retreat. 
                        They were caught totally off-guard!

                                 ARTUR
                        Our own Polish Jews killing Nazis!  

                                 SAMUEL
                        I was in the officer’s area when 
                        the grenade exploded. You should 
                        have seen it! The most frightened 
                        were the Germans. I saw with my own 
                        eyes SS flee the scene. These 
                        monsters, always so terrifying and 
                        mighty looking, scurried from the 
                        yard like snivelling dogs! 

                                 ARTUR
                        We can have a go at them. If our 
                        brothers and sisters can resist in 
                        the ghetto, so can we. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        We should wait. 

                                 ARTUR
                        But the time is right! 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Now that word is out about Jews 
                        fighting, they’ll be watching us. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        He’s right. Since the rebellion in 
                        Warsaw they’re sending fewer Jews 
                        here, they’re fearful of similar 
                        rebellions in the camp.
                                 ZELOMIR
                        But with less work to do they’ll 
                        start killing us soon. Everyday the 
                        transports are fewer. 

           INT. BEER GARDEN - NIGHT 

           A lively party. A group of gypsy musicians PLAY TRADITIONAL 
           MUSIC along with Artur. SS dance with women from the brothel. 

           EXT. BEER GARDEN - LATER 

           A drunken Artur staggers out. He vomits, slumps to the 
           ground. He wipes his mouth, staggers towards his hut.

           THREE SHADOWY FIGURES spring up from a dark corner, they grab 
           Artur and shove him to the ground. They’re fellow workers we 
           do not recognize. They beat Artur mercilessly.  

                                 VOICE 1
                        Did you enjoy your meal, traitor? 

                                 ARTUR
                        No, please, stop!

                                 VOICE 2
                        Go to hell Nazi sympathizer!

                                 VOICE 3
                        Give our regards to the commandant!

           The assailants stop, one spits at him, they steal away, 
           leaving Artur sprawled on the ground, writhing in pain. 

           INT. INFIRMARY - DAY 

           Battered and bloody, Artur lays on an examination table. Dr. 
           Chorazycki dresses his wounds. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        You have some minor fractures and 
                        bruising. You’ll be fine. Don’t 
                        worry, I have orders from the White 
                        Death himself to give you any 
                        medical attention you need. You’ve 
                        done well gaining their trust.

                                 ARTUR
                        I’ve done nothing but play my 
                        music. Day in, day out I play for 
                        condemned people and murderers.
           Dr. Chorazycki helps Artur off the table. He crouches down, 
           ties Artur’s shoes for him.  

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        I won’t let you give up, Artur.

           Suddenly -- an enraged Franz EXPLODES through the DOOR.

                                 FRANZ
                        Chorazycki! You’re being summoned 
                        for questioning! 

           Franz grabs Dr. Chorazycki, begins to beat him. Dr. 
           Chorazycki lunges at him with a surgical knife.  

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        So you’ve been stealing have you?

           Frantic, Dr. Chorazycki pulls out a cyanide capsule, throws 
           it in his mouth, bites down on it. 

           The cyanide begins to take effect, Dr. Chorazycki falls to 
           the ground. Franz kicks him in the stomach. Gasping for air, 
           Dr. Chorazycki lifts his head. 

                                 DR. CHORAZYCKI
                        Men! Get back at them! Kill them!

           His head lolls, his body slackens, he collapses. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Get up you dirty dog! 

           Franz pries his mouth open to retrieve the cyanide capsule 
           but it’s too late. He kicks him viciously in the stomach. 

           EXT. LINEUP YARD - DAY 

           Anguished workers watch Franz hover over Dr. Chorazycki, his 
           foot resting on the dead doctor.

                                 FRANZ
                        Goldjuden out! 

           Three goldjuden workers are dragged out of line by guards, 
           they are SHOT on the spot.

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        I was informed by Strebel that your 
                        beloved physician here was 
                        stealing. Anyone caught doing this 
                        will be shot immediately.
           Franz kicks Dr. Chorazycki’s lifeless body. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Take this shit out of my sight!

           In tears, Artur watches as his friend’s body is carted off.  

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           On his empty bunk lay the dead doctor’s stethoscope, eye 
           glasses and white armband. Sullen members of the Planning 
           Committee bow their heads as Galewski prays. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Just as there are stars who's light 
                        reaches Earth long after they have 
                        fallen apart, there are people 
                        who's remembrance lights this world 
                        long after they have passed...

           INT. ARTUR’S HUT - NIGHT 

           A despondent Artur reaches under his mattress, pulls out the 
           cyanide capsule given to him by Dr. Chorazycki. With tears in 
           his eyes, he slips on his brother’s woolen blazer. 

           He begins to pry open the capsule until a KNOCK stops him. 
           Artur slips the capsule into his coat, answers the door.

                                 GUARD
                        Come with me.

           EXT. BROTHEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Anitza stands out front smoking cigarettes. 

                                 GUARD
                        Special orders from the commandant.  

           Anitza stamps out her cigarette, ushers Artur inside. 

           INT. ANITZA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT  

           A feminine, cozy room with a CRACKLY FIRE, silk curtains, a 
           thick rug. Artur stands in the corner, Anitza is on her bed.

                                 ANITZA
                        You’re the only Jew I’ve seen in 
                        here. They must really like you. 
           Artur’s eyes drop. She fidgets with her Star of David. 

                                 ARTUR
                        What is that around your neck?

                                 ANITZA
                        A birthday present from my father 
                        before he was killed by Gestapo 
                        thugs. He was a member of the ZOB. 
                        The Jewish Fighting Organization. 
                        When I wear it I feel him with me. 

           She kisses the pendant. Artur glances at his brother’s coat. 

                                 ANITZA (CONT’D)
                        I take it off when there’s an SS 
                        visiting. It’s funny. In here they 
                        don’t act like monsters. They’re 
                        courteous, well-mannered gentlemen. 
                        They bring me champagne, chocolate, 
                        sometimes jewelry. All stolen. 
                        There’s a law called the Race and 
                        Resettlement Act that says sleeping 
                        with a Jew is illegal. They don’t 
                        concern themselves with that in 
                        here. Hypocrites.  

                                 ARTUR
                        What did you do before the war?

           She strolls over to the window, gazes out. 

                                 ANITZA
                        I was about to begin my second year 
                        at the University of Krakow, in the 
                        humanities department. I wanted to 
                        become a professor of literature. 
                        My focus was Goethe. My girlfriends 
                        and I were coming back from 
                        vacation at the Narew River, all 
                        suntanned and worry-free. The next 
                        morning I wake up and it was as if 
                        my people had betrayed me. There 
                        were Nazi flags flying everywhere. 
                        On churches, hospitals, schools. 
                        Even at our university. Everyone 
                        had gone insane. The first person 
                        to go was my brother. They said he 
                        was going to work. He promised us a 
                        letter. That letter never came. My 
                        mother didn’t fix his bed for 
                        weeks. She didn’t want to lose the 
                        imprint of his head on the pillow.

                        She’d sit in a corner of the attic 
                        for hours just smelling his pillow.

           Anitza pokes at the fire. 

                                 ANITZA (CONT’D)
                        Take off your coat. It’s hot.

           Artur slips off his blazer, a small OBJECT LANDS on the 
           floor. Curious, Anitza picks it up -- the cyanide capsule.

                                 ANITZA (CONT’D)
                        Who’s this for?   

                                 ARTUR
                        Death can be your best friend when 
                        it delivers you from suffering. 

           Anitza sets it on the night stand. 

                                 ANITZA
                        Your music means too much to me. I 
                        won’t let you do it. 

           She’s stern but not unkind. Artur stands to leave. 

                                 ANITZA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go. Please stay a little 
                        longer. If I have you in here, no 
                        one else will come in. 

           She takes his hand, lays him on the bed, he wraps his arms 
           around her, holds her close. Anitza opens her book. 

                                 ANITZA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll read to you. This is my 
                        favorite poem by Goethe. 

           Artur closes his eyes, listens to her read. 

                                 ANITZA (CONT’D)
                        Let man be noble, generous and 
                        good, for that alone distinguishes 
                        him from all the living beings...

           INT. ANITZA’S BEDROOM - MORNING 

           Artur awakens, the fire has gone out. He looks down at Anitza 
           -- her eyes are open, she lays lifeless, grey, stiff. Artur 
           finds the empty cyanide capsule in her hand.
           EXT. BROTHEL - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER 

           A sullen Artur trudges out. He passes the boy with his flock 
           of geese. A drunken SS staggers up to the boy, SHOOTS him in 
           the head. Heartbroken, Artur stalks off. 

           Franz sees Artur leaving the brothel, he follows him. 

           INT. ARTUR’S HUT

           Artur enters, Franz bursts in after him. 

                                 FRANZ
                        I saw where you were coming from, 
                        arrogant piece of shit. You think 
                        you own this camp don’t you? 

           Franz throws his violin at him, drags him out. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Come with me. You have a new job 
                        detail, maestro. 

           EXT. PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the flower-lined path to the extermination area.  

                                 FRANZ
                        Would you like to see your people 
                        get ‘disinfected’ maestro? 

           EXT. PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Franz drags Artur down the path. They come out on a clearing -
           - Artur freezes just as Anitza’s mother had -- his eyes land 
           on something above him -- 

           -- a ritual Jewish bath house. 

           Concrete steps lined with potted flowers lead to large, 
           ornate doors. At the very top of the building -- 

           -- an immense, yellow Star of David. Artur is stunned.

           Doors open, terrified victims are squeezed inside by barking 
           guards who jab at their naked bodies with bayonets.

           Bath attendants in black armbands stand at the entrance.  

                                 BATH ATTENDANT
                        Hurry! Before the water gets cold!
           Sign at entrance: TO SHOWERS. Airtight steel DOORS are SHUT. 

           Franz drags Artur around the corner -- two Russian T34 tanks 
           are connected to the building by a thick tube. 

           Franz OPENS a side DOOR, shoves Artur inside.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 

           A long, narrow corridor. On either side are gas chambers. 
           Franz grabs the back of Artur’s head, forces him to watch 
           through a grimy observation slit into one of the chambers. 

           Inside the chamber are features of a traditional Jewish 
           bathhouse -- towels on racks, white tiled walls, orange 
           terracotta tiles on the floor with Stars of David. 

           A sign posted on the wall -- CLEANLINESS IS MANDATORY. DO NOT 
           FORGET TO WASH HANDS. On the ceiling are long metal pipes 
           that end at shower heads. 

           A Jewish ceremonial curtain from a synagogue has words 
           inscribed on it in Hebrew. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Read that!

                                 ARTUR
                             (reading)
                        This is the gateway to God, 
                        righteous men will pass through it.

           DOORS to the chamber OPEN. Workers lead terrified victims 
           inside. Weeping mothers clutch wailing babies to their 
           breasts. Hundreds of victims are squeezed in. 

           Guards SLAM the airtight DOOR, sealing the room. The 
           screaming intensifies. People claw at the walls, climb on top 
           of each other. Children are trampled.

           A WORKER gives a signal. 

                                 WORKER
                        Turn on water!

           Tanks turn on, ENGINES ROAR. 

           From the shower heads, carbon monoxide is funneled from the 
           tanks and pumped into the chamber. Victims gasp and clutch at 
           their throats as they choke to death.

           Artur tears his eyes away. Franz pushes a gun into his back. 
                                 FRANZ
                        Watch! 

           After a few moments, chambers falls silent. The screaming 
           stops, dead bodies collapse on top of each other. 

                                 WORKER
                        Turn off, all asleep!

           ROARING of tank ENGINES cease. 

           Guards OPEN STEEL DOORS at the opposite end. Workers swiftly 
           remove bloated bodies, load them onto carts, wheel them away. 
           A guard spots a body twitching, he SHOOTS it. 

           Workers enter to clean the chamber. Franz drags Artur away.

           EXT. CREMATION PIT - CONTINUOUS

           Artur stumbles out. A fiery volcanic pit devours dead bodies 
           of those just gassed. The pyre CRACKLES as workers toss in 
           corpses. Thick, black smoke rises up. 

           “Dentists” pry open corpse mouths, pull out gold fillings  
           with forceps, toss them into suitcases full of gold teeth. 

           Workers with soot-black faces pitch wood into the pit and 
           douse the blaze with gasoline. 

           Ashes are shoveled into peasants’ horse drawn wagons who then 
           drive off toward camp exit.

           Artur’s eyes follow the thick black smoke rising into the 
           air, guilt consumes him, stricken, he weeps.

           Tormented, Artur’s eye catches something -- standing in front 
           of the blazing pyre, smiling into the inferno with sadistic 
           satisfaction is Stangl. Flickering flames illuminate his face 
           -- he looks like Satan. 

                                 FRANZ 
                        You have your masterpiece, maestro. 
                        As you can see, he has his.

           This crushes Artur. Franz drags him to the gas chamber, 
           leaves him right under the Star of David. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Play! 

           Artur PLAYS his VIOLIN as a new batch of terrified victims 
           are shoved into the gas chamber. Tears roll down his face. 
           INT. BEER GARDEN - NIGHT 

           A lavish party. Birthday cake. Colorful decorations. A 
           sumptuous buffet. Men and women dance. SS plays an accordion.

                                 SS GUARD
                        Speech from the birthday boy!

           SS men lift their glasses, toast to Artur.   

                                 ARTUR
                             (trying to sound sincere)
                        Thank you for this wonderful 
                        birthday celebration. Especially to 
                        Commandant Stangl a sincere thanks!

           EXT. LINE-UP YARD - DAY 

           Roll call. Artur finishes “Fester Schritt”, workers sing 
           along. Franz steps up with the master list in hand. 

                                 FRANZ
                        Attention workers. When I call your 
                        name, line up behind me. 

           Workers shoot nervous glances. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        Bachner Lilly, Bernstein Siefried, 
                        Birnbaum Petr, Bodnik Leibish...

           These workers are led away at gun point. 

                                 FRANZ (CONT’D)
                        ...Kot Berl, Lewin Ora, Chaim...

           Galewski lowers his eyes, shakes his head. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Where did they take those people?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        To be exterminated. It’s finally 
                        happening. They’re killing workers. 

           INT. ARTUR’S HUT - DAY 

           Galvanized, Artur grabs the newspaper he stole at the Bug 
           River. With resolve, he hides it inside his wool blazer. 
           EXT. SHOE SHINE STATION - DAY  

           Benyamin polishes Artur’s shoes, who pulls out the newspaper, 
           stuffs it inside the shoe shine kit. Artur points to 
           Galewski, Benyamin nods in understanding. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Benyamin slinks over to Galewski, hands him the newspaper. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Benyamin, who gave this to you? 

           Benyamin moves his arms as if playing violin.

                                 TOMASZ
                        Artur.

           Galewski reads it, his eyes widen, his expression brightens.

                                 OSKAR 
                        What is it? 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        They’re advancing! 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Who?

                                 GALEWSKI
                        The Russians! Germany lost 
                        Stalingrad! Completely slaughtered 
                        in Siberia! They sustained heavy 
                        losses on the Eastern front. The 
                        British are bombing German cities! 
                        Major losses in Africa! With the 
                        Germans fighting on two fronts 
                        they’re losing the war!

                                 SAMUEL
                        That means we’ll be liberated! This 
                        war is sure to end in a few months!

                                 TOMASZ
                        We can’t wait that long. With the 
                        Nazis losing, they’re going to 
                        liquidate this place, and us in it. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        Shouldn’t we wait it out until the 
                        allies or the Russians come?
                                 SAMUEL
                        Russians? They’re just as bad. They 
                        hate Jews.

                                 LIEBESKIND
                        Many of the SS are on leave. We 
                        should do this now. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        But how do we gain access to 
                        weapons in the armory?

           Galewski turns to Liebeskind.

           EXT. ARMORY - DAY 

           Oskar sidles up pushing his stroller. He jabs a small metal 
           fragment into the LOCK, BREAKING IT. He slinks away unseen. 

           INT. LIEBESKIND’S LOCKSMITH HUT - DAY

           Two Ukrainian GUARDS enter holding the armory door. 

                                 GUARD
                        The lock on this door is broken, we 
                        need it repaired. 

                                 LIEBESKIND
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 GUARD
                        Hurry it up.

           INT. LIEBESKIND’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

           Liebeskind fashions a spare key for the door to the armory. 
           He finishes, tests it on the lock -- it works. He quietly 
           slips the new key into his pocket. Guards enter. 

                                 GUARD
                        Is the lock finished? 

                                 LIEBESKIND
                        Yes. You can test it if you’d like. 

           The guard shoves Liebeskind away. He pulls the key out of his 
           pocket, slips it into the new keyhole -- it works. 
           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           The barracks buzzes with excited whispers. Galewski leads the 
           Planning Committee in one last meeting, which has swelled to 
           include many new members.

           Liebeskind enters, quietly hands Galewski the new key.

           INT. SS MESS HALL - SAME TIME

           BUGLE BLOWS. 

           INT. PRISONER BARRACKS 

           Dressed and ready, workers wait in silence for doors to open. 

           INT. ARTUR’S HUT - DAWN 

           Artur plays his violin. Markus enters, begins to sweep. 

                                 MARKUS
                        Conductor, today is the day. 

           Artur stops playing. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Today?

           EXT. LINEUP YARD - DAWN 

           Artur leads the prisoners in morning roll call with the usual 
           “Fester Schritt”. Their spirits high, prisoners sing 
           especially loud and shoot one another furtive smiles. Franz 
           makes his way down the line. MUSIC ends. 

                                 FRANZ 
                        Released for duty! 
           EXT. RECEPTION AREA/TRAIN STATION - DAY 

           Artur’s orchestra plays Beethoven as a trainload of 
           passengers disembark. The usual process ensues. 

                                 LOUDSPEAKER
                        Attention Warsaw Jews! You are in a

           EXT. PATH TO EXTERMINATION AREA - DAY 

           Zelomir makes his way down the path, trundles a cart of 
           lumber. He approaches two workers with black armbands. 

                                 ZELOMIR
                        Tell the others. End of the world 
                        today. Signal at 1 o’clock. 

           Without looking up, workers nod.  

           INT. SS GUARD HUT - DAY 

           Markus mops, an SS sits at a table counting money. 

                                 MARKUS 
                        Should I take your uniforms to the 
                        laundress, sir? 

                                 SS GUARD
                        No, laundry day is Sunday. 

                                 MARKUS
                        They’re slightly stained, sir.

           SS nods absently, continues counting his money.

           INT. METAL SHOP HUT - DAY 

           Blacksmith sharpens a metal file into a dagger. We notice a 
           pile of newly sharpened weapons hidden under a table. 

           Oskar enters, quickly grabs the weapons, hides them in his 
           stroller, steals away unseen.

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY 

           Camp BUTCHER approaches a GUARD. 
                                 BUTCHER
                        Sir, may I have permission to 
                        sharpen this bag of carving knives?

                                 GUARD
                        Not now. 

                                 BUTCHER
                        We’re receiving a horse today. I 
                        have to carve it and freeze it 
                        before it goes bad. I can save you 
                        a piece if you’d like.

           The guard peeks in his sack. 

                                 GUARD

                        Galewski will pick these up.

           INT. ARTUR’S HUT - DAY 

           Artur spots Samuel walking by. Artur pokes his head out, 
           motions for Samuel to come in. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Is it true about today?

           Samuel nods.

                                 ARTUR (CONT’D)
                        Why wasn’t I told?

                                 SAMUEL
                        They say you’re too close to the 
                        White Death and can’t be trusted. 

                                 ARTUR
                        And you, Samuel? What do you say?

           Samuel studies Artur’s face. 
                                 SAMUEL
                        I came to Treblinka with 6,000 
                        other Jews on my train. I’m the 
                        only one alive off that transport. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I went into the pit of hell, 
                        Samuel. Satan himself couldn’t 
                        create a hell worse than those 
                        chambers. I’m as guilty as them. 
                        There’s no humanity left in me. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        If you’re guilty, I am too. I built 
                        those chambers with my own hands.   

           Artur slips off his brother’s wool blazer. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Take this. It was my pillow in the 
                        summer. On winter nights it kept me 
                        warm. It protected me in beatings. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Why are you giving this to me?

                                 ARTUR
                        Because you’ll make it.
                        You look Aryan, you have a good 
                        accent. Nothing about you gives you 
                        away as a Jew. You’ll be a witness.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Who’ll believe me? They’ll say I’m 
                        mad, they’ll put me in an asylum. 
                        Can anyone believe this horror 
                        unless they live it? I can’t 
                        believe it myself. 

           Artur pulls out his manuscript. He puts it in Samuel’s hand. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        Your music. 

                                 ARTUR
                        It’s our story. Told in six 
                        movements. Our arrival, our hunger, 
                        our despair. It’s documentation, a 
                        living archive.

           Artur lays down on his bed. Samuel puts on the blazer, slips 
           the manuscript in the coat pocket. He makes for the door and 
           opens it. He hesitates, his hand rests on the doorknob. 
                                 SAMUEL
                        Do you remember when I told you 
                        about Ingrid and I in our garden, 
                        listening to the radio? 

           Artur sits up, his curiosity piqued at the mention of Ingrid. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        There’s one thing I didn’t tell 
                        you. As you know, your songs would 
                        frequently play on that popular 
                        Warsaw station everyone listened 
                        to. Whenever you came on, I’d turn 
                        to look at Ingrid. Every time she’d 
                        hear one of your songs, she’d stop 
                        working. Then she’d sit quietly, 
                        close her eyes, listen to your 
                        music, as if she were savoring 
                        every note. Then I would catch her 
                        secretly wipe away a furtive tear 
                        from her cheek. She never caught on 
                        that I was watching her.

           Samuel opens the door, quietly slips out. 

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY 

           Butcher empties his sack of sharpened knives. He hides them 
           under a large beef flank.  

           INT. LAUNDRY - DAY 

           Laundress hands Galewski the sack with the SS uniforms. He 
           stashes it in his wheelbarrow under building materials. 

           EXT. ARSENAL HUT - DAY 

           Galewski tries to enter the arsenal hut but an SS stops to 
           light a cigarette. Tomasz and Oskar walk up to distract him.  

                                 SS GUARD
                        Why are you standing around? 

                                 OSKAR 
                        My friend and I just made a bet. 
                        Maybe you can help us out. What 
                        kind of prostitute is more likely 
                        to give you syphilis? A blonde or a 
                        brunette? My friend says brunettes. 
                                 SS GUARD
                        No, no! Blondes of course!

           They laugh. 

                                 OSKAR 
                        How about a cigarette? 

           SS digs in his pocket. With his attention diverted, Galewski 
           sidles into the arsenal hut unseen. 

           INT. ARSENAL HUT 

           Galewski pulls out an SS uniform from the laundry sack, puts 
           it on. Samuel rushes in.

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Quickly, put this on. 

           Samuel slips the SS jacket over Artur’s blazer.

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        Quiet, the slightest rustle can be 
                        heard by the guard next door. 

           Galewski plucks the arsenal key from his pocket, unlocks the 
           closet, starts removing grenades, pistols, rifles. 

           Oskar enters. Galewski and Samuel swiftly fill his stroller 
           with weapons. Oskar casually strolls out, whistling. 

           INT. TOMASZ’S STUDIO - DAY 

           Oskar enters, hands Tomasz a pistol, steals away. 

           EXT. LATRINE - DAY

           Oskar opens the door to the latrine, sets weapons down, shuts 
           the door. To the worker clad in rabbi vestments -- 

                                 OSKAR 
                        End of the world. Signal at 1.

           KNOCK at the window. A WORKER with a wheelbarrow peers in. 
           Galewski opens the window, hands the worker rifles and 
           pistols. He hides them in his wheelbarrow.  

           Samuel stuffs grenades in a worker’s burlap sack. 

           EXT. SS LIVING QUARTERS - DAY 

           Artur sits on the bench, smoking in his usual spot. He gazes 
           at the geese without their little boy. Stangl ambles up. 

                                 STANGL 
                        Maestro. Come, let’s walk to lunch. 
                        I have some news for you. 

           They stroll past workers who glare at Artur. 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you’ve heard about recent 
                        losses Germany has sustained? I’m 
                        not concerned. There’s a story I 
                        like to tell that proves the Third 
                        Reich is destined to endure. It 
                        took place in World War I. There 
                        was a sharp shooter from France. 
                        His name slips my mind. Deep in the 
                        Belgium forest this sharp shooter 
                        had hidden for days, killing every 
                        German in sight. This man was 
                        untouchable, he’d reached mythic 
                        proportions. German soldiers feared 
                        him. One day while he was resting, 
                        what does he see? A lonely, dazed 
                        German soldier, an infantryman for 
                        the 16th Bavarian Reserve. The 
                        Frenchman lifts his rifle, aims it 
                        at the German, point blank. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        Then, as if someone had whispered 
                        into his ear, the German looks up, 
                        sees that he’s in the cross hairs 
                        of this dreaded sharp shooter. What 
                        happens next? Would you believe the 
                        Frenchman lowers his rifle! He lets 
                        the German live! Who was this 
                        soldier? This lowly infantryman 
                        whose life for reasons unknown have 
                        been saved when so many others just 
                        like him were killed? Our fuhrer! 
                        He was later promoted to lance 
                        corporal and received two iron 
                        crosses. He once captured four 
                        French soldiers single-handedly. 
                        This story proves that our fuhrer 
                        was saved from certain death for a 
                        higher purpose. Be proud, Artur, 
                        that you’ve served him in such an 
                        exemplary capacity.

           Artur nods. 

                                 STANGL (CONT’D)
                        So I’ve spoken to my superiors with 
                        regards to your services to the 
                        Reich. I’ve secured you sanctuary 
                        when Germany wins the war. It’s a 
                        special entitlement given to very 
                        few people in your situation. 

                                 ARTUR
                        I don’t know how to thank you, sir. 

                                 STANGL
                        Let’s talk specifics after lunch. 

           EXT. SHOE SHINE STATION - DAY 

           Benyamin shines an SS’ boots. SS flicks a cigarette, it lands 
           in the shoe shine kit full of grenades. Benyamin frantically 
           plucks the smoldering cigarette as the SS laughs at him. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - DAY 

           Artur and his orchestra settle, SS men sit down to eat.  

           INT. ARSENAL HUT - DAY 

           Samuel fills a disinfectant cannister with gasoline. He hands 
           the cannister to a WORKER. 
                                 SAMUEL 
                        Hit every building you can reach. 
                        At the signal, throw the match. 

                                 WORKER 
                        With joy, brother. 

           Samuel looks at the clock -- 12 o’clock -- one hour left.

           INT. SS HUT - DAY 

           A servant boy quietly slides open a drawer. He draws out a 
           pistol, stuffs it in his pocket. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - DAY 

           Artur’s orchestra begins the lunch performance. Stangl and 
           his men eat with relaxed abandon. 

           EXT. WORK AREA - DAY 

           Masons repair a wall. A WORKER pushing a cart plods up.

                        End of the world. Signal at 1. 

           The masons nod silently. The worker removes rifles from his 
           cart, hides them under a pile of stones. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL - DAY 

           Artur finishes a JAZZ piece, checks his watch -- 12:15. 

           INT. ARSENAL HUT - SAME TIME 

           Without warning, an SS enters, spots Samuel and Galewski in 
           the SS uniforms. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        What the hell is going on in here? 

           SS goes for his whistle, Samuel slits his throat. Galewski 
           tosses a blanket over the body and drags it under a table.

           INT. SS MESS HALL - DAY 

           Officers are served coffee. Artur begins another SONG.   
           INT. ARSENAL HUT - DAY 

           Samuel grabs a pistol, stuffs it in his pocket. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        I need to cut the phone lines. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Hurry. 

           Samuel finds Benyamin frantically trying to bar an SS from 
           entering the arsenal hut, the SS pushes him away. 

                                 SS GUARD
                        Get away from me, you mute.  

           The guard enters. 

                                 SS GUARD (CONT’D)
                        I heard a noise in here. 

           His foot hits the dead body hidden under the blanket. 

                                 SS GUARD (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

           He leans down to pull the blanket off. Samuel jumps out, 
           SHOOTS the guard in the head. The GUNSHOT rings out all over 
           camp -- workers freeze -- waiting for the second shot. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Give the signal! We must do it now!

                                 SAMUEL
                        But I haven’t cut the phone lines!

                                 GALEWSKI
                        There’s no time! Give the signal!

           Samuel SHOOTS his PISTOL into the air.

           EXT. MAIN CAMP 

           Workers stop working, quickly grab their weapons, dash to the 
           exit. Guards SHOOT at workers charging the gates. 

           A full-blown revolt is on. GRENADES detonate, GUNSHOTS, 
           MACHINE GUN FIRE, EXPLOSIONS thunder from all sides. 

           A worker drops his disinfectant cannister, lights a match 
           lobs it at a wooden hut, it alights. He runs to another hut, 
           throws a match -- the camp is engulfed in flames. 
           A worker drops a bucket of potatoes pulls out a knife, slits 
           the throat of an SS. 

           Guards GUN down workers from watchtowers. Benyamin lobs a 
           grenade from his shoe shine kit at a watchtower.  

           The worker in rabbi clothing opens the door to the latrine, 
           grabs a rifle and begins firing. 

           INT. SORTING BARRACKS

           Workers grab their weapons.  

           INT. KITCHEN 

           Cooks grab knives and run out. 

           INT. POTATO HUT

           Workers drop their buckets, lob grenades at guards. 

           EXT. PRISONER BARRACKS 

           Samuel finds workers cowering with fear. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Come out! Come out and fight!

           EXT. BUG RIVER  

           Franz and other SS hear the EXPLOSIONS, they run toward camp. 

           INT. SS MESS HALL 

           Stangl and his men run out with pistols drawn. Artur turns to 
           his musicians. 

                                 ARTUR
                        Run! Drop your instruments! Go!

                                 CELLIST
                        What about you? 

                                 ARTUR
                        Get out! 

           Artur’s men run off. Clutching his violin, Artur makes his 
           way toward the main office.  
           INT. MAIN OFFICE

           Artur bursts in, runs to the LOUDSPEAKER, SWITCHES it on. 

           EXT. CAMP PHONE 

           A furious Stangl on the phone --

                                 STANGL
                        Set up roadblocks immediately! 

           Stangl is interrupted by music coming from the LOUDSPEAKER -- 

           ARTUR’s VIOLIN. 

           Artur plays the piece he composed for Himmler. He now plays 
           it for his fellow Jews. His MUSIC fills the air, infusing the 
           workers with courage to fight. 

           Enraged, Stangl SLAMS the phone, storms toward his office. 

           INT. GAS CHAMBER

           Weeping victims stand inside the gas chamber. The DOOR flies 
           open, workers yell at them to get out and fight. 

           Naked prisoners fly out, grab rocks and any weapon they can 
           get a hold of to fight guards, some fight with their fists. 

           EXT. FARM FIELD

           Peasant farmers working the land hear the faint sound of 
           ARTUR’S VIOLIN amidst the chaos coming from camp.  

           We pan across camp to see that most buildings are in flames. 

           EXT. BARBED WIRE FENCE

           Hundreds charge the fence, cut through it with wire cutters. 
           Some tear it down with bare hands. Some escape, many are 
           GUNNED down. 

           The iron Swastika atop the front gate crumbles. 

           EXT. FOREST

           Prisoners escape into the woods as they are fired on by 
           guards with MACHINE GUNS. Dead bodies lay everywhere.
           EXT. MAIN SQUARE

           Samuel pockets a pistol and grabs an axe. He runs toward the 
           forest. Along the way he spots Oskar’s overturned stroller 
           laying on the ground next to Oskar’s dead body. 

           Samuel makes a dash toward the exit, passing dead bodies of 
           workers and guards. 

           INT. MAIN OFFICE

           Stangl explodes inside. Artur plays his violin.

                                 STANGL
                        Stop that immediately! 

           Eyes closed, Artur ignores him, defiantly continues PLAYING. 

           Stangl lifts his pistol presses it to Artur’s temple - BLAST! 

           BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT 

           EXT. SAMUEL’S GARDEN - DAY

           A gorgeous sunny day. A small red RADIO plays JAZZ MUSIC on a 
           window sill with flower curtains billowing in the breeze. 

           JAZZ SONG ends.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Up next on Polish Radio we have a 
                        sweet shimmy called “Rose Marie”, 
                        by Warsaw’s own Artur Gold!

           We move away from the RADIO, past Samuel in his lounge chair, 
           smoking a pipe, reading the newspaper. He looks up from his 
           paper, turns his head. We follow his gaze to a woman kneeling 
           down, troweling in her garden, facing away from us. She 
           pauses, gazes up at the little red radio on the windowsill 
           and listens to Artur’s music. She shifts her head slightly. A 
           small tear rolls down her cheek, she wipes it away. 

           BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT

           Artur’s body crumbles to the floor next to his violin. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Still clad in the SS uniform, Samuel sprints through trees 
           with BULLETS TEARING past. EXPLOSIONS RING out from behind.  
           He finds Galewski writhing in pain, his leg bleeding. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Samuel, I’ve been shot. 

           Samuel tries to lift Galewski. 

                                 GALEWSKI (CONT’D)
                        I can’t make it,free yourself! 
                        Finish me off. Please, I beg you.

                                 SAMUEL
                        But we’re so close! 

           Guards bear down on them. 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        Samuel, finish me off, in the name 
                        of He in whom you don’t believe! 

           Samuel takes Galewski’s face in his hand, turns it toward the 
           burning death camp. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        We did it! We burned that accursed 
                        hell! We burned it to the ground! 

                                 GALEWSKI
                        We did it, brother. 

           Samuel kisses Galewski on the forehead. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Shalom. Go home, now.

           German shouts ring out. Samuel pushes his pistol to 
           Galewski’s temple, pulls the TRIGGER. BLAST! Galewski’s body 
           goes limp. In tears, Samuel closes Galewski’s eyelids. 

           A guard slinks up from behind -- a TWIG SNAPS, Samuel spins 
           around -- the guard SHOOTS at him, grazing his arm. Samuel 
           raises his ax, buries it in the guard’s chest. 

           A jeep with a machine gun mounted to the top approaches, 
           Samuel draws back, hides behind dense brush until it passes. 

           Samuel darts off, peels off the SS uniform, revealing Artur’s 
           woolen blazer underneath. 

           Samuel looks back one last time at the burning camp, then 
           disappears into the woods. 
                                  SIXTH MOVEMENT:  FINIS

           EXT. POLAND - FARM FIELD - DAY 

           We are back with peasants working the land. A worker gazes up 
           at the sky -- in the distance, a light grey plume of smoke 
           rises above the trees -- it is no longer thick and black. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - FOREST - DAY 

           We are low to the ground, following the wheel of a car 
           rolling over the ashes of murdered Jews.

           We pan up, the wheel belongs to a jeep with two RUSSIAN 
           OFFICERS. 

           They roll past the farmers. One of the farmers glances up 
           from his work, he spots the Russians. He drops his hoe and 
           runs after the Russian jeep -- it’s Samuel.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Stop, please stop! 

           The jeep stops. Russians jump off, aim their guns at Samuel. 

                                  RUSSIAN 1
                        Stop! By order of the Russian Army!

           Samuel freezes, throws his hands up.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Don’t shoot! I’m an escaped 
                        prisoner from a German death camp. 
                        I’ve been in hiding with a farmer. 

                                 RUSSIAN 1
                        Death camp? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Just past these woods. Treblinka.

           He points to the thin grey plumes of smoke in the sky.

                                  RUSSIAN 1
                        We have no information of a camp. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        What?!

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        You’re Jewish? You don’t look like 
                        a Jew. 
                                  RUSSIAN 1
                        We just came from that area. 
                        There’s nothing. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        What? I was in that hell for a 
                        year! They gassed thousands of 
                        people!

           The Russians eye him with suspicion. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        Please, just let me show you!

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 

           Samuel rides in the back. The jeep crests a hill.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Just over this hill you’ll see--

           Samuel’s face drops to find --

           EXT. TREBLINKA SITE 

           -- nothing but an empty clearing. All that stands is a lonely 
           farmhouse. A stone chimney exhales thin, grey smoke. 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        See, there’s nothing. Let’s go.

           Shocked, Samuel jumps off the jeep, runs toward the clearing. 
           Purple lupines and fresh grass have been planted everywhere. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        But it was here, right here!  

           The soldiers follow him in the jeep as he runs. Samuel stops 
           in the middle of the clearing.

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        In this exact spot is where those 
                        godforsaken gas chambers stood! 

           He points to a spot a few meters away. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        And over there -- huge pits where 
                        thousands of bodies would burn. All 
                        night and day! 

           The Russians shake their heads at him. 
                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you see, they’re trying to 
                        hide what happened!

           He points to a patch of grass. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s where the train would stop, 
                        there was a platform here. 

           He runs over to a spot, in tears he falls to the ground. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        And here. This very spot is where 
                        he would play his music! 

           The Russians laugh. 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        Someone played music here? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        My friend Artur Gold. He had an 
                        orchestra and they played music! 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        Come on let’s go. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        No, please, wait! 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        There’s nothing. You have no proof!

           Samuel crumbles in anguish. Russians turn to leave just as a 
           FARMER in overalls emerges from the house smoking a pipe.

                                 FARMER
                        Can I help you with something? 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        Our friend here says there used to 
                        be a camp on this land. 

                                 FARMER
                        A camp? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Right where your house stands, 
                        there was a bakery there!

                                 FARMER
                        No, there’s no camp here.
           The Russians and the farmer laugh at Samuel. 

           Samuel approaches the farmer. He stops -- it’s Strebel, the 
           guard from Treblinka that traded with workers. A flash of 
           recognition on Strebel’s face as he locks eyes with Samuel. A 
           LITTLE GIRL runs out of the house. Samuel softens. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Sweet little girl, it’s been a year 
                        since I’ve seen a living child. 

           Strebel pulls her away.

                                 STREBEL
                        I’ve farmed this land for years. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        No, that house was built with the 
                        bricks from the gas chamber! I 
                        recognize those bricks! I built 
                        those chambers myself!

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        We apologize, but our friend seems 
                        to have problems with his memory. 

                                 STREBEL
                        Would there be anything else?

                                  RUSSIAN 1
                        No. We’ll be leaving now. 

           Strebel shoots Samuel a lingering glare. 

                                  RUSSIAN 1 (CONT’D)
                        Come along, that’s enough nonsense. 

           Samuel looks up at the sun -- the silent witness to all his 
           suffering. He weeps. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        I swear! It was in this very spot!

           He pounds the ground with clenched fists. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        Right here! This was a huge pyre 
                        where thousands of bodies burned! 
                        They ploughed the fields, planted 
                        grass! Don’t you see? 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        But there’s nothing to corroborate 
                        what you’re telling us!
                                 SAMUEL 
                        I’m telling you the truth! 

           Samuel stands, points to the perimeter of the clearing.  

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        This entire area was a camp, a 
                        whole town! We all had jobs! There 
                        were shoemakers, carpenters, cooks, 
                        laundry maids. I was personal 
                        tailor to the commandant! 

                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        And there were musicians, right? 
                        Playing music in a death camp. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        Yes! 

           The Russians laugh. A glimmer of hope flashes in Samuel’s 
           eyes. He peels off Artur’s brown woolen blazer. 

                                 SAMUEL (CONT’D)
                        Wait! I have proof right here! 

           With a pocketknife he cuts the inner lining of the blazer. 

                                  RUSSIAN 1
                        He’s mad. 

           Samuel pulls out Artur’s manuscript, hands it to Russian 1. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        He gave it to me the day of our 
                        revolt.

            Russian 1 leafs through the pages. 

                                  RUSSIAN 1
                        Music? 

                                 SAMUEL
                        It’s a concerto he wrote. When 
                        Himmler came to visit. 

                                 RUSSIAN 2
                        Heinrich Himmler?  

                                 SAMUEL
                        Yes! 

           The Russians exchange intrigued glances. Russian 2 STARTS the 
           ENGINE.
                                  RUSSIAN 2
                        Get in. 

           Hopeful, Samuel makes his way to the jeep. 

           From behind, he hears someone singing. He stops, turns to 
           face Strebel. He and his daughter sing a very familiar song -- 
           the anthem of Treblinka -- “Fester Schritt”. 

                                 STREBEL/DAUGHTER 
                             (singing)
                        ...the squads march to work. All 
                        that matters to us is Treblinka...

           Samuel and Strebel lock eyes. As he sings, Strebel picks up 
           his daughter, enters the farmhouse, SHUTS the DOOR.

           Samuel climbs on.

           We are low to the ground. The jeep’s WHEELS SKID. Tires rip 
           at the earth, shooting dirt from under the spinning wheel -- 
           revealing Anitza’s blue sapphire Star of David. It lays on 
           the ground, peaking out from under the dirt and ash. 

           EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY

           The Russian jeep winds down the dirt road, away from the thin 
           wisps of grey smoke rising up to the sky. It passes Polish 
           peasants stoically working the land.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           ON SCREEN: 

           Of the 300 prisoners that escaped during the revolt, less 
           than 100 survived the massive Nazi manhunt.

           In less than two years of operation, Treblinka was second 
           only to Auschwitz in deaths, with estimated tolls falling 
           between 700,000 to 925,000 victims. Exact numbers can not be 
           determined due to the extreme secrecy of the camp. 

           It was demolished in the Summer of 1944.

           In 1970 Franz Stangl was captured in Brazil and convicted. 
           While imprisoned, he died of a heart attack a year later.
