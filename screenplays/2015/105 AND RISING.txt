                                 The Fall of Saigon

                "The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising."

                  -- Code broadcast on Armed Forces Radio to signal 
                   the final evacuation of American civilians from 
                          South Vietnam on April 29, 1975.

                        Let’s be perfectly cold-blooded 
                        about it. I look at the tide of 
                        history out there, South Vietnam 
                        probably is never gonna survive 
                        anyway.

           SUPER: President Richard Nixon

                                 NIXON (V.O.)
                        Can we have a viable foreign policy 
                        if a year from now, or two years 
                        from now, North Vietnam gobbles up 
                        South Vietnam?

                                 KISSINGER (V.O.)
                        If Saigon’s collapse looks as if 
                        it’s the result of South Vietnamese 
                        incompetence. 

           SUPER: Secretary of State Henry Kissinger

                                 KISSINGER (V.O.)
                        If we now sell out in such a way 
                        that, say, in a three- to four-
                        month period, we have pushed 
                        President Thieu over the brink, it 
                        will worry everybody. So we’ve got 
                        to find some formula that holds the 
                        thing together a year or two... a 
                        decent interval after which no one 
                        will give a damn. Vietnam will be a 
                        backwater.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           INT. KISSINGER’S OFFICE, WAR BUILDING, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           A dossier with the photo clipped to the front lands in front 
           of SECRETARY OF STATE HENRY KISSINGER. Shrewd. Cynical. 
           Paranoid. With presidential attitude. If any one person 
           “owns” the Vietnam War, it is Kissinger.

           He sits at a table with a YOUNG AIDE and a SENIOR AIDE.

                                 YOUNG AIDE
                        He lost a son there in ‘68. Word is 
                        he never recovered.

                                 SENIOR AIDE
                        This is Saigon we’re talking about. 
                        We need someone stronger.

                                 KISSINGER
                        You’re both wrong. Martin is 
                        perfect.

                                 SENIOR AIDE
                        He’s old, desperate and emotionally 
                        compromised.

                                 KISSINGER
                        And that gives him his one 
                        superlative quality: he is the only 
                        man in America who wants to stay in 
                        Indochina longer than we do.
                             (to Young Aide)
                        Set up a meeting. Make him think 
                        he’s a long shot.

           INT. BEDROOM, MARTIN HOME, BETHESDA, MD - DAY

           The flesh-and-blood GRAHAM MARTIN (60’s), tall but slightly 
           bent, looks through his suits. Slightly nervous. 

           His WIFE comes in, selects a tie. 

           MINUTES LATER

           He checks himself in the mirror, fully dressed. She admires 
           how he looks. Makes a small adjustment to the tie. Places 
           palms on his lapels.

           She gives him an encouraging kiss: “Go get ‘em.”

           INT. KISSINGER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Martin prostrates himself before an impassive Kissinger and 
           the snot-nosed Young Aide.

                                 MARTIN
                        I get that our continued presence 
                        in Vietnam is unpopular. Even 
                        distasteful to some. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTIN (CONT'D)
                        But the war’s legacy remains in the 
                        balance; decisive actions must 
                        still be taken. I've made a career 
                        of foreign service. These are the 
                        moments why, and I can think of no 
                        better... no other... way left for 
                        me to honor my boy Glenn.

           Martin takes a large gulp of water: he's been monologuing. 
           Gauges Kissinger's reaction: quickly disappointed.

                                 KISSINGER
                        Let's not kid ourselves, Graham. 
                        This isn't like your ribbon-cutting 
                        work in Italy or Thailand. Whoever 
                        they approve, Congress will turn 
                        straight around and advocate to 
                        shut him down and drag him home.

                                 MARTIN
                        Casualty Officers have made 58,000 
                        next-of-kin calls in seven years. 
                        Not one to politicians on the Hill. 
                        They don’t appreciate what’s at 
                        stake. But I do.

                                 KISSINGER
                        Forgive this Secretary of State, 
                        his poor diplomacy skills. I'm 
                        saying: maybe you are too old for 
                        this fight.

           Young Aide turns up one side of his mouth in snide enjoyment.

                                 MARTIN
                        Sometimes age is an advantage. In 
                        my case, it means I’ll hold nothing 
                        back because I've got nothing else 
                        left to live for.

                                 KISSINGER
                        You understand, even if you perform 
                        admirably, the country will want 
                        someone to blame.

                                 MARTIN
                        If being the lightning rod for  
                        criticism of those actions takes a 
                        personal toll on me, well that 
                        pales in comparison to what was 
                        asked of Glenn and the others.

           Kissinger nods to his aides. “See. I told you.”
                                 KISSINGER
                        Thanks for coming by today Graham. 
                        I’ll get back to you.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           A series of NEWSREEL CLIPS featuring the “greatest 
           generation” of Newscasters: Cronkite, Brinkley, etc.:

           -- January 1973. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho sign a Cease Fire 
           Agreement in Paris. Nixon declares: “Peace with honor.”

           -- May 1973. Troops returning stateside. Total number of 
           troops remaining in Vietnam reduced from 200,000 to 100,000.

           -- June 1973. Graham Martin appointed the new Ambassador to 
           South Vietnam, replacing Ellsworth Bunker.

           -- June 1973. Congress passes the Case-Church Amendment 
           prohibiting US military activity in Southeast Asia.

           -- October 1973. Congress approves $1.1 Billion in aid to 
           South Vietnam. Down from $2.2 Billion the previous year.

           -- August 1974. Nixon resigns over Watergate. South Vietnam 
           loses their greatest advocate.

           -- September 1974. Total number of troops remaining in 
           Vietnam reduced from 100,000 to 50,000.

           -- October 1974. Congress approves only $700 million in aid 
           to South Vietnam.

           -- February 1975. North Vietnamese Army breaks the terms of 
           the peace accord by crossing the border unchallenged into 
           South Vietnam.

                                 EMBEDDED REPORTER (V.O.)
                             (bombastic)
                        South Vietnamese by the tens of 
                        thousands looked to the skies 
                        beseeching: “Where are the great 
                        American bombers to protect us?” 

           -- White House Press Room. President Ford walks away from 
           Reporters.

                                 EMBEDDED REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Their pleas met with but a mighty 
                        silence from Washington 

           -- March 29, 1975. NVA attacks coastal Da Nang, South 
           Vietnam’s second largest city. THOUSANDS OF LOCALS crush the 
           docks, fighting to escape by boat. 
                                 EMBEDDED REPORTER (V.O.)
                        A silence too soon broken by the 
                        footsteps of approaching North 
                        Vietnamese ground troops. 
                        Destination: Da Nang.

           Desperate Civilians throw themselves onto BARGES, already 
           teeming to capacity. Many young and elderly fall into the 
           water, crushed to death between steel hulls and stone 
           embankments. Panic-stricken Parents TOSS CHILDREN at 
           retreating boats with catastrophic results.

           On the Tarmac at Da Nang Airport, a SWARM of South 
           Vietnamese, on scooters, motorcycles and foot, chase after a 
           taxiing World Airways plane. Men cling to the stairs as the 
           plane gains speed. The Flight Crew helps four of them on 
           board, but two others fall away.

           A speeding Motorcyclist drops a GRENADE under the left wing. 
           An EXPLOSION tears away metal. Others hold to the wheel well 
           as the plane takes strenuous flight. At a thousand feet, a 
           final hanger-on drops from the sky.

           END MONTAGE.

           PULL OUT TO REVEAL:

           INT. BAR, OFFICERS CLUB, HONG KONG - “CONTINUOUS”

           The DA NANG IMAGES play on the nightly news showing on a 
           TELEVISION above the bar. 

           Tight on an exhausted DA NANG CONSULATE GENERAL AL FRANCIS 
           returning to Saigon’s river port from Da Nang via garbage 
           barge. Text under image provides his name. He weakly waves 
           off Reporters’ questions.

           The set is visible from adjoining

           DINING ROOM

           As CAPTAIN JIM KEAN (35), in Marine service uniform, watches 
           from the edge of his chair. Meal untouched.

           His wife, ROSANNE, returns from the ladies’ wash room. “Date 
           Night.”

                                 KEAN
                        The news used to lead with Vietnam. 
                        Now it’s a blurb before sports and 
                        weather.

           Rosanne stifles a sigh and sits down. This is all-too-
           familiar. 
                                 ROSANNE
                        Let’s talk about something else. 
                        Less about work...

           ...then repositions her chair to block her husband’s view of 
           the television.

                                 ROSANNE (CONT’D)
                             (pointed)
                        More about Rosanne and Jim. For 
                        example--

                                 KEAN
                             (off TV)
                        That’s what the boys in DC were 
                        counting on. If you can’t see it, 
                        it’s not happening.

           Rosanne puts her own news in a mental back pocket.

                                 ROSANNE
                        And what, exactly, is “happening?”

                                 KEAN
                        The country’s blowing up. Just 
                        because we lit the fuse two years 
                        ago, doesn’t mean I can’t hear the 
                        explosion.

                                 ROSANNE
                        The war’s over. For the rest of us 
                        anyway.

                                 KEAN
                        We made promises to protect those 
                        people.

                                 ROSANNE
                        Two tours. Couple purple hearts 
                        rattling around your sock drawer. 
                        I’d say you did your part.

           Kean gets that faraway look so familiar to her.

                                 KEAN
                        For all the good that did.

           This makes him too sullen for her taste. She gamely pivots:

                                 ROSANNE
                             (modeling her hair)
                        That’s what I’m beginning to think 
                        about my new hairdo.
           Kean appraises her, brightens somewhat. Rises.

                                 KEAN
                        Sorry. Gets me worked up. I need 
                        some air. 

                                 ROSANNE
                             (not fooled/not unkind)
                        Make it a double.

           He kisses her on the cheek. 

                                 ROSANNE (CONT’D)
                        You want to volunteer for hazard 
                        duty, there’s always the broken 
                        washing machine.

           She watches him head for the bar. Even smiles when Jim 
           flashes TWO FINGERS at the BARTENDER.

           Rosanne grows more curious when Bartender pours two separate 
           shots (not a double). Explained when

           BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Bartender walks to other end of bar. Addresses COLONEL

                        The gentleman over there bought 
                        your next round.

           Kean salutes, then displays the whiskey like it’s a game show 
           prize: “If you want it, come and get it.” Slocum shakes his 
           head... and capitulates.

           DINING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Rosanne downs her wine. Signals WAITER for the check.

           BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Kean points to the television.

                        With Da Nang falling so easily, 
                        they’ll move on Saigon next. And 
                        that’ll be that.

                        weakness.
            Slocum enjoys the first sip.

                                 KEAN
                             (pressing)
                        I should be there, Gil.

                        It’s a lost cause.

                                 KEAN
                        We’ve still got fifty Marines 
                        guarding the embassy. My Marines.

                        to leave and you want to go back 
                        in.

           Kean doesn’t reply. Either can’t or won’t.

                                 SLOCUM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll think on it.
                             (off Kean’s 
                              disappointment)
                        Well, your dad would applaud the 
                        effort anyway. Saw him pull stunts 
                        like this in the Pacific.

                                 KEAN

                        enough.

           Kean turns to see Rosanne paying check.

                                 SLOCUM (CONT’D)
                        What’s she think of this?

                                 KEAN
                        She knows who she married.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           AN OVERHEAD LIGHT SNAPS ON...

           INT. UTILITY ROOM, KEAN HOME, HONG KONG - DAY

           Kean, wearing KHAKIS and a GOLF SHIRT, examines the broken 
           washing machine. He tests the input hose: water from an open 
           tap TRICKLES out...
           EXT. BACK YARD, KEAN HOME - DAY

           Kean digs out a hole to expose the underground WATER LINE.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, KEAN HOME - DAY

           Rosanne watches from behind the curtains of the picture 
           window as

           EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Kean has now dug a TRENCH, following the pipe to where a ROOT 
           has busted through the clay pipe.

           A PORTABLE RADIO plays BBC coverage of the latest events from 
           Vietnam.

           LATER

           The back yard is a disaster area. In addition to the ten-foot 
           trench, an old STUMP that caused the problem has been half-
           way removed.

           Rosanne comes and sits down on the stump.

                                 ROSANNE
                             (off the mess)
                        It’s been nice having a man around 
                        the house these past few months.

           The BEEP of a car horn. Surprising Kean but not Rosanne.

                                 ROSANNE (CONT’D)
                        Guess it was too good to last.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Kean turns the corner and registers a DRIVER picking up a 
           PACKED SUITCASE from the front step. Bringing it to the Jeep. 

                                 KEAN
                             (grateful)
                        This is my last chance to go back.

                                 ROSANNE
                        Maybe you never left. 
                             (beat)
                        Just promise me you won’t do 
                        anything foolish. Sock drawer’s all 
                        full.

                                 KEAN
                        I promise.
           He kisses her good-bye. The kind of kiss that prompts the 
           Driver to turn his back.

                                 ROSANNE
                        Go on now.
                             (pushing back tears)
                        I miss my husband. Do me a favor, 
                        find him and bring him home.

           Kean kisses her one last time. Then heads to the Jeep. Looks 
           back:

                                 KEAN
                        Your hair. Looks nice.

           INT. HOLD AREA, C-80 CARGO PLANE - NIGHT

           Kean has the entire hold to himself. A Co-Pilot pops his head 
           back:

                                 USAF CO-PILOT
                        Buckle in, sir.

           INT. HOLD AREA, C-80 CARGO PLANE - DAY

           The ubiquitous rice paddies of Vietnam pass by the window. 

           EXT. TARMAC, TAN SON NHAT AIRPORT, SAIGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Kean steps off the plane and into chaos.  

           TEXT ON SCREEN: Saigon. April 18, 1975.

           Hundreds of WESTERNERS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE wait and/or fight 
           to board outbound planes.

           As Kean walks among them, there’s a distinct feeling of a 
           salmon swimming upstream.

           A very young looking and gung-ho South Vietnamese Driver, 
           MUNG, greets Kean with an enthusiastic, imprecise salute. 
           Grabs Kean’s duffel.

                                 MUNG
                        You have cigarette, Major?

           Kean, surprised, fishes out his pack. Offers one to Mung.

                                 KEAN
                        It’s Captain for another week. 
                                 MUNG
                        Yes, sir... 
                             (winking)
                        Major, sir.

                                 KEAN
                        You old enough to smoke?

           They reach their car. Mung throws Kean’s duffel in the front, 
           gets behind the wheel.

                                 MUNG
                        I’m not old enough to drive.

           INT./EXT. SEDAN, STREETS OF SAIGON - DAY

           Mung drives the Embassy vehicle. Sitting on a phone book. 
           Talking a mile-a-minute in butchered English. 

           Kean in rear, not listening, looks out at the hectic streets. 

                                 MUNG
                        City very busy.

           Locals watch them pass with a combination of grumbling, 
           desperation and undisguised anger. Kean rolls up the 
           window... then down again. Unsure what posture to take.

           A FRUIT SELLER leans in window. Shoves papayas in Kean’s 
           face...

                                 KEAN
                        No. No, thank you.

           ...as a STREET URCHIN reaches in the opposite window and 
           GRABS KEAN’S SUITCASE. Takes off running.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           Mung shrugs with a sheepish smile. 

                                 MUNG
                        City very busy.

           Kean rolls the windows up again.

           EXT. NORTH GATE, US EMBASSY, SAIGON - DAY

           Mung pulls up to the compound. A two-acre square dominated by 
           the 6-story Chancery, a block of smaller administrative 
           buildings, a large parking lot and adjacent swimming pool. 

           A GUARD leans inside. Checks Kean’s credentials. 
                                 GUARD
                        Welcome to America’s last foothold 
                        in Vietnam, Major.

           Guard waves to Other Guards, who open the gates.

                                 KEAN
                             (to self)
                        It’s Captain...

           EXT. PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           Mung parks beneath a huge tamarind tree.

           INT. FOYER, CHANCERY - DAY

           Kean ENTERS. Surprised to see nobody guarding the building.

           REC ROOM - DAY

           Kean pops his head in. He exchanges salutes with NCOIC SGT. 
           JUAN VALDEZ (30’s), the mustachio-ed senior station officer, 
           standing and watching a TELEVISION.

                                 KEAN
                        Jim Kean. Would’ve expected to see 
                        a bit more security, given the 
                        situation.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Ambassador’s orders. Business as 
                        usual.

                                 KEAN
                        Where is he?

                                 VALDEZ
                        Doing his same tired act.

           Valdez nods to the TELEVISION:

           INT. TELEVISION STUDIO, SAIGON - SAME TIME

           Ambassador Martin, looking pale and dyspeptic from a bout of 
           pneumonia, puts on a brave face for the cameras as he 
           addresses an INTERVIEWER’s questions.

                                 MARTIN
                        I want to assure you. We are not

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Then why did your Congress not 
                        approve additional money for our 
                        country last week?

                                 MARTIN
                        It’s true, the $700 million aid 
                        package was defeated. But President 
                        Ford will be asking for $1.2

                        important Vietnamese are being 
                        evacuated on American planes.

                                 MARTIN
                        No Vietnamese are being allowed to 
                        leave the country with the 
                        exception of American spouses and 
                        their dependents. That’s all.

                             (sizing him up)
                        He’s not in.

                                 KEAN
                        Light’s on.

                        You want to make me say it, I’ll 
                        say it. He’s not in for you.

                                 KEAN
                        I’m Commanding Officer of the

                        Ground Support Force Commander 
                        Southeast Asia.

           She’s not particularly impressed.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (sheepish)
                        Soon to be Major.

           She sighs, lowers her eyes. Returns to her paperwork. Nods 
           towards door marked: AMBASSADOR GRAHAM MARTIN.

           MARTIN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Martin listens to a SPEECH on the radio at low volume. Desk 
           littered with cables, coming and going.

           KNOCK on door. He ignores it. Kean eventually opens and walks 
           in.

                                 KEAN
                        Captain Jim Kean.

                        I didn’t call you, Captain.

                                 KEAN
                        I thought to report as soon as 
                        possible.

           He hands ORDERS to Martin, who drops them in an inbox without 
           a glance. Beside the inbox is a framed MEMORIAL PHOTOGRAPH of 
           a YOUNG MAN.

           Martin looks at Kean for the first time.

                                 MARTIN
                        I mean, I didn’t call you to 
                        Saigon.
                                 KEAN
                        Fifty Marines against the entire 
                        North Vietnamese Army didn’t strike 
                        me as a fair fight.

                                 MARTIN
                             (sizing him up)
                        And you’re the one man who can 
                        balance the scales?

           Kean is tempted to say ‘yes’, but deflects:

                                 KEAN
                        More like, you can use all the help 
                        you can get.

                                 MARTIN
                        I’ve met my share of military men 
                        looking for a fight. We don’t need 
                        heroes, Captain. We need diplomacy. 
                        Understood?

                                 KEAN
                        Yes, sir.

                                 MARTIN
                        That means discretion. Not 
                        headlines. My job, and yours by 
                        extension, is to resolve things 
                        quietly. So all you need to know is 
                        that I’ve got the situation well in 
                        hand. And all I need to know is 
                        that you’re not going to stir up 
                        trouble and you can follow orders.

           Martin continues staring at him, demanding a response:

                                 KEAN
                        Yes, sir.

           INT. SITUATION ROOM, CHANCERY - DAY

           Kean addresses a room full of MARINES; individuals we’ll get 
           to know but for now they feel to us (and to Kean) like a 
           single immutable entity. They eye Kean with guarded interest.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Everyone’s here, Major.

                                 KEAN
                        Thank you, Sargent. It’s good to be 
                        back in Saigon. I’m glad to see the 
                        embassy in--
           A Marine, BENNINGTON, raises his hand. Kean nods.

                                 BENNINGTON
                        We’re getting conflicting reports 
                        about the fighting up north. Can 
                        you fill us in?

                                 KEAN
                        The Ambassador’s military advisor 
                        provides you with a daily threat 
                        assessment. I refer you to that.

           The deflection has the opposite effect Kean hopes, and the 
           floodgates open. Marines barrage Kean with questions:

                                 BAUER
                        There’s a rumor the VC’s have 
                        infiltrated the White Mice. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Is Bien Tho under attack?

                                 SCHLAGER
                        If Saigon falls, what are the 
                        contingency plan?

                                 FRAIN
                        What’s the sitrep, Major? Just 
                        level with us.

           Kean can feel all eyes upon him. He dares not meet their 
           collective gaze:

                                 KEAN
                        We need to focus. Our primary 
                        responsibility is to protect the 
                        Ambassador and his operations. So 
                        let’s go over your current 
                        protocols. Sargent?

           Valdez shares the men’s disappointment. Hesitates briefly 
           before complying:

                                 VALDEZ
                        Yes, sir, Major--

                                 SCHLAGER
                             (dismayed)
                        It’s Captain Kean.
                             (to Kean)
                        Isn’t that right, sir?

                                 KEAN
                        That’s correct. Carry on, Sargent.
                                 VALDEZ
                        Twelve men are assigned to 
                        Ambassador Martin’s personal 
                        detail...

           As Valdez continues, Kean allows himself to scan his 
           Marines... and sees the disappointment on each and every 
           face. 

           INT. HALLWAY, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Gevers helps Kean set up a COT.

                                 GEVERS
                        We weren’t expecting you, sir. No 
                        room at the inn, as it were. But we 
                        can displace one of the Privates.

           Kean keeps making up his bed.

                                 GEVERS (CONT’D)
                        Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at 
                        a hotel, sir?

                                 KEAN
                        I’m not wasting our limited time 
                        and resources shuttling to the 
                        Colonial and back.

                                 GEVERS
                        Can I at least help you unpack?

           Kean pulls out his wallet and slips it under the pillow.

                                 KEAN
                        Too late.

           LATER

           Kean sleeps uncomfortably on the cot and in his golf clothes. 
           Tossing. Cheek to pillow, he feels the lump beneath.

           He sits up. Reaches for the wallet underneath. Pulls out a 
           PHOTO of Rosanne.

           COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Kean stands by as Norman puts through a call.

           Out the window, Kean spots a familiar face: 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

           DA NANG CONSULATE GENERAL AL FRANCIS waits with a suitcase.
           INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

           Kean heads for the door.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Norman)
                        Never mind.

           INT. KEAN HOME, HONG KONG - NIGHT

           Rosanne runs to the PHONE. PAPERS in her hand.

                                 ROSANNE
                        Jim?

           But the line is dead.

                                 ROSANNE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           She hangs up. Key words on the papers in her hand can be 
           read: “Blood Work” and “Pregnant”.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Francis steps into the back of car. An upbeat Mung behind the 
           wheel.

                                 KEAN (O.S.)
                        Al--

           Francis turns, drunkenly surprised to see a friendly face.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Jim. Didn’t know you were in 
                        Saigon.

                                 KEAN
                        You know me and burning buildings.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Then you get what a shit show this 
                        is.

                                 KEAN
                        Don’t worry. We’ll get ours home.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Christ, Martin hasn't told you?
                               (shaking head)
                        Of course not. The intelligence 
                        reports from Da Nang since evac 
                        tell the whole story. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                        Civilians slaughtered by the 
                        thousands for working with us. Told 
                        the Ambassador in no uncertain 
                        terms: Saigon’s gonna be far worse.

                                 KEAN
                        What did Martin say?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Said I must be mentally exhausted. 
                        Ordered me stateside. That son-of-a-
                        bitch won’t let anyone tell him 
                        what to do. Which would be fine 
                        only he’s not living in reality.

           Francis stumbles getting in to the car.

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                             (RE: stumble)
                        You missed one helluva going away 
                        party.

           Kean closes the car door for him. Hands another cigarette to 
           a grateful Mung.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Mung)
                        Makes sure he gets on that plane.

           Mung gives him a terrible salute, starts the engine...

                                 FRANCIS
                        Cable room. Sixth floor.

           ...and drives out the gate.

           INT. HALL, SIXTH FLOOR, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Kean tries the door marked: CABLE ROOM. Locked.

           WAITING AREA, MARTIN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Kean rummages through the Secretary’s drawers. Finds a KEY 
           RING.

           TIGHT ON: Kean’s hand, key in lock. Twist and CLICK.

           INT. CABLE ROOM - NIGHT

           Kean, seated, sifts through INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS on Da 
           Nang. PHOTOS and first-hand accounts of the atrocities: 
           summary executions, massive desertions and labor camp round-
           ups.
           The full force of the human damage hits him hard.

           INT. MARTIN’S STUDY, AMBASSADOR’S HOME - NIGHT

           Martin listens intently to RADIO, where a man gives a speech 
           in Vietnamese to occasional APPLAUSE.

           Martin’s Wife leads Kean inside. Kean waits until she’s 
           retreated before

           THWACK.

           Kean drops the large folder on Martin’s desk.

                                 KEAN
                        This is the list of valued human 
                        assets in Da Nang considered at-
                        risk in the event of an NVA 
                        occupation.

           As Kean turns pages, one in three is crossed out with a fresh 
           RED X. 

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        You can see what’s transpired in 
                        only a week.
                             (tapping file)
                        That’s Da Nang. One notebook. 
                        Saigon is a room of filing cabinets 
                        filled with names. 20,000 in all. 
                        Men and women who helped the U.S. 
                        fight the war. Add their families 
                        and we’re looking at 100,000 people 
                        who, even now, count on our 
                        protection from summary execution 
                        or rehabilitation camps.

                                 MARTIN
                        Do you have a point, Captain Kean?

                                 KEAN
                        I’d like to go over evacuation 
                        procedures for these folks.

                                 MARTIN
                        That won’t be necessary.

                                 KEAN
                        We can’t just leave them behind 
                        when the time comes.

                                 MARTIN
                        We won’t leave them behind. 
                                 KEAN
                        Sir?

                                 MARTIN
                        Because we won’t be evacuating.

           Kean studies Martin: “The man’s serious.”

                                 KEAN
                        I’ve been reading Al Francis’ 
                        intelligence reports. 100,000 ARVN 
                        troops surrendered when their 
                        officers cut and ran. The country’s 
                        second largest city fell in a day. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I’m well aware of recent events.

                                 KEAN
                        Then you understand it’s happening, 
                        sir. The entire country will belong 
                        to the North.

                                 MARTIN
                        That is your considered opinion, is 
                        it, after a day in-country?

                                 KEAN
                        No. That was my opinion after ten 
                        minutes. These files only confirmed 
                        it.

           Martin steadies his gaze on Kean.

                        Saigon will never fall. 

                                 KEAN
                        With all due respect, that’s only 
                        your opinion.

                                 MARTIN
                        No, it’s my responsibility. 
                        Washington trusts me to make the 
                        right call, and I intend to stand 
                        my ground. Listen to this:

           Martin turns up the radio again. An impassioned Viet voice 
           belonging to GENERAL KHIEM fills the room.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        That’s General Khiem. The Silver 
                        Tiger. He’s admonishing all his 
                        countrymen who would turn tail.
           Martin listens. Likes what he hears. Turns down the radio 
           again.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        He will hold the Mekong Delta with 
                        200,000 American-trained troops 
                        armed with American-made weapons. 
                        And if our Communist neighbors to 
                        the north still don’t get the 
                        message, we have 80 SAC B-52s at 
                        Utapao Air Base, Thailand to say it 
                        louder. They can be flying missions 
                        over Hanoi in 12 hours.

           Kean struggles to keep his control: “The man has lost his 
           mind.”

                                 KEAN
                        What if Thieu fails to deliver? We 
                        made promises to protect these 
                        people.

                                 MARTIN
                        Your job, the primary job of all 
                        Marines here is to protect me.

                                 KEAN
                        Yes, sir, but-- 

                                 MARTIN
                        As far as I’m concerned that means 
                        helping me do my job, which is to 
                        save the country of South Vietnam. 
                        To that end, keep your opinions to 
                        yourself. There’s no need to raise 
                        the alarm and it’s vitally 
                        important we set an example for the 
                        remaining Americans and the rest of 
                        the city. So it’s business as 
                        usual. That’s an order.

           EXT. AMBASSADOR’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Kean shuts the door behind him. Leans back against it in 
           disbelief: “What the hell just happened in there?”

           EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT - ESTABLISHING

           INT. BAR, RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

           Kean, Valdez and MAY LI, Valdez’s Girlfriend, sit at a table 
           while a DOZEN MARINES flirt, drink and joke nearby, 
           occasionally throwing a skeptical eye in Kean’s direction. 
                                 KEAN
                        I get the diplomat thing, but I 
                        think Martin actually believes what 
                        he’s saying. 

                                 VALDEZ
                        That’s the Ambassador.

                                 KEAN
                        He’s making a tough job tougher.

                                 VALDEZ
                        A job you volunteered for, 
                        remember? 

                                 KEAN
                        That’s me. The good soldier. 

                                 VALDEZ
                        That just might be your problem, 
                        right there.

           Valdez doesn’t know how right he is. The point hangs in the 
           air until a WAITER comes over with a DRINK for Kean.

                                 KEAN
                        I’ve got one already.

                                 WAITER
                        It’s from your men. 

           Kean eyes the straw-colored drink with suspicion.

                                 KEAN
                        What is it?

                                 WAITER
                        They say it is an Arnold Palmer?

           The Marines at the bar all LAUGH. Some mime golf swings. 
           Point to Kean’s clothes. Kean puts on a smile, raises the 
           glass to them, but knows he doesn’t have their respect yet.

                                 VALDEZ
                        They figured you were here to make 
                        this a military operation. They’ll 
                        get over it.

           Kean consider his Marines more seriously. 

                                 KEAN
                        What’re we working with?
                                 VALDEZ
                        I’ll introduce you.

                                 KEAN
                        No time for all that. I can gauge 
                        enough from a nickname. Every 
                        Marine’s got one.

           Valdez points out each guy:

                                 VALDEZ
                             (off STEVE SCHULLER)
                        Steve Schuller. Broke every 
                        Physical Training score we had. For 
                        that, he’s called PT Monster.

           It’s obvious why. Schuller is country strong.

                                 VALDEZ (CONT’D)
                             (off BOBBY FRAIN)
                        Frain is the Body Beautiful.

           The good-looking Frain, with a physique to match, flirts 
           effortlessly with the best LOCAL TALENT.

                                 MAY LI
                             (teasing/to Valdez)
                        That’s what I would call him.

           Valdez gives her a soft elbow to the ribs in return.

                                 VALDEZ
                             (off BENNINGTON)
                        Bennington’s Black Market. 
                        Resourceful as all hell.
                             (off BAUER)
                        Bauer’s Mr. Clean. Stick Ass when 
                        he’s not around.
                             (off SULLIVAN)
                        Sully. Mike Sullivan. He’s Rock 
                        Steady. I gave him that one.

                                 KEAN
                        What do they call you, Top?

                                 VALDEZ
                        Just Top.

                                 MAY LI
                        What is wrong with Top?

                                 VALDEZ
                             (to May Li)
                        Every NCOIC’s called Top, baby.
                                 KEAN
                        With a punch line like Juan Valdez?
                             (off Valdez’s 
                              shrug/encouraging)
                        No, it’s good. Means they respect 
                        you. And the cherry boys?

           Kean refers to a pair of fresh-faced 19-year olds: JUDGE and 
           MCMAHON, doing their best to catch up on the jokes flying 
           around them.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Judge and McMahon? No time. Just 
                        arrived in-country a few days ago.
                        I’m stationing them at the airport. 
                        Simple checkpoint stuff.

                                 KEAN
                        Why in hell is GenCom still drawing 
                        tags for here, anyway?

                                 VALDEZ
                        Replacements. Had to send home the 
                        four Marines from the Da Nang 
                        consulate. Night terrors.

           They go silent, thoughts turning to the same shit coming to 
           Saigon. May Li rises to end the tension.

                                 MAY LI
                        Another round?

           As she heads to the bar:

                                 KEAN
                        She should get out of Saigon. But, 
                        hey, it’s not my place.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Funny, she told me the same thing.
                             (troubled)
                        Won’t leave without her parents. 
                        She’s stubborn and proud, like the 
                        whole damn country. North and 
                        south.

           EXT. TARMAC, SAM PAT AFB - NIGHT

           Silver-haired SOUTH VIETNAMESE GENERAL KHIEM arrives by Jeep.

           He moves toward a waiting helicopter. It takes eight men to 
           carry four bags. Two men to a bag. 
           An eager AIR FORCE PILOT heads across the tarmac to fly the 
           helo. He is stopped by PILOT BUI, a dashing, magnetic figure 
           wearing a silk aviator’s scarf.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        I will escort General Khiem.

           One bag hits a pole and makes a METALLIC CLUNK. Bag rips open 
           to reveal GOLD BARS.

                                 AIR FORCE PILOT
                        We all want the reward and a place 
                        on an American ship.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        Not me. I will come back.

                                 AIR FORCE PILOT
                             (skeptical)
                        Yeah? How do we know?

                                 PILOT BUI
                        Because today South Vietnam needs 
                        pilots not gold.

           With that, Pilot Bui hops into the cockpit.

           EXT. BAR, RED LIGHT DISTRICT, SAIGON - NIGHT

           The Marines, their female Companions and May Li stumble out.

           Their LAUGHTER drowned out when a group formation of HU-1 
           “Huey” Helicopters passes low overhead.

                                 FRAIN
                        What the hell?

                                 BENNINGTON
                        That’s the Silver Tiger. General 
                        Khiem. Bugging out. Heard it from 
                        some DAO boys inside.

           Kean watches the helos disappear to the east, then pulls 
           Valdez aside.

                                 KEAN
                        The North is coming, whether the 
                        Ambassador believes it or not. 
                        Inform the men to be in the 
                        situation room at 0700.

           INT. SITUATION ROOM, CHANCERY, US EMBASSY - DAY

           The Marines settle, some gingerly/hung-over, into chairs.
                                 KEAN
                        Yesterday, you asked me several 
                        questions regarding the NVA and 
                        South Vietnam’s defensive 
                        preparedness. Unfortunately, and 
                        I’m relaying the Ambassador’s 
                        instructions: I am not to provide 
                        you with my personal view of the 
                        military situation facing us.

           That same skeptical look from the Marines. Kean pauses, makes 
           a mental deal with himself to cross the Rubicon, then LOCKS 
           THE DOOR and plunges in:

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        So I’ve asked Frank Snepp to give 
                        you the SitRep. His opinion. Not 
                        mine.

           The Marines perk up.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        You might have seen Frank haunting 
                        the corridors of the CIA floor--
                             (deliberate “mistake”)
                        I mean the cultural attache floor.

           Warming to Kean, the Marines LAUGH. So does FRANK SNEPP, a 
           crew-cut Agency veteran.

                                 SNEPP
                             (relaxed)
                        Embassy’s a cozy place. I don’t 
                        think I’m fooling anybody. Howdy 
                        gents.

           Snepp uses a MAP to reinforce his comments. Drawings indicate 
           change in North Vietnamese positions over the past 45 days.

                                 SNEPP (CONT’D)
                        Charlie was gearing up for a two 
                        year campaign. But victories have 
                        come so fast, he’s looking to take 
                        Saigon before monsoon season.

           Snepp spots a sheepish Private Judge start to raise his hand.

                                 SNEPP (CONT’D)
                             (answering)
                        That's a week from now. Tops.

           Judge lowers his hand.

                        miles north. Between 100,000 and 
                        150,000 professional, battle-
                        hardened soldiers. They outnumber 
                        the ARVN three to one. 

           BRIDGE in the far distance. This will be our benchmark for 
           NVA’s progress.

                        They’re fanning out around the 
                        city. By the time they reach Vu 
                        Long bridge, they’ll have Saigon in 
                        a stranglehold.

           INT. SITUATION ROOM, CHANCERY - CONTINUOUS

                                 SNEPP
                        Another thing, a significant number 
                        of VC cadres and NVA forward 
                        artillery observers have already 
                        infiltrated the city. Some have 
                        been apprehended wearing South 
                        Vietnamese army and police 
                        uniforms.

                                 BAUER
                        What about this hammer-and-anvil 
                        strategy we’ve been hearing about?

           Snepp flashes Kean a “What the hell?” look as Norman 
           elaborates:

                                 NORMAN
                             (naively hopeful)
                        That maybe Thieu let the NVA get 
                        this close so he could drop a few 
                        divisions behind their lines and 
                        crush them against the city’s 
                        defenses. 

           Snepp can’t suppress a LAUGH before recovering.

                                 SNEPP
                        If Thieu had the resources, which 
                        he doesn’t, he would have tried 
                        that in Da Nang. No. Saigon’s going 
                        to fall.
           Kean nods to Snepp in thanks then feels the room get quiet 
           before he takes control:

                                 KEAN
                        But before it does, we’re going to 
                        be Marines. 

           There’s general positive MURMURING among the Marines. This is 
           what they’ve been wanting to hear. 

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        That means getting as many at-risk 
                        Vietnamese out of here as possible.

           Snepp takes the opportunity to unlock the door and EXIT.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        I can't and won’t make an order of 
                        this. So if anyone has a problem, 
                        feel free to speak up. 

           A brief silence before skeptical Schlager pipes up:

                                 SCHLAGER
                        No, sir, Major. No problems.

           With everyone on the same page, the mood changes: "Let's get 
           down to work."

                                 KEAN
                        Evacuation plans were drawn up two 
                        years ago. Code name Flash Storm. 
                        The name has since been compromised 
                        and the situation on the ground, as 
                        demonstrated by the chaos in Da 
                        Nang requires a complete re-
                        thinking. 

           Kean nods to Valdez, who places an overlay on the MAP to show 
           evacuation plans. 

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        As before, signal will go out on 
                        Armed Forces Radio. But the new 
                        plan is code named Operation 
                        Frequent Wind.

                                 SCHULLER
                        The plan must really stink.

           Schuller, the PT Monster, enjoys getting a few SNORTS of 
           laughter from his fellow Marines.

           Martin passes Snepp on Fourth Floor landing.

                        Fourth floor isn’t your usual 
                        haunt.

                                 SNEPP
                        Howdy, Graham. Don’t tell anyone 
                        but spooks have a lousy sense of 
                        direction. 

           Snepp flashes a sheepish grin and heads upstairs. Martin 
           looks down the fourth floor hallway from where Snepp has 
           come... 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 KEAN
                        The operation includes four 
                        options. Option One involves 
                        commercial aircraft, so that’s now 
                        out. Two is a continuation of fixed-
                        wing evac from Tan Son Nhut using 
                        military C-141 and C-130’s only. 
                        Three involves a sea lift from the 
                        Port of Saigon but after the 
                        tragedy on the Da Nang docks, 
                        that’s a non-starter. 

                                 BENNINGTON
                        You said four options, Major?

                                 KEAN
                        Option Four is a helicopter lift 
                        from the Airport.

           Sounds of SKEPTICISM flood the room.

                                 MARINES

                                 SCHULLER
                        Might as well empty a tub with a 
                        thimble.

           Kean displays a MAP on wall that explains Option Four.

                        We’ll stage in the World Airways

                        miles off Vung Tau. Embassy

                        parking lot. Any questions?

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        I can think of a couple.

           Kean pivots to see Martin in the doorway. Kean steps more 
           directly between Martin and the incriminating map.

                                 KEAN

                        operations.

           Martin takes a good look around the room. Finally EXITS. Kean 
           addresses his men again:

                        Let’s go ladies. Much as it pains 
                        me to see you go, the Commies won’t 
                        treat you with the same affection.

                                 PROSTITUTE #1

                        You’ll do just fine. Trust me.

           Some of the Prostitutes want to stay. There’s a tug-of-war 
           between the two groups, ENTREATIES and a lot of TEARS but 
           Frain eventually leads the evacuating ladies downstairs and 
           outside.

                        I’ve gotta get back to the Embassy.

                        We’ll try again tomorrow.

           At the other end of the line, Private Judge fights to keep 
           order as he processes Vietnamese for transport. He spots 
           Sullivan leaving.

           Sullivan and his family EXITING.

           Sullivan turns to see Private Judge. Judge grabs Sullivan’s

           Sullivan and his Wife kiss and embrace. Not wanting to say 
           good-bye.

           Judge gives the deeply-moved Sullivan a shy smile then 
           personally walks Sullivan’s Wife to the next plane waiting to 
           take off, carrying their daughter on his shoulders.

           ...with Kissinger.

                                 MARTIN
                        You assured President Thieu at the 
                        time of the accords -- and I have 
                        subsequently reiterated the promise 
                        on several occasions -- that we 
                        would re-commence bombing runs over 
                        Hanoi the moment North Vietnam 
                        violated the peace terms. We are 
                        well beyond that, Henry.

                                 KISSINGER
                        That was Nixon’s promise. President 
                        Ford has taken a different 
                        approach.
                                 MARTIN
                        But if he understood the situation 
                        here--

                                 KISSINGER
                        The President will not be asking 
                        Congress to dust off Operation 
                        Linebacker.

                                 MARTIN
                             (biting hard)
                        I was hoping for better news.

                                 KISSINGER
                        This is where your skills come in, 
                        Mr. Ambassador. A diplomatic 
                        solution remains the best possible 
                        outcome. 

                                 MARTIN
                        There is thought that the Soviets 
                        can use their influence in Hanoi to 
                        rein in General Dho. I’ll make 
                        enquiries through the French 
                        Ambassador.

                                 KISSINGER
                        God’s speed, Graham. The President 
                        and I are counting on you to avoid 
                        the embarrassment of a total pull 
                        out.

           The muted CLICK of an overseas disconnection.

           Martin, agitated, EXITS the Chancery now using a CANE. Moves 
           as quickly as his frail body allows. Grabs the AXE from 
           Schuller’s hand and throws it to the ground.
                                 MARTIN
                        What’s all this?

                                 KEAN
                             (quick to lie)
                        Need to keep your transport options 
                        open, sir.

           Martin suspects there’s more going on. Makes a gut call:

                                 MARTIN
                        The tree stays. The people of 
                        Saigon see us take down this tree, 
                        it will be seen as a sign of 
                        weakness. 

                                 KEAN
                        We’re past symbols, sir.

                                 MARTIN
                        Symbols always matter. The flag. 
                        The eagle. And this tree. It’s a 
                        symbol of American strength. Of 
                        commitment to the people. Take away 
                        this tree, you might as well remove 
                        the flag. The people of Saigon will 
                        notice and there will be widespread 
                        panic.

           Kean and his Men grow uncomfortable as Martin loses himself 
           to bombast.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Anyone touches that tree, they will 
                        be court-martialed.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SAIGON - NIGHT

           North Vietnamese soldiers make camp. Bringing forward long-
           range artillery guns and mortars.

           INT. LOCK ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Schuller and Frain ENTER and make for a PILE of VIETNAMESE 
           CURRENCY.

                                 FRAIN
                        You sure about this?

                                 SCHULLER
                        It’s not stealing, it’s investing 
                        in the local economy.
                             (off Frain’s look)

                                 SCHULLER (CONT'D)
                        Okay, it’s stealing... but  
                        nobody’ll ever know.

           Frain accepts this. Starts grabbing piasters.

           EXT. LOCK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Gevers walks by as Frain and Schuller EXIT, stuffing their 
           pockets with the CASH.

                                 GEVERS
                             (Vietnamese)
                        I don’t see a thing.

           INT. BAR, RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

           Schuller and Frain are far-gone wasted. LOCAL GIRLS on their 
           lap. They lavish piasters on everyone until their pockets are 
           empty.

           First to notice are the Girls, who abruptly drop their 
           attention. Head off for richer prospects.

                                 SCHULLER
                        Guess that’s it.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Schuller and Frain pass the tamarind tree. They both look at 
           the tree, and then each other.

           Schuller finds the axe, where Martin left it. Goes to the 
           back of the tree, shielded from Martin’s windows, and takes a 
           drunken WHACK.

                                 SCHULLER
                        That’s for those bow ties and your 
                        wife’s little dog.

           Frain grabs the axe. WHACK.

                                 FRAIN
                        That’s for not letting me date your 
                        daughter.

           WHACK.

                                 FRAIN (CONT’D)
                        And that’s for not letting me date 
                        the other one.

           They look at the tree. Still no progress.
                                 SCHULLER
                        C’mon. We’ve got detail.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, AMBASSADOR’S HOUSE, SAIGON - NIGHT

           An anxious, tight-mouthed Martin reaches into a cabinet. 
           Grabs a bottle of wine. Thinks better of it and pulls out a 
           SPECIAL BOTTLE, wrapped in cloth.

           Through a slightly open door, MARTIN’S WIFE packs and holds 
           back tears. Her SHIH TZU under her feet.

           Martin puts on his “game face” turns to face the FRENCH 
           AMBASSADOR

                                 MARTIN
                             (French)
                        I have a grave favor to ask, 
                        Jacques. 
                             (English)
                        I need you to approach the Soviets.

           Martin’s Wife knows her cue to exit. She sweeps up the Shih 
           Tzu in her arms and EXITS.

           INT. HALLWAY, CHANCERY, US EMBASSY - 0400 HOURS

           Silence. Kean sleeps on his cot. 

           The jarring RUMBLE of distant ROCKET ATTACKS jolts him awake. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Burn Squad. Sullivan and Gevers already stare to the 
           northwest, shovels in hand, as Kean ENTERS from the fire 
           stairs.

           Together they witness the onset of massive MORTAR and ROCKET 
           BOMBING of Tan Son Nhut Airport. Five miles away.

                                 KEAN
                        It’s started.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Who we got over there?

           Sullivan turns for an answer. But Kean is already GONE.

           INT./EXT. TAN SON NHUT AIRPORT - SAME TIME

           Violent EXPLOSIONS rip through hangars and fuel depots amid 
           the all-night evacuation. 
           Mortar rounds blast deep CRATERS in the runways. Hundreds of 
           waiting Vietnamese evacuees run for cover of concrete 
           bunkers.

           Kean’s senior posted Marine, Bauer aka “Mr. Clean”, 
           frantically wraps his wire-rim glasses around his ears and 
           screams into his radio:

                                 BAUER
                             (”incoming!”)
                        Whiskey Joe! Whiskey Joe!

                                 RADIOMAN
                        Took a hit to the staging center! 
                        We’ve got casualties!

           Bauer adjusts to the chaos, readying his M-16:

                                 BAUER
                             (into radio)
                        We’ve got men on the wire...

           Another ROCKET hits the roof of a hangar. Splintering wood 
           and corrugated metal.

           Bauer runs through smoke-filled air, towards the perimeter of 
           the airport.

           CHECKPOINT #1

           Bauer finds Corporal Lamar Holmes splayed on the ground, 
           clutching his knee and bleeding from his head.

                                 BAUER
                        Holmes, can you walk? Holmes?!

           Holmes just stares blankly. Shell-shocked.

           Another BLAST and a FIREBALL as the fuel tank ruptures on an 
           American C-130 plane. Burning oil and debris litter the 
           nearby runway.

           The wall of fire lights the scene in front of Bauer. And his 
           heart jumps into his throat as he stares towards:

           CHECKPOINT #2

           Now nothing more than a whole in the ground.

           Bauer starts tearing at twisted chain link and sheet metal. 
           He spots a pristine MARINE BOOT... holding a leg severed at 
           the shin. Nearby, a singed metal flak jacket burned into a 
           torso with no limbs.
           Nearby exploding BULLET ROUNDS send Bauer belly-first to the 
           dirt. What he thought was enemy fire come from a burning ammo 
           dump. 

           But from his prone position, he spots PRIVATE JUDGE staring 
           back. Lifeless face drained of blood.

           TAN SON NHUT AIRPORT - 0500 HOURS

           Kean jumps from an Embassy vehicle driven by his driver, 
           Mung. 

                                 AIRPORT MARINE
                        We’re two short.

                                 KEAN
                        Do a roll call and--

           Bauer approaches.

                                 BAUER
                        Don’t bother. It’s Judge and 
                        McMahon.

                                 KEAN
                        Jesus. The newbies.

           A silence fills the space.

           Kean turns to make a quick, professional scan of the 
           situation.

           A final cargo plane makes a desperate attempt to take off 
           amid the continuing rocket attack. It gets hit; wreckage 
           further blocking the cratered runways.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Get the Ambassador on the horn.

           Kean watches as 100 yards away, across the tarmac, SOUTH 
           VIETNAMESE AIR FORCE OFFICERS commandeer Huey helicopters at 
           gunpoint.

           Communications Marine brings Kean a crank phone. 

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (grabbing phone)
                        Sir. It’s no longer possible to fly 
                        fixed-wing aircraft.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:
           INT. AMBASSADOR’S HOME - DAY

           Martin puts on his boots. Phone cradled to his chin.

                                 MARTIN
                        Don’t give me a conclusion, 
                        Captain. Just an assessment.

                                 KEAN
                        We’ve got cargo planes destroyed on 
                        the tarmac. Oil fires. And incoming 
                        mortar rounds. The airport’s a shit 
                        storm.

                                 MARTIN
                        I better see for myself.

                                 KEAN
                        The situation’s self-evident, and 
                        leaving the embassy at this time is 
                        more risk than--

                                 MARTIN
                        Not a word of this to anyone. I’m 
                        on my way.

           Kean hears Martin CLICK off. CURSES under his breath.

           EXT. STREETS, SAIGON - DAY

           Martin driven in his armor plated Chevrolet Impala.

           Three Marines in the car, including Bennington, stare out 
           their windows. Fingers on triggers.

           EXT. TAN SON NHUT AIRPORT - 0700 HOURS

           Martin ARRIVES, crosses paths with the BODY BAGS holding 
           Judge and McMahon. He’s quickly ushered inside: 

           INT. DEFENSE ATTACHE OPERATIONS HQ - CONTINUOUS

           Upstairs. With a wide view of the airport. The light is 
           better now. Kean can see the full extent of the smoldering 
           damage. 

           Martin, escorted by Bennington, joins him.

                                 MARTIN
                             (anxious)
                        Mrs. Martin and Nit Noy?

           Kean looks to Bennington: “Nit Noy?”
                                 BENNINGTON
                        Mrs. Martin’s shih tzu.

           Kean bites his lip.

                                 BAUER
                             (overhearing)
                        They got out safely an hour ago, 
                        sir.

           They all watch one brave South Vietnamese AIR FORCE PLANE 
           circle the airport, laying down protective fire against 
           advanced NVA positions.

                                 MARTIN
                        Well, we still control the airport.

                                 KEAN
                        The runways are unusable. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Not once you clear that debris. 

                                 KEAN
                        That’ll only invite another mortar 
                        attack.

                                 MARTIN
                        But can you do it?

                                 KEAN
                             (”Yes, but...”)
                        Frequent Wind. Call it, sir.

           Martin seems to be wavering... But they’re disrupted by a 
           SQUAWK.

                                 NORMAN (O.S.)
                             (on squawk box)
                        I’ve got the Secretary of State for 
                        the Ambassador.

                             (annoyed/pivoting)
                        Your orders were to talk to no one.

                                 KEAN
                             (”not my fault”)
                        CoC picks up our chatter.

                                 MARTIN
                             (to Norman/into mic)
                        Patch him through.

           INT. KISSINGER’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Kissinger nods to his Secretary, who shuts his door.

                                 KISSINGER
                        Graham. What’s going on? I 
                        understand the airport’s been 
                        attacked.

                                 MARTIN
                             (non-commital)
                        All is calm at present.

                             (careful)
                        I rely entirely on your assessment 
                        of the situation. If you need to 
                        call for Frequent Wind, then I will 
                        accept this distressing news. But 
                        understand this: the win here is 
                        the appearance of an orderly 
                        withdrawal of non-essential 
                        personnel, and the flag still 
                        flying over the embassy.

                                 MARTIN
                             (into mic/looking at Kean)
                        If the runway can be re-opened, my 
                        men can do it.

           Martin hangs up. Kean has his orders. He doesn’t like it. But 
           there it is.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Bauer and Bennington)
                        Come with me.

           EXT. GATES, US EMBASSY - 0800 HOURS

           A CROWD has already started to gather. Schuller and Schlager 
           eyeball them warily.

           Valdez comes over.

                                 VALDEZ
                        We’ve gotta keep the embassy 
                        screwed down tight. Anyone gets 
                        in’s just another we gotta get out 
                        again. 
                                 SCHULLER
                             (to crowd)
                        Go home. Closed. Closed.

           But few in the Crowd move off.

           EXT. OUTSIDE CONTROL TOWER, AIRPORT - DAY

           Kean does his best to attempt clearing the debris. A group of 
           Marines work fire hoses attempting to put out the fiery cargo 
           plane. 

           Kean gets behind the wheel of a truck. Joins others to push 
           smaller vehicles off the runway.

           But SNIPER FIRE opens up from several different positions. 
           Shoots holes in Kean’s vehicle. All the drivers flop to the 
           ground, roll under their trucks for safety.

           Kean locates the source of some of the shots: an NVA sniper 
           in an advanced position atop one of the neighboring roofs.

           Kean uses hand signals to position a Marine Sharpshooter. 
           Then Kean exposes himself, opening fire on the Sniper’s 
           position, allowing the Marine Sharpshooter to make a clean 
           hit.

                                 KEAN
                        Let’s get back to it.

           Kean is the first back behind the wheel of his truck. The 
           others follow suit. One eye on the nearby buildings.

           EXT. FRONT GATES, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Martin returns. Miffed to find the gates closed. The Crowd 
           has increased to several hundred Vietnamese. Some carry 
           suitcases full of possessions.

           Martin checks his watch: frowns.

           As the gates open for the Impala, Martin taps the Driver on 
           the shoulder with his cane:

                                 MARTIN
                        Stop.

           Martin rolls down his window and addresses Schuller:

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 SCHULLER
                        Top’s orders. 
                                 MARTIN
                        Nonsense. It’s just another 
                        Thursday.

           Schuller eyes the large, restless Crowd.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        And put the rifle away. Calm is 
                        contagious.

                                 SCHULLER
                        Yes, sir.

           Martin’s Impala drives on inside. Schuller and Schlager 
           exchange a look. They keep the gate open and signal the Crowd 
           to come forward. 

           The Crowd doesn’t need to be told twice, as they push inside 
           quickly past the Marines.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Kean assesses the scene: smoke rises from the last plane fire 
           finally extinguished. The final vehicle has been pushed off 
           the runway.

                                 KEAN
                        Well, that’s one clear.

                                 BAUER
                        Still pretty rutted.

                                 KEAN
                        Let’s scrounge some sheet metal or 
                        plywood. Lay ‘em across. Best we 
                        can do under the--

           KABOOM! A new barrage of very accurate MORTAR FIRE rains 
           down. Every ducks for cover.

           It’s over nearly as fast as it begun. But a fresh round of 
           burning debris and deeper holes have crippled the runway.

           Kean surveys the damage: all his work has been erased.

           EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER - DAY

           Mung practices blowing smoke rings. Jumps into “business 
           mode” when he sees Kean approaching.

                                 KEAN
                        We’re heading back.
           EXT. STREETS, SAIGON - MORNING

           Mung drives Kean, Bennington and Bauer. They notice the 
           general restlessness and angry stares, each preferring not to 
           mention it out loud.

           As they pass a Western Hotel, they spot an American 
           Photojournalist, JOHN BEINECKE, laden with cameras, and a 
           VIETNAMESE ASSISTANT flagging them down.

           Mung stops.

                                 KEAN
                        Where you headed?

                                 BEINECKE
                        We’re bugging out. Couple of the AP 
                        guys picked up shortwave chatter 
                        from the airport.  

                                 KEAN
                        Then you should know that’s not an 
                        option. Hop in.

           As the two men get in:

                                 BEINECKE
                        Where are the vans? This is 
                        supposed to be an evac pick-up 
                        site.

                                 KEAN
                        We’re not evacuating.

           Beinecke has a hard time processing this.

                                 BEINECKE
                             (”Am I missing 
                              something?”)
                        The city’s under attack.

           INT. EMBASSY VEHICLE - CONTINUOUS

           As Mung drives on.

                                 BEINECKE
                        We need to go by the Colonial? The 
                        AP guys’ll be stranded for sure.

                                 KEAN
                        How many are there?

                                 BEINECKE
                        No more than three.
           Kean sizes up the sedan. It’s going to be cramped.

                                 KEAN
                        Okay.

           EXT. COLONIAL HOTEL - MORNING

           Mung pulls up into a chaotic scene. The AMERICAN JOURNALISTS 
           are being antagonized by a group of YOUNG VIETNAMESE. More 
           Vietnamese Youths are looting nearby.

           Mung stops the car. There are SIX Journalists. Three stuff 
           inside the car. The other three stand on the old sedan’s 
           running boards.

           But the RIOTERS surround the car. A few ROCKS strike the car. 
           The windshield cracks.

           Beinecke starts snapping photos. Kean knocks the camera down.

                                 KEAN
                        You’re not helping.

           As the Rioters gain confidence and come closer, a NATIONAL 
           POLICE OFFICER in white gloves and white helmet (one of the 
           “White Mice” referred to in the sitrep meeting earlier) 
           emerges from the crowd. 

           He DRAWS HIS GUN.

                                 BEINECKE
                        Christ. We heard VC’s had 
                        penetrated the Whie Mice...

           But the White Mouse swings his gun on the Rioters. 

                                 WHITE MOUSE
                             (to Crowd)
                        Stay back!
                             (to Kean)
                        You go to Embassy?

                                 KEAN
                        That’s right.

                                 WHITE MOUSE
                        You will not make it this way.

           He jumps onto the car’s running board.

                                 WHITE MOUSE (CONT’D)
                        I take you.
           EXT. STREETS, SAIGON - MINUTES LATER

           The Embassy car makes slow progress along the streets, 
           getting increasing attention from the local population.

           NARROW STREET

           Mung drives the over-stuffed car down a narrow street. 
           Several vehicles pull up behind them, blocking their retreat.  
           From all directions come another, larger ANGRY MOB.

           They are trapped.

           The White Mouse gets out of the car. Starts trying to reason 
           with the Mob but, even with GUN DRAWN, it’s clear there’s no 
           calming them down.

           The Mob overruns the White Mouse and surrounds the car.

           Some start grabbing at the Americans. Others rock the car. 
           They notice Mung with them.

                                 RIOTER
                             (RE: Mung)
                        He works with the Americans! Even 
                        now!

           Rioters grab at Mung. Kean does his best to protect his 
           driver but there are too many.

           They pull Mung from Kean’s grasp and out of the car. A GUNMAN 
           produces a PISTOL.

           PFFT. The Gunman shoots Mung in the back of the head. Dead.

           The lifeless young Driver consumes Kean’s vision.

           Then the mob turns towards Kean and the Journalists. They 
           rock the sedan. Grab the Americans. Yank Kean from the front 
           seat. ROPES are thrown over lamp posts.

           Then the REVVING of a nearby engine.

           FAR END OF BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           The White Mouse has hot-wired an abandoned BUS. Leaning on 
           the HORN he blasts into the crowd. Forcing them to scatter.

           Kean helps Beinecke and the other Journalists get on board. 

           The White Mouse reverses the bus, tears down the narrow 
           street clipping parked cars. BULLETS chasing them.
           The bus SMASHES through the blockade of cars at the end of 
           the block.

           MAIN STREET

           The White Mouse GRINDS into first gear. The bus lurches 
           forward and away from the furious Mob.

           EXT. FRONT GATE, US EMBASSY - MORNING

           The banged-up bus drives through the gates.

           Kean is first out the door. The grounds are already a quarter 
           full with 1,000 Vietnamese and their belongings. More 
           streaming through the gates.

           Kean addresses Schuller:

                                 KEAN
                        Why’s the gate open?

                                 SCHULLER
                        Ambassador’s orders.

                                 KEAN
                             (off crowd)
                        That makes them our responsibility 
                        now. And there’s no getting them 
                        across town.

           The White Mouse is the last out of the bus.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. For everything.

                                 WHITE MOUSE
                        Of course, my friend.

                                 KEAN
                        Listen to me. There isn’t much 
                        time. You need to get your family. 
                        Bring them back here right away. 
                        I’ll make sure you get out.

                                 WHITE MOUSE
                        Thank you. But no. I can not do 
                        that.

                                 KEAN
                        You’re a South Vietnamese police 
                        officer. The NVA will not hesitate 
                        to shoot you. Understand?
                                 WHITE MOUSE
                        I understand. But this is my home.

           Impressed into silence, Kean can only watch as the White 
           Mouse disappears into the crowd.

           INT. MARTIN’S OFFICE - 1100 HOURS

           Martin button-holed by his DEPUTY and Secretary.

                                 SECRETARY
                        You’ve received several cables from 
                        Washington.

                                 DEPUTY
                        I’ve run out of ways to stall the 
                        Vietnamese. They want to know our 
                        next move.

           Kean ENTERS. 

                                 MARTIN
                        If you’re back that means the 
                        airport’s re-opened.

                                 KEAN
                        It’s pointless.

                                 MARTIN
                        I told you to--

                                 KEAN
                        Anyone plans on leaving Saigon, 
                        it’s helos from there and helos 
                        from here. No more options. No more 
                        time.

                                 MARTIN
                        I need you to do your job. Isn’t 
                        that what you came here to do?

           Kean heads for the door. Shaking his head in dismay.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        One more thing: the two dead

                        Not a word to HQ on the matter. 
                        They’ll order our withdrawal and 
                        Frequent Wind will initiate by 
                        default.

                                 KEAN
                        They have families.

                                 MARTIN
                        And they’ll be notified in good 
                        time. Right now, I need room to 
                        maneuver. And that means re-opening 
                        the airport.

           Kean puts hand back on handle but can’t turn the knob. 
           Clearly conflicted. Then turns around. Defiant.

                                 KEAN
                        I won’t do this any longer.

                                 MARTIN
                        Excuse me?

                                 KEAN
                        I won’t follow more orders that 
                        make the situation worse.

                                 MARTIN
                             (to Secretary)
                        Give us a moment.

           The Secretary heads back to her desk.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Deputy)
                        You too.

           Deputy looks to Martin, who nods wearily.

                                 MARTIN
                        You will address me with deference. 
                        I am the United States Ambassador 
                        to South Vietnam.

                                 KEAN
                        And I respect your authority, sir. 
                        I do. But not at the expense of 
                        reason or compassion. No longer.

                                 MARTIN
                        You’ll do your job or you’ll be 
                        removed.
                                 KEAN
                        Let me tell you about doing my job. 
                        On my second tour here, I was in 
                        charge of an artillery battery on 
                        Hill 712, above a village called Ah 
                        Luoc. Real strategic position. My 
                        job was to control the hill at all 
                        costs. When the VC attacked, which 
                        they did every couple weeks like 
                        clockwork, I cut them down. They’d 
                        arrive with wire tied tight around 
                        their biceps and above the knee, to 
                        slow the inevitable bleeding. But 
                        cut them down we did. And when we’d 
                        find a weapons cache in the village 
                        at our back, we did our best to 
                        find who was responsible. I did my 
                        job. And what I got was a box full 
                        of photos back home of former 
                        friends who are either dead or 
                        unwilling to talk to me. The 
                        conclusion I came to was I didn’t 
                        do my job well enough. So, yeah, I 
                        came back for more. To get it 
                        right. But I’m tired of being a 
                        good Marine.

           Kean goes to the window.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Look outside. Really look.

           Martin finally does. Sees the rising fear and chaos among the 
           gathered people.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        We have lost. And now we are 
                        leaving. 

           Beyond the walls, a group South Vietnamese SOLDIERS strip off 
           their uniforms and toss them away.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        All we can do, the only thing left 
                        to do, is take as many of these 
                        people with us as possible.

           Martin looks away from the window. Heads wearily for the 
           door. No acknowledgement of Kean or his words.

           Kean watches him go: “I’ve lost him.”
           EXT. CHANCERY BUILDING, US EMBASSY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennington follows Martin outside and catches up inside

           GATE

           Schuller and Schlager try to keep ARRIVING VIETNAMESE 
           entering in an orderly fashion.

                                 BENNINGTON
                        I have orders to keep you on the 
                        grounds, sir.

                                 MARTIN
                        And when you can’t?

                                 BENNINGTON
                        To follow you.

                                 MARTIN
                             (annoyed)
                        Just stretching my legs.

           Martin does an about face. Bennington keeps his eyes on him 
           until the Ambassador disappears around some low-story out-
           buildings.

           INT./EXT. MAINTENANCE BUILDING, EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           Martin ENTERS.

           Heads down a hall then fishes out a key and unlocks what 
           looks like a storage closet. 

           STORAGE CLOSET

           In the rear of the small room is a METAL DOOR. Martin slides 
           back a heavy bolt and steps into

           EXT. COURTYARD, FRENCH EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           French flag on a pole.

           INT. AMBASSADOR’S OFFICE, FRENCH EMBASSY - DAY

           Martin and the French Ambassador. Martin drops heavily off 
           his cane and into his chair.

                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR
                        The Soviets have declined to get 
                        involved.
                                 MARTIN
                        They might posture that way but 
                        their interests go deep here. Maybe 
                        you missed a signal.

                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR
                             (tight)
                        I don’t think so. They were rather 
                        blunt.

                                 MARTIN
                        They don’t want to overstep the 
                        Chinese if it means getting tripped 
                        up.

                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR
                        There is nothing left I can do. 

                                 MARTIN
                        You must take another swing at 
                        them. Pick up the phone, tell them 
                        you have more--

                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR
                             (”We’re done here.”)
                        There is nothing left.

           Martin rises slowly. Painfully.

                                 MARTIN
                        Nothing but follow your dusty 
                        playbook, you mean. Find a stronger 
                        nation to take up a fight you’re 
                        too tired to keep fighting 
                        yourself. 
                             (reaches door)
                        Too bad there isn’t one.

           EXT. FRENCH EMBASSY - DAY

           Martin steps out onto the street. Walks away from the 
           American Embassy. Needs to gather his thoughts.

           EXT. PLAZA, SAIGON - DAY

           Martin sits on a bench. Smokes a cigarette despite his shitty 
           lungs. COUGHS heavy.

           Two SMALL BOYS across the square LAUGH and chase a pigeon 
           around a fountain. Martin watches transfixed until the BOYS’ 
           MOTHER comes to an open window and calls them inside.
           EXT. FRONT GATE, US EMBASSY - DAY

           With a bit more giddyup in his tired legs, Martin strides 
           past a perplexed Bennington: "How the hell'd he get by me?"

           INT. HALL OUTSIDE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, CHANCERY - DAY

           Norman sees Kean walking past.

                                 NORMAN
                        Major, sir.

           Kean backs up. 

                                 NORMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got your wife.

           Kean ENTERS. But is intercepted by:

                                 MARTIN’S SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        The Ambassador wants to see you. 

           Kean turns.

                                 MARTIN’S SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Immediately.

           She’s giving him the stink-eye.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Norman/RE: Rosanne)
                        Guess I’ll be seeing her soon 
                        enough.

           Kean follows Martin’s Secretary down the hall.

                                 NORMAN (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. Kean, I can’t track 
                        him down...

           INT. MARTIN’S OFFICE, CHANCERY - DAY

           Kean ENTERS.

                                 KEAN
                        I suppose you’re gonna declare me 
                        mentally exhausted, like Al 
                        Francis.

                                 MARTIN
                             (gentle)
                        Sit down.
                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        My son, Glenn, took shrapnel to the 
                        spine in ‘67. Died in medivac. I 
                        vowed to make his death and the 
                        fifty-eight thousand other American 
                        kids count for something. 

                                 KEAN
                             (off photo on desk)
                        Good looking kid.

           Martin picks up the PHOTO OF THE YOUNG MAN.

                                 MARTIN
                        That’s my other son. Gaye. Car 
                        accident. Wanna tell me which makes 
                        less sense?

                                 KEAN
                        Glenn and the others were 
                        fulfilling our promise to help 
                        these people.

                                 MARTIN
                        And that’s what I’ve been trying to 
                        do. Find a way to keep the country 
                        together.

                                 KEAN
                        The country is lost. The people can 
                        still be saved.

                                 MARTIN
                             (maybe coming around)
                        My superiors aren’t interested in 
                        saving Vietnamese lives.

                                 KEAN
                        From here to the end, we do what’s 
                        right. Not what’s ordered.

                                 MARTIN
                             (all in)
                        That will require diplomacy. 
                             (conceding Kean’s role)
                        And some heroes, too.
                             (punching intercom)
                        Get me General Carey aboard the 
                        Blue Ridge.

           EXT. USS BLUE RIDGE, OFF THE COAST OF VIETNAM - ESTABLISHING
           INT. CONTROL ROOM, USS BLUE RIDGE - DAY

           An agitated GENERAL CAREY (50’s), by-the-book from his crew 
           cut to his polished shoes, grabs a phone handed to him by a 
           Crewman.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. MARTIN’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 MARTIN
                             (into phone)
                        General Carey. I’m ordering 
                        Operation Frequent Wind. Option IV.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Jesus. Helos from the airport?

                                 MARTIN
                        And the embassy as well.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                             (alarmed)
                        The embassy? Mr. Ambassador, a 
                        thousand moving parts make that 
                        impossible.

                                 MARTIN
                        Nevertheless, those are the facts 
                        on the ground. When can I expect 
                        evac to commence.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                             (unhappy/off watch)
                        1400 hours.

                                 MARTIN
                        We’ll be ready.

           Martin hangs up.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Kean)
                        Let’s hope this works.

           “WHITE CHRISTMAS” MONTAGE:

           Kean walks down the hall to 

           COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Norman jumps to attention.
                                 KEAN
                        Frequent Wind. Call it in.

           Norman, surprised and excited, grabs a land line.

           INT. RADIO STATION, SAIGON - CONTINUOUS

           A phone RINGS. The American STATION MANAGER picks it up.

                                 STATION MANAGER
                        Radio Free Vietnam.

                                 NORMAN
                        Christmas has come early.

           The Manager nearly drops the cigarette from his mouth. Hangs 
           up. Then flips through a stack of 45’s until he finds what 
           he’s looking for: Bing Crosby’s WHITE CHRISTMAS. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - SAME TIME

           All the Marines assemble.

                                 KEAN
                        When the shit hits, everybody runs 
                        for the American flag. And that's 
                        here. We’ll be looking out our 
                        window at an Alamo-type situation.

           The Marines go quiet. Digesting the news.

           INT. HALL, RADIO STATION - SAME TIME

           Manager walks down a hall, and stops outside the window below 
           the ON AIR light of

           STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           A DEEJAY looks through the glass wall and goes pale when he 
           sees the Manager holding the record to the glass. 

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 KEAN
                        I don’t know what’s coming over 
                        those walls. Or how it’s coming. 
                        But I can promise one thing: when 
                        it does, we will fight like 
                        Marines.
           INT. STUDIO, RADIO STATION - SAME TIME

           The DEEJAY cues up the record with shaky hands on the open, 
           second turntable. He fades down the volume on the first 
           turntable, interrupting a Peggy Lee standard.

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 KEAN
                        And if we have to, we will die like 
                        Marines.

           INT. STUDIO, RADIO STATION - SAME TIME

                                 DEEJAY
                        And now for the weather. It’s 105 
                        degrees and rising here in Saigon.

           He starts up White Christmas. Grabs his personal effects and 
           runs out.

           INT. SITUATION ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 KEAN
                             (loud)
                        Every Marine a rifleman!

           A ROAR fills the room.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           RADIOS all across the city broadcast Bing Crosby crooning 
           WHITE CHRISTMAS. 

           This signal was an open secret. Not only did the Americans 
           know it, but so did all the Vietnamese. Chaos engulfs the 
           city. 

           SAIGON SHOPS -- SHOPKEEPERS close abruptly. Locking their 
           doors against the coming chaos.

           SAIGON STREET -- A SQUAD of South Vietnamese INFANTRYMEN 
           squabble among themselves. Several throw down their rifles 
           and walk away.

           GATES, US EMBASSY -- Schuller, Schlager and Sullivan close 
           the gates against a tide of approaching Vietnamese waving 
           documents and money. PROTESTS go up.

           MESS HALL, US EMBASSY -- Frain and Bauer do weapons checks.

           ROOFTOP, CHANCERY BUILDING, US EMBASSY -- Gevers shovels 
           PALLETS OF US DOLLARS into the incinerator.
           WALL, US EMBASSY -- Norman and Babel establish machine gun 
           nests at strategic corners.

           BUNK ROOM, US EMBASSY -- Valdez packs a few belongings, 
           including photograph of May Li.

           VIETNAMESE APARTMENT -- May Li, her AGING PARENTS and SISTER 
           with two INFANT CHILDREN gather with a few other families 
           around a RADIO at a Neighbor’s House. 

           PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY -- Marines HOSE DOWN the grounds. 

                                 KEAN
                        Sea Knights on the roof pad for the 
                        Americans and Jolly Green Giants 
                        down here for the locals. The 
                        water’ll keep us from choking on 
                        kicked-up debris.

           ROOF, US EMBASSY -- Schlager and Gevers paint a bright yellow 
           “H” inside a circle on an elevated section of the roof.

                                 SCHLAGER
                             (off their handiwork)
                        Why not just put a big bull’s eye 
                        on there for Charlie while we’re at 
                        it.

           PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY -- Kean oversees the tamarind tree 
           finally cut down in parking lot. Gas-powered chain saws lop 
           off large branches. Chains hitched to two trucks rip away the 
           stump.

           Marines CHEER as Martin watches from his office window.

           Frain cups his hands, shouts in Martin’s direction:

                                 FRAIN
                        Timberrrrrrrr!

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. SAIGON - DAY

           Aerial view of streets. Like ants approaching the embassy 
           from all directions.

           EXT. GATES, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Increasing chaos. Desperate LOCALS climbing over razor wire 
           or slipping in whenever the gate is briefly opened. 

           Schuller, Schlager and Sullivan do their best to maintain 
           order, but they’re on the losing side.
                                 SCHULLER
                        This is crazy. We should’ve bugged 
                        out months ago. What’re we still 
                        doing risking our necks for these 
                        ungrateful bastards? Look at them. 
                        Half of ‘em want to slit my throat. 

                                 SCHLAGER
                        Count me among them, if it’ll shut 
                        you up.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        They’re scared is all.

                                 SCHULLER
                        I’m only saying, let them fix their 
                        own damn mess.

                                 KEAN (O.S.)
                        And what mess is that, Sargent?

           They didn’t see him approach.

                         SULLIVAN
                                                        SCHULLER
           Major.
                                              Major.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Schuller)
                        One we helped make.

                                 SCHULLER
                        Yes, sir.

           Kean distributes CHECKLISTS to the Marines.

                                 KEAN
                        Here’s the story. We can’t save the 
                        whole city. But we’re going to get 
                        out as many at greatest risk as 
                        possible. Anyone comes to the gate 
                        on this list gets through. Plus 
                        immediate family members. These 
                        people have risked everything to 
                        openly collaborate with us over the 
                        past fifteen years. They stay 
                        behind, they’re as good as dead.

                                 SCHLAGER
                             (under breath)
                        Goes for us, too.
           EXT. SWIMMING POOL, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Kean confers with Gevers, who occasionally stops to speak 
           Vietnamese to some of the thousand plus locals gathered 
           already.

                                 GEVERS
                        Got ‘em in sticks of 50, Major.

                                 KEAN
                        Good. But tell them to ditch the 
                        bags. No weight in the birds that 
                        isn’t breathing.  

                                 GEVERS
                        I’ve tried explaining, but they 
                        won’t part with ‘em. Some folks are 
                        backing their arguments with guns.

                                 KEAN
                        Toss everything into the pool. 
                        Weapons, too.

                                 GEVERS
                        They’re already using the pool to, 
                        uh, relieve themselves.

                                 KEAN
                        All the less likely they’ll jump in 
                        after their stuff.

                                 GEVERS
                        Roger that.

           They turn skyward at the first sounds of what will become the 
           familiar THRUMMING of incoming HELICOPTERS.

           INT. “LADY ACE 09” CH-46 HELICOPTER, ABOVE SAIGON - DAY

           The TAK-TAK-TAK of small-caliber bullets clipping the 
           fuselage. Relatively young CO-PILOT white knuckles it.

           Veteran USAF PILOT GERALD “GERRY” BERRY (30’s), coolly at the 
           controls.

                                 BERRY
                        Go ahead. Ask.

                                 CO-PILOT
                             (distracted by bullets)
                        What?

                                 BERRY
                        Everybody asks. I got two. 
                                 CO-PILOT
                        Captain?

                                 BERRY
                        DFC’s, man. Distinguished Flying 
                        Cross. Gold star in lieu of the 
                        second.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        We’re taking flak, sir.

                                 BERRY
                        That’s rifle fire.

           Louder EXPLOSIONS ending in smoke puffs near the helo.

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        That’s anti-aircraft.

           Berry deftly puts the helicopter into a steep bank.

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                             (continuing)
                        My brother-in-law’s got a second 
                        star. Never shuts up about it.

           EXT. AIRSPACE ABOVE CHANCERY ROOFTOP - DAY

           Berry brings in his dual-rotor CH-46 SEA KNIGHT heads for the 
           roof. 44 feet long, 7 feet wide and capable of a 12-ton 
           takeoff weight.

           EXT. ROOF, US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

           Berry guides “Lady Ace 09” to a perfect landing on the yellow 
           “H”.

           EXT. AIRSPACE ABOVE PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

           Another helicopter, this one a massive CH-53 JOLLY GREEN 
           GIANT reaches the parking lot. THUMPING a 78-foot single 
           rotor. 88 feet long, 14 feet wide and capable of a 20-ton 
           takeoff weight.

           With remarkable skill, the CH-53 performs a 100-FOOT STRAIGHT 
           VERTICAL DROP landing squarely on the freshly painted “H” 
           next to the tamarind stump hole.

           EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME

           Kean is there to meet Berry. They shake hands through the 
           pilot-side window.
                                 BERRY
                        Any chance I’m bringing out the 
                        Ambassador per orders?

                                 KEAN
                        In good time. Got some other cargo 
                        first.

           Berry sees the Evacuees crowding around the pool below.

                                 BERRY
                        We’ve got you boys covered.

           INT. MESS HALL - DAY

           Frain addresses the waiting Americans.

                                 FRAIN
                        First 40! With me!

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY - DAY

           Bauer comes to Berry’s open window. Yells over the ROTOR 
           NOISE.

                                 BAUER
                        Any trouble?

                                 BERRY
                             (shrugging)
                        Took some rifle fire. Kid’s stuff.

           Frain leads the 40 Americans on to the roof. Bauer directs 
           them up Lady Ace 09’s lowered skiff.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY - SAME TIME

           Gevers guides the first “stick” of 50 Vietnamese to the back 
           of the Chinook. They scurry up the opened tail.

           The stick is fully loaded. The pilot begins to lift off. But 
           sees Kean burst from the Chancery, frantically waving him 
           back down.

           The Pilot drops the helo hard to the ground as Kean, running 
           from the Chancery, and Gevers converge at his window.

                                 PILOT
                             (frantic)
                        What the hell’s wrong?

                                 KEAN
                        You took to the air too easy.
                                 PILOT
                             (calming/confused)
                        Sir? 

                                 GEVERS
                        We’ve got 50 on board, sir.

                                 PILOT
                        That’s my max payload.

                                 KEAN
                             (delighted/correcting him)
                        50 Americans. These guys live on 
                        rice and bean sprouts. Not one of 
                        them breaks 120 pounds. We can get 
                        another 20 on board. Let’s go! 

           Gevers yells to the next stick of waiting Vietnamese, waving:

                                 GEVERS
                        The next twenty.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Gevers)
                        Re-organize the rest into sticks of 
                        70. We’ll get 40% more out!
                             (practically kissing him)
                        40%!

           EXT. ROOF - DAY

           Valdez keeps track of overall numbers on a CHALKBOARD. 

           Helos: 2
           US Remaining: 1,960
           SV Evac’d: 70

           And so the evacuation begins.

           INT. NEIGHBOR’S APARTMENT, SAIGON - DAY

           May Li and Family talk together while NEIGHBORS have been 
           having a conversation in the kitchen. 

                                 MAY LI’S FATHER
                        The Communists can’t be any worse 
                        than the Capitalists.
           Elder Neighbor returns to their group.

                                 ELDER NEIGHBOR
                        We are sorry but May Li is no 
                        longer welcome here. She will bring 
                        trouble to those around her when 
                        the Communists arrive.

           May Li rises to leave.

                                 MAY LI
                        We must leave this place.

           Her family stays put.

                                 MAY LI’S MOTHER
                        Saigon is our home.

                                 MAY LI’S SISTER
                        You only want to be with your 
                        American boyfriend.

                                 MAY LI
                        I want a place to live without 
                        fear. That’s not here.

                                 MAY LI'S MOTHER
                        Because the Americans came and 
                        destroyed everything.

                                 MAY LI'S FATHER
                        We have no reason to trust them.

           May Li EXITS alone.

           INT. MAY LI’S HOME - DAY

           May Li gathers up clothing. Stuffs a few bags. Artillery 
           rounds SHAKE the building. Electricity goes out.

           She lights an OIL LAMP, which gives her an idea...

           EXT. STREET, SAIGON - DAY

           May Li’s Sister, Mother, Father and Nieces walk home from 
           Neighbor’s House. Two American Chinooks fly low overheard, 
           taking evacuees to safety.

           FIREMEN rush past them from behind.

           The family follows Firemen around the corner and see:
           MAY LI’S HOUSE - DAY

           A FIRE now under control but the damage has been done. May Li 
           stands in front with the luggage she collected.

                                 MAY LI
                        Now we must make a new home.

           As the family processes May Li’s arson::

                                 MAY LI (CONT’D)
                        I don’t trust the Americans either. 
                        But Juan is a good man. He will 
                        help us.

           INT. MARTIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Kean knocks as he enters. Martin clearly expecting him.

                                 MARTIN
                        Where have you been? You need to 
                        hear this.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CULTURAL AFFAIRS OFFICE, FIFTH FLOOR, CHANCERY - DAY

           CIA Officer Frank Snepp stuffs the last files into a brief 
           case, while Marines gather the rest of the documents.

           Kean and Martin ENTER. 

                                 SNEPP
                             (to Marines/off docs)
                        Shred the rest.

                                 MARTIN
                        Tell him what you told me.

           Snepp EXITS to 

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kean and Martin in pursuit.

                                 SNEPP
                        Our intelligence lines are badly 
                        compromised but we’re picking up 
                        chatter from General Dung’s camp.
           STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

                                 SNEPP
                        The sense is that he’s planning to 
                        enter the city at 6pm and attack 
                        the embassy. Mortars. RPG’s. Worse 
                        than the airport.

           Kean and Martin follow Snepp upstairs and onto

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY - CONTINUOUS

           An Air America Huey Helicopter waits. Rotors WHIRRING.

                                 SNEPP
                        You’ll have to be out by then.

           Snepp waves his hand “adios” and gets on the helo. 

                                 KEAN
                        I can’t clear this place in three 
                        hours.

                                 SNEPP
                        If you don’t, Dung will.

           They watch the last CIA officer leave Saigon.

           Martin looks down below at the swimming pool area. It remains 
           packed with more than 3,000 Vietnamese. 

                                 MARTIN
                        We can’t just leave them behind.

                                 KEAN
                        If there’s an attack at 6PM, we 
                        need only Americans on every 
                        chopper from here out.

           Martin can’t take his eyes off the Vietnamese: “Still so many 
           to save.” Looking at them in daylight gives him a thought:

                                 MARTIN
                        What if there isn’t an attack at 
                        6PM?

                                 KEAN
                        You heard Snepp.

                                 MARTIN
                        I heard him say he’s got “the 
                        sense” Dung is going to attack. He 
                        doesn’t know for sure.
                                 KEAN
                        I doubt Snepp wants us to parse his 
                        words so closely.

                                 MARTIN
                        I met Dung once. In Paris. He’s 
                        vain. And power hungry--

                                 KEAN
                        There’s too much at stake for 
                        speculation--

                                 MARTIN
                        If Dung attacks tonight, that means 
                        the city falls during darkness. The 
                        world reads of his victory but 
                        there will be no photographs. No 
                        news footage. The first war to be 
                        fought on television, would end on 
                        radio. I don’t think that’s how the 
                        General, who wants to announce that 
                        he sent the world’s greatest power 
                        running, sees this playing out.

                                 KEAN
                        Graham, if you’re wrong, hundreds 
                        of Americans might die. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Me among them. I understand. But if 
                        I’m right, we can save thousands 
                        more South Vietnamese.

                                 KEAN
                        It’s your call, Mr. Ambassador.

           Martin thinks it over. Making this kind of call is why he 
           joined the foreign service 40 years ago.

                                 MARTIN
                        Dung wants to maximize the 
                        publicity for winning as much as 
                        our brass wants to minimize it for 
                        losing.

                                 KEAN
                        Alright. Then we evac as many 
                        people as we can before dawn. 
                        Deadline be damned.

           Martin nods, agreeing to take the gamble.
           EXT. GATE, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Kean approaches his Gate Marines: Sullivan, Schlager, and 
           Schuller. Schlager stuffs the list of high priority evacuees 
           into Sullivan’s hands. Annoyed.

                                 KEAN
                        What’s going on?

                                 SULLIVAN
                        The list is shit. Maybe a hundred 
                        checked off so far.

                                 SCHLAGER
                        List or no list, Major, these folks 
                        are flat-out desperate. 

                                 KEAN
                        Okay, new rule. Use your judgment. 
                        But you let ‘em through that gate, 
                        it’s a promise that the US Marine 
                        Corps will protect them. So every 
                        one you plan on saving better be 
                        more worthwhile than the nine you 
                        turn away.

           He scans their faces. Convinced they get the picture.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright then.

           Kean leaves.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Okay, Marines. Time to triage.

                                 SCHULLER
                        Time to play God, you mean.

           EXT. GATE, US EMBASSY - DAY

           An old EMBASSY WORKER (seen briefly earlier) arrives.

                                 SULLIVAN
                             (recognizing him/waving)
                        Diehm Vu. Welcome.

                                 DIEHM VU
                        Mister Sullivan, sir.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Get in here.
           Sullivan clears a path through the gate.  Then Sullivan spots 
           the ROPE tied around his waist. 

           Tethered behind Vu, snaking through the Crowd outside the 
           walls are his RELATIVES, tied together in a long chain. 
           Sullivan can’t see the end.

                                 SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        How many are with you?

                                 DIEHM VU
                        Forty-five.

                                 SULLIVAN
                             (gently)
                        This is too many. You can only 
                        bring ten.

           Diehm Vu looks back at his extended family. Tears well up in 
           his eyes.

                                 DIEHM VU
                        Please. I have so many...

                                 SULLIVAN
                        It’s the best I can do.

           Diehm Vu grows increasingly distraught.

                                 DIEHM VU
                        I can not live with making such a 
                        choice. They are all my family.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        I’m sorry. There’s no other way.

                                 DIEHM VU
                        Please. You choose, Mister 
                        Sullivan. 

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Me?

                                 DIEHM VU
                        Please. 

           It’s Sullivan’s turn to look with distress along the string 
           of family members.

                                 SULLIVAN
                             (reluctantly)
                        Your wife. Your daughters and any 
                        grandchildren.
                                 DIEHM VU
                        Very well. Thank you.

           Diehm Vu begins speaking to his Family. CRIES erupt 
           immediately from everyone. Diehm Vu acts as decisively as 
           possible. But Sullivan can’t watch any more.

           Motions to Schlager to join Schuller running point.

                                 SULLIVAN
                             (exiting/making up excuse)
                        I need to check on rations.

           Schuller opens the gate for Vu and His Family, who enter. But 
           the Crowd reacts and one of Vu’s Daughter gets pushed 
           backwards. She SCREAMS for help.

           Schuller wades into the Crowd to get her.

           An angry ARVN REGULAR gets in Schuller’s face.

                                 ARVN REGULAR
                        You leave us! You shit! You shit!

           Schuller pushes him aside and grabs hold of Vu’s Daughter. 

           Schlager, joined now by Gevers, do their best to maintain 
           security at the open gate, but dozens of people leak past 
           them.

           As Schuller turns back towards the gate, he is BAYONETTED by 
           the ARVN Regular. The steel point plunging into the Marine’s 
           side.

           Gevers surges into the Crowd. He BASHES the ARVN Regular in 
           the head with the butt of his rifle. Blood instantly pours 
           from the man’s head as his eyes roll back and he drops into 
           the crowd. Alive or dead, we’ll never know.

           Bennington grabs Vu’s Daughter and Schuller stumbles back 
           inside, as Schlager closes the gate.

           PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Schuller, seated, examines his side. He sticks TWO FINGERS up 
           to their SECOND KNUCKLE inside the deep wound. 

           Kean is now standing over him.

                                 KEAN
                        You’re out on the next bird.

           Schuller pulls a RAG from his pocket and stuffs it inside the 
           hole.
                                 SCHULLER
                        I’m good, Major.

           Kean eyes him suspiciously.

                                 SCHULLER (CONT’D)
                        Got a job to do, sir. 

                                 KEAN
                             (after weighing it over)
                        Alright. But you’re off the gate. 
                        Head to the roof. Report to... 
                        damnit.

                                 BABEL
                        Bauer, sir?

                                 KEAN
                        Right, Bauer. You’ll help him guide 
                        in the helos.

           Kean’s already on to the next fire: another skirmish at the 
           gate. More people slip through. Kean heads over to

           GATE - CONTINUOUS

                                 KEAN
                        Lock it up!

                                 SCHLAGER
                        Sir?

                                 KEAN
                        New rule! Lock it up, now! We can’t 
                        keep going out there. 

           Schlager puts a massive BOLT LOCK on the gate, right in front 
           of LOH PAT, one of the many desperate to leave but who lack 
           paperwork. 

           The anxiety of the crowd rises yet another notch.

                                 BABEL
                        How’re we gonna get anyone else in?

                                 KEAN
                        Schlager. Over here.

           Schlager meets Kean at part of the fence, where another 
           Marine has spotted a Westerner.

           Kean stands on top of Schlager’s shoulders and reaches over 
           the top of the fence. The Westerner gets boosted up from the 
           outside and grabs hold of Kean’s hands.
           Up and over the Westerner scrambles. Drops safely inside the 
           Embassy.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s how.

           Kean spots May Li pushing her way through the crowd outside.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Somebody better get Top.

           EXT. FENCE NEAR GATE, US EMBASSY - MOMENTS LATER

           Valdez runs to the fence.

                                 VALDEZ
                        May! May!

           May Li hears him, redirects away from the gate, fights 
           through a thinner section of the crowd to reach him. But the 
           crowd is still big enough to keep jostling her.

                                 MAY LI
                        John!

                                 VALDEZ
                        You’re alright now. Let’s get you 
                        inside.
                             (to Babel)
                        Give me a hand.

           Babel approaches...

                                 MAY LI
                        No. I can’t.

           ...Babel backs off again, giving the lovers room to work 
           things out.

                                 VALDEZ
                        It’s easy. We just lift you over. 

                                 MAY LI
                        But my family.

           She cranes her neck to see them. Valdez, taller, has a better 
           view:

           ACROSS THE ROAD, NEAR GATE - CONTINUOUS

           May Li’s aging Parents, Sister and tiny Nieces stand back 
           from the edge of the crowd.
           FENCE - CONTINUOUS

                                 VALDEZ
                        I can’t leave the grounds. But 
                        bring them here.

                                 MAY LI
                        It is too dangerous for them. They 
                        are weak and afraid.

           Valdez grabs her hands through the chain link. Partly just to 
           keep her from being pushed away by the “current”.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Please, May. 

                                 MAY LI
                        I made them come this far. I can’t 
                        leave them now.

                                 VALDEZ
                        And I can’t leave my post. I would 
                        go with you, baby--

           He shakes the chain link in frustration. She strokes his 
           hand.

                                 MAY LI
                        I know, Big John.

                                 VALDEZ
                             (softly pivoting)
                        No one calls me that.

                                 MAY LI
                             (teasing)
                        You need a good nickname. 
                             (beat)
                        We will be together again. I 
                        promise.

           Valdez closes his eyes for an anguished beat. Then fishes 
           around in his pocket and hands May Li a set of KEYS.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Take my Jeep if it hasn’t been 
                        jacked. It’s out front of Marine 
                        House. You need to hurry. Don’t try 
                        the port, it’ll be worse than here. 
                        Go to the SV air force base at Lap 
                        Sam. Find a plane, a helicopter, 
                        anything.
                                 MAY LI
                        I will.

                                 VALDEZ
                        When you reach the fleet, you tell 
                        them to find me.

                                 MAY LI
                        Alright.

           May lets go of his hand and starts drifting back into the 
           crowd.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Lap Sam! Don’t forget!

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SAIGON - DAY

           The NVA Army rolls past abandoned and destroyed South 
           Vietnamese military vehicles and equipment.

           A road-side sign in Vietnamese advertises for a Motorcycle 
           Store, complete with map to its location Central Saigon and 
           the distance: 6KM.

           EXT. 7TH FLEET, 40 MILES OFFSHORE - DAY

           Berry pilots the Lady Ace 09 as it reaches the carriers and 
           support ships in international waters.

           INT. LADY ACE 09 - DAY

           Berry spots one of the small four-passenger HU-1 “Huey” 
           helicopters coming upon him. He makes a quick maneuver to 
           find clear space.

                                 CO-PILOT
                             (off Huey)
                        Air America?

                                 BERRY
                        Nope. South Vietnamese pilot with 
                        an evacuation plan of his own. 
                        Can’t exactly blame him.

                                 CO-PILOT
                        How many Hueys they got?

                                 BERRY
                             (”Things are gonna get 
                              ugly up here.”)
                        Hundreds.
           EXT. 7TH FLEET, 40 MILES OFF THE COAST - DAY

           Complete chaos in the skies and on decks.

           A constant flow of South Vietnamese Huey Pilots guide their 
           birds on a one-way trip to reach the fleet.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - DAY

           One of the Huey’s BUZZES the deck. SQUAWKING in Vietnamese 
           from its PA system. Carey’s EX-O nearby.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        What do they want?

                                 EX-O
                        I think they want to land.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        They can’t land here! We’re in the 
                        middle of a military operation.

                                 EX-O
                        They barely have enough fuel for 
                        the one-way trip. They’re gonna 
                        escape or die trying. 

           General Carey assesses his options then:

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Alright. Set ‘em down. They’re 
                        turning our air space into a 
                        demolition derby.

                                 EX-O
                        Yes, sir.

           The first Huey lands. More line-up to follow in her wake. 

                                 EX-O (CONT’D)
                        Get her off the deck!

           US DECKHANDS frantically drag the Huey on its skiffs to the 
           ship’s edge. Then PUSH IT OVERBOARD. 

           Soon, Hueys land wherever and whenever possible. The same 
           fate is repeated for each landing Huey.
           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING - 1759 HOURS

           Kean verifies the time on his watch: one minute to witching 
           hour. 6PM. He and Valdez scan the city limits to his north 
           and west, looking for signs of an aerial attack.

           INT./EXT. US EMBASSY - SAME TIME

           Martin at his desk. Schuller and Schlager at the front gate. 
           The whole place goes completely still. The Marines hold their 
           collective breath.

           EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Kean sees the second hand sweep past the top of the hour... 
           All round him stop and stare at the sky... 

           The silence maintains. Kean exhales when...

           CRASH. Kean jumps out of his skin:

           Next to him, Bauer has just reached the roof from the 
           stairwell and slammed the METAL DOOR behind him. Kean and a 
           half-dozen Marines standing nearby stare slack-jawed at 
           Bauer: 

                                 BAUER
                             (confused)
                        What?

           While the Marines give Bauer shit, Valdez looks to Kean.  

                                 VALDEZ
                        Guess that means we’ve got until 
                        sunrise.

                                 KEAN
                        By then we’ll be gone.

           EXT. FRONT GATE, LAP SAM SOUTH VIETNAM AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

           May Li and her family reach the base in Valdez’ Jeep. They 
           all get out.

           The gate house has been abandoned.

                                 MAY LI 
                        Come on.

           She ENTERS

           LAP SAM AFB - CONTINUOUS

           The place is already looted and deserted.
           There is nothing here. No one here.

                                 MAY LI’S SISTER
                        No way forward. No way back.

                                 MAY LI
                        I’m sorry.

           But everyone is too tired to leave.

           The quiet is cut by a distant ENGINE WHINE, growing louder. 
           The family watches as a JET FIGHTER lands at the distant end 
           of the runway and taxis towards them.

           Pilot Bui, scarf waving, hops from the cockpit onto the wing. 
           Then jumps to the ground. He takes a look at the plane: 
           ripped to shreds. Then off the desertion around him:

                                 PILOT BUI
                             (to self)
                        Cowards. I’ll fight alone if I 
                        must.

           He runs over to a wheeled gas tank. Opens the tap: bone dry. 
           He kicks it in frustration.

           He sinks to the ground. Defeated.

                                 MAY LI
                        Excuse me.
                             (he offers no reply)
                        Excuse me.

                                 PILOT BUI
                             (ignoring her)
                        South Vietnam is gone.

                                 MAY LI
                        We are South Vietnam.

           This finally gets his attention. He turns to look at her. 
           Struck by her beauty.

                                 MAY LI (CONT’D)
                        You can still help us to leave 
                        Saigon.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        You and everyone else. The pilots 
                        have all left. Everyone has gone.
                             (skyward)
                        Cowards! The country needed you!
                             (to May Li)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PILOT BUI (CONT'D)
                        They took all the aircraft. 
                        Anything they can fly.

                                 MAY LI
                        What about that?

           Pilot Bui follows her outstretched arm in direction of:

           An American CH-53 HELICOPTER.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        The ailerons are shattered. They

           Pilot Bui, May Li and Family over the Pacific. 

           Pilot Bui jabs at the FUEL GAGE as it rides empty.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        You said forty miles.

                                 MAY LI
                        Yes.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        You better be right.

           EXT. USS COOK - DAY

           A Destroyer Class ship. All towers and step-back decks with 
           no room to land anything but a single small Huey.

           One such Huey, ripped to shreds with one landing skid askew, 
           touches down.

           It’s hemorrhaging gasoline and oil. Emergency Crews rush over 
           as the evacuating Air America Pilot and his Vietnamese 
           passengers jump from the busted helo.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - SAME TIME

           Half a mile away, General Carey observes the chaos with 
           powerful binoculars.
           His eyes catch sight of something that prompts him to lower 
           the binocs:

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Who in hell is that?

           Into the chaos on the USS Cook storms Pilot Bui’s CH-53. It’s 
           five times the size of the little Hueys.

                                 GENERAL CAREY (CONT’D)
                        He wants to land a Cadillac on a 
                        pool table!

           The USS Cook’s Deck Flagmen wave him off furiously. There’s 
           no safe place to land his big bird.

           Pilot Bui struggles to keep the bucking helo relatively 
           stable.

                                 PILOT BUI
                             (off Flagmen)

                        Open the door.

           May Li and her Sister step to the edge of the open helo side 
           door.

                                 USS COOK CAPTAIN
                        Get the nets!

           EXT. ABOVE THE 7TH FLEET - DAY

           Berry heading back for another run spots the action on deck 
           of the USS Cook.

                                 BERRY
                        Jee-sus. We better see how this 
                        plays out.

           EXT. DECK, USS COOK - DAY

           Cargo netting is hustled into place beneath the rollicking 
           Chinook. May Li and her Sister pantomime an argument beneath 
           the SCREAMING ROTORS. May Li finally pushes her Sister out.

           She lands safely in the netting.

           Then May Li’s Parents drop to safety.
           Finally, May Li holds her infant Niece above the net. As she 
           releases the child, the Chinook bucks violently. The child 
           arcs through the air... and into the arms of a Marine.

           May Li looks to Pilot Bui.

                                 PILOT BUI
                        Go on! I’ll be alright.

           May Li jumps into the net.

           Pilot Bui guides the Chinook away a safe distance. Balancing 
           a few precarious feet over the waves.

           INT. PILOT BUI’S CH-53 - CONTINUOUS

           Pilot Bui takes his scarf and ties it between the steering 
           stick and the instrument panel.

           He cinches it tight, and the huge helicopter banks violently 
           to the left. Pilot Bui slides out the open door. 

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           Pilot Bui drops into the water, disappearing from sight as 
           the Chinook crashes into the sea above him. Rotors breaking, 
           sending flying twisted metal in every direction, including 
           broadside the USS Cook.

           A POOL OF RED LIQUID gathers where Pilot Bui was last seen.

                                 CO-PILOT

                        That’s not blood. That’s Hydraulic 
                        fluid.

           Sure enough, Pilot Bui finally resurfaces. Offers up a jaunty 
           salute.
           EXT. DECK, USS COOK - CONTINUOUS

           A CHEER goes up from all topside as a Rescue Skiff is sent to 
           pick him up.

           A smiling Berry banks his helicopter away towards the 
           mainland.

           A CH-53 lands on the roof. A CH-46 takes off from the parking

           EXT. GATES, US EMBASSY - DAY

           Kean oversees the chaos at the gates.

           The DISH WASHER from the red light bar (also seen briefly 
           before) reaches the fence. He speaks no English. He hands a 
           grubby, old folded note to Schlager.

                                 DISH WASHER
                        Please? Yes?

           Schlager reads it as Schuller watches.

                                 SCHULLER
                        What gives?

                                 SCHLAGER
                        The guy used to bus tables at the 
                        officer’s club in Da Nang. It’s a 
                        letter of thanks from some captain.

                                 SCHULLER
                        Jesus.

                                 SCHLAGER
                             (to Dish Washer)
                        I’m sorry. No.

           He tries pressing the letter back into the Dish Washer’s 
           hands, but the Vietnamese guy won’t take it back.

                                 DISH WASHER
                        Yes? Please?

           Gentle pleading on both sides. This back-and-forth could go 
           on forever. Schuller has to intervene, brandishing his M-16.
                                 SCHULLER
                             (heart not in it)
                        Get out of here! Beat it!

           The Dish Washer finally slinks away. Schlager can’t watch.

                                 SCHULLER (CONT’D)
                             (unsure)
                        He’ll be alright.

                             (even less sure)
                        Yeah. He’ll be fine.

           Kean spots Martin, shadowed by Bennington, and walks over to 
           intercept them. Bennington shakes his head for Kean’s 
           benefit: “I couldn’t stop him.”

                                 KEAN
                        Sir, where are you going?

                        The residence.

           Kean glances at the roiling crowd outside the gates.

                                 KEAN
                        That’s not a good idea.

                                 MARTIN
                        Good, bad. Makes no difference. 
                        I’ve got sensitive material in the 
                        house safe. A contact list. A 
                        hundred names.

                                 KEAN

                        You should’ve destroyed them days 
                        ago.

                                 MARTIN
                        I let hope get in the way.

                                 KEAN
                        I’ll send some men.

                                 MARTIN
                        It’s my responsibility. I’m going.

           Kean nods. Understands where Martin’s coming from.

                                 MARTIN
                        Never mind the gate.

           EXT. COURTYARD, FRENCH EMBASSY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennington and three other Marines escort Martin through the 
           secret door from the US Embassy. 

           Bennington CURSES under his breath: “That’s how he tricked me 
           the last time.”

           EXT. STREETS, SAIGON - DAY

           Martin, Bennington and the Marines walk a deadly quiet, 
           abandoned street.

           A few curious LOCALS follow at a distance.

           They reach:

           EXT. AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - ESTABLISHING

           INT. BEDROOM, AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - DAY

           Martin opens a combination safe, pulls out the LIST and some 
           other papers. Marines get to work preparing small THERMITE 
           CHARGES.

           LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Martin takes a final wistful look around. Runs his hands over 
           the piano. Even plays the right hand part of a concerto. 

           Through the curtains Bennington can see a CROWD gathering on 
           the street and heading to the front door.

                                 BENNINGTON
                        Sir? Is there a back door?

           Martin grabs a small, ivory PAGODA.

                                 MARTIN
                        There’s something better.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           Martin and the Marines admire a mint condition 1963 LINCOLN 
           CONTINENTAL. Two small AMERICAN FLAGS flank the hood.
                                 BENNINGTON
                        Maybe the flags are a bit too... 
                        provocative?

           Martin sadly snaps off one of the flags.

           EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE AMBASSADOR’S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           The garage door opens and out rolls the Lincoln, skirting the 
           crowd.

           As the Lincoln advances, a new crowd thickens. Gets more 
           hostile.

           Someone throws a brick at the windshield. Shattering it.

                                 MARTIN
                             (calm)
                        Keep going.

           Bennington bears down behind the wheel.

           Eventually, the car can make no more progress. Rocks the car. 
           Succeeds in ROLLING IT OVER.

           Bennington and the other Marines pull Martin from the car. 
           Form a tight diamond around him and manage to rush him inside

           REAR COURTYARD

           Martin, clothes roughed up and skin scraped, stands with the 
           French Ambassador. Martin assembles his remaining stamina to 
           present a vestige of his best diplomatic self:

           He uses two hands to present the ivory pagoda to his fellow 
           Ambassador.

                                 MARTIN
                        You always had an eye for it.
                                 FRENCH AMBASSADOR 
                        Nothing gets by you. Thank you, my 
                        old friend. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I’m sorry for my behavior earlier. 
                        I’m not used to losing.
                             (”The US”)
                        We... are not used to losing.

           With that, Martin steps through the metal door built into the 
           brick garden wall. Bennington and the Marines have already 
           passed through.

           Once through, the French Military weld the door shut from 
           their side.

           gun fire as it escorts one of the evac Chinooks towards the

           It takes heavy damage from ground fire. The helo, coughing

           for the rescue cradle.

           The Rescue Copter Pilot lowers the bird, dangerously, until 
           the skids are COMPLETELY UNDERWATER. His CREW bodily pulls 
           the two men on board; they SCREAM in pain from nasty compound 
           fractures in their legs.

           Then the pilot STRAINS the bird to lift it back out of the 
           water.

           By the time it’s back on deck, General Carey is there as 
           well. The helicopter continues to shed salt water as the two 
           injured men are littered past him.

                                 GENERAL’S AIDE
                        Four went down, sir.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                             (RE: darkness)
                        We were pushing our luck. Mayhem 
                        and darkness don’t mix. Send out 
                        the word.

           A Second Rescue Helicopter searches in vain for the lost 
           Pilot and Co-Pilot.

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Darkness falls. A CH-53 loads up.

                                 CH-53 PILOT
                        I’m last up. We’re sitting ducks 
                        for Charlie. Either that or we’ll 
                        crash into each other.

           Kean grabs Pilot’s Headset.

                                 KEAN
                             (into headset)
                        This is Captain-- Major James Kean. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEAN (CONT'D)
                        You let me worry about the 
                        situation here. Just keep those 
                        birds coming! 

           There’s no reply. The Pilot gently takes back the headset.

                                 CH-53 PILOT
                        It’s no good, sir. Everyone’s 
                        grounded.

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Largely quiet, except for distant light arms FIRE. Kean kicks 
           at the loose gravel under his feet. Frustrated. Pulls out his 
           wallet. The PHOTO of Rosanne has slipped half-way out, bent 
           and torn.

           Valdez taps at the chalkboard with his chalk. Itching to move 
           the numbers up.

           Helos: 30
           US Remaining: 458
           SV Evac’d: 1,552

           They look down at the South Vietnamese by the pool, who 
           remain patiently in their sticks.

                                 VALDEZ
                        What now?

                                 KEAN
                        I wish I knew.

           Bauer approaches Kean.

                                 BAUER
                        Sir, you might want to check on the 
                        Ambassador.

           INT. MARTINS OFFICE, CHANCERY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Kean enters and anxiously watches a DOCTOR looks over Martin, 
           who RASPS, COUGHS and spits phlegm on the couch.

                                 MARTIN
                        This is a waste of time. I need to 
                        get back to work.

                                 KEAN
                             (to Doctor)
                        How bad is it?
                                 DOCTOR
                        Pneumonia. Bronchial infection. He 
                        needs hospitalization.

                                 MARTIN
                        I’ll be alright.

                                 DOCTOR
                        What you’ll be is dead without an 
                        immediate course of powerful 
                        antibiotics.

                                 KEAN
                        Why don’t you lie down for a while? 
                        Get some rest.

           Martin tries to rise.

                                 MARTIN
                        Nonsense.

           Kean gently but firmly pushes him back down to sitting. He’s 
           too weak to resist anyway.

                                 KEAN
                        Quit trying to muscle in on the 
                        hero stuff. Stick to diplomacy. 
                             (Martin’s unconvinced)
                        Not kidding, sir, if you die, 
                        you’ll only make this situation 
                        worse.

           Reluctantly, Martin lies back down fully on the sofa.

                                 MARTIN
                             (stubborn/tired)
                        Duly noted. Now beat it.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           The chaos of the day has also given way to quiet here. 

           INT. OFFICER’S QUARTER, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Pilots sleep wherever possible. Some, including Captain Berry 
           scarf down C-rations. General Carey ENTERS.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        How’re you boys doing?

           General round of “Fine, sir.”
                                 BERRY
                        Sir, if you don’t mind my saying, 
                        we should be in the air.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        You’ve flown eight straight hours. 
                        FlightReg says you’re done. On top 
                        of that, enemy fire means running 
                        lights only. It’d be like flying 
                        with your eyes closed.

                                 BERRY
                        One thing that comes from flying 
                        the same route for eight hours, 
                        sir: I can do it with my eyes 
                        closed.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Mistakes will be made, son. I’m 
                        sorry but I can’t allow it.

           General Carey moves on to talk to other Pilots.

                                 BERRY
                             (to self)
                        Mistakes have already been made. 

           Berry shakes awake his Co-Pilot.

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Berry and Co-Pilot beeline for Lady Ace 09. A SIGNAL MAN gets 
           in the way.

                                 SIGNAL MAN
                        All birds are grounded.

                                 BERRY
                        Yeah I heard that.

           Berry shoves him out of the way. Gives his helo a loving pat 
           on the fuselage and jumps into the cockpit.

           Other Pilots see what he’s doing. Chug down their coffee and 
           food. Prepare to follow Berry back into the night.

           EXT. PARKING LOT, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Kean discusses the situation with Valdez.
                                 SCHULLER (O.S.)
                        Major!

           Kean looks up to the Chancery roof. Sees Schuller waving his 
           hand and pointing to the Eastern horizon.

                                 SCHULLER (CONT’D)
                        Incoming birds!

           Kean looks around the landing zone.

                                 KEAN
                        They can’t see shit to land.
                             (to Marines)
                        Every vehicle. Here. Now!

           Kean directs Marines as they scramble all available vehicles. 
           They encircle the landing area and shine their headlights. 

           INT. LADY ACE 09 - NIGHT

           The landing zone is impossible to locate. Then suddenly 
           HEADLIGHTS illuminate the “H” from all sides.

           ROOF - NIGHT

           Schuller and Gevers stand on the helipad with flares. 
           Immediately, they are under attack from sniper fire coming in 
           from all directions.

                                 GEVERS
                        Shit!

           They drop the flares and duck for cover.

                                 GEVERS (CONT’D)
                        We need a better plan.

                                 SCHULLER
                        You think?

           HELIPAD, ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Gevers lies on his back astride the landing “H”. As the next 
           Chinook approaches, he strobes a flashlight pointed skyward.

           He waits until the copter is a mere feet above him before 
           quickly rolling off the platform. He nearly lands on 
           Schuller, a huge grin on his face.

                                 GEVERS
                        Now that’s a plan!
           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Martin tracks down Kean who huddles with Valdez around the 
           chalkboard.

                                 KEAN
                        What the hell are you doing up, 
                        sir?

                                 MARTIN
                             (ignoring him)
                        How’re we doing?

                                 VALDEZ
                             (unhappy)
                        Well.

                                 KEAN
                        Too well.

                                 VALDEZ
                             (off Kean’s puzzled look)
                        We’re running out of Americans. 

           The chalkboard numbers have been written and erased dozens of 
           times:

           US Remaining: 300

                                 MARTIN
                        That’s the kind of day it’s been. 
                        Even good news is bad news.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Another ten helos roof-side and the 
                        American evacuation will be over.

                                 MARTIN
                        They’ll call me in and shut us 
                        down.

                                 KEAN
                        Not with more than 2,000 Vietnamese 
                        still on our lawn.

           INT. CANTEEN, THIRD FLOOR, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Kean ENTERS.

           Journalists, including Beinecke, mix with Embassy Staff and 
           the remaining Businessmen. These are the last three hundred 
           AMERICAN CIVILIANS.

           Kean stands on a table.
                                 KEAN
                        Can I have everyone’s attention?
                             (room quiets down)
                        You may have noticed a few thousand 
                        folks outside looking to hitch a 
                        ride stateside. And I know decent 
                        folks like yourself would want to 
                        help them out. But the top brass 
                        doesn’t necessarily see it that way 
                        and the only leverage I have is 
                        you. So what I’m asking is: help me 
                        slow-play our hand.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        That plan works ‘til it doesn’t. 
                        Then where are we?

                                 FAMILY MAN
                        I’ve got a wife and two kids back 
                        home. You want to give them a call 
                        and explain why I missed my ride?

                                 KEAN
                        Most of you have worked side-by-
                        side with these folks for several 
                        years. You want to call their wives 
                        and their kids and explain why 
                        their dads won’t be coming home at 
                        all?

           There’s silence until:

                                 BEINECKE
                        Get us out, Major, but take 
                        whatever time you need.

           Kean nods his appreciation. Then waves to the door.

                                 KEAN
                        This should help the time pass 
                        quickly.

           Marines wheel in all the EMBASSY LIQUOR. A WHOOP goes up.

                                 BEINECKE
                        If you’d led with the booze you 
                        wouldn’t’ve needed the speech!

           EXT. POOL, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Gevers barks out orders to the Crowd in Vietnamese. Forty 
           Vietnamese follow Kean inside 
           INT. CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Kean leads them up the stairs. Kean stops at

           CANTEEN, THIRD FLOOR

           The Vietnamese look inside. Puzzled.

           Down to 200 Americans but the place is now RAUCOUS.

           Someone’s improvised a sign that says “Last Bar”. Hundreds of 
           bottles of alcohol cover the mess tables and everybody’s 
           drinking, telling war stories, etc. 

           10 Americans are waiting to join Kean’s procession. The rest 
           of the Americans toast to their evacuation.

           The 40 Vietnamese and 10 Americans follow Kean to

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Bauer loads them onto the waiting Sea Knight. 

           INT. “LADY ACE 09” - CONTINUOUS

           Berry gets a thumb’s up from Kean. Lifts his “Lady Ace 09” 
           into the air. 

           East he flies across Saigon. Muted STACCATO bursts of small 
           arms fire follow them. Occasional SHRACK of a bullet striking 
           the metal fuselage.

           Then QUIET once it reaches the water. Just the sound of the 
           helo blades.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Berry lands. Drops the tail gate.

           General Carey is among those watching as Vietnamese burst out 
           onto the deck. Just the 10 Americans among them. His 
           countenance darkens.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Where are the goddamn Americans?

           INT. MARTIN’S OFFICE, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Martin’s Aide hands the half-dead Martin a TELEGRAM.

                                 MARTIN’S AIDE
                        From the Secretary.

           Martin reads: This is FINAL evacuation! Americans only!
                                 MARTIN
                        Prepare a reply.

                                 MARTIN’S AIDE
                        Begging your pardon, Graham, but I 
                        don’t think Henry’s asking for a 
                        reply.

                                 MARTIN
                        Nevertheless... 

           Martin’s Aide grabs a pen and paper.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                             (dictating)
                        Understood. Will keep Americans 
                        flowing. Full stop.

           Martin enjoys this little moment of statecraft to which he 
           was born.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Aide)
                        Would you agree the Americans are 
                        “flowing”?

                                 MARTIN’S AIDE
                             (impressed)
                        Like molasses, sir.

                                 MARTIN
                        Better destroy the cable equipment 
                        after you send it.

           INT./EXT. CHANCERY BUILDING, US EMBASSY - NIGHT

           Another “stick” of 40 Vietnamese are combined with 10 
           remaining Americans and other Westerners, then guided up the 
           fire stairs towards the roof.

           On the roof, Bauer oversees the filling of the helos. Each 
           waiting pilot asks him the same question:

                                 BERRY
                        General Carey wants to know how 
                        many Americans left.

           Bauer nods towards Valdez’ Chalkboard. Valdez has just 
           updated it to read: US: 200.

                                 BAUER
                        Two hundred.

           Valdez POCKETS THE CHALK and walks away.
           QUICK PILOT MONTAGE:

           This repeats itself several times as Sea Knights land.

           -- Pilot #1 checks the board: US: 200

           -- Pilot #2 checks the board: US: 200

           -- Berry lands again and checks the board: US: 200

           Berry cracks a knowing smile. 

                                 BERRY
                             (to Bauer)
                        I’ll pass it on.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Berry stands before General Carey:

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        God dammnit! The number never 
                        changes!

                                 BERRY
                        Must be some stragglers still 
                        reaching the embassy, sir.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Don’t play cute with me, son. Those 
                        Marines are marching to their own 
                        tune, and I’m pulling the plug.

           INT. KISSINGER’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON DC - 2 PM LOCAL TIME

           Kissinger speaks to General Carey.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        I share your concern, Mr. 
                        Secretary. This is the number we 
                        are getting from our pilots.

                                 KISSINGER
                        The President wants this operation 
                        completed. Right. Now.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           An exhausted Berry finishes wolfing down some chow as he 
           inspects his Lady Ace 09 and Deck Hands re-fuel her.
           General Carey prowls the deck with his Entourage. Grabs Berry 
           by the lapels of his flight jacket. 

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        You like to fly at night? Fine. 
                        Bring out the Ambassador. Now, god-
                        damn-it. If the Corps isn’t duly 
                        impressed by my stars and bars, you 
                        should know this comes straight 
                        from the White House.

                                 BERRY
                        Yes, sir.

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING, US EMBASSY - 0300 HOURS

           Schuller lies flat on his back, lighting the descent of 
           Berry’s Lady Ace 09. Schuller rolls out of harm’s way -- 
           getting good at the job.

           Schuller gets back on his feet. Approaches Berry when he sees 
           the pilot’s serious, dour look.

                                 BERRY
                        I got my orders. Time for the 
                        Ambassador to leave. And the rest 
                        of you Marines immediately after.

                                 SCHULLER
                        We still got more than a thousand 
                        folks downstairs.

                                 BERRY
                        If it were up to me... But like I 
                        said, I got my orders.

           SFX: POP of a champagne cork.

           INT. “LAST BAR”, FIFTH FLOOR, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           EMBASSY STAFF and JOURNALISTS, led by Beinecke, are getting 
           good and drunk on the remains of the Embassy’s alcohol 
           supply.

                                 BEINECKE
                             (finishing a bottle)
                        Leave nothing for the enemy!

           Schuller finishes informing Kean and Martin.

                                 SCHULLER
                        Pilot up top’s not lowering the 
                        gate until he has the Ambassador.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCHULLER (CONT'D)
                             (to Martin)
                        I’m sorry, sir. He means business.

           There are still thirty hearty, drunk Americans waiting 
           around, including Beinecke, Martin’s Aide and an Older 
           Embassy Worker or Journalist.

           Kean looks at Martin, so weak he can barely stand:

                                 KEAN
                             (to Schuller)
                        Tell him: “The Old Man’ll be right 
                        up.”

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Berry watches from the cockpit as the “Ambassador” is 
           escorted by Martin’s Aide and an ENTOURAGE of other Drunk 
           Embassy Officials. 

           Kean gives the “Ambassador” a salute as the Entourage joins 
           the Vietnamese Refugees on board Lady Ace 09.

           Then Kean approaches Berry as the bird powers up for flight.

                                 BERRY
                        End of the road, Major. Sorry.

                                 KEAN
                        Thanks to you and your boys. We had 
                        a good run.

           Berry gives him the thumb’s up and takes off.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Berry brings Lady Ace 09 to ground. He gets out and salutes a 
           waiting General Carey.

                                 BERRY
                        I’ve got the Ambassador, sir.

           General Carey stands tall and waits for the Ambassador to 
           disembark.

           The Older Embassy Worker/Journalist stumbles down the helo’s 
           rear ramp with his drunken mates. General Carey, puzzled, 
           turns to Berry.

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        He’s a bit in the sauce, I’m 
                        afraid.
           General Carey turns crimson, seething with anger.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Berry enters sheepishly. General Carey hands him a headset.

                                 BERRY
                             (querulous)
                        This is Lieutenant Gerry Berry.

                                 PRESIDENT FORD (O.S.)
                             (through headset)
                        This is President Ford. 

           Berry stops himself in the middle of saluting his non-visible 
           Commander-in-Chief.

                                 BERRY
                        Sir? Yes, sir!

                                 PRESIDENT FORD (O.S.)
                        One Gerry to another, you bring me 
                        Ambassador Martin. No delay, son.

                                 BERRY
                        No, sir. Absolutely not, sir.

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING, US EMBASSY - MORNING

           Gray light. Schuller guides in Lady Ace 09 yet again.

                                 BERRY
                        The real ambassador this time. No 
                        tricks. 

           INT. MARTIN’S OFFICE, CHANCERY BUILDING - MORNING

           Martin hunched over his desk. WHEEZING. Gaunt. He should be 
           in a hospital.

           He gets up. Takes down the photo of his dead son. Replaces it 
           with a MAP OF HANOI.

           Kean KNOCKS then ENTERS.

                                 MARTIN
                             (off map)
                        Might as well make them feel at 
                        home when they get here.

           Kean shows Martin more respect now than at any previous 
           moment in their interactions.
                                 KEAN
                        It’s time, sir.

                                 MARTIN
                        There are still evacuees in our 
                        care.

                                 KEAN
                        About 400. Forty South Koreans, the 
                        rest locals.

                                 MARTIN
                        Only seven more flights. I’ll tell 
                        Henry.

           Martin reaches for the phone, forgetting it was cut hours 
           ago. Gets the dead line.

           Kean gently takes the phone from Martin. Hangs it up.

                                 KEAN
                        The Vietnamese, they’ll keep coming 
                        over the walls and through that 
                        gate as long as we’re here, Mr. 
                        Ambassador. But time’s run out. 

                                 MARTIN
                        We failed them.

                                 KEAN
                        We did everything we could with 
                        what was left to us. You should be 
                        proud.

                                 MARTIN
                        I will be hated.

                                 KEAN
                        Not by me. Not by my men or anyone 
                        else who saw you today.

           “LAST BAR”, THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT

           The last Embassy Workers and Journalists shuffle out, 
           including Beinecke. Taking the remaining alcohol with them.

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

           Valdez takes down the EMBASSY FLAG.

           As Martin and Kean reach the roof, Valdez hands it to Martin. 
           Salutes.
                                 MARTIN
                        Thank you, John.

           The last American Civilians board the CH-53. No room for the 
           Marines.

                                 KEAN
                             (breezy/off Martin’s look)
                        We’ll be right behind you. Just 
                        gonna turn off the lights.

           Martin’s AIDE helps him towards last space on Lady Ace 09. 
           Martin first waves him off, but accepts the assistance anyway 
           when it’s needed to get him on board.

           Valdez and Kean watch Berry take off.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Valdez)
                        Send up the flare. Time to take the 
                        finger from the dike. 

           EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - 0330 HOURS

           A STAR CLUSTER FLARE goes up into the gloaming. 

           ON THE WALL - SAME TIME

           Norman and Babel look to the sky, then to each other. 

           As casually as possible, first Babel, then Norman remove the 
           firing pins from their machine guns and back off the wall.

           FRONT GATE

           Schlager and Frain stagger their retreat. Word quickly 
           spreads through the jittery Crowd.

           SWIMMING POOL

           A couple of Marines leave. Gevers remains posted all alone. 
           The 400 waiting evacuees watch him carefully.

           Gevers tries to make reassuring eye contact with as many 
           people as possible. But their fear threatens to sink him.

                                 GEVERS
                             (to no one in particular)
                        I gotta take a leak.

           Gevers “casually” heads towards the Chancery. Once out of 
           their sight, his face caves in to guilt and wretchedness.
           CHANCERY

           The 50 remaining Marines form three concentric rings around 
           the entrance. 

           There’s a moment of odd quiet as the Vietnamese, both inside 
           and outside the embassy, digest the situation.

           Kean holds his heart in his mouth. Waiting.

           A time-bomb goes off inside all the Vietnamese at once. Loh 
           Pat lets out a visceral SCREAM of panic and anger.

           OUTSIDE THE GATES

           The mob crashes through the gates and swarms the compound 
           like World War Z zombies.

                                 KEAN
                        Inside!

           The other Marines retreat into the Chancery.

           Valdez, Bauer, Frain, Schlager, Norman and Bennington remain 
           outside to hold back the crowd. 

           Frain grabs the eight-foot STEEL BEAM used to bar the 
           Chancery door, hoists it on his shoulders and swings it 
           around and around, keeping the crowd at bay.

           He knocks over several men. 

           Valdez and Schlager pull him inside the Chancery, where the 
           beam is used to bolt the mahogany double-doors.

           INT. LADY ACE 09 - MORNING

           Berry flies the CH-53. Martin, sick and exhausted in the 
           cargo hold.

           The helo reaches the coastline:

                                 CO-PILOT
                        And we are wet.

                                 BERRY
                             (into headset)
                        This is Lady Ace 09. Tiger. Tiger. 
                        Tiger. The tiger is out of the 
                        cage.

           INT. COMMAND AND CONTROL, USS BLUE RIDGE - MORNING

           A CHEER goes up. General Carey takes congratulations.
                                 COMM OPERATOR
                        Roger that, Lady Ace 09.

           INT. FIRE STAIRS, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           Marines race upward, locking the security door on each floor 
           behind them.

           Norman stops on 

           5TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           He sets off THERMITE GRENADES among the communications 
           equipment.

           FIRE STAIRS - NIGHT

           Norman runs up the final flights. Bursts onto

           ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Where he SLAMS the door behind him. And bolts it shut.

           In the commotion, it wasn’t obvious but now it is: THERE ARE 
           NO HELICOPTERS.

                                 KEAN
                        They’ll come for us.

           INT. PRESS ROOM, THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Kissinger heads to the podium to address the gathered PRESS 
           CORP.

                                 KISSINGER
                        Ladies and Gentlemen. I am relieved 
                        to report...

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - NIGHT

           Lady Ace 09 lands. Carey shakes a weary Martin’s hand, before 
           the Ambassador is placed on a stretcher.

                                 KISSINGER (V.O.)
                        ...that Ambassador Martin has 
                        safely and successfully left our 
                        embassy in Saigon without incident. 

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Kean and his Marines scan the skies in vain. 
                                 KISSINGER (V.O.)
                        There are no more US 
                        representatives on the ground 
                        there, and the American presence in 
                        Vietnam is now officially over. 

           With no more helos in sight, Kean turns his attention to his 
           men.

                                 KEAN
                        Okay. Weapons check. Ammo check. 
                        Inventory the rest.

           The Marines inventory their meager ammunition. Valdez checks 
           in with Kean.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Now I see why you’re in those 
                        civvies. Gonna blend right in with 
                        that rabble down there when the 
                        time comes.

                                 KEAN
                        What, and give you an excuse to 
                        shoot me for getting you into this 
                        mess? I don’t think so.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Then I guess we’re stuck with each 
                        other.

                                 KEAN
                        Guess so.

           EXT. CHANCERY - NIGHT

           The crowd pounds on the mighty doors, unable to bust through.

           Loh Pat looks around. Pushes himself out of the crowd. He 
           locates a FIRE TRUCK which he hot wires. He BLASTS the 
           truck’s siren. The crowd disperses and he smashes the fire 
           truck straight into, and through, the Chancery doors. 

           INT./EXT. CHANCERY - NIGHT

           The mob floods inside and up the stairs. 

           INT. FIRE STAIRS, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           The weight of the crowd easily busts the security doors on 
           each floor of their hinges.
           INT. ROOF, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           The mob reaches the steel-enforced door that opens on to the 
           roof. 

           The door has a glass viewing portal roughly 2' x 1'. 

           Schuller stands guard on the roof. Makes a big deal of 
           brandishing his rifle. 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

           Schuller can see their faces: some furious, some desperate, 
           some pleading.

           The mob, including Loh Pat, smashes the small window.

           HANDS thrust beseechingly and threateningly, through. Some 
           try to unlock the door. Schuller pushes their wrists down 
           onto the broken glass shards. 

           Hands retreat in pain, only to be replaced by other hands. 
           Schuller throws tear gas grenades through the window, as 
           needed, to temporarily subdue the crowd. It's not pleasant 
           work, and it effects the normally stolid Marine.

           ROOF - 0530 HOURS

           The scene has grown momentarily quiet.

           Still no helos. 

           Valdez works a bulky CNK “Clink” handheld radio.

                                 VALDEZ
                             (into Clink)
                        Task Force 47, this is the US 
                        Embassy. Over.

           Valdez presses the headphones to his ear, 

                                 VALDEZ (CONT’D)
                             (into Clink)
                        Roger that. Standing by.
                             (to Marines)
                        They’re sending more helos. Just 
                        had to refuel.

           Sullivan looks at Gevers/off Valdez: “What the hell is he 
           doing?”
                                 SULLIVAN
                        You know that tin can’s got a range 
                        of maybe 5 clicks, right Top?

                                 VALDEZ
                        Hold a sec...
                             (pretending to receive 
                              message)
                        The fleet says they’re coming for 
                        everyone but you, Rock Steady. 
                        They’re making you the new 
                        Ambassador.

           Schlager LAUGHS. Sullivan doesn’t find it so funny.

           ONE HOUR LATER

           The mood has grown somber. Then a distance WHIRRING.

           EXT. ROOF, CHANCERY - NIGHT

           A single CH-46 arrives on the roof. 

           It's immediately clear to Sullivan:

                                 SULLIVAN
                        Only one chopper? Not gonna be 
                        enough.

           Kean looks to the skies for another helo. Then back to 
           Sullivan, who shakes his head: “I don’t think so.”

           Kean grabs Valdez.

                                 KEAN
                        Your best nine men. Everyone else 
                        on board.

           As Valdez starts to move off, Kean grabs his sleeve:

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Have ‘em leave their weapons with 
                        us.

           Marines board the helo. As it takes off, we are left with the 
           LAST 11 MARINES:

           KEAN, VALDEZ, SULLIVAN, BAUER, SCHULLER, SCHLAGER, NORMAN, 
           GEVERS, BABEL, FRAIN and BENNINGTON.

                                 FRAIN
                        Finally, some goddamn peace and 
                        quiet.
           But nobody laughs.

           LATER

           Everything left with their own thoughts. Scattered across the 
           roof.

           Sullivan takes the chalk from Valdez’ Board. Doesn’t bother 
           erasing the US: 50. Just crosses out the “50” and writes “11” 
           next to it.

           Valdez gives up his radio act. Chucks the worthless metal 
           over the roof edge and sits next to Kean.

                                 KEAN
                        I do two tours. Following orders 
                        that cost a lot of people their 
                        lives. So this time I go my own 
                        way, thinking I can save some for a 
                        change. Only that makes me just 
                        another asshole giving orders that 
                        just might cost ten more good men 
                        theirs.

                                 VALDEZ
                        You feel good about those tours?

                                 KEAN
                        Nope.

                                 VALDEZ
                        You feel good about what you did 
                        today?

                                 KEAN
                        Yeah.

                                 VALDEZ
                        So does every Marine on this roof.

           Kean looks over the Marines under his command, believing 
           Valdez's words.

                                 VALDEZ (CONT’D)
                        You’re a decent soldier. You’re a 
                        better man.

           At that moment, from his seated position, Kean sees the South 
           Vietnamese flag LOWERED from nearby Do Trang Bridge. Kean 
           jumps up and moves to the roof edge:
           DO TRANG BRIDGE

           The final shreds of the South Vietnamese army scatter as the 
           NVA streams across the bridge and into the city center.

           ROOF

           Frain checks the action on his M-16.

                                 FRAIN
                        Don’t know about the rest of you, 
                        but I’m not going down without a 
                        fight.

                                 SULLIVAN
                        And you figure that’s your call, 
                        Private? 

                                 KEAN
                        No, Frain’s entitled to his 
                        opinion. You all are. This hasn’t 
                        exactly been a chain-of-command-
                        type deal from the get-go and all 
                        I’ve done is back you all into a 
                        corner. So you boys take a vote. 
                        Majority rules.

           Frain scrounges some pebbles. Hands them around. Kean walks 
           over to Schuller, after the Private has “voted” with his 
           pebble in Frain’s helmet.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (off wound)
                        How’s the pain?

                                 SCHULLER
                        Nothing next to the idea we’ve been 
                        forgotten, sir.
                             (off Vietnamese)
                        I get it now. Why we're still here. 
                        No matter what happens, it’s been 
                        an honor.

           Kean gives him a “thank you” pat on the back. Then turns to 
           Frain:

                                 KEAN
                        What’s the damage?

                                 FRAIN
                             (counting pebbles)
                        It’s unanimous, sir.
                                 KEAN
                             (to Marines/off Frain)
                        You heard him, men.

           Everybody prepares their weapons in earnest. Finds a good 
           location to fend off either an attack from the street, roof 
           door or the sky. Options are limited.

           DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           The Marines last shred of protection, darkness, erodes as the 
           sun threatens to rise over the horizon.

           EXT. VU LANG BRIDGE - SAME TIME

           The NVA Army is across. And now but a block away.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME TIME

           Valdez, anxious, looks to Kean: “What do we do?” Kean betrays 
           nothing.

           Sullivan hears it first...

           The faintest WHIR. Then, a dark speck on the horizon slowly 
           resolves into an incoming CHINOOK.

                                 KEAN
                        How about it, boys? Ready to go 
                        home?

           The CH-46 lands on the roof. Schuller throws a few more gas 
           canisters through the door window. Buying time to join the 
           others at the helo. 

           The mob bursts onto the roof. Swarm towards the helo pad.

           INT. CH-46 - CONTINUOUS

           Schuller doesn't have it in him to gas the Vietnamese any 
           more. So Schlager releases the remaining gas canisters, only 
           the ROTOR WASH causes the gas to fill the helo instead. 

           The pilot struggles to take off. Valdez falls out of helo. 
           Nobody notices. But Kean does a headcount...

                                 KEAN
                             (screaming over rotors)
                        Where’s Valdez?!

           Valdez’s HANDS are spotted clinging to the half-closed ramp. 
           Babel and Bennington pull him inside.
           Helo finally takes off, leaving Loh Pat and the mob grasping 
           at air.

           EXT. SAIGON - DAWN

           Over the city the helo flies. Kean sees the city on fire. And 
           an NVA tank crash through the Presidential Palace gates.

           EXT. OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAWN

           Kean sees the fuel gage reading EMPTY.

                                 KEAN
                        We’re running on fumes.

                                 CHINOOK PILOT
                             (laughing)
                        We’ve been bare-assing it for 19 
                        hours straight. Low fuel doesn’t 
                        even register on the white knuckle 
                        scale.

           EXT. DECK, USS BLUE RIDGE - DAWN

           The helo comes to rest. 

           Kean and his Marines set foot on the deck. Met by General 
           Carey.

           Kean salutes.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Are you Major Kean?

                                 KEAN
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        Not some imposter?

           The General betrays no amusement.

                                 KEAN
                        No, sir.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                        That was some fine work.

                                 KEAN
                        Just doing my job.

                                 GENERAL CAREY
                             (pushing)
                        “Just following orders.”
                                 KEAN
                        Something like that, sir.

           General Carey gives a slight nod, then heads off as a smiling 
           Captain Berry approaches.

           Kean smiles back, extends his hand and... WHUNK. Berry clocks 
           him across the chin with a right hook.

                                 BERRY
                        You lying asshole.

           Then Berry smiles again. Wraps his arm around him 
           affectionately.

                                 BERRY (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s go find a drink.

           LATER

           Valdez watches May Li arrive from a Transport Boat. Her 
           Family behind her.

           They embrace.

                                 VALDEZ
                        Good to see you, baby.

                                 MAY LI
                        Good to see you, Big John.

           Valdez doesn’t protest the name. Now he owns it. 

           He looks over her family. He’s moved to see: they’re tired, 
           weak and without possessions of any kind. But they made it.

           INT. SICK BAY, USS BLUE RIDGE - DAY

           Kean finds Martin in bed. Completely spent. On an IV drip.

                                 MARTIN
                        How’d we do?

                                 KEAN
                        Best we could.

                                 MARTIN
                        No. How many we save?

           Beat.

                                 KEAN
                        More than six thousand souls.
           Martin can barely process the number.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                        Won’t bring your son back.

           Martin closes his eyes to rest.

                                 MARTIN
                        But not bad for a day’s work.

           PHONE BANK

           Kean stands in line with others. 

                                 COMMUNICATIONS GRUNT
                        Number?

                                 KEAN
                        The first is--

                                 COMMUNICATIONS GRUNT
                        One call per person.

                                 KEAN
                        Well, I gotta make three.

                                 COMMUNICATIONS GRUNT
                        One per man. General’s orders.

                                 KEAN
                        I’m making three.

                                 COMMUNICATIONS GRUNT
                             (off long line)
                        Fine. You wanna tell them that, be 
                        my guest.

           The Grunt is surprised when Kean takes him up on the 
           suggestion:

                                 KEAN
                             (to room)
                        I’m going to make three calls. 
                        First to my wife, who I just found 
                        out is pregnant and the next two to 
                        the parents of the last Marines to 
                        die in Vietnam, promising I’ll get 
                        their bodies home. Anyone got a 
                        problem with that? 

           SILENCE fills the room.
                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Grunt/taking phone)
                        I’ll make the calls myself. And if 
                        you wanna tell the General, be my 
                        guest.

           The Marines enjoy a much-needed LAUGH as the Grunt backs off.

           Kean finishes dialing.

                                 KEAN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hey babe... No, I’m fine. Heard you 
                        got some big news...

           FADE OUT.

           “In the largest helicopter evacuation in history, 1,373 
           Americans and 5,595 Vietnamese were carried to safety over an 
           18-hour period.”

           “Captain Gerald “Gerry” Berry received his third 
           Distinguished Service Cross and second gold star for 
           leadership and bravery during the evacuation.

           Master Sergeant Juan Valdez lives in Oceanside, CA and is 
           President of the Fall of Saigon Association. 

           Ambassador Graham Martin retired two years later. When he 
           died in 1990 at the age of 77, his wife said: ‘He started 
           dying that day in 1975. It took fifteen years to finish the 
           job.’ He is buried in Section 7 of Arlington Cemetery along 
           with his son.

           Jim Kean retired in 1983, achieving the rank of Lt. Colonel. 
           He died in 2008 at the age of 66, survived by his wife and 
           three daughters.”
