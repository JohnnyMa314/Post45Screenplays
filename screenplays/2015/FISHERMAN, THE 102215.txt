                             Inspired by true events and
                          Based on the character created by

           UNDER THE OCEAN - NIGHT

           Ribbons of moonlight pierce the dark ocean from above as we 
           glide forward underwater with embodied, animal purpose. 

           OBJECTS begin to fall into view ahead: various shapes sinking 
           from the surface as we move between them... AN AMMO BOX, A 
           CHAIR, PIECES OF TWISTED METAL raining down everywhere...

           We shift direction between the debris, moving forward... 

           A more familiar silhouette sinks in front of us: A HUMAN 
           CORPSE. But we ignore it, turning to slowly pass it.

           Now, in the gloomy distance ahead, see LIGHTS FLICKERING from 
           portholes, briefly illuminating the surreal sight of a U.S. 
           NAVY HEAVY CRUISER as it sinks, going down into the deep, 
           bubbles and debris spewing from TWO GASHES in its side. 

           As we watch, pressure snuffs its lights and it becomes just a 
           shadow in the dark, barely visible, falling into the abyss as 
           we continue onward with cold indifference to its fate...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DRIVING OUT TO SEA - DAY

           A fine day off the coast of NEW ENGLAND. AUGUST 1946. A 
           thirty-five foot NOVA SCOTIA LOBSTER BOAT drives out to sea.

           Vapor trails from its tall exhaust beside the flying bridge. 
           She’s a little worn in but still in her prime with decades of 
           life left in her. 

           Printed on the stern in large letters is her name: “ORCA”.

           EXT. FLYING BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY 

           The man at the helm is twenty but seems older. He’s 
           weathered, from sun and from drinking, with unkempt hair and 
           a beard and icy eyes, piercing and haunted. Barely a year has 
           passed since the war ended, but it did its work on this man. 

           They call him QUINT.

           He glances behind him. A little harbor and the island of 
           Martha’s Vineyard are shrinking into the distance.

           He tightens his grip on the wheel, glancing down at the boat 
           beneath him and its hull cutting the water. He seems nervous. 

           He reaches for a mug on the console and lifts it to his 
           mouth, only to find it already emptied. He throttles down. 
           INT. CABIN - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Beneath the flying bridge is a compact cockpit/cabin with a 
           tiny kitchenette, table and booth, all surrounded by windows.

           Quint climbs down from above and stumbles inside. He grabs a 
           nearly-empty bottle of schnapps and empties it into the mug.

           He downs it in an easy gulp.

           But then the endless ocean outside the window gives him 
           pause. He stares at it with anxious uncertainty.

           He turns away and digs in a grocery bag, past bread and 
           bologna and cheese, to reach a fresh bottle of whiskey.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Jazz warbles from a HAND-CRANK GRAMOPHONE inside the cabin. 
           Quint stands up from a wooden rocking chair, as his fishing 
           rod bends with a catch on the line. He works to reel it in.

           He pulls up a nice-sized striper. Stuffing one hand into a 
           glove, he grabs the fish to remove the hook. 

                                 QUINT
                        Beauty, aren’t you.

           The fish squirms and he loses his grip, dropping it to the 
           deck. He clumsily tries to grab it as it flaps around, but he 
           knocks his mug from the top of a tackle box. It SMASHES on 
           the floor -- whiskey spills across the deck.

                                 QUINT
                        Shit.

           He kicks the fish into a corner. He’s drunk, frustrated.

           ANGLE ON: THE FISH, flapping in spilt whiskey, when... BAM! A 
           knife slams through its head, pinning it to the deck.

           Quint stares at it, grimly. Blood seeps into booze...

           He pulls the knife out, opens a cooler box and drops the fish 
           inside to join a few others he already caught, on ice. 

           He pauses, staring down into the box.

                                 QUINT
                        What are you looking at? Huh?

           Long beat. He glares at the dead fish. But then a smile 
           cracks across his face, becoming a rasping chuckle. 
           He reaches for his mug but is reminded that it’s broken. So 
           he snatches the bottle instead and raises it to the fish.

                                 QUINT
                        This was a good idea. I feel better. 
                        But I’ll need more of you than this.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DUSK

           LATER, the daylight is fading. The ice box is now stuffed 
           full with more fish that he’s caught.

           QUINT sways across the deck, fishing rod in hand as the line 
           jerks and he struggles to reel another in.

                                 QUINT
                        Nice strong fella. 

           After a few minutes of effort, the fish is close enough to 
           glimpse: a TWO-FOOT MACKEREL shimmering below the surface.   

           Quint reaches for his glove when suddenly -- THE LINE IS 
           YANKED VIOLENTLY, pulling on the rod, then it goes limp... 

           Confused, he reels in easily... And he pulls up ONLY THE 
           MACKEREL'S HEAD, still attached to the line, dripping blood 
           on the deck... Its body has been bitten away.

           Quint blanches, staring at it. 

           Unnerved, he moves to peer over the edge but he sees nothing. 
           Just a diffuse patch of blood in the water.

           His breath quivers. He looks back at the fish in his ice box.

                                 QUINT
                        Okay. Time to play your part now.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON: A FAT STRIPER slaps down onto a cutting board. A 
           kitchen knife slices through it. 

           Quint chops the fish up by lamplight, quickly and crudely. 
           He’s not cleaning it, he’s just making mincemeat out of it.

           He carefully tips the chopping board so that the blood runs 
           off into A BUCKET that is already full of chum soup.

           He pushes fresh hunks into bucket too. He pauses for a swig 
           of whiskey, then he grabs the next fish when suddenly --

           He hears DISTANT CRIES AND SCREAMS from across the water.
           He looks up, nervous, peering into the dark beyond the boat. 
           But he sees nothing, hears nothing... But it scares him:

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint retreats inside, where LOW JAZZ crackles on the 
           gramophone and A STRANGE PANIC starts to take hold of him. 

           He downs another mug of booze. He tries to calm his breath 
           but SUDDEN FLOODS OF DISCONNECTED IMAGES start to rush him:

           A bloody hand reaching... A blur of grey in the water... Meat 
           on a grill... A girl smiling... Artillery firing... Flesh 
           tearing... Bodies writhing during sex... Blood from a nose... 

           Quint shakes it off, turning to a window. But with the light 
           on inside, he sees HIS OWN REFLECTION in the glass -- a face 
           he hardly recognizes, let alone admires.

           He switches off the light. His eyes adjust to see THE ENDLESS 
           OCEAN outside instead, and now fear swells from that:

           Limbs thrashing underwater... Smoking cigarettes on a ship’s 
           deck at night... Waves crashing... Fire raging...

           He switches the light back on: there’s his face again. He 
           switches it off: there’s the open water beyond. He groans; 
           agitated and claustrophobic as A HAMMERING SOUND grows... 

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - LATER

           THE HAMMERING continues. SEE: shirts and sweaters, nailed up 
           over the windows to form makeshift drapes. No reflections 
           anymore, no ocean visible. The cabin is a little dark cave.

           FIND: QUINT hammering a shirt above the last window.

           He reaches into his duffel for another shirt but is surprised 
           to find a WOMAN’S SCARF, jumbled in with his clothes. 

           He pauses. Feeling it in his hands, remembering. He steps 
           backward to climb down but HE SLIPS AND --

           FALLS HARD to the floor.

           He lies dazed, eyes open, listening to the water lapping 
           outside and the soft jazz warbling from his gramophone...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAZZ BAR, SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT - MAY 1945

           A live band plays the same song in a wartime San Francisco 
           lounge full of sailors and ladies drinking and dancing. 
           Quint is at the bar. He’s a year younger but starkly 
           different: crew-cut, clean-shaven and fresh faced, eyes clear 
           and gleaming with youthful confidence and natural charm. 

           He’s in uniform with two shipmates. BRUBAKER (20s) is his 
           closest friend, wiry-tough and loyal. HART (17) is a new 
           recruit deckhand who’s maybe never even been away from home, 
           let alone inside a bar.

                                 QUINT
                        Put it away, Brubaker.

           Brubaker is holding out a thin chain from his neck, which is 
           looped through a DIAMOND RING. He turns to Hart. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        No, I’m showing Hart. This was my 
                        mother’s ring, that’s a real diamond. 
                        It’s all I got to my name, so I’m not 
                        gonna just leave it in my bunk.

                                 QUINT
                        Brubaker wears a wedding ring round 
                        his neck and wonders why he’s got no 
                        sweetheart.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        It’s an engagement ring. Neck’s the 
                        best place for it. It shows them I 
                        got nothing but noble intentions for 
                        them, unlike you Quint.

                                 HART
                        That really works, Brubaker?

           Brubaker turns back to Hart, suddenly mock-angry.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        What did we tell you? You don’t talk 
                        while me and Quint are talking.

                                 QUINT
                        No, tell us. How is that working out?

                                 BRUBAKER 
                        It works great -- I just haven’t 
                        found the right girl is all.

           Smiling, Quint scans the bar and, as the crowd parts, he sees 
           a vision: LAURA FOSTER (25) is a humble, intelligent beauty, 
           chatting with her friend DIANE (25). Laura was looking at 
           him, but as he makes eye contact she turns away. 

           Beside Quint, Hart is put out by Brubaker’s comment. 
                                 HART
                        I don’t see why y’all had to bring me 
                        out here if I can’t talk.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        ‘Cause you’re greener than green, 
                        gup, look at you. Still flush full of 
                        ‘rental cash, and it’s tradition you 
                        buy your olders and wisers some 
                        drinks once you graduate training.

                                 HART
                        That’s a real tradition? 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        You questioning your superiors? 
                        Quint, he needs some manners. Quint?

           He turns to see Quint making his way across the bar.

           ACROSS THE BAR

           Laura and Diane are watching the band play. Laura turns to 
           see Quint appear next to her. He tips his hat to her.

           He pretends to watch the band too, but he sneaks sideways 
           glances at her. She knows it, and she smiles.

                                 LAURA
                        Can I help you, sailor?

                                 QUINT
                        Actually, I thought we might be able 
                        to help each other.

                                 LAURA
                        Oh really?

                                 QUINT
                        Yes, ma’am. See, I’m hoping to enjoy 
                        a refreshing beverage and stimulating 
                        conversation with a beautiful woman. 
                        Thinking you might be up to the task.

                                 LAURA
                        How’d you figure that?

                                 QUINT
                        Because of the look you gave me.

                                 LAURA
                        Look? I think I may have merely 
                        glanced your way by accident.
           Diane turns from the music, noticing Quint with them. 

                                 QUINT
                        You were looking. Staring, really, 
                        but we’ll give it the benefit of the 
                        doubt and call it a glance. Thing is 
                        though, these days with a war on and 
                        all this turmoil in the world, got to 
                        take chances on a glance like that.

                                 DIANE
                        A real philosopher, you are. I’m 
                        Diane, this is Laura. 

                                 QUINT
                        You can call me Quint.

                                 LAURA
                        Quint? Is that a first or last name?

                                 QUINT
                             (ignoring her, to Diane)
                        Laura seemed a little shy. Figured 
                        I’d come help her out.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m not shy.

                                 DIANE
                        She’s not shy.

           Then Brubaker arrives beside Quint, faux-serious.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Sorry to interrupt. Quint, we got a 
                        serious problem. That damn greenie 
                        sonofabitch - pardon my language, 
                        ladies - that new kid Hart.

                                 QUINT
                        What did he do?

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Well he’s a babyfaced boot-mouth and 
                        he fumbles through our order, and now 
                        we got four martinis instead of two. 
                        I don’t know what to do, it’d be an 
                        awful shame to waste them but we 
                        can’t drink them ourselves because --

                                 QUINT
                        Because we’re on duty tomorrow. My 
                        god, Brubaker, this is a disaster. Is 
                        there anything we could do?
                                 DIANE
                             (bemused)
                        Oh for goodness sake. Yes, we’ll join 
                        you for a drink.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Really?

           Diane takes Brubaker by the arm and leads him back to the 
           bar, leaving Laura with Quint.

           They look at each other. The eye contact lingers.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m not shy.

                                 QUINT
                        Prove it.

           INT. JAZZ BAR - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT - LATER

           Quint and Laura are dancing together now, later in the night. 
           Brubaker and Diane, and other couples, dance around them. 
           It’s slow, close and intimate, and they talk as they go. 

                                 LAURA
                        I’m a New Englander too. Boston’s 
                        home, but we summer in the Vineyard. 
                        Have you ever been there? 
                             (catching his look)
                        What? What is it?

                                 QUINT
                        All moneyed up aren’t you. Fancy 
                        college and all, studying psychotics.

                                 LAURA
                        Psychology. Yes, I’m very fortunate.

                                 QUINT
                        See, I was all set to go to Harvard 
                        but then this damn war happened...

                                 LAURA
                             (going with his joke)
                        Oh, is that so?

                                 QUINT
                        Straight-A student, I was. Sometimes 
                        it’s hard, you know, being a brave 
                        fighting sailor in the United States 
                        Navy, while also being such an 
                        intellectual. The other guys just 
                        don’t understand me. 
                                 LAURA
                        Oh, I’m sure you get bullied.

                                 QUINT
                        It never stops. Professor Quint, 
                        that’s what they call me.

           She smiles at his jokes. 

                                 LAURA
                        Well I told you about me, Professor. 
                        You still haven’t told me where 
                        you’re from. Where is home for you?

           Beat. Quint’s eyes darken in thought. A pregnant pause hints 
           at perhaps broken homes and no living loved ones.

                                 QUINT
                        The sea.

           She laughs at this overly dramatic statement.

                                 LAURA
                        The sea?

                                 QUINT
                        Been round water my whole life. On 
                        the water I feel free, I feel safe. 
                        Isn’t that what home is?

                                 LAURA
                        I suppose.

                                 QUINT
                        One day, I’ll get my own vessel. Then 
                        I’ll show you blue bloods the freedom 
                        I got that you can’t buy.

           Laura looks at him sweetly.

                                 LAURA
                        You’ve got a war to win first.

           Beat. They look into each other’s eyes.

                                 QUINT
                        Lady, I don’t know how long we’ll be 
                        stationed in San Francisco, but let 
                        me see you again while we are and I 
                        promise: I’ll go end it for you. 

           Her smile is answer enough for him. He twirls her as the band 
           strikes a new tune and a TRUMPET plays, becoming --
           INT. CABIN - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           -- A GULL SQUAWKING loudly, waking Quint, lying where he fell 
           in the cabin. He groans in pain from a hangover. 

           The cabin sways from waves, startling him -- he sits up in 
           shock, as if only just remembering he’s on a boat.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Coming outside, Quint finds the boat is engulfed by a THICK 
           SEA MIST with little visibility beyond thirty feet.

           A half-chopped up fish still lies on a cutting board. But an 
           oddly elegant, beautiful WHITE GULL is nipping at it.

           It SQUAWKS at him, rather boldly.

                                 QUINT
                        Okay. Go on now.

           It just seems to eye him. It SQUAWKS again. 

                                 QUINT
                        Go on. This isn’t your business. 

           As he waves at it, the gull takes flight. Quint watches it 
           rise and settle into a hover high above the boat.

           Quint lifts the lid from the bucket of chum and sneers at its 
           already rotten smell. He glances at his ice box - a few fish 
           left to add. He grabs his knife, and gets back to work.

           EXT. FOREDECK - ORCA - DAY, LATER

           Quint shimmies along the side of the boat to the front deck. 
           There he finds a few old LOBSTER CAGES stacked together. 

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint ties a lobster cage off on gunwale cleats so that it 
           hangs down outside the stern, sitting in the water.

           Then he ladles chum in through a flap in the cage. Fish hunks 
           are caught inside; blood and oil ooze outward into the water.

           EXT. FLYING BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY

           Quint peers into the mist as he drives slowly forward. He 
           hears a SQUAWK and looks up to see THE GULL is following.

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           The Orca seems a ghost ship, suspended in a cloud of grey.
           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - NIGHT

           Holding a lantern, Quint spoons more chum into the lobster 
           cage. A line is cast out into the dark from his rod. 

           He sits into his rocking chair, rocking it with one foot up 
           on a tackle box. It creaks and groans, creaks and groans. 

           AGAIN: SCREAMS AND SPLASHES echo faintly from the dark, 
           distant and muffled. He pauses, eyes darting. Spooked. 

           MOMENTS PASS. Then he sips from his mug and resumes rocking 
           when -- the RADIO inside the cabin squawks to life.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (RADIO)
                        Fry Bait to Orca. Fry Bait to Orca. 
                        You out there? Come in Orca. 

           Quint glances back at the cabin with dark suspicion. 

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint staggers in and grabs the receiver.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (RADIO)
                        Fry Bait to Orca. Come in Orca. 

                                 QUINT
                             (into receiver)
                        What do you want, Bill?

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        There you are. Uh, just trying to 
                        check you’re okay. I got someone here 
                        who wants to talk to you pretty bad. 

           Quint frowns with suspicion and worry.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        Hello? It’s me, it’s Laura... Are you 
                        there? 

           He drops his head into his hand, closing his eyes. 

                                 QUINT
                        I’m here.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        Jesus, are you okay? We didn’t know 
                        where you were last night. I was 
                        worried sick. We called around and 
                        Bill said you bought a boat. How did 
                        you even-- I mean, how could you 
                        afford a boat?
           Beat. Quint winces, trying to think.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        He said you loaded up and left by 
                        yourself. Without a word. Please, 
                        just tell me what’s going on. What 
                        are you doing out there? 

           Quint looks out the doorway at the dark ocean. Then he speaks 
           with grim conviction.

                                 QUINT
                        I’m fishing. 

           SILENCE: Laura is disconcerted. Quint just swigs from his 
           mug, hating himself for it at the same time.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        When are you coming back?

           Quint glances around his den, bleary-eyed.

                                 QUINT
                        When I’ve caught what I need to 
                        catch. When I’ve cleared my head. 

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        Are you drinking?
                             (beat, hear her emotion)
                        This isn’t the way. I can help if you 
                        just talk to me. I want to help you.

                                 QUINT
                        Why?

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        You know why...

           He does know. Hear it in her voice: she loves him.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        Don’t run away. Don’t do this to 
                        me... I don’t deserve that.

                                 QUINT
                        No. You deserve better. You’ve always 
                        deserved better.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                             (beat)
                        Look. There’s a storm coming in. You 
                        have to at least come in for that, 
                        then if you want to go back out...
           Long beat. He’s silent. It hurts him to hurt her like this.

                                 LAURA (RADIO)
                        Quint. If you can’t talk to me, I 
                        can’t wait for you. I won’t wait.

           Quint wrestles with this a few moments. Finally he lifts the 
           receiver to speak when -- a NEW VOICE crackles over the air:

                                 FISHERMAN 1 (RADIO)
                             (laughing)
                        Just go back to her, boy! She’s ready 
                        for you!

                       LAURA (RADIO)
           Quint? Quint? Bill, what is 
           this--
                                                   FISHERMAN 2 (RADIO)
                                              Oh yeah! I’d hurry, she 
                                              sounds ready to go alright --

                                 FISHERMAN 1 (RADIO)
                        I gotta say, this is better than the 
                        pictures, I could listen to you two 
                        going back and forth all night!

                                 FISHERMAN 3 (RADIO)
                        That you, Gardner? I thought I was 
                        the only one listening to this drama.

                                 FISHERMAN 1/GARDNER (RADIO)
                        Yes sir, glad I came down the 
                        Vineyard. Good catches today but 
                        nothing as entertaining as this.

           There’s more CACKLING and BANTER back and forth between the 
           anonymous eavesdropping fishermen... 

           Quint clenches his eyes shut, embarrassed not for himself but 
           for her -- he knows this must be hurting her.

                                 FISHERMAN 2 (RADIO)
                        You still there, boy? Little lady? I 
                        think we scared them off.

           He’s got enough sense to know not to respond to them.

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        Come on guys, cut it out will ya.

                                 FISHERMAN 1 (RADIO)
                        Ah take a joke, Bill! 

                                 FISHERMAN 3 (RADIO)
                        Bill, tell her I’d be happy to come 
                        fill in instead. (laughing)
           BAM-BAM! Quint loses it -- SMASHES the receiver several times 
           against the wall. He hurls the radio, silencing the laughs.

           Miserable, he finishes his mug and slumps to the floor. But 
           there he sees HER SCARF under the table where he dropped it.

           He picks it up. He breathes in the lingering smell on it. 

           INT. GUEST ROOM, DIANE’S APT - MORNING - JULY 1945

           Quint stirs, waking in a dim apartment bedroom to see Laura 
           in bed beside him, looking at him with affection. 

                                 LAURA
                             (whispered)
                        Hi.

                                 QUINT
                        Hi back.

                                 LAURA
                        You talk different in your sleep. 

                                 QUINT
                        Slander and lies. I do not.

                                 LAURA
                        It’s true. It’s like a whole 
                        different accent. I never heard 
                        anything like it.

                                 QUINT
                             (teasing, evading)
                        Oh, you got a lot to compare it to?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m not in the habit of bringing men 
                        home with me, good sir.

                                 QUINT
                        Hope not. Otherwise this guy here, 
                        the one you been going steady with 
                        for almost four weeks now, he’d have 
                        something to say about that.

           He kisses her. But at this, Laura’s smile fades.

                                 QUINT
                        What? What is it?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry... You’re late.
                                 QUINT
                             (dread)
                        What? What time is it? Laura --

           He turns to check a clock across the room.

                                 QUINT
                        Shit!

           Quint leaps out of bed, naked, and frantically starts getting 
           dressed in his civilian clothes.

                                 QUINT
                        Why didn’t you wake me?! Laura! 

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry! I just... I didn’t want 
                        you to leave.  

           Buttoning his shirt, Quint turns to see the guilt and 
           emotional vulnerability on her face. She’s upset.

                                 LAURA
                        I don’t know when I’ll see you again, 
                        if I’ll even see you again at all. 

           Quint is in a terrible rush, but knows he owes her this brief 
           moment. He sits and takes her face in his hands. 

                                 QUINT
                        Laura Foster, nothing’s going to 
                        happen to me.

                                 LAURA
                        That a promise? 

           A twinkle in his eye; he puts on a salty sailor inflection.

                                 QUINT
                        I’m just goin’ home, remember?

                                 LAURA
                             (smiling)
                        That’s it, that voice! He’s trouble.

                                 QUINT
                             (teasing, accented)
                        You girls don’t know me. This is me. 
                        That sea’s my home, nothin’ gonna 
                        touch me there--

           She silences him with a finger on his lips.
                                 LAURA
                        Thank you for sneaking out to see me.

                                 QUINT
                             (sincere again)
                        I didn’t have a choice, I had to. 

                                 LAURA
                        Okay, go... Go on, sailor!

           He kisses her again, then he’s up and grabbing his jacket and 
           stuffing feet into boots as he opens the door --

           INT. DIANE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           He bursts from the bedroom and rushes through the apartment, 
           passing Diane in the kitchen in a robe, sipping coffee.

                                 QUINT
                        Bye Diane!

           The door slams. Diane walks to the guest bedroom where Laura 
           puts on a brave smile. Diane sits on the bed and hugs her.

                                 DIANE
                        I’ll tell you one thing about this 
                        war, it gives you an easy out. Come 
                        on, I’ll buy you breakfast.

           EXT. PORT OF EMBARKATION, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY - JULY 1945

           A taxi pulls up close to docks that are teeming with MILITARY 
           VEHICLES AND PERSONNEL. Quint leaps out and runs to a -- 

           CHECKPOINT

           A FEW GUARDS man it, checking sailors’ papers. GUARD 1 looks 
           at him, bedraggled in his civilian clothes.

                                 GUARD 1
                        You got papers to come through here?

                                 QUINT
                        My ship’s leaving!

                                 GUARD 2
                             (recognizing him)
                        Quint? Shit, I don’t want to know 
                        what’s gonna happen to you for this. 
                        She’s already casting off. Go go!

           Guard 2 waves him through. Quint starts sprinting.
           EXT. WHARF - CONTINUOUS

           MOVE WITH QUINT rounding a corner at a run, to reveal the:

           USS INDIANAPOLIS

           610 feet of sleek steel-grey US Navy cruiser; smaller and 
           nimbler than a battleship but bigger and deadlier than a 
           destroyer, she’s built for speed and quick, hard strikes. 

           TUG BOATS are already pulling her away from the wharf as 
           Quint pulls his stashed sailor suit from a trash can and 
           sprints toward the gangway. At the top, a DECKHAND sees him.

                                 DECKHAND
                        Jesus H. Christ... What the hell are 
                        you doing off the ship?! Whoa, whoa, 
                        no you’re too late!

           But Quint just races straight up the gangway --

           EXT. QUARTERDECK - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           HE LEAPS from the end, across the eight-foot gap, and lands 
           on deck next to the DECKHAND. He gives a cheeky salute.

                                 DECKHAND
                        You’re certifiable, man. You’re 
                        insane, you know that?

                                 QUINT
                        Nah. 

           Quint rushes across the quarterdeck and starts down a 
           STAIRWELL, heading below decks.

           INT. CREW QUARTERS - INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           The ship is a labyrinth of narrow corridors; a floating city 
           with 1300 men onboard. Quint squeezes past men going in all 
           directions. Some smirk at his civilian clothes.

                                 PASSING SAILOR
                        Nice rags, Quint. You stitch ‘em 
                        yourself?

                                 QUINT
                        Your mother made ‘em, Lynch. Gave ‘em 
                        to me last night.

           INT. MESS HALL - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           Quint ducks into one of the ship’s two MESS HALLS. 
           A few OFF-DUTY GUYS are still sitting and talking, a few 
           others are mopping floors and cleaning tables around them. 

           Quint heads for the serving counter. A couple of the clean-up 
           crew, HILL and GRIFFS, see him coming.

                                 HILL
                        Look at this.

                                 GRIFFS
                        Quint, where the hell you been?
                             (realizing)
                        Oh goddammit. No. You got some last 
                        night, didn’t you? 

                                 QUINT
                        A gentleman never tells.

                                 HILL
                        You ain’t no gentleman, Quint, you’re 
                        a sailor.

                                 GRIFFS
                        Two months in port, I get nothing. 
                        What am I doing wrong?

                                 HILL
                        You jerk the line, Griffs. When you 
                        set the hook, you jerk it too hard. 
                        Lose fish that way.

                                 GRIFFS
                        I’m not talking about fishing. This 
                        isn’t fishing.

                                 QUINT
                        Everything’s fishing. 

                                 GRIFFS
                        You’re gonna tell me about this 
                        later, Quint. I gotta at least live 
                        varicosely. 

                                 HILL
                        It’s vicariously, idiot. The word is 
                        vicariously.

           Leaving Hill and Griffs to bicker, Quint arrives at the 
           counter. One of the cooks, HUGHES, is cleaning up behind it. 

                                 HUGHES
                        Breakfast’s over.
                                 QUINT
                        Hughes, I gotta get on duty, I need 
                        something. Please, just a cup of 
                        coffee, maybe some toast? 

           Hughes just stares at him. He raises four fingers.

           Quint pulls out a pack of cigarettes and hands over four. 
           Hughes takes them, then pours a coffee and gets out bread and 
           peanut butter and pushes it all across the counter.

                                 QUINT
                        Hughes, I love you.

           HUGHES rolls his eyes, goes back to cleaning. 

           QUINT slides into a table next to a group of FIVE VETERAN 
           SAILORS and starts smearing peanut butter onto his bread. 

                                 QUINT
                        Fellas.

           They all grunt various hellos, as guys do. JENSEN reads a 
           newspaper. FRENCH, HOLLOWAY and GIBSON are close to Quint in 
           age. ROBERTS is a grizzled old lifer (late 40s), tattooed and 
           weathered and respected by all as kind of totemic shaman.

                                 QUINT
                        Anyone know where we’re headed?

                                 FRENCH
                        Nope. But Roberts has a bad feeling.

                                 GIBSON
                        Don’t say it. Stop talking about it.

                                 FRENCH
                        Why? It’s important, because he’s 
                        usually right.

                                 JENSEN
                        We’re going to war, anyone who 
                        doesn’t have a bad feeling is either 
                        drunk or an idiot.

                                 HOLLOWAY
                        Alright, but Roberts knows things. He 
                        foretold that Jap kamikaze that hit 
                        us back at Okinawa, remember that? 

                                 JENSEN
                             (still reading newspaper)
                        He’s not magic, just because he’s the 
                        oldest. No offense, Roberts.
           Roberts shrugs: none taken.

                                 QUINT
                             (eating his bread)
                        It true? You got a bad feeling?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Bad luck been brought aboard. 

                                 HOLLOWAY
                        They loaded something into hangar 
                        one. Big box, under Marine guard. 
                        Nobody’s allowed near it. Nobody 
                        knows what it is.

           But just then, the ship’s INTERCOM crackles to life:

                                 CAPTAIN MCVAY (V.O.)
                        Men, this is your Captain. This is a 
                        speed run, we’re pushing as fast as 
                        we can to the island of Tinian, where 
                        we’ll deliver cargo. We can’t afford 
                        to dally, so all hands be sharp... 

           They all look at each other as the announcement continues. 

                                 GIBSON
                        Tinian. Must be for a big invasion of 
                        Japan, right? That’s the plan?

                                 QUINT
                        Quicker we do it, quicker we get to 
                        go home. See you boys out there. 

           Quint drains his coffee and they grunt goodbyes. As he goes, 
           he points to Griffs and Hill, still cleaning.

                                 QUINT
                        At ease, gentlemen.

                                 GRIFFS
                        Yeah yeah, up yours, Quint.

           INT. CORRIDORS - INDIANAPOLIS

           Quint moves fast in the bustling corridors, eating his PB&J. 
           Catch glimpses of life on the ship through passing doorways. 

           INT. QUINT’S BUNK ROOM - INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint finishes pulling on his sailor’s dungarees. Bunks are 
           lashed to the walls, four levels high. A couple NIGHT SHIFT 
           GUYS are napping or browsing girlie magazines.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Where the hell have you been?

           Quint kicks his pile of civvies out of sight under a bunk and 
           turns round to salute LT BARNES (25) coming in. 

                                 QUINT
                        Sir! Went to see Doc Smith. Been 
                        having a little stomach problem.

                                 LT BARNES
                        That’s a load of bullshit. You’re 
                        damn lucky I didn’t catch you coming 
                        onboard in your civvies, Quint. 

                                 QUINT
                        No idea what you mean, sir.

                                 LT BARNES
                        Sure. We’ve been through some shit 
                        together but don’t push your luck. 
                        I’m still your officer, and we’re at 
                        war. Get back to work.

                                 QUINT
                        On my way, thank you sir.

           Lt Barnes nods and leaves, with Quint following behind. 

           INT. CORRIDORS - INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint slides around a couple people, then climbs back up a 
           series of STEEP STAIRS toward the deck:

           EXT. FORECASTLE DECK - INDIANAPOLIS - DAY

           He emerges past the ship’s 8” GUNS, but something makes him 
           pause. He glances back at San Francisco, receding behind 
           them. A moment’s thought for Laura, left behind... 

           But then other sailors are gazing upward in awe, pointing.

           Quint looks up. The ship is steaming under the GOLDEN GATE 
           BRIDGE to open sea and war beyond. It’s exhilarating. 

           EXT. FORECASTLE DECK - ANCHORED OFF TINIAN - DAY

           A PV-1 VENTURA plane roars low overhead, going in to land, as 
           Quint is now standing along the Indy’s railing with other 
           sailors, including GIBSON, several days of sailing later.

           The Indianapolis is anchored off the coast of TINIAN, an 
           island leveled by shelling and rebuilt as a huge airbase.
           Sailors watch as a MYSTERY BOX is hoisted via crane from the 
           Indy’s hangar deck and lowered down to a smaller boat, part 
           of a FLOTILLA gathered around the big cruiser.

           Quint smokes, watching SPECIALISTS also carry a strange BLACK 
           CANISTER off the ship with reverential care. TURNER, a 
           Marine, watches through BINOCULARS next to him. 

                                 PVT TURNER
                        Hell of a welcome party for it, 
                        whatever it was. High ranks down 
                        there too, and not just Navy. 

           He offers the binoculars to Quint, who takes a look. 

           Sure enough, there are TOP MILITARY BRASS on the boats. Quint 
           sees a GENERAL cross himself as the canister draws near. 

                                 GIBSON
                        I don’t get it. What the hell could 
                        be so important?

           JENSEN arrives from behind them.

                                 JENSEN
                        New orders from CINCPAC, shipping us 
                        straight onward to Leyte, via Guam.

           Quint watches the flotilla take the precious cargo. It 
           troubles him -- he too is getting a bad feeling now.

           Hearing the ROAR of more planes above him, Quint looks up --

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - MORNING - AUGUST 1946

           Quint’s sits upright in his cot and bangs his head as a SOFT 
           RUMBLING fades in the distance - A plane? Thunder? 

           He groans, hungover again. He gets up and starts to fix a 
           little hair of the dog from a bottle nearby.

           Then he halts as he hears SOMETHING ELSE... He listens.

           The boat creaks. Waves rock against it. But then -- a MUFFLED 
           METALLIC CLANGING, coming from outside...

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint steps out into a grey, blustery day. There’s the noise 
           again. It seems to be coming from the lobster cage, hanging 
           outside the stern. It CLUNKS with sudden loudness.

           Quint moves across to the stern and peers over:
           But the lobster cage hangs there, still and quiet, just as he 
           left it. He’s confused. Was he imagining it?

           He reaches down over the side.

           He grabs one of the ropes holding it in place. 

           He starts to pull the cage up when:

           A HUGE SHARK EXPLODES UPWARD FROM BELOW, ATTACKING THE CAGE 
           WITH ITS GAPING JAWS.

           Quint drops it and leaps backward in shock.

           The shark (an 18’ GREAT WHITE) completely mangles the cage, 
           chomping at the steel mesh before one rope snaps and the 
           shark suddenly yanks the whole cage underwater, disappearing.

           A FEW MOMENTS PASS and Quint stares at the surface where it 
           used to be, blood draining from his face in shock.

           Then he cautiously picks up the line and starts pulling it 
           in. Soon the cage reappears: torn apart, fish parts gone.

           Quint stares at it, numb.

           Movement draws his eye... 

           He turns, leaving the cage, shuffling across the stern to the 
           other side of the boat where...

           The BIG SHARK is gliding slowly right past the stern, dark 
           dorsal fin cutting the surface. 

           Quint grips the boat’s edge, trying to reassure himself that 
           he is safe from it here onboard. 

           THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance... 

           Quint turns to see the shark is swimming toward a horizon 
           heavy with BLACK STORM CLOUDS. Slowly, his fear gives way to 
           a rising hatred and determination instead...

                                 QUINT
                        Alright. I’m here now. I’m coming for 
                        you.

           EXT. BRIDGE - ORCA - NIGHT

           Quint drives through a summer storm in the dark. It’s no 
           hurricane, but the rain is hard and the swells kick the Orca.

           Quint swigs from a bottle as he works the wheel.
           He glances at a LIFE JACKET, sitting nearby, as if it were 
           tempting him, mocking him. He shakes his head at it.

                                 QUINT
                        Ahhh, fuck you!  

           He snatches the life jacket up and hurls it overboard when --

           BANG! Below him, the cabin door bursts open, rain pouring in.

           He jumps down onto the ladder, trying to reach the door to 
           close it again, but it swings away from him. 

           Unattended, the wheel spins freely. The boat veers sideways 
           and lists as a wave crashes over it from the side. 

           Quint falls, in terror as the far side of the boat rises 
           above him and it comes awfully close to being rolled over --

           ANGLE ON: THE CABIN, as boxes fall and bottles smash. A few 
           inches of water wash inside, hurling loose debris around.

           But the swell is merciful, and the boat swings upright again.

           Quint abandons the cabin door and climbs back up the ladder 
           to grab control of the wheel once more. 

           Regaining his breath, he focuses out into the swirling dark, 
           and there, IN THE BLINK OF A LIGHTNING FLASH, he glimpses:

           A US NAVY HEAVY CRUISER, away on the horizon.

           ANGLE ON: QUINT, dazed with shock, blinking rain away...

           Lightning flashes again but now there is NOTHING THERE.

                                 QUINT
                        It’s nothing. It’s not real. 

           He takes another swig of booze, then pulls his hood over his 
           head to block it out and fixes his eyes ahead. 

           CLOSE ON QUINT: the sound of the storm fades as his nerve 
           begins to fray with each crack of lightning and wave... 

           INT. BAR, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY - MAY 1946

           Quint is slumped over a bar alone. The place is mostly empty. 
           He’s haggard here, far from the polished sailor he once was. 

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Hello.
           He turns to see: LAURA standing there, beautifully put 
           together but also nervous, unsure of herself. It’s been 
           almost a year since they last saw each other.

                                 QUINT
                        Laura...

                                 LAURA
                        I hardly recognized you. 

                                 QUINT
                        Yeah, the beard. No more sailor 
                        whites for me, you know. War’s over.

                                 LAURA
                             (gentle)
                        So I heard. About eight months ago.

           That slides past him. He’s awkward, a shadow of the confident 
           man she knew. He moves in and quickly pecks her cheek.

                                 QUINT
                        Nice to see you again. 

                                 LAURA
                        I’m glad you called me.

                                 QUINT
                        Yeah, sorry if it was a little loud 
                        in that place I called you from... 
                        Hey, you want a drink? Here, I’ll get 
                        you a drink.
                             (to bartender)
                        Can I get another of these, and a 
                        martini for the lady.

                                 LAURA
                             (to bartender)
                        That’s okay, I’m fine. Thank you.

           Quint turns to look at Laura. She forces a smile. 

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        It’s still a little early for me.

           He gazes at her, as if he’s not even sure she’s real.

                                 LAURA 
                        What is it? Do I look different? 

                                 QUINT
                             (a compliment)
                        No. You’re exactly the same.
           Laura sits, spotting his duffel bag beside him.

                                 LAURA
                        Are you on your way somewhere?

                                 QUINT
                        This? No. Just, uh--
                             (lying)
                        I’m moving in with a friend. New 
                        place. But how are you? You okay?

                                 LAURA
                        I’m well. I’m done with school for 
                        the summer, going to drive back to 
                        see my folks on the Vineyard. Do you 
                        have plans to go back east at all?

                                 QUINT
                        Sure. Maybe. I’m working on it, you 
                        know. When I get enough for the fare.

           An awkward beat. Quint seems to be growing more anxious.

                                 QUINT
                        It’s good you’re back in school.

                                 LAURA
                        Yes, I think so.

                                 QUINT
                        How is it?

                                 LAURA
                        It’s... It’s really fascinating. I’m 
                        learning a lot. 

           Quint nods, absently. He takes a large swig of his new drink. 

                                 LAURA
                        Quint? Are you okay?

           Her kind eyes bore into him, making him uncomfortable. He’s 
           not okay; he’s struggling to control a rising emotional tide 
           he didn’t even realize had been triggered by seeing her.

                                 QUINT
                        What do you mean?

           Sensing it, she takes his hand in hers, genuinely concerned.

                                 LAURA
                             (quiet)
                        I mean, is anything wrong?
           He looks at his hand in hers: this might be the first genuine 
           human contact he’s had since the war. He’s isolated himself, 
           and this innocent concern is a spotlight shining into him.

           He tries to force a laugh, but it chokes in his throat. Tears 
           form against his will.

                                 QUINT
                        I’m fine. Really. I’m swell.

           But he can’t stop it now. A dam is cracking. 

                                 LAURA
                        Oh dear. It’s alright. Come on.

           Laura pulls him to a booth to gain some privacy. Quint is 
           embarrassed. He tries to brush it off, but it doesn’t work.

                                 QUINT
                        It’s fine. I’m fine. I’m just really 
                        tired, you know. Been a little sick.

                                 LAURA
                        Quint...

           Beat. He looks away, eyes red. He shakes his head against it.

                                 LAURA
                        What happened? Tell me... Did 
                        something happen to you?

           EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT - AUGUST 1946

           The Orca sits low in the dark ocean, cabin lights glowing 
           through the rain. Lightning forks in the distance now.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - NIGHT - AUGUST 1946

           Quint drops down from the bridge into A FOOT OF STANDING 
           WATER inside the boat that sloshes back and forth, carrying 
           unsecured flotsam with it.

           Soaked and troubled, Quint looks at the miserable scene. 

           He starts picking up debris, righting his rocking chair when--

           He notices a STRANGE BLACK SHAPE coming toward him, out in 
           the sea. He squints at it with concern -- what is it? A ship?

           At first it’s hard to tell. Strange masts spike upward and 
           the whole silhouette seems to be SUBMERGING as it comes, but 
           still -- it’s on a COLLISION COURSE with the Orca.
                                 QUINT
                             (shouting, warning)
                        Hey... HEYYY! 

           But his voice chokes as the staggering form becomes 
           recognizable: the prow sinks below the water but the signal 
           mast and conning tower of a JAPANESE B3 TYPE CRUISER 
           SUBMARINE still come at him, even as its dive continues... 

           Quint stands frozen in shock as it just submerges in time to 
           PASS DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE ORCA.

           HIGH ANGLE: lightning flashes reveal the monstrous submarine, 
           dwarfing the Orca as it glides beneath it.

           It leaves NO WAKE; it wasn’t real. Quint knows it but he’s in 
           shock anyway as the vision dissolves in the dark below...

           INT. QUINT’S BUNK ROOM - INDIANAPOLIS - NIGHT - JULY 1945

           Quint lies in his crew bunk, sweating in the heat. Men snore 
           or mutter quietly around him. He’s reading an old dog-eared 
           copy of “The Complete Works of Shakespeare”.

                                 QUINT
                        Brubaker, you awake?

           Brubaker is in his own bunk, idly toying with the engagement 
           ring on its chain around his neck.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Feel like I’m being cooked in here. 

                                 QUINT
                        You really read this whole thing? 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Sure. Didn’t think you’d actually do 
                        it though.

                                 QUINT
                        I told you, got to educate myself.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Quint, you got a long way to go 
                        before you’re in that girl’s league.

                                 QUINT
                        That’s what I’m saying, slow and 
                        steady... Gotta admit there’s some 
                        good stuff in here, despite all this 
                        sappy romantic shit. 
                                 BRUBAKER
                        Which one are you on?

                                 QUINT
                        Romeo and Juliet. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        There’s more to it than that.

           Beat. Quint raises the book again. Brubaker seems troubled.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Hey Quint... You think we’re going to 
                        be part of an invasion? 

           Quint looks up, realizing this isn’t just friendly banter.

                                 QUINT
                        I don’t know. Maybe.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        I’m getting real tired of this war, 
                        pal. I know we’re not supposed to say 
                        it, but it’s true. I want to go home.

                                 QUINT
                        It’s as good as over. We’ve got them 
                        on the run now.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        That just makes me more scared, you 
                        know? I don’t wanna be the last one 
                        to go from this thing.

           The sombre thought hangs in the quiet. Quint glances at him.

                                 QUINT
                        Brubaker?

                                 BRUBAKER
                        What?

                                 QUINT
                        You keep wearing that ring on your 
                        neck, you’re never going to get laid.

           Brubaker smiles and gives him the finger. Quint gets out of 
           bed and pulls his clothes on, grabbing his blanket.

                                 QUINT
                        Too damn hot. Gonna try the deck. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Good luck.
           EXT. QUARTERDECK - INDIANAPOLIS - NIGHT

           It’s dark and quiet. Quint steps carefully between SLEEPING 
           MEN, scattered on the quarterdeck to escape the heat below. 

           He finds a spot among them and sits with his back to a wall. 

           EXT. THE OCEAN - SAME TIME

           HIGH ANGLE: The Indy is a black shadow cutting across the 
           dark ocean, leaving a faint phosphorescent wake behind it.

           EXT. QUARTERDECK - INDIANAPOLIS - NIGHT

           Quint closes his eyes but he can’t get comfortable. The deck 
           is hard and something is troubling him.

           He stands and makes his way across to the STARBOARD RAILING. 

           He leans into it, relishing the breeze on his face... 

           Without warning, a MASSIVE EXPLOSION shreds sixty feet of the 
           starboard bow to pieces, blowing debris and flames sky-high.

           Quint falls sideways, only to then spot the slightest flash 
           of SOMETHING DARK in the water, coming at them --

           A SECOND TORPEDO HITS the same side, closer to tower one, and 
           results in an EVEN BIGGER EXPLOSION, and the combined 
           concussive force actually lifts the massive ship up off the 
           water before it slams back down at a new angle.

           Quint was thrown across the deck. Recovering, eyes wide with 
           shock, he sees the ship become a hellish inferno in seconds. 

           A GEYSER OF FIRE shoots up out of the main smokestack as 
           thousands of gallons of high-octane fuel ignite below decks.

           He feels SUCCESSIVE CONCUSSIONS from below: exploding powder 
           magazines, tearing the ship apart from the inside-out.

           Men are SHOUTING, SCREAMING and RUNNING on deck. 

                                 VOICES IN THE DARK
                        Action stations! / We’re under 
                        attack! / Mines! / It’s a bomber! 

                                 QUINT
                        Torpedoes... They were torpedoes.

           But his voice is hoarse, and no one is listening to him.

           The ship GROANS AND RUMBLES beneath him, and it starts to 
           list gradually toward starboard. 
           Suddenly, someone grabs him from behind:

                                 CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
                        You! Come on, you’re okay, let’s get 
                        to work! Everyone, get on the hoses, 
                        we gotta get these fires out!

           Afraid, Quint joins up with a SMALL GROUP, moving forward.

           EXT. FORECASTLE DECK - INDIANAPOLIS - NIGHT

           Quint runs through dark and smoke and flaming confusion. They 
           grab HEAVY FIRE HOSES, dragging them forward to fires ahead.  

                                 CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
                        This way! We’re almost there!

           SURVIVORS come stumbling past them, screaming, charred and 
           burning, skin falling off their bodies.

           But the sight ahead shocks Quint’s group: the ship is 
           mangled, steel deck plates splitting apart. Flames erupt 
           through the fissures from below, as if up from hell itself. 

                                 CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
                        Here! Here! Hook up the hoses!

           Quint’s team connect the hoses to HYDRANTS. They throw the 
           valves open but then -- NOTHING HAPPENS.

                                 SAILOR
                        What’s wrong with it? 

                                 SAILOR 2
                        Pressure’s gone! The mains must be 
                        damaged!

                                 CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
                        Keep trying! Get to the next one!

           But Quint’s attention is torn away by INJURED MEN SCREAMING 
           AND WRITHING on the deck. Quint looks down: the soles of his 
           boots are SMOKING from contact with the SUPERHEATED METAL...

           Quint and others rush forward to help. He grabs one man whose 
           legs are broken and starts dragging him away -- but his 
           cooked flesh sticks to the deck, pulling off from his bones.

           The ship rolls further to starboard. Quint helps his 
           shrieking invalid uphill to safety.

                                 QUINT
                        Medic! Medic?!
           Men are running past everywhere now: anonymous shadows in the 
           FLICKERING, CHAOTIC DARK. Some OTHERS take the injured man 
           from Quint as another EXPLOSION shakes them from below.

           Quint reaches his FIRE HOSE GROUP -- still no progress. The 
           CPO tries a COMMS BOX but it’s down too. He looks to Quint.

                                 CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
                        You! Go check the main pumps, see if 
                        you can get pressure going again!

                                 QUINT
                        You want me to go down below?

                                 CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
                        Unless an abandon ship order is 
                        given, we have to try to save her!  

           Quint is scared, but he nods -- okay.

           INT. CORRIDORS - INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint drops down a ladder into hell. 

           Fires rage in the tight hallways. A river of burning fuel 
           runs down one corridor, turning steel beams to molten slag; 
           water rushes down other halls carrying debris and body parts.

           A SAILOR whose face is burned off stumbles toward him, 
           weeping. Quint grabs him and guides him to a ladder --

                                 QUINT
                        This way! Here, grab hold and climb!

           As the sailor heads up, Quint moves off into the labyrinth. 

           The ship now lists THIRTY DEGREES to starboard, putting 
           everything on a slant. Quint stumbles sideways into a steel 
           wall which sears his arm badly. He yells in pain. 

           He hears SHOUTING up ahead, and pushes quickly forward as one 
           ABLE-BODIED GUY comes the other way, supporting another NAKED 
           SAILOR with one leg missing, his clothes burned off.

                                 QUINT
                        That way! You’re almost there!

           Quint pushes past survivors, coughing from smoke as he goes.

           He turns a corner and a TORRENT OF SEAWATER knocks him down. 

           He struggles upright, gasping and sputtering, pulling himself 
           against the current until he ducks into the PUMP ROOM -- 
           INT. PUMP ROOM - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           -- where he heads straight over to find MANGLED EQUIPMENT 
           instead of working water pumps: there’s no saving them... 

           Then, sensing something, he turns around to find HALF THE 
           ROOM IS GONE. He’s looking out through a DEVASTATING HOLE, 
           gouged across multiple decks and rooms by one torpedo... 

           Water carries oil and debris out from the other side of the 
           breach in a torrent -- beds and equipment and corpses 
           trailing behind the ship that is still moving forward.

           At the same time the ship takes on water. Soon its list will 
           put his floor at the waterline and even more will flow in.

                                 QUINT
                             (realizing)
                        She’s going down...

           INT. CREW QUARTERS - INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint stumbles past MORE MEN making their escape.

                                 ABLE-BODIED SAILOR
                        You’re going the wrong way! We have 
                        to get out!

           Frantic, Quint ignores them and moves to his bunk room:

           INT. QUINT’S BUNK ROOM - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           Steel walls are buckling, debris floats everywhere in a foot 
           of oily water. A few BODIES lie broken and dead. 

                                 QUINT
                        Brubaker?! Hart?! 

           Quint is about to leave when he hears the SLIGHTEST MOAN and 
           spots the WAVING FINGERS of a survivor, trapped.

           He drags a bed away to find GRIFFS, alive but with a broken 
           leg, bone protruding, and he’s covered in black engine oil.

                                 QUINT
                        Jesus, Griffs! 

                                 GRIFFS
                             (delirious, shouting)
                        I can’t breathe!... They left us!

           Quint grabs him and starts to lift him out --
           Then he sees Griffs is holding a BODY in his arms -- it’s 
           HILL, dead. Griffs blinks, eyes thick with smoke blindness.

                                 GRIFFS
                        Who are you? Who is that? 

                                 QUINT
                        It’s Quint! Come on, we gotta go! 
                        You gotta leave him! Griffs!

                                 GRIFFS
                             (loud, trying to hear)
                        What?!

           Quint realizes that GRIFFS is mostly deaf and blind.

                                 QUINT
                        He’s dead! You gotta leave him!

                          GRIFFS
                                                          QUINT
                                              No! He’s --
           It’s Hill! I’m getting him 
           out!

           The ship lurches further onto its side. Griffs falls. 
           Exasperated, Quint roughly tears his grip from the body. 

                                 GRIFFS
                             (trying to grab him again)
                        No! Hill! No, where’d he go!

                                 QUINT
                        Hold onto me! Just hold on to me!

           Finally Griffs grabs onto Quint, who starts leading him out.

           INT. CREW QUARTERS - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           They stumble down the hallways, now walking as much on the 
           wall as the floor, due to the ship’s increasing lean.

           Quint finds the way he came is now BLOCKED by an inferno. 

           He turns back around another corner, moving down the hall to 
           find -- A HATCH BEING CLOSED ON THEM up ahead. 

                                 QUINT
                        NO! No, wait!

           CLANG! The hatch is SEALED SHUT from the other side. Quint 
           hits it but it’s helpless. Water rises against it, knee high.

                                 GRIFFS
                        What is it? What’s happening?
                                 QUINT
                        They’re dogging the hatches...

           ON QUINT: desperately thinking...

           INT. PUMP ROOM - INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint and Griffs arrive back at the ruined pump room. The 
           waterline has now reached this deck -- pouring in through the 
           breach in a torrent. It’s a struggle to even stand.

           Quint grabs a drifting LIFE VEST and puts it on Griffs.

                                 QUINT
                        Put this on!

                                 GRIFFS
                        What are we doing?

           Quint leans out of the breach and looks up. He sees ROPE and 
           BURNED NETTING hanging down from the deck above them.

           BOOM! The ship shakes. Fire spreads into the room, closing 
           in. They have no choice now but out and up.

                                 QUINT
                        We have to climb. Stay close!

           Quint climbs out of the hole and grabs the rope. He hands it 
           off to Griffs.

                                 QUINT
                        You got it? Come on, we have to go! 

           EXT. SIDE OF SHIP - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           Griffs swings out on the rope and painfully starts climbing 
           the twenty feet to the deck. 

           After Griffs transfers from the rope onto the netting above, 
           Quint swings out below him and starts following. 

           BUT SUDDENLY: the ship JOLTS and lists further over -- GRIFFS 
           LOSES HIS GRIP AND FALLS past Quint, tumbling into the water.

                                 QUINT
                        Griffs! 

           Quint watches him bob up in his life jacket then trail away 
           into the darkness as the ship keeps moving forward.

           Quint has no choice but to keep climbing. 
           EXT. QUARTERDECK - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           Quint pulls himself up through the railing onto the deck, now 
           awash with BLOOD AND BODIES. HUNDREDS OF MEN climb uphill 
           against the sixty degree lean. 

                                 QUINT
                        Man overboard, there’s a man 
                        overboard!

                                 RESCUER
                        There’s a lot of men overboard! 

           Quint sees men up on the port side lose their grip and tumble 
           down across the deck -- Quint leaps sideways to avoid being 
           struck as they hit the railing beside him and FLIP OVERBOARD.

           Nearby, men hand out foam LIFE VESTS and LIFE BELTS. Quint 
           takes a vest, moving with the flow of men toward the stern, 
           CLIMBING UPWARD across the deck using his hands.

           But a shout comes from a SILHOUETTE on the bridge above them:

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

           The cry is taken up and spread by the frightened crowd.

                                 CROWDS/ALL
                        Abandon ship!

           Quint searches the chaotic crowd. He grabs someone:

                                 QUINT
                        Hey! You seen anyone from B-deck? 
                        Brubaker? Jensen?

           But the sailor shakes his head, too terrified to focus. 

           HUNDREDS gather along the port rail as it lifts higher into 
           the air. Men start climbing over it and jumping together in 
           droves, DROPPING EIGHTY FEET into the darkness below.

           Quint climbs upward across the deck, grabbing bulkheads and 
           loose lines to help him, moving toward the stern through a 
           CRUSHING, SHOUTING CROWD as men slip and fall down the deck. 

           A GROUP nearby tries to free one of the ship’s LIFE BOATS 
           from its stanchions, but the angle makes it hard work. The 
           boat suddenly BREAKS FREE AND FALLS, crushing a sailor. 

           Quint thinks he catches a glimpse of Brubaker, stumbling 
           blindly away from him along the railing up ahead.
                                 QUINT
                        Ed! Brubaker!

           He pushes to catch up but the man turns -- and it’s not him.

           EXT. MID-SHIP DECK - INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

           QUINT grabs the PORT SIDE RAILING as it rises higher -- he 
           climbs through until he is standing with others on the 
           outside as the ship rolls NINETY DEGREES on its side. 

           ON QUINT: terrified, he takes in the surreal scene for a few 
           moments... But then THE CROWD SHOVES HIM OVER THE EDGE --

           POV QUINT: sliding wildly, down across the huge stretch of 
           EXPOSED HULL, and into the VAST BLACK OF THE SEA below... 

           EXT. OCEAN - SINKING INDIANAPOLIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint surfaces in oil-slicked water churning with bodies and 
           debris. The hull’s WALL OF STEEL looms beside him. 

           Worried it might roll back onto him, he starts swimming away 
           hard. As he passes level with the stern, it starts RISING UP 
           OUT OF THE WATER like the tail of some metal leviathan.

           Men leap from the top. Some hit a SPINNING PROPELLER on the 
           way down and are batted at sickening angles into the dark.

           Quint keeps stroking away frantically in 10’ swells. HAUNTING 
           SCREAMS AND SPLASHING echo around in the dark...

           A wave crashes against him, sending him briefly under.

           He comes back up, sputtering. He blinks oil-stung eyes that 
           slowly adjust to a dark, GREYSCALE SEASCAPE. 

           A CORPSE floats past him, face-down in its life jacket. 

           He pushes onward toward other debris, looking for any help. 

           He grabs A CHAIR but it sinks under his weight.

           Quint sees something ahead: a SMALL LIFE RAFT with men in it.

                                 QUINT
                        Hey! Help!

           His voice is lost in the waves and the cacophony of unseen 
           men in the water, spread for a mile around, all shouting. 

           He starts swimming toward the raft. It’s slow going. He 
           flails. He sinks. He chokes and gasps and fights closer.
                                 QUINT
                        Hey! 

                                 RAFT VOICE 1
                        There’s another one! He’s got a vest 
                        on, he’s afloat!

           Quint reaches the raft, and someone inside it grabs onto him 
           by the life jacket. The tiny dingy is crowded with bodies. 
           Someone is moaning in agony, while others try to comfort him.

                                 RAFT VOICE 1
                        Got you. You okay? Hey, you hear me?

           Quint just keeps coughing up seawater and oil. 

                                 RAFT VOICE 1
                        There’s no room inside, but tie your 
                        jacket to the raft and hang on. 

           Quint nods and fumbles with his jacket, suffering from shock.

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - DAWN - AUGUST 1946

           Quint is on his hands and knees, up to his chest in the 
           waterlogged cabin, an addict searching for a fix.

                                 QUINT
                        No... No no no! Goddammit!

           All he finds are soaked grocery bags and smashed remnants of 
           fallen liquor bottles. He tips dregs into his mouth.

           His face is pale, drawn and shaky. He looks sick.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint splashes through the water and PUKES overboard.

           But then he freezes, bloodshot eyes staring out... 

           PULL AROUND HIM TO REVEAL: 

           The sea all around the Orca is awash with black fuel oil, and 
           the SURVIVORS of the Indianapolis are floating in it, 
           scattered for miles in each direction, broken and dying. 

           He turns away and collapses inside the boat. It’s hard to see 
           a man laid so low; haunted by trauma and guilt.

                                 QUINT
                        What the hell is wrong with me?

           DAWN SUNLIGHT flashes in his eyes:
           EXT. ADRIFT LIFE RAFT - OCEAN - DAY - DAY ONE 1945

           Quint winces from a scorching sun. The survivors are cooking 
           alive in the black, oil-covered, choppy sea. He lifts his 
           hand to see HIS SKIN IS WRINKLED AND PRUNED. 

           Swells attack the pitiful raft. Made of balsa wood and 
           canvas, it’s already damaged and coming apart.

                                 GRIMES (O.S.)
                        Lieutenant? Sir, I think this guy 
                        here is dead.

           LT BARNES stands to look but the floor cracks beneath him. 

           Quint glances at the miserable faces in the raft. Familiar 
           among them are LT BARNES and ROBERTS and TURNER. FRENCH too, 
           but he’s in bad shape: listless, his flesh fire-scorched and 
           shredded. Among the new faces are GRIMES and NORMAN. 

                                 LT BARNES
                        We can’t keep him, not in this heat.

           So Grimes and others awkwardly lift a CORPSE out of the raft 
           and into the water and push it away. 

           IT FLOATS -- they forgot to take the life vest off. Quint and 
           others watch it drift nearby like a ghoul, haunting them.

                                 RAFTER
                        Plane... A plane! Look!

           They all look up to see a SPECK passing high overhead. They 
           SHOUT AND WAVE, SPLASHING THE WATER to be more visible.

           Quint shouts too, until he notices that Roberts is just 
           sitting uneasily. Something about it makes Quint stop. 

           It’s quickly clear the plane won’t see them. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        Shouldn’t thrash and holler.

           Everyone glances at Roberts. Half his scalp is burned, making 
           him seem even wilder, but it doesn’t seem to bother him.

                                 GRIMES
                        We’re trying to get rescued, Roberts.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Should stay still in the water.

           He glances at Quint as he speaks. Catching an unspoken 
           meaning, a quiet dread starts to grow in Quint’s mind. 
           He turns and glances behind him, but there’s no sign of the 
           floating corpse between the waves anymore...

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Quint is staring at the fallen radio, ready to admit defeat. 
           He switches it on. It crackles with poor reception...

                                 BEN GARDNER (RADIO)
                        ...storm wasn’t worth it. Gonna be a 
                        fine day today though.

                                 FISHERMAN 2 (RADIO)
                        That’s the truth. Best catches I’ve 
                        had all month this morning. Drinks on 
                        me tonight, Gardner.

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        Hey, any of you boys heard anything 
                        from the Orca? Been trying to hail 
                        him all day. Over.

                                 BEN GARDNER (RADIO)
                        You mean the kid from yesterday?

           Quint listens closely.

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        Yeah that little lady’s worried sick. 
                        He’s solo. He was out in the storm.

                                 FISHERMAN 2 (RADIO)
                        Seemed a storm that could’ve been 
                        handled.

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        I don’t know the boy, dunno if he 
                        knows what he’s doing out there. 

                                 BEN GARDNER (RADIO)
                        Maybe you should call him in missing?

           Long beat.

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        Ah... I don’t want to make a fuss. 
                        He’s probably fine -- I’ll just keep 
                        trying the radio and wait to hear...

                                 FISHERMAN 2 (RADIO)
                        Will keep an eye out.

                                 BILL (RADIO)
                        Fry Bait to Orca, come in Orca...
           Quint finally reaches for the receiver but finds it smashed 
           open. He clicks transmit but nothing happens. Broken.

           So he turns the radio off again, silencing the chatter. He 
           looks around his ruined cabin. He’s on his own out here.

           EXT. FLYING BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY

           Quint tries a BILGE PUMP SWITCH - it hums somewhere below but 
           falters, broken. Exasperated, he turns away.

           EXT. MID-DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint splashes across the deck and leans out over the side to 
           see water barely trickling out from the BILGE PIPE.  

           He turns, surveying the scene in frustration when he spots 
           LAURA’S SCARF wafting in the standing water nearby. 

           He grabs it, but her scent is all washed out. So he wrings it 
           out and carefully lays it out on a table to dry. 

           Resigning to his fate, he grabs a bucket floating nearby, and 
           starts BAILING THE WATER OUT OF THE BOAT BY HAND... 

                                 LAURA (PRE-LAP)
                        What are you thinking about?

           INT. LAURA’S CAR - DRIVING - DAY - MAY 1946

           Laura is driving her car, wearing the scarf, with Quint in 
           the passenger seat, staring at the landscape rolling by. 

                                 LAURA (CONT)
                        Hey, you okay? You still with me?

           Quint blinks back to reality and looks at her.

                                 LAURA
                        You were someplace else there. 
                             (beat, he says nothing)
                        You don’t have to tell me about it. 
                        But I just want you to know that you 
                        can, you know, if you want to. I’m a 
                        good listener. And we’ve got a lot of 
                        hours left in this car.

                                 QUINT
                        Thank you, for inviting me to come.

                                 LAURA
                        My parents were on my back about 
                        doing the journey alone. They’re 
                        relieved I’ve got a friend along. 
                                 QUINT
                        Laura, I don’t want to impose --

                                 LAURA
                        You won’t be. They love having 
                        guests. And, bonus! You’re a veteran.
                             (beat, sweet)
                        Get some rest. Tomorrow I’m making 
                        you drive.

           He leans back but his eyes are open; he’ll get no real rest. 

           EXT. REAR-DECK - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Quint finally stops bailing water, hours later. He’s got the 
           worst of it - now just a couple inches of standing water. 

           EXT. MID-DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Quint is underneath the decking, in more water, working on 
           the bilge pump. He tightens a gasket, checks his handiwork.

           EXT. FLYING BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY

           The engine coughs to life as Quint starts it. 

           He leans over the side to see - WATER is pumped out of the 
           BILGE PIPE again, down below. But Quint is sweating, ill.

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - DAY

           Quint uses a mop to push the last of the water out. He stops, 
           crouching to pick up pieces of broken liquor bottles.

                                 QUINT
                        All my booze in the bilge.  

           He looks around, as if addressing the boat herself.

                                 QUINT
                        I see what you’re doing. Think you 
                        can clean me up too? Just slowing me 
                        down, making it all worse.

           He glances outside where he sees his FISHING GEAR waiting.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Quint digs in a tackle box to find a spool of HEAVY DUTY 
           FISHING LINE. He spends time threading it onto his rod.
           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Quint reaches into the half-empty chum bucket, gagging. He 
           pulls out a dripping hunk and uses it to bait his hook.

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - DAY, LATER

           The rod sits in its holster, line cast out, while he scoops 
           chum overboard. He’s feeling so sick his hand is trembling. 
           He’s delirious, staring at the blood blooming in the water...

           EXT. ADRIFT LIFE RAFT - OCEAN - DUSK - DAY ONE 1945

           The man floating next to Quint outside the raft has a NASTY 
           CUT on his arm that’s bleeding slightly into the water...

                                 QUINT
                        Herb? You alright?

           The man, HERBIE ROBINSON, turns. Quint nods at the wound.

                                 HERBIE
                        It’s fine, just nicked it open again. 
                        I might die of thirst though.

           PARKS turns to them from inside the raft -- a tough farm boy.

                                 PARKS
                        Won’t be long now. Rescue boats have 
                        been steaming all day. Won’t be long.

           A SUNSET fades, pink and orange. Between the swells Quint 
           glimpses a MUCH LARGER GROUP OF SURVIVORS, floating several 
           hundred yards away. He hears the WAILS of their wounded. 

                                 GRIMES
                        Maybe the bigger group over there 
                        have got tins of water. You never 
                        know. Think we should keep paddling 
                        to reach them, don’t you?

           NORMAN, in the water, lets out a sudden CRY OF SHOCK.

                                 LT BARNES
                        What? What is it?

                                 NORMAN
                        A fish, I think. Bumped right into me!

           Quint turns to look, suspicious.

                                 GRIMES
                        Hey maybe we could catch one? For 
                        food? Japs eat fish raw don’t they?
                                 NORMAN
                             (unnerved)
                        I dunno, man. It felt pretty big...

                                 FRENCH (O.S.)
                             (delirious, feeble)
                        Boat! There’s a PT boat going by.

           They all turn to look where he’s pointing. There’s no boat, 
           but Quint does see remnants of a small wake dissipating...

                                 PARKS
                        You’re imagining things, Frenchie.

                                 FRENCH
                        I saw it going by, right there.

                                 ROBERTS
                        It weren’t no boat...

           As usual when Roberts speaks, they listen. His face is grim.

           There’s a SUDDEN SPLASH from behind them. Quint and some 
           others turn to look -- another small wake dissipating. 

           Something is out there, in the water...

                                 GRIMES
                        What was that? Anybody see? 

           ON NORMAN: HE SAW. His eyes are wide and he just turns to 
           bury his face into the raft, terrified.

           Quint glances down as -- a LARGE SHADOW glides right beneath 
           his dangling legs, disappearing under the raft.

           Quint looks up, and sees Roberts staring at him ominously. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        I told you... It weren’t no boat. 

           Others start looking, and then they all see the same thing:

           A LARGE DORSAL FIN cutting the water, right behind Norman.

                                 PARKS
                        Jesus Christ...

           Quint tenses in fear. Norman and others have a harder time. 

                                 GRIMES
                        That’s a big fish. That’s an awful 
                        big fish...
                                 LT BARNES
                        It’s alright. Stay calm. What did the 
                        manuals say? Splash at them, try to 
                        make a ruckus, scare ‘em off.

                                 ROBERTS
                        That’ll only bring more of ‘em in. 

                                 QUINT
                        We should get to the other group. 
                        Better if we’re in a big group. 

           Lt Barnes looks to Roberts for confirmation.

                                 ROBERTS
                        Maybe so. The more of us the better.

           As if on cue, they all hear a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM coming 
           across the water from the big group. Then FRANTIC SHOUTING.

                                                         NORMAN
                                              Oh my god, oh my god...
                          GRIMES
           What was that? Huh? What was 
           that about?

                                 LT BARNES
                        It’s nothing. They’ve been screaming 
                        like that all day. Men are wounded. 

                                 GRIMES
                        Not like that, sir. 

                                 QUINT
                        Just start paddling, nice and easy.

                                 NORMAN
                        I want to get in the raft. Let me get 
                        in the raft!

                                 LT BARNES
                        Everyone just try to stay calm!

                                 NORMAN
                        You’re not in the water! 

                                 PARKS
                        Can it, Norman! Start swimming. 

           But Lt Barnes is getting scared, on behalf of his men.

                                 LT BARNES
                        We push until we reach the other 
                        group. In the meantime, just--  
                        Everyone just try to ignore them.
           But it’s too late. They’re already jumping at every splash.

           POV QUINT: he glances down again, past his vulnerable legs, 
           to see a couple more SHARKS rising up from the deep...

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           A three-foot JUVENILE BLUE SHARK thrashes as Quint heaves it 
           up out of the water, hanging from his fishing line.

           Holding it up, he stares into it for a few moments. It’s a 
           beauty, but Quint’s eyes are as cold and dark as the shark’s.

           He glances at his chum bucket nearby -- it’s almost empty. 

           Suddenly, he slits its belly open bottom to top with his 
           knife. Flesh opens, entrails tumble out into the water. 

           Quint removes the leader and drops the shark into the water. 
           It thrashes, then instinctively attacks its own entrails, 
           intestines passing back through the hole in its belly. 

           Quint watches with morbid intensity as it dies eating itself. 

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER: a four-foot blue shark swims past, drawn 
           by the fresh blood, and takes a bite out of the dead one.

           Satisfied, Quint grabs his rod, baits it, and casts it again.

           He hears a SQUAWK and looks up to see the WHITE GULL has 
           returned, hovering above the boat.

                                 QUINT
                        I told you, this is my business.

           He turns back to the rod but the bird SQUAWKS. 

                                 QUINT
                             (mimicking, retaliating)
                        Squawk!

           It SQUAWKS back softly. He looks up at it, fierce.

                                 QUINT
                        Squawk-squawk-squawk! What’s wrong 
                        with you, bird? You going to follow 
                        me out to sea? I got work to do.

           But watching it hover silently, something about the pretty 
           bird moves him. Perhaps it’s just having a companion. 

           He picks out a small piece of fish from the chum. 

           He holds it up, then throws it -- 
           The gull expertly snatches it out of the air, swallowing it. 

                                 QUINT
                        Birds and fishermen... Bad pairs. 

           EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY - MAY 1946

           Quint and Laura wait outside the door of a large, beautiful 
           house on Martha’s Vineyard. He tries to smooth his shirt.

           The door opens and ANNE FOSTER (45), Laura’s mother beams 
           with excitement as she pulls her daughter in for a hug.

                                 ANNE
                        Laura! My Laura, come here! I missed 
                        you so much!

                                 LAURA
                        I missed you too, Mom.

                                 ANNE
                        And this must be Mister Quint. 
                        Delighted to meet you! Come on, come 
                        on inside, both of you!

           She ushers them both inside as Laura’s father, WELLINGTON 
           FOSTER (60) comes downstairs. 

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Is that really my little Laura, the 
                        all grown up college girl?

                                 LAURA
                        Hi Daddy.

           They hug. Quint looks around; never seen a home like this.

                                 ANNE
                        And this is --

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Quint, Seaman First Class, so my 
                        daughter tells me. 

                                 QUINT
                             (shaking hands)
                        Yes sir. 

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        An enlisted man. I respect that, and 
                        thank you for your service. Laura 
                        told us all about you on the phone. 
                        You’re a New Englander yourself?
                                 QUINT
                        I moved around a lot as a kid. 
                        Fishing vessels and the like.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Well we’re happy to help a sailor 
                        out. The guest cabin out back is all 
                        yours, and I phoned a few people in 
                        town. There’s a job waiting for you 
                        at the club if you’ll have it. 

                                 QUINT
                        Thank you, that’s very kind.

                                 ANNE
                        You stay as long as you need. Now 
                        come on and we’ll get some lunch.

           Anne pulls Laura onward through the house. Quint is about to 
           follow but realizes that Mr. Foster is still looking at him.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        I want to thank you for accompanying 
                        my daughter on her journey. Lot of 
                        troubled men out there, after the 
                        war. I’m glad she had someone to look 
                        out for her. 

           Mr. Foster smiles but the tacit warning hangs in the air. 
           Nervous, Quint begins to hear echoes of: rolling waves, men 
           muttering, then A DISTANT SCREAM --

           EXT. LIFE RAFT - CALM SEAS - DAWN - DAY TWO 1945

           Quint glances across the water in the murky half-dark just 
           before dawn. He’s floating beside the life raft and most of 
           the men seem to be asleep, but a few are still gently 
           paddling by hand, talking in hushed voices.

                                 RAFTER 1
                        You hear that? It doesn’t sound safer 
                        over there.

                                 RAFTER 2
                        I don’t care if it’s safer or not, if 
                        we don’t find food or water soon 
                        we’re all dead. We have to try.

           Quint can also hear MUTED VOICES from the LARGER GROUP, not 
           far ahead now. They’ve paddled closer in the night. 

           A SPLASH behind him. Quint turns, but sees nothing. 

           He starts kicking against the raft, helping the paddling. 
           ANOTHER SCREAM, followed by SHOUTS OF ALARM, reach them from 
           the main group, waking a few others on the raft.

                                 GRIMES
                        Jesus, what’s going on over there? 

           Roberts looks at the brightening glow of the coming sunrise. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        This is their time.

                                 GRIMES
                        Whose time? What do you mean?

           SPLISH-SPLASH! A tail whips quickly through the water. 
           Another flashes past on the other side... Moving fast now.

                                 LT BARNES
                        Wake the others. 

           The boys start waking each other up, to moans and grumbles of 
           pain and hushed whispers.

           Quint turns to Herbie, floating next to him, asleep in his 
           life jacket with his back to him. 

                                 QUINT
                        Herb? Hey, Herbie. You gotta wake up.

           No answer... Quint edges around the raft to reach him.

                                 QUINT
                        Herb? Come on, Robinson, wake up.

           Quint gently takes his shoulder, turning him to see...

           Herbie Robinson’s face is stiff and contorted with utter 
           terror, eyes wide open and -- DEAD.

           Quint flinches backward in horror as Herbie’s whole torso 
           rolls over itself like a top, to reveal: 

           HE’S BEEN GRUESOMELY BITTEN IN HALF BELOW THE WAIST.

           Quint raises his hand, realizing his own skin is stained with 
           fresh blood, seeped into the water all around them... 

                                 QUINT
                        Oh my god...

           WHAM! A TIGER SHARK bursts upward and attacks Herbie’s 
           remains, shaking it like a dog with a chew toy, severing the 
           vest straps attached to the raft, and it takes him under.
           For a moment, the men all stare, utterly speechless. 

                                 ROBERTS
                             (calm)
                        We best get moving.

           But fear and panic takes over. Some spring into action, 
           shouting. Others seem to go catatonic in shock.

                                 LT BARNES
                        Everyone paddle! We’re getting to the 
                        main group, now!

           Quint is not one to show his fear openly, but see it in his 
           eyes: he’s terrified. He hooks one arm over the side of the 
           raft and STARTS KICKING to help with the effort...

           They’re creating a SPLASHING, FROTHING PANIC. And now they 
           can see DOZENS OF SHARKS around them in the dawn light.

           MORE SCREAMS reach them from the larger group, visible up 
           ahead. MORE ATTACKS are happening over there.

           Suddenly NORMAN tries to climb into the raft, TIPPING IT -- 
           water starts pouring into it from the lowered side.

                                 NORMAN
                        You can’t do this! You can’t keep me 
                        out here with them!

                                 PARKS
                        Goddammit, Norman! You’re going to 
                        sink us all! Get off!

                                 NORMAN
                        No! No!

           Men THRASH AND FIGHT, trying to free the hysterical Norman 
           from the unstable, wildly tipping raft. 

           PARKS and another guy lose their balance and fall out of the 
           raft into the water. Immediately, two other guys in the water 
           try to climb in and take their place.

           It’s an ugly chaos of SHOUTING AND SPLASHING.

           BANG! Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out. The shock of it briefly 
           freezes them all -- they turn to see LT BARNES shakily 
           standing, with a pistol raised. He’s exasperated.

                                 LT BARNES
                        You men in the water, you stay in the 
                        water. That means you too now, Parks, 
                        I’m sorry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LT BARNES (CONT'D)
                        You men in the boat, you stay in the 
                        boat. We don’t have time to argue. 
                        Right now our mission is to get to 
                        the others, and as the highest rank 
                        in this group it’s my --

           CRUNCH! He doesn’t get to finish because just then: a HUGE 
           SHARK bursts up through the pathetic, already-damaged 
           floorboards of the raft, biting and tearing.

           Quint watches in shock as a lot happens all at once:

           The raft’s floor crumbles, men fall on top of the shark. Men 
           kick down on it even as ANOTHER SHARK attacks the raft. 

           Then SOMEONE IS SCREECHING on the other side of the raft and 
           men are scrambling away from him -- 

           POV: glimpses of flailing limbs and blood spurting into the 
           air and a tail flipping up...

           QUINT turns and swims in the other direction with others.

           THE RAFTERS cling to floating remains of the raft, kicking 
           and pushing, everyone shouting, panicking, fighting --

           NORMAN treads water, seeing LARGE SHARKS pass inches away 
           from him, cutting right through the middle of the group. 

           GRIMES is swimming when a shark takes him, biting a chunk out 
           of his torso, killing him instantly and dragging him under.

           Gasping, Quint swims past the raft wreckage as it splinters 
           and comes apart, forcing men to abandon it. 

           The water is red with blood now. The sharks dart past all 
           around them, working up into a FEEDING FRENZY.

           Quint sees old Roberts, calmest of the group, grab the life 
           jacket strap of a CATATONIC BOY on the edge of the group, 
           paralyzed by fear. Roberts drags the boy away with him.

           Most are frantically scattering away from each other.

                                 LT BARNES
                        Stay together! Everyone gather on me!

           Some of them hear him, SHOUTING to others. Quint grabs Norman 
           on his way, who has tears streaming down his face. 

                                 QUINT
                        Come on! Swim!
           They both swim toward Barnes. Norman screams as sharks bump 
           them with their noses and flit away -- testing, probing. 

           A GROUP OF SEVEN assembles around Barnes, including Quint. 

                                 LT BARNES
                        Hold onto each other, face out. Kick 
                        ‘em! Hit ‘em! Do whatever you can to 
                        keep them away!

           As Quint maneuvers into the group, another LONE SWIMMER in 
           the background is pulled under. None of them even notices it.

                                 RAFTER 1
                        Who’s not here? Who are we missing?! 

           Then Quint turns and they see French, badly injured from the 
           explosions, flailing helplessly away from the group.

                                 PARKS
                        Frenchie!

           With no thought for his own safety, PARKS breaks from the 
           group and starts swimming for his friend.

                                 LT BARNES
                        No, wait! 

           The rest watch him helplessly as sharks circle closer.

           UNDERWATER: fragile, vulnerable legs all kicking together to 
           stay afloat, as sharks glide and swoop around them.

                                 RAFTER 2
                        Come on, Parks! Come on! 

           The group sees Parks reach French and grab him, but now they 
           seem terribly far, as Parks starts towing his friend back.

                                 GROUP/ALL
                        Swim! Keep swimming Parks! Don’t 
                        look, just swim!

           Utterly exhausted, Parks gasps, barely keeping them afloat.

                                 QUINT
                             (to the group)
                        Come on, kick toward him!

           All together, the group starts swimming, closing the gap. 

           Quint looks up, seeing a dorsal fin heading for Parks...
                                 QUINT
                        No!

           BUT THEN: A SCREAM erupts RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- a shark bursts 
           into the group and attacks the boy that Roberts was holding. 
           It takes his leg off. The boy WAILS IN HORROR as more blood 
           blooms in the water and Roberts holds onto him from behind. 

                                 ROBERTS
                        I’ve got you, I’ve got you!

           WHAM! ANOTHER SHARK bites into a man beside Quint, who vomits 
           up blood, screaming, and then is yanked underwater.

           Then suddenly: an arm grabs Quint from behind, startling him-- 

           It’s Parks and French, alive. They made it, but Parks barely 
           has the energy to keep himself afloat. Someone takes French 
           while Parks grabs hold of Quint, briefly dragging him under --

           UNDERWATER POV: he glimpses DOZENS OF SHARKS around them 
           before he kicks back up again, dragging Parks up with him. 

                                 PARKS
                        I’m sorry Quint, I got nothing left!

                                 LT BARNES
                        Look! The other group is right there!

           The big group is now maybe forty meters away. It’s a A FEW 
           HUNDRED MEN, clinging to FLOATER NETS. 

           But the sight is no comfort to Quint’s group, who all halt, 
           staring ahead in shock...

                                 PARKS
                        Sweet jesus...

           A MASSIVE FEEDING FRENZY is taking place at the big group. 

           Men are scattering and panicking in all directions and Quint 
           witnesses NUMEROUS ATTACKS, producing blood and screams... 

           As the sun rises: SEE HUNDREDS OF SHARKS circling them.

           ON QUINT’S GROUP: watching the nightmare, realizing there’s 
           no safety there. See it in their faces: hope is collapsing.

           CLOSE ON: QUINT, frantic and paralyzed, knowing there’s 
           nothing he can do but wait...
           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Quint is hunched over the stern, chum ladle in hand. He looks 
           terrible, pale and sickly. He glances up at the GULL, still 
           hovering above, then returns to staring at the water.

           TICK-TICK-TICK... Little tugs on his holstered rod’s reel.

           A bite? Quint turns and eyes the rod when --

           THE REEL SCREAMS as line is taken out fast. The rod bends 
           under pressure --

           Quint grabs it just as the rod lifts out of its shallow 
           holder. The fish runs a few moments and then finally stops.

           Quint heaves backward, but only gets a tiny amount of slack. 
           The rod bends. It’s SOMETHING BIG... 

                                 QUINT
                        Okay. Alright now.

           Quint is nervous but determined, leaning back, using his 
           weight but still barely getting an inch from this fish. 

           And then it runs again -- he lets the reel whine as line is 
           taken out FAST. Fast enough to SCARE HIM... 

           Quint drops down into his rocking chair and kicks his feet up 
           against the stern. It’s no sport fishing chair but it’ll do 
           in a pinch. He heaves on the rod as he gets tension again. 

           His knuckles are white. He breathes hard, straining, when the 
           gull starts SQUAWKING overhead.

                                 QUINT
                        Shut up or go away! I have to do 
                        this, you hear!

           He reels in a bit as he settles in for a long struggle.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - LATER

           Quint is pale and drenched in sweat. His blistered hands are 
           bleeding on the rod. He’s still fighting this fish and it’s 
           closer in to the boat now. 

           ANGLE ON: THE ROCKING CHAIR as it is dragged forward in 
           little budges, sleds scraping across the wet deck.

           Quint stands out of the chair and guides the line around the 
           stern as the boat chugs slowly on, wheel locked on course.

           Then line shifts direction as the fish dives under the boat.
                                 QUINT
                        No, no! Come on! 

           He angles the rod around the edge of the stern, moving up the 
           port side of boat. But the line doubles back underneath --

           EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

           The fishing line is pulled in against the side and keel of 
           the boat, continuing deeper where it disappears into gloom.

           Nearby, the boat’s PROPELLER SHAFT SPINS, THROBBING...

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Quint keeps his grip, but he knows he’s in a tough spot with 
           the line going under the boat and no one to help him. 

           ANGLE ON: his feet shuffle across a still-wet deck.

           Suddenly his prey runs and several things happen ALL AT ONCE:

           Quint’s FOOTING SLIPS on the wet deck and he falls --

           EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           The line is pulled across the ACTIVE PROPELLER and tangles in 
           it -- the prop shaft STARTS EATING UP LINE --

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           -- as Quint is unbalanced by his fall, the rod is yanked out 
           and sideways, ripping him forward across the deck -- 

           He SLAMS into the gunwale before he lets go of the rod and 
           just manages to grab onto the edge as he tumbles over it --

           EXT. UNDERWATER - ORCA - SAME TIME

           The rod is pulled underwater and mangled by the propeller as 
           the heavy duty line spirals and tangles all around it --

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Terrified, Quint hangs on outside of his boat, feet kicking 
           the water, before he manages to heave himself back inside.

           But then the engine is making a HORRIBLE GRINDING SCREECH 
           from the prop shaft jamming up -- 

           He bolts upright, runs and climbs up to the bridge --
           EXT. BRIDGE - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           -- Quint kills the straining engine. SILENCE returns. 

           He wipes his face. He glances down at the rear deck: empty 
           chum bucket, empty fish locker, empty rod holster... 

           And then, from the high vantage point he sees...

           The large dark shadow of a GREAT WHITE SHARK, swimming away 
           from the boat until it melts into the deep and is gone. 

           Quint slumps down to the floor, shaky. Stranded with no gear 
           left: a failure. His eyes are vacant with a hopeless stare...

           INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY - JUNE 1946

           Quint works as a DISH BOY in a restaurant kitchen, COOKS 
           behind him. He washes plates in an industrial sink. He takes 
           another from a dirty pile, as a BUSBOY deposits more on top.

                                 BUSBOY
                        Rand’s gonna be in here in a minute. 
                        Get this pile done.

           As the busboy leaves, Quint stares down into the sink...

           ANGLE ON: the oily, dirty water, churning with his hands.

           Quint looks out the window above the sink --

           ANGLE ON: ocean swells crashing against the rocks outside.

           ON QUINT: memories stir. He holds a quivering hand up to see 
           that the SKIN ON HIS FINGERS IS PRUNING...

           THUD-THUD-THUD... He glances behind him, where a cook is 
           cleaving ribs from a blood-red rack of meat.

           The details begin to assault him, repeating: waves crash, 
           meat cleaves, swing doors creak, cars pass outside, water 
           gurgles in the drain, dirty dishes clunked down on the pile. 

           The intensity builds, paralyzing him until -- 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint bursts from a service door, hyperventilating, in a cold 
           sweat. He pulls a pocket hip flask and takes a long swig.

           He looks up at the ocean across the street, as if it were 
           taunting him, calling to him. But he’s afraid.
           THUMP! The door open again, and then the restaurant manager 
           RAND (45) finds him. 

                                 RAND
                        What the hell is this? I’ve got 
                        dishes piling up in there and 
                        customers complaining about the wait 
                        and you’re out here -- drinking? Are 
                        you trying to lose your job?
                             (Quint ignores him)
                        Are you even listening to me? Look at 
                        me. Look at me, son!

           Quint takes another swig, right in front of him.

                                 RAND
                        Give me that. 

           He tries to take it from Quint --

                                 RAND (CONT’D)
                        I’m not having employees drinking on 
                        the job. Give it to me!

           As he reaches for the flask, Quint suddenly grabs his arm and 
           aggressively shoves him up against the wall. 

           Beat. Quint’s bloodshot eyes bore into him, dangerous pain 
           churning below the surface. But then Quint turns the flask 
           upside down and empties it onto the ground at their feet.

                                 QUINT
                        Sorry, boss. Just having a bad day.

           He lets go and walks away, leaving the manager stunned.

                                 RAND
                        You’re done, you understand? I took 
                        you on as a favor to the Fosters, but 
                        that’s it. Go destroy yourself 
                        someplace else!

           EXT. MARINA - NIGHT - JUNE 1946

           Later that night, Quint sways along a path by the marina, 
           drinking from a bottle, when he stumbles and falls down.

           He’s unhurt but he stays where he landed. He gazes out into 
           the dark, toward the ocean. A BUOY BELL dings gently 
           offshore. Water laps against boats moored along the docks.

                                 FISHERMAN (O.S.)
                        I see ya there.
           Quint turns to see A FIGURE sitting on a bench nearby, face 
           concealed by shadow. He’s toying with a length of rope, tying 
           and untying knots, smoking a cigarette. Seems about sixty.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        You’re not one of them.

                                 QUINT
                        What?

                                 FISHERMAN
                        Not your town. Not your island. 
                        Island full of guppies, that’s what 
                        this is. You’re not guppy. You’re a 
                        fisher, same as me.

                                 QUINT
                        You don’t know me, old man.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        I know you. Call yourself Quint.

           Quint turns, spooked now.

                                 QUINT
                        Who are you?

                                 FISHERMAN
                        I’m about between here and Amity 
                        Island, where I do my business. I 
                        seen you around this past month. 
                        You’re a drinker. Sometimes you’re a 
                        talker when you’re a drinker.
                             (beat)
                        You want to get better, get back on 
                        the water. But you’re scared. So 
                        you’re drinking and country clubbing 
                        and playing with guppies.
                             (beat)
                        Ain’t the truth of you, who should be 
                        hooking ‘em instead.

                                 QUINT
                        I’m just trying to... There’s a girl.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        ‘Course. You got a choice, between 
                        that or what you feel you got to do. 
                        Some get a choice in life. Some 
                        don’t. Some’s just guppies. 

                                 QUINT
                        What the hell are you talking about?
                                 FISHERMAN
                        She’s landlocked, isn’t she? But you, 
                        you got salt in you. You been on the 
                        sea, in it, across it, under it and 
                        back up again. Can’t leave it now.

           Beat. Quint looks out where the ocean is concealed by a 
           darkness that seems to beckon to him.

                                 QUINT
                        I still see them. Every night they’re 
                        there. Think I’m going crazy.

                                 FISHERMAN
                        You been with some bad fish, boy.

                                 QUINT
                        What do I do?

                                 FISHERMAN
                        With bad fish? Put ‘em to rest.

           Quint glances at the man, who lights up a new cigarette.

                                 QUINT
                        I don’t know if I can go out there 
                        again. 

                                 FISHERMAN
                        You been hurt in the leg, you don’t 
                        try to fix your shoulder.
                             (beat)
                        You been hurt out there, don’t try to 
                        fix it here. You want to reckon with 
                        bad fish, you got to go to them. 

           Beat. The buoy’s bell CHIMES in the distance. Staring ahead, 
           Quint doesn’t look at the man again. 

                                 QUINT
                        I don’t even have a boat.

                                 FISHERMAN (O.S.)
                        It’ll come. When you decide to start 
                        lookin’, it’ll come.

           EXT. ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Smoke coughs from the high exhaust as the engine STRAINS and 
           a sickening GRINDING sounds from the tangled prop shaft. 

           Quint cuts the engine and climbs down from the bridge. He 
           leans out over the stern, trying to glimpse the problem, but 
           the propeller is hidden underneath.
           He scans an empty horizon on all sides of him: he’s alone, no 
           help available. He knows what he has to do, but he’s afraid.

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - DAY

           Quint hooks a gunwale ladder on the outside of the stern, 
           then takes the time to strip down to his undershorts.

           He glances up, as if for the gull, but it’s not with him now.

           He picks up his knife. 

           Slowly, carefully, he climbs out onto the ladder.

           He pauses, staring at the water just below him with dread. 

           He hesitates for a long moment, paralysed. 

           It’s a gut-wrenching, awful fear that makes him physically 
           nauseous, almost gagging. Tears well up in his eyes. 

           But finally he closes his eyes and, for the first time since 
           his ordeal, lowers himself back down into the salt water.

           He gasps and begins to hyperventilate, just from the feel of 
           it again, as he is immersed up to his shoulders, still 
           gripping the ladder. 

           Tears run down his cheeks. He looks down at his feet, 
           dangling freely over the deep once again.

           Panic starts to rise. He turns, frantically glancing around 
           as if checking for any threats below.

           But there’s nothing. He closes his eyes, trying to calm 
           himself a little... But he knows it’s not going to work.

           He steels himself, then takes a breath and ducks underwater.

           EXT. UNDER THE STERN - CONTINUOUS

           Quint uses his hands to pull himself under the boat where he 
           finds the propeller -- its shaft completely tangled in heavy 
           fishing wire. Pieces of the smashed fishing rod hang from it.

           He inspects it for a moment. It’s a mess. It’s going to take 
           some time and effort down here...

           CLOSE ON: HIS FACE - a growing unease in his eyes. He spins 
           around, checking behind him, but there’s nothing there... 

           Then he looks down... And sees the SHADOWY FORMS OF SEVERAL 
           SHARKS rising from the gloom far below... 
           Panicking, he starts pulling himself back to the surface.

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           Quint bursts up to the surface, gasping for air. He grabs the 
           ladder but now he sees no sign of the sharks below... 

           He closes his eyes but it starts to bring back the same 
           HAUNTING SOUNDS of men in the water, MUTTERING AND MOANING... 

           EXT. FLOATER NETS - GENTLE SEAS - DAY - DAY THREE 1945

           Quint and his group now cling to FLOATER NETS among a group 
           of a HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN. The nets barely keep afloat, 
           sinking and shifting horribly, providing no rest.

           The sun scorches. Men are parched and burned. HUNDREDS OF 
           SHARKS circle, some mere feet away, but more docile for now.

           Quint is startled when someone grabs him. He turns to see the 
           ship’s level-headed DOCTOR SMITH, a reassuring presence.

                                 DOC SMITH
                        Quint? Thought that was you. Jesus, 
                        you look like hell. I been making 
                        rounds, I didn’t know you were here 
                        with us. You alright? You hurt?

                                 QUINT
                        Reached you this morning. Guys are in 
                        bad shape, Doc. French needs help, 
                        he’s septic. He tried to drink the 
                        seawater last night.

                                 DOC SMITH
                        You didn’t let him?

                                 QUINT
                        I’m not stupid. He’s over there.
                             (as Doc starts to leave)
                        Hey, Doc. You seen any of my guys? 
                        Brubaker? Griffs? Gibson?

                                 DOC SMITH
                             (hesitates)
                        Brubaker. He’s on the other side of 
                        the group.

                                 QUINT
                             (off his look)
                        What? What is it?

                                 DOC SMITH
                        I’m sure he’d like to see you. 
           This worries Quint. He turns to LT BARNES, listless nearby.

                                 QUINT
                        L.T., I’m going round the other side 
                        of the group. Something I got to do.

           Lt Barnes just nods like a man losing hope. So Quint starts 
           maneuvering himself past boys, eliciting a cry of pain here 
           and there as he brushes past --

           He reaches the edge of the group and - WHOOSH! A SHARK glides 
           past, inches away from him. Some nearby men flinch away in 
           panic, while others seem to have become numb to the threat.

           Nervous, Quint steels himself then pushes out and STARTS 
           SWIMMING around the outside of the group, facing inward, 
           searching among the blistered, miserable faces.

           As he goes, he hears SPLASHES AND MOVEMENT behind him. He 
           freezes in fear several times, but keeps going.

           BACK WHERE HE STARTED

           ROBERTS watches Quint’s progress from a distance. 

           He’s enigmatic, but there’s a hint of admiration for Quint. 
           Very softly, he starts SINGING an old sailors’ song:

                                 ROBERTS
                             (singing, slow and soft)
                        Farewell and adieu, to you bright 
                        Spanish ladies... Farewell and adieu, 
                        to you ladies of Spain... For we’ve 
                        received orders, to sail back to 
                        Boston... And we hope in a short 
                        time, to see you again...

           NEARBY MEN start to come out of their stupor. One by one, 
           others join in, SOFTLY SINGING the words too:

                                 ROBERTS AND OTHERS
                        We’ll rant and we’ll roar, like true 
                        Yankee whale men... We’ll rant and 
                        we’ll roar, across the salt sea... 
                        Until we sight Amity beside Martha’s 
                        Vineyard... Straight up the channels 
                        of New England we’ll roll...

           MOVING THROUGH THE GROUP

           Quint continues on as THE MELANCHOLIC SONG SPREADS, picking 
           up more voices, getting gradually more energetic, more 
           defiant, with subsequent verses and chorus refrains...
           The music gives him courage. Exhausted, he swims onward, 
           checking faces as more men wake up to the song or join in.

           BRIEF SEQUENCE:

           - Quint passes men in various stages of unbearable hell. Some 
           float in their underwear or naked, clothes burned off their 
           backs, others in full uniform. All are oil-stained.

           - Chronic dehydration causes delirium and horrible pain. 
           Everyone is hollow-eyed, tongues and eyeballs swollen out.  

           - Some are burned, others are mutilated. Small fish swirl 
           between them, nipping at wounds.

           - A group of men remove the life jacket of a dead comrade and 
           push his body away from the group as it sinks.

           - One man pushes in front of Quint, mumbling nonsense, his 
           mind broken, and starts swimming away from the group. Quint 
           watches him until he is suddenly attacked by a shark.

           - He sees another boy, unseen in the middle of a group, 
           calmly let his face drop into the water and drown himself.

           - A shark noses up against Quint and he kicks it away.

           - Moving carefully, Quint makes his way through the misery.

           OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUP

           Finally, Quint glimpses a familiar face clinging to the nets.

                                 QUINT
                             (hoarse)
                        Hart! Hart!

           HART turns and sees Quint with relief and hope.

                                 HART
                        Quint?!

           Quint maneuvers through the survivors, barely keeping his 
           head above the water until he can grab onto a floater net.

           Hart is holding onto SOMEONE ELSE, facing away. He sees Quint 
           struggling to stay afloat, despite his life jacket.

                                 HART
                        The jackets, they’re taking on water. 
                        Mine’s almost useless too. 

                                 QUINT
                        You alright, you hurt?
                                 HART
                        Hanging in. But Quint...

           Face full of dread, Hart turns the man he’s holding onto:

           It’s BRUBAKER, terribly burned. Skin blackened and peeling 
           off him. Eyes swollen shut. It’s gruesome and heart-breaking.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Who is that? 

                                 HART
                        He can’t see.

                                 QUINT
                        It’s me, pal. It’s Quint.

           Brubaker’s mutilated face pauses, then contorts as he seems 
           to cry, reaching out to Quint.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Quint? Quint, you’re alive. I don’t 
                        know what’s happening. Why aren’t we 
                        rescued?

           Quint gently slides next to him, all floating up to their 
           shoulders. Brubaker winces from each small contact.

                                 QUINT
                        I don’t know. Don’t worry, we’re 
                        together now. We’ll be alright.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        You should’ve stayed behind. 
                        Shouldn’t have got on the boat.

                                 QUINT
                        That’s the damn truth. I been looking 
                        for you all over, and here you are 
                        with this little twerp Hart, huh?

                                 HART
                        He saved my life.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        I didn’t.

                                 HART
                        He got me out. I was knocked out 
                        cold. Came round and he’s dragging me 
                        out. He shielded me from the fire, 
                        took it himself.
                                 BRUBAKER
                             (trying to make light of it)
                        Liar... You think I’d rescue some 
                        greenie piece of shit...

           But Hart is the one getting emotional now, looking at 
           Brubaker and the evident sacrifice he made.

                                 HART
                        No. I didn’t think you would. But you 
                        did.

           They’re interrupted by A SCREAM and commotion - yet another 
           shark attack, a ways away. But they just block it out.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Quint, I’m hurt bad.

                                 QUINT
                        No, no. You’re looking fine. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        No. Something’s wrong. I can feel it. 
                        It’s been days; they’d be here by 
                        now. You gotta get Hart out, okay?

           Quint glances at Hart, who is shaking his head in disbelief.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        You gotta get him out.

                                 HART
                        Stop saying that, Brubaker. I can 
                        take care of myself.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        I don’t care what you think.
                             (back to Quint)
                        He’s a greenie. He’s the youngest.  

           Quint just stares at his delirious friend, unsure what to 
           make of this, while Hart feels both shame and guilt.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Just keep him alive, don’t make what 
                        I did be in vain.

           Quint leans in conspiratorially, voice roughing at the edges 
           as his real accent comes through. 

                                 QUINT
                        Okay listen, no more Navy bullshit, 
                        I’ll tell you what’s what. We keep 
                        alive, together. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 QUINT (CONT'D)
                        Think a little fire or sharks can 
                        take us down? Huh?
                             (Brubaker allows a smile)
                        No, no. Not you, not me. Not even 
                        baby-hands Hart here. Not on my 
                        watch. They scuppered our vessel and 
                        we’re in the salt now but it’s home. 
                        We’re still gonna fish, you’ll see. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Yeah. Just promise me. Say it anyway.

                                 QUINT
                        I promise.

           Brubaker reaches out blindly and takes Quint’s hand. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        I got another favor to ask you.

           He painfully removes the silver chain from his neck, DIAMOND 
           RING attached to it, and puts it in Quint’s hand.

                                 QUINT
                        No don’t-- Don’t take that off. 

                                 BRUBAKER
                        It hurts my neck. Just hold onto it.

                                 QUINT
                             (beat, taking it)
                        Don’t mean we’re engaged or anything.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        You been my best friend in this 
                        fucking war. You’ll know what to do 
                        with it.

                                 QUINT
                        I’ll hold it, that’s all. You’re 
                        gonna find a nice birdie back home 
                        and you’re gonna give it to her.  

           Quint loops the chain over his own head. Brubaker reaches out 
           and feels it around Quint’s neck.

                                 BRUBAKER
                        Good. 

           Brubaker turns and leans back against Quint. MOMENTS LATER he 
           seems to be asleep. Quint glances at Hart --

           But then Brubaker suddenly slips down out of his life jacket, 
           which he undid without them noticing. He immediately SINKS.
                                 QUINT
                        No!

           Bubbles erupt as Brubaker EXPELS ALL OF HIS AIR, sinking 
           deeper below. Quint fights free of the net then DIVES UNDER --

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Quint swims downward, past dangling legs and circling sharks, 
           and there sees: Brubaker convulsing as he sinks deeper.

           Quint only stops when he sees the truth: Brubaker is already 
           drowned, now just sinking away into the deep. 

           REVERSE ANGLE: but now it is 1946 bearded Quint, who has 
           dived down from the Orca’s ladder, staring into the gloom 
           below as the vision of Brubaker fades from present reality. 

           Realizing where he is, he quickly kicks back up again.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Dripping wet on deck, Quint is wrecked from the memory but 
           also his failure to get the job done and fix the propeller.

                                 QUINT
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry...

           The profound quiet and loneliness weighs on him. Then he 
           finds himself shivering... He looks ill, eyes sunken.

           EXT. THE OCEAN - DUSK - AUGUST 1946

           The Orca is a tiny speck in a vast ocean as the light fades.

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - NIGHT

           Quint rummages through the cabin’s kitchenette once more. He 
           finds an intact bottle but only gets a few drops from it.

           He eyes the sandwich items and food he brought, but most of 
           it is soaked and ruined. He groans in pain, quivering. 

           He pops painkillers and sits at the table. He starts HITTING 
           HIS HEAD compulsively, until he sees LAURA’S SCARF opposite 
           him where he left it, now dried out.

           But unlike before, now he stares at it coldly, emotionless.

           INT. BURGER JOINT - NIGHT - JULY 1946

           Quint looks at the scarf, draped over a booth seat behind 
           Laura who is sitting opposite him, beginning to eat.
                                 LAURA
                        I used to come here as a kid. Best 
                        burgers on the island. But it’s these 
                        milkshakes that do it. 

           UNDER THE TABLE: Quint tops up his Coke from a hip flask. 

                                 LAURA
                        So how was work today? 

                                 QUINT
                        I think your dad’s friend likes me.

                                 LAURA
                        Rand? You think so?

                                 QUINT
                        Sure.

                                 LAURA
                        Well that’s great. Really great!

           She takes a bite of her food. Quint stares into his.

                                 LAURA
                             (mouth full)
                        Aren’t you going to eat?

                                 QUINT
                        Why are you doing this? Why are you 
                        all being so nice to me? 

           Beat. Laura isn’t hurt by this. She looks at him, ragged 
           beard growing in, dark circles under his eyes. 

                                 LAURA
                        Because. I met this guy once. He was 
                        happy and charming. And he could 
                        dance pretty well. And I liked him.

                                 QUINT
                        You sure that was the real me? You 
                        sure you actually know me?

                                 LAURA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 QUINT
                        I thought maybe the Navy’d give me an 
                        escape. Give me a chance at a life 
                        like yours. A chance to change where 
                        I came from. But maybe it didn’t.

           Beat. Laura stares at him.
                                 LAURA
                        You think you fooled me? I admired 
                        that you were working to make a 
                        future for yourself. I believe in 
                        that guy I knew for a few happy 
                        weeks. He was real. And I don’t think 
                        you should give up on him.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Laura?! Laura Foster!

           Laura and Quint look up as handsome, all-American BRIAN 
           MCCLAIN (25) comes back to their table from a passing group.

                                 LAURA
                        Gosh, Brian.

                                 BRIAN
                        I didn’t know you were back in town!
                        It’s been too long! And you look just 
                        great.
                             (turning to Quint)
                        Hi. Brian McClain.
                             (shaking his hand)
                        Laura and I grew up together - our 
                        fathers are friends. I used to chase 
                        her around on the beach and pull her 
                        hair, didn’t I?

                                 LAURA
                        I believe I gave as good as I got.

                                 BRIAN
                        Very true. I heard you were in school 
                        out west?

                                 LAURA
                        It’s picking back up now the war’s 
                        over. I hope to graduate next year.

           Quint sips his Coke, watching them. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Racing ahead of me again. The war 
                        kept me back but I’m starting 
                        Princeton in the fall. I really can’t 
                        wait. Well hey, I don’t want to 
                        interrupt your meal here but-- Look, 
                        if you two don’t have plans you 
                        should come join us later, we’re 
                        headed to Ernie’s after.

                                 LAURA
                        Sounds fun. Maybe we will.
                                 BRIAN
                        Alright, I hope so. 

           Brian rejoins his friends, leaving. Quint glances at Laura.

                                 LAURA
                        What?

                                 QUINT
                        Nothing. 

           Stone-faced, Quint drains the rest of his spiked Coke.

           INT. ERNIE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT - LATER

           Quint sits at a beach bar watching a crowd dance to a band.

           ACROSS THE BAR: Laura talks with Brian and another girl. 
           Brian is clearly flirting with her; she’s just being nice. 

           She glances over at Quint and smiles to him. He hardly 
           reacts, eyes glazed. She breaks away and comes over to him.

                                 LAURA
                        Did you pick up on that?

                                 QUINT
                        What?

                                 LAURA
                             (flirting)
                        I gave you a look. You know, a 
                        glance. You used to claim you knew 
                        all about glances.

                                 QUINT
                        Oh, right. Yeah. I know what it 
                        meant. It meant you want me to rescue 
                        you from that asshole.

           Laura’s smile fades.

                                 LAURA
                        He’s not an asshole. He’s a friend. 
                        Just be nice.

                                 QUINT
                        I am being nice.

           She gives him a “yeah right” look.

                                 QUINT
                        I know that look. That look means... 
                        You want another drink with me.
                                 LAURA
                        You’ve had enough. Come dance. 
                             (encouraging)
                        Come on, it’ll be fun. Get up.

           She takes his hand, leading. He sways a little on the way. 

           DANCE FLOOR

           They dance together, his hand at her waist. She steps closer. 
           She smiles up at him. But his eyes start to dart around the 
           swirling room, at the different people, at the band... 

                                 LAURA
                        Hey. Eyes down. I’m right here.

           Quint looks down at her.

                                 LAURA
                        You alright?

           He just nods, but he’s never really okay these days. He seems 
           anxious, nervous, and of course, drunk.

           A girl SHRIEKS behind them, causing Quint to suddenly jerk 
           around in fright -- but she’s just crying out in fun as her 
           boyfriend dips her.

           The KICK DRUM startles him as the band ups the tempo. Dancers 
           CHEER AND WHIRL around them. It all starts BLURRING INTO: 

           EXT. FLOATER NETS - OCEAN - DAWN - DAY THREE 1945

           -- Quint spins round in the water, seeing MEN FIGHTING each 
           other in the half-light. VICIOUS FIGHTS break out everywhere 
           in the group as MASS PARANOID DELUSIONS spread like wildfire.

                                 VOICES (O.S.)
                             (shouting)
                        It’s a Jap! / He’s trying to get me! 
                        / Kill them! / Kill the Japs!

           Driven mad from exposure, dehydration and hypothermia, men 
           are screaming, stabbing, biting and drowning each other. 

                                 HART (O.S.)
                        Quint! Quint, help!

           Quint spots Hart being attacked and pulled under by TWO MEN.

           Quint swims over and throws a punch at FIGHTER 1, knocking 
           him backward where he’s then consumed by a different brawl --

           But then FIGHTER 2 has Hart in a hold, trying to drown him.
                                 QUINT
                        Hart!

           Terrified for him, Quint grabs Fighter 2 round the neck and 
           all three GO UNDERWATER, fighting, wrestling.

           But Hart is failing, going limp... There’s no other option...

           Quint wrenches the man’s neck and with a CRACK -- HE DIES.

           Quint pulls Hart to the surface, both gasping for life. 

                                 HART
                        They’ve gone mad. They’ve gone mad!

           Quint is in shock, at having killed one of their own...

                                 LAURA (PRE-LAP)
                        Quint? Hey...

           INT. ERNIE’S LOUNGE - NIGHT - JULY 1946

           Quint’s frantic eyes re-settle on Laura. She can tell he’s on 
           edge, that he’s not present. She’s gentle, compassionate. 

                                 LAURA
                        Just look at me, okay? You’re 
                        alright. You’re safe.

           He holds her gaze and they slowly dance, and it helps. 

           For a few moments the music takes them. It’s just him and 
           her, and everything else starts to fade into the background. 

           For a few moments, he’s at peace with her.

           But then A HAND slaps his back, startling him -- 

                                 BRIAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, you two! We were just --

           He’s cut off as Quint instinctively, and violently, lashes 
           out in defense -- GUT-PUNCHING BRIAN. 

           Brian falls, winded, to gasps of shock from the crowd --

                                 LAURA
                        What are you doing?!

           Quint blinks back to the present, seeing what he’s done.

                                 QUINT
                        He-- He grabbed me.
                                 LAURA
                        He touched you! 

                                 BRIAN
                        What the fuck is wrong with your 
                        friend, Laura?

                                 LAURA
                        Brian, I’m sorry, he’s just drunk!

           She helps Brian up, comforting him.

                                 QUINT
                             (confused, anxious)
                        I didn’t... I thought you were... 

                                 BRIAN
                        Thought I was what, dammit? A fucking 
                        Nazi? Get a hold of yourself, man, 
                        the war’s over!

           Quint turns, feeling the crowd pressing in around him:

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - NIGHT - AUGUST 1946

           Quint turns circles in the cabin, vision blurring and shadows 
           shifting from the swinging light bulb and his delirium. It’s 
           claustrophobic in here with the windows covered.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint stumbles out into the dark and manages to collapse into 
           his rocking chair. He gulps in the cool night air.

           He looks up at a clear night sky full of cold stars.

           But then he starts to hear them again: the lost cries and 
           voices of the MEN OUT IN THE WATER just beyond the boat. 

           He curls into the chair, a wretch, not daring to look. 

                                 QUINT
                        Leave me alone. Please go away. 

           For a few moments he is QUIET. Then A VOICE comes from 
           nearby... It’s his voice, but with a true salty dog edge:

                                 “QUINT” (O.S.)
                        They want vengeance, boy. 

                                 QUINT
                        No... I can’t. I can’t do it.
                                 “QUINT”
                        Can’t, can’t. Okay, that’s fine. Then 
                        you cry away like a little baby, when 
                        there’s work to be done, or you mope 
                        back to shore and cuddle your nice 
                        birdie, when there’s work to be done. 

           A MAN’S SHADOW falls over Quint in the chair, leaning closer.

                                 “QUINT”
                        You know why they’re out there. You 
                        know why they’re hollerin’ and dying 
                        in your head still. You had the right 
                        idea.

                                 QUINT
                        The rod’s broken. It’s all broken.

                                 “QUINT”
                        You been through worse than a broken 
                        rod. You been through hell. You got 
                        this boat, fine boat, with everything 
                        you need. Good name for her too. You 
                        know them fish ain’t the top o’ the 
                        food chain. You know what is. You 
                        know what’s king out here.

                                 QUINT
                        Leave me alone. Get out of my head.

                                 “QUINT”
                        Get out of my head! I don’t need you. 
                        Thought you could run away from what 
                        you are and play sailor or country 
                        club boy. Look what that got you. A 
                        mess. You want me to do it? You want 
                        me to do your work, is that it? 

                                 QUINT
                        Stop talking...

           ANGLE ON: QUINT curled in the rocking chair, when suddenly 
           HANDS grab him by the shirt, YANKING HIM UP.

           He’s dragged, resisting, across the deck and into --

           INT. CABIN - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           Strong arms hurl Quint against the sink and fasten round his 
           neck from behind. A hand grabs a plastic bottle of water and 
           pours it over his head and face, then hold it to his lips.

                                 “QUINT”
                        Drink! Drink it, you need it!
           Quint sputters and gasps, held fast, and drinks the water. 

           When he finishes it, he’s thrown hard across the cabin. He 
           SLAMS into the bench where he crumples down, stunning him: 

           PAN AROUND TO SEE: Quint, his face hard and mean, snatches a 
           KITCHEN KNIFE and roars back to yank Quint up from the floor.

           SEE: two sets of arms and bodies, but never two faces in the 
           same frame at the same time.

           They crash into the booth, opposite each other, and “Quint” 
           holds the knife down against the weakened Quint’s wrist.

                                 QUINT
                             (terrified)
                        Don’t! Let me go! 

                                 “QUINT”
                        Why? So you can wallow and bitch like 
                        a crazed gull for the rest of your 
                        life, huh? Caw-caw-caw! Or are you 
                        going to do something? Come on, do it 
                        then. Cut yourself open and it’s all 
                        over. That’s fine. Do it!

                                 QUINT
                        NO!

           ANGLE ON: QUINT, eyes suddenly fierce and defiant.

                                 “QUINT”
                        Why not? You’re thinking about the 
                        girl still. You want her, huh? No no, 
                        you listen. Remember that Shakespeare 
                        book he gave us? I remember. Romeo 
                        and Juliet. Everyone knows the story. 
                        Everyone thinks it’s a love story, 
                        but I don’t think so. Not really. 
                        Romeo and his little birdie, they 
                        known each other what, five minutes? 
                        No, that’s not love. You know what 
                        it’s about? It’s about war. 

           REVERSE TO: QUINT, quivering, captivated.

                                 “QUINT” (CONT’D)
                        Two peoples, fightin’ each other over 
                        nothing. That’s what war is, that’s 
                        what you got us involved in. Juliet 
                        and him, all they did is find someone 
                        to take their minds off the madness. 
                        That’s their ‘love’ -- an escape. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 “QUINT” (CONT’D)
                        But then you know how it goes, one 
                        thing leads to another, and Romeo’s 
                        friend Mercutio is slain by Tybalt. 
                        Romeo, now that’s his best friend 
                        dying before him, his brother. He 
                        loved him for sure. And so... What 
                        can he do? He can wallow and cry back 
                        to his split tail for her comfort, or 
                        he can straighten things out. You 
                        remember what he chooses. You know 
                        what he says to Tybalt.
                             (beat, gesturing above)
                        “Mercutio’s soul is but a little way 
                        above our heads, staying for thine to 
                        keep him company. Either thou, or I, 
                        or both must go with him.” 

           “Quint” presses the blade until it starts to draw blood.

                                 “QUINT”
                        You’re in the same boat now. No shame 
                        either way, but your brother’s still 
                        there above your head, in your head 
                        every day, right? Either thou, or I, 
                        or both must go with him. 

                                 QUINT
                        I don’t know how to --

                                 “QUINT”
                        Just say it!

                                 QUINT
                        Either thou, or I, or both must go 
                        with them.

                                 “QUINT”
                        Not to me, you know who to say it to. 
                        Them that took ‘em, out there.

                                 QUINT
                        Either thou, or I, or both must go 
                        with them!

                                 “QUINT”
                        That’s the spirit. Again.

                                 QUINT
                        Either thou, or I, or both must go 
                        with them!

                                 “QUINT”
                        Yes! You hear that, you grey-finned 
                        porkers?!
                                 QUINT
                        EITHER THOU, OR I, OR BOTH MUST GO 
                        WITH THEM!

                                 “QUINT”
                        I can still catch this fish! 

           “Quint” SLAMS the knife point-down into the table as he gets 
           up and starts tearing the makeshift curtains off the windows.

                                 “QUINT”
                        Either thou, or I, or all must go 
                        with them! Hahaha! All of them! One 
                        by one. That’s it!

           ANGLE ON: QUINT at the table, hearing the other crashing 
           around the cabin, but his own gaze is fixed on the KITCHEN 
           KNIFE in front of him, as if forming an idea... 

                                 QUINT (V.O.)
                        I’m alive. Alive and I got a debt to 
                        pay. Been afraid too long. Either 
                        thou, or I, or all must go with them.

           A crazed half-smile of realization appears on his feverish 
           face and suddenly there is SILENCE... 

           WIDE: ONLY ONE QUINT is sitting alone in the cabin, now open 
           to the moonlight streaming through the windows. 

           He grabs the knife, ripping it from the table as he gets up.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - Hands grab a hammer, chisel, and a C-clamp from a toolbox.

           - The KITCHEN KNIFE is C-clamped onto a work surface on the 
           Orca’s deck, blade up... CLANG! Quint starts hammering the 
           chisel into the big knife blade --

           - Quint leans in, hammering precisely, metal on metal..

           - Quint forces himself to CHUG WATER.

           - Quint cobbles together A MEAL from supplies, eating it.

           - A MOP is grabbed from a storage closet in the cabin. 

           - Quint saws the mop’s head off of the handle.

           - Quint whittles with a utility knife on the wooden shaft.

           - A new reel of HEAVY-GAUGE FISHING LINE is grabbed.
           - Bench seats are lifted up to reveal a storage locker. A 
           self-inflating LIFE RAFT is pulled out from inside, encased 
           in its plastic barrel container.

           - CLOSE ON: Quint threads a line leader through a hole 
           punched in the stainless steel.

           EXT. FORWARD DECK - ORCA - DAWN - AUGUST 1946

           Quint is hunched over, working on the front deck. Satisfied, 
           he finishes and stands, silhouetted in the pre-dawn light. 

           In his hand is a MAKESHIFT HARPOON...

           The kitchen knife has been cut and bent into a SINGLE-FLUE 
           BARBED HARPOON SHAPE. It’s attached onto the end of the 
           wooden mop handle, and the fishing line is laced through it.

           Quint tests its heft. It feels good. It feels fierce. 

           There’s a stillness in him now as he turns and looks at the 
           sun just rising at the horizon, off the bow of the Orca. 

           EXT. FLOATER NETS - OCEAN - DAY - DAY FOUR 1945

           Hot sun glares off the flat sea, burning retinas. Quint, 
           Barnes, Hart and Roberts cling to nets -- the overall group 
           is now a third of its original size, mostly due to sharks. 

           Salt water sores cover their burned skin. The lack of food or 
           drink for almost four days ravages bodies and minds. 

           Quint stares down into the water, watching tropical fish and 
           sharks swirl below their feet. Hart floats beside him.

                                 HART
                        Quint... 

                                 QUINT
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 HART
                        He was gonna kill me. He wasn’t 
                        himself... None of us are. You saved 
                        me and I just want to say thank you.

           But Quint says nothing. Numbed by the barrage of horrors... 

                                 LT BARNES (O.S.)
                        Hey... Hey! Where are you boys going?

                                 HALLUCINATING SAILOR (O.S.)
                        The hotel, over there. Gonna get 
                        water, then catch the bus home.
           Quint and Hart both turn to see THREE BEDRAGGLED SAILORS 
           swimming away into the open ocean, to Lt Barnes’ dismay.

                                 LT BARNES
                        No! It’s not real, dammit!

           Lt Barnes starts to swim after them but Roberts grabs him.

                                 ROBERTS
                        You go after them, use up what little 
                        you got left, you’ll drown too. Men 
                        been going like that all morning. 

           Upset, Barnes watches them get further away. One is suddenly 
           taken by a shark. Another falters and drowns from exhaustion.

           ON QUINT: he stares into the water again, his mind numb and 
           miserable. Then something catches his eye off camera...

           MOVE AROUND QUINT, TO REVEAL:

           The lobster boat, ORCA, cruising slowly between the floating 
           men, forty feet away, and there on the deck is QUINT as he is 
           a year from now, bearded and grim, harpoon in hand...

           The two Quints lock eyes with each other. 

           For a long eerie moment it’s not even clear which Quint is 
           real and which is a hallucination...

                                 HART (O.S.)
                        You guys hear that...? Hey, Quint!

           Quint is grabbed by Hart, causing him to duck briefly 
           underwater. Coming up again, Quint searches but the vision of 
           the Orca is gone... And Hart is pointing up at the sky.

                                 HART
                        A plane. You see that? It’s coming 
                        this way, it’s low!

                                 QUINT
                             (not even looking)
                        It’s not real. We’re all seeing 
                        things. We’re losing our minds.

                                 HART
                        No... I see something. Look!

           And then, one by one, they start to hear the distant drone of 
           a plane’s engines, growing rapidly louder. 
                                 LT BARNES
                             (turning to look)
                        Oh my god... 

                                 DOC SMITH
                        I see it... I see it!

           Quint’s brow furrows, and he slowly turns to look himself as:

           A LOCKHEED VENTURA PV-1 zooms low over the ocean toward them 
           and men start HOLLERING AND WAVING like crazy and then...

           It WAGS ITS WINGS to signal to them: “I see you.”

           The men burst into ecstatic yelling and splashing. Hart is 
           laughing and crying, he turns to Quint.

           But Quint is quiet now, too exhausted and broken to 
           celebrate. He watches the plane roar onward.

           In the distance, the plane circles and drops emergency 
           supplies: a few small life rafts and ration packs. 

                                 HART
                        No! What are they doing?! Why are 
                        they dropping supplies way out there?

           Without thinking, some men start breaking from the group, 
           swimming out across open water toward the far-off supplies. 

                                 LT BARNES
                        There must be another group. There 
                        must be more survivors over there.

           The plane circles back past them but it drops nothing more. 

                                 HART
                        But what about us?

                                 LT BARNES
                        They’ve spotted us now. They’ll be 
                        coming. Ships will come.

           But they can’t hide their growing anxiety as they realize 
           they’re still stuck, STILL WAITING, just as one of the 
           swimmers is hit by a shark with a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM...

           INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT - JULY 1946

           QUINT STARTS AWAKE, crying out in a cold sweat, in his small 
           studio guest house behind the Foster residence. 

           A SOFT KNOCK at the door, then it opens and Laura slips 
           inside, wearing a robe. She closes the door quietly.
                                 QUINT
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LAURA
                        You were shouting in your sleep. I 
                        heard you from the house. 

           Beat. She walks across the darkened room and sits on the bed. 
           Quint seems nervous to have her here.

                                 QUINT
                        If your parents find out you were in 
                        here with me --

                                 LAURA
                        Tell me about the nightmares. Tell me 
                        what happened.

           Beat. He just can’t.

           She reaches out and takes his hand. 

                                 LAURA
                        I see what it does to you. You think 
                        I won’t understand. Maybe you’re 
                        right. What do I know? What can I 
                        possibly say that could help? But 
                        maybe it’s not what I can say but 
                        what you have to say. One day, I 
                        think you’ll tell somebody what 
                        happened. Then maybe you’ll finally 
                        be free of it. 
                             (beat)
                        Will you let me just be with you?

           Quint matches her gaze in the darkness. She leans in and 
           kisses him, soft and tender. 

           He kisses her back. She draws close as it becomes heated.

           Still kissing him, she undoes her robe, slipping out of it to 
           just her silk night gown.

           He pulls her further into his bare torso, kissing her.

           Straddling him now, she breaks off, holding his face. She 
           reaches down and draws the night gown up over her head. 

           Naked, she kisses him again and he wraps her in his embrace.

           They continue. She’s growing more passionate, shifting 
           position until -- 

           Eventually, she senses something is wrong... 
           He looks away, ashamed. Softly, she lies down beside him.

           ON LAURA: self-conscious. Thinking maybe she can’t help him.

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - MORNING - AUGUST 1946

           Quint is standing up on the gunwale in his undershorts. 

           Determined now, he jumps and plunges down into the water.

           EXT. UNDER THE STERN - CONTINUOUS

           Quint swims to the propeller shaft and uses his buck knife to 
           cut tangled pieces of wire until he can pull them free. 

           He works quickly and effectively, but there’s a lot to do.

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint comes up for air but he doesn’t waste time, doesn’t 
           allow the fear to affect him, before he dives under again.

           EXT. UNDER THE STERN - MORNING

           Quint saws tangled lines when the KNIFE SLIPS and nicks his 
           other hand. A little blood seeps out... He looks at it, 
           uneasy, but goes back to work, pulling the last tangle free.

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint surfaces. He glances at his cut hand for a moment. Then 
           he turns to find himself --

           EXT. OCEAN - DUSK - DAY FOUR 1945

           -- IN THE PAST, where Roberts is floating nearby, now barely 
           conscious. Quint swims to him.

                                 QUINT
                        Come on, Roberts. Stay awake.
                             (seeing Lt Barnes)
                        Lieutenant! Hey, I need help!

           But Lt Barnes is also too weak and sick. Parks and Hart 
           watch, floating nearby.

                                 PARKS
                        They’re not going to last. We need 
                        the boats to get here.

           Quint looks up helplessly at TWO PLANES circling above, now 
           seeming more like buzzards then angels. THEIR ENGINES BECOME--
           EXT. FLYING BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           --THE ORCA’S ENGINE GRUMBLING to life, sounding smooth again. 
           At the helm, still dripping wet, Quint almost smiles.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY

           Quint opens the chum bucket but finds only a little left. He 
           pours it overboard, watching the last drops with grim malice.

           He hurls the bucket away, thinking. Then he looks down, at 
           the LITTLE CUT on his hand...

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - DAY

           Quint sets his harpoon upright in the corner, then climbs up 
           and throws a leg over the stern gunwale to sit straddling it.

           Beat. He flicks open his pocket buck knife and looks at it. 
           He glances out at the empty sea around him.

                                 QUINT
                        It’s you or me. I’m here.

           Quint suddenly CUTS A LONG GASH DOWN HIS OUTSIDE LEG, just 
           below the knee. It immediately starts bleeding profusely...

           He winces as he maneuvers so that the blood runs down off his 
           foot, dripping into the ocean below. 

           SQUAWK! He looks up to see the WHITE GULL has returned. 
           Quint’s steely eyes are inscrutable as he watches it. 

           He starts HUMMING an old sailor ballad. He leans across to 
           reach his TACKLE BOX nearby, and drags it toward him...

           ANGLE ON: BLOOD drips from his wound and blooms in the water 
           as the gull starts eerily SQUAWKING OVERHEAD.

           INT. LOCAL JAIL - NIGHT - JULY 1946

           Quint sits in a small jail cell, bruised and disheveled from 
           fighting.

           MR. FOSTER and a local SHERIFF arrive outside the cell. The 
           Sheriff unlocks the door as Mr. Foster looks at Quint.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Get up. Let’s go.

           INT. ALL NIGHT DINER - NIGHT - LATER

           Quint is sitting in a booth opposite Mr. Foster. A WAITRESS 
           (50s) sets down an order on their table.
                                 WAITRESS
                        Two coffees, and a fruit salad. 

           As she leaves, Mr. Foster pushes the fruit toward Quint.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        You should eat. I’m sure you have a 
                        headache, it’ll do you good.

                                 QUINT
                        I’m not hungry.

           Mr. Foster shrugs. He sips his coffee.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Are you in love with my daughter?

           Long beat. Quint is taken aback. He thinks, nervous.

                                 QUINT
                        She’s the best girl I ever met.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Yet here you are, abusing her 
                        family’s hospitality. A drunken 
                        disgrace every night. Getting in 
                        fights. Getting fired from a job I 
                        got you. Getting arrested.
                             (beat)
                        I know what happened to you. I did 
                        some digging, I know about the 
                        Indianapolis. It’s a terrible thing 
                        and I’m truly sorry for it.
                             (beat)
                        I also found out that you’re 
                        currently absent without leave, with 
                        a year still left on your Navy 
                        contract. That’s a serious crime. 

           Quint shifts in his chair, uncomfortable.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Don’t worry, they won’t find you 
                        because of the arrest. 

           Quint looks at him, helpless. The waitress returns, filling a 
           silence as she refills Mr. Foster’s coffee, then she leaves.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        The Navy’s busy enough after the war. 
                        Maybe they’d find you, maybe not. But 
                        I can get you a general discharge, 
                        get you out of your contract a year 
                        early, no questions asked.
                                 QUINT
                        How?

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        You know I have influential friends. 

                                 QUINT
                        You’d do that for me?

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        I know you disdain my wealth and 
                        status but I’m not here to stand in 
                        the way of my daughter’s love. That 
                        said, right now you’re not suitable 
                        for her. You don’t have a job, you 
                        have no prospects. You’re a drunk. 
                        But I realize you’re struggling, as 
                        does she. She wants to help you. 

                                 QUINT
                        It’s not her problem, it’s mine.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        You made it her problem when you 
                        agreed to come here with her.

           Quint doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        You know, I fought a war once. I also 
                        saw things no man should ever see. 
                        Though I made it to the end alive, 
                        for a long time my mind was still 
                        there. Still fighting. The army flew 
                        me back on an airplane, but do you 
                        know what actually brought me home? 
                        The love I accepted from my wife.
                             (beat)
                        You need to find your way home, or 
                        you need to end it with her.

           Mr. Foster gets up and drops a few bills on the table.

                                 MR. FOSTER
                        Think it over. And eat the fruit 
                        salad, you’ll feel better.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Quint is sitting on stern, leg bleeding. He’s pallid, picking 
           at a loaf of bread, breaking off pieces and eating them.

           He scans the clear, calm sea: nothing. 
           He hears a flutter nearby and sees the WHITE GULL has landed 
           on the side of the boat nearby. They both eye each other. 

                                 QUINT
                        You think this is a mistake. Think I 
                        should be spilling my guts out to the 
                        girl, crying about it to everyone 
                        instead of working with the sea. They 
                        all think that’ll help this.

           Quint’s demeanor and voice is rougher. The Navy boy is gone.

           He tears off a piece of bread. He throws it at the seagull 
           who snatches it and eats it quick. It looks for more. 

           He looks at his leg. The wound is coagulating, bleeding less.

                                 QUINT
                        You think I’m crazy, just like they 
                        all do. Just like she does. You 
                        two’re birds of a feather, flapping 
                        over my head, making a damn fuss.

           He throws another piece of bread to the gull, which eats it 
           up. He keeps tearing bits off and throwing them to the gull:

                                 QUINT
                        All them millions dead. The world 
                        deserved what it got in this war. All 
                        of us did. We were all part of it. On 
                        and on and on. We never change, we 
                        just get better at doing what we do. 

           Beat. The gull hops closer along the gunwale, chasing pieces 
           of bread as he throws them.

                                 QUINT
                        Maybe I went crazy too. But this here 
                        isn’t part of it. No, I’ll tell you 
                        what was crazy. Running away from 
                        yourself, joining the damn United 
                        States Navy who don’t give a shit 
                        about you. 
                             (beat)
                        Changing the way you talk, trying to 
                        be somebody you’re not, trying to 
                        impress fancy girls in big cities 
                        when really you got nothing to offer 
                        but the salt in your veins. What I 
                        was doing, that was crazy. 

           He throws crumbs. The seagull snatches them. It squawks.
                                 QUINT
                        But this, this is me coming back. 
                        Coming home. From now on, no more 
                        bullshit. From now on I’m just me by 
                        myself, just Quint, and I do what has 
                        to be done. 

           ANGLE ON: ONE HAND reaches down beside him to a length of 
           fishing line attached to A HOOK, BAITED WITH BREAD... 

                                 QUINT
                        Because this here’s my vessel, you 
                        understand? I’m the Captain here. And 
                        I don’t want no new mates.

           With that, he hurls another piece of bread to the waiting 
           gull, that hungrily snatches it out of the air only to find --

           --it has eaten a FISHING HOOK too.

           Quint yanks on the attached line with his hands and the hook 
           pulls the gull down into the boat by its beak. 

           It SHRIEKS LOUDLY and FLAPS FRANTICALLY UPWARD but -- Quint 
           is on his feet now and yanking the line violently inward --

           The gull falls again, panicking, tangling, squawking until --

           Quint grabs it, pinning it down beneath him on the deck.

           CLOSE ON: QUINT -- eyes cold and merciless as we hear a 
           SUDDEN SNAP and the white gull falls silent in his arms.

           NEW ANGLE: Quint rises, gull in hand, and grabs his KNIFE as 
           he returns to his same spot and sits over the edge again.

           He scans the water again, but sees nothing. 

                                 QUINT
                        I’m not done. Either thou, or I, or 
                        both must go with them.

           NEW ANGLE: FRESH BLOOD runs into the water, mingling with 
           that from his own leg, as he takes his knife to the gull...

           ANGLE: THE BLEEDING CARCASS drops into the water, attached to 
           the line, which he ties off on a cleat... BAIT.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY - JULY 1946

           Quint sits on a towel, Laura in a swimsuit in front of him.
                                 LAURA
                        Don’t get me wrong, I love it here in 
                        summer. But it feels so small now. So 
                        quiet. Most of the people have 
                        already left. It’ll be good to get 
                        back to a busy campus.

           REVEAL: He’s concealing a small OPEN BOX in his hand, and 
           inside it is A RING. The same ring that Brubaker gave him. 

           He seems to be building the courage to present it to her.

                                 LAURA
                        I thought maybe you might come with 
                        me. Back west. You could find a job 
                        and we could visit the city, like 
                        when we met. 

                                 QUINT
                        Sure. That sounds really nice. 

                                 LAURA
                             (feeling foolish)
                        It’s just an idea.

                                 QUINT
                        Laura, I been thinking and there’s 
                        something I wanted to ask you...

           But just then, something in the ocean behind her catches his 
           attention... Was there something there, in the water? 

           He stares, strangely transfixed by the breaking waves. 

           She turns to look, expecting to see something. She smiles, 
           getting the wrong idea.

                                 LAURA 
                        What is it? You want to go in?

                                 QUINT
                        What?

                                 LAURA
                        Alright, let’s swim! Come on!

                                 QUINT
                        No, no, no --

           Laura pulls him up and forward, and he starts to panic.

                                 LAURA
                        It’ll be fun. I won’t take no for an 
                        answer. The water’ll do us some good--
                                 QUINT
                             (wrenching away)
                        NO, dammit!

           She stares at him, shocked and hurt. Then she glances at the 
           ocean, recognizing that his outburst came from fear.

                                 LAURA
                        I’m sorry...

           Quint can’t meet her gaze. Quivering, angry at himself.

                                 LAURA
                        We don’t have to-- We can go home.

           But Quint steps past her, moving toward the water. She stays 
           put, watching him go.

           He stops at the water’s edge. Surf washes up over his feet. 
           Feeling the sea again, something stirs deep within. He kneels 
           down in it, still holding the ring box in his hand. 

           He gazes out at the horizon. 

                                 QUINT
                             (whispered)
                        I can’t. This is my home.

           He snaps the ring box closed as he stands. Then he pockets it 
           and walks back up the beach, leaving Laura bewildered.

                                 LAURA
                        Quint, where are you going? 

           EXT. MARINA - DAY - LATER

           Quint walks quickly through the marina, scanning the docks. 
           Sail boats, fishing boats: none are what he’s looking for.

           Frustrated, he finally finds himself standing by the same 
           bench where the mysterious fisherman talked to him one night.

           He sits down in the fisherman’s spot, dejected.

           He looks out at the marina, but then he spots something... 

           He gets up again. He heads down a long dock toward it, 
           passing boats on the way.

           He arrives at the boat called ORCA. On its side a sign is 
           hung: “FOR SALE - INQUIRE AT HARBOR MASTER”

           Quint stares. He walks around it. He runs his hands along its 
           side, peering in the windows. This is it.
           INT. HARBOR MASTER OFFICE - DAY

           Quint enters a small office near the harbor. He finds the 
           HARBOR MASTER (60) who looks up from his paper.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        Help you?

                                 QUINT
                        That boat out there, the Orca.

           The harbor master eyes him over his spectacles.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        You interested in buying?

                                 QUINT
                        That’s why I’m asking.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        You got the money to buy a boat?

           Quint hesitates. He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out 
           the small box. He opens it to reveal Brubaker’s ring.

           He stares at it for a long moment, weighing the decision.

                                 HARBOR MASTER
                        You going to propose to me, boy? That 
                        boat requires money. 

           Quint looks up at the harbor master.

                                 QUINT
                        Is there a pawn shop on the island?

           PRELAP: hear the increasing whine of an ENGINE APPROACHING--

           EXT. OCEAN - DUSK - DAY FOUR 1945

           Quint is holding onto Roberts, Hart holding Lt Barnes, with 
           Parks nearby in the water. They all look up, watching as: 

           A PBY-5A CATALINA, built for landing on flat water, breaks 
           formation with another plane and descends toward them.

                                 PARKS
                        He’s gonna land... Crazy sonofabitch 
                        is going to land it in these waves!

           It roars down over their heads, landing somewhere just out of 
           sight. Quint and Hart and Parks exchange looks.
                                 HART
                        That’s a chance. We have to get to 
                        that plane. If we don’t these two 
                        might not make it.

           Quint nods, just as yet another wave splashes up against him.

           EXT. OFF THE STERN - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Quint surfaces outside the Orca, coughing. He looks at his 
           boat, realizing he must’ve fallen off it in his sleep. 

           He shakes his head. But the water actually feels good again. 
           He kicks onto his back and just floats there.

           ANGLE ON: QUINT - calm for a moment, gazing up at the sky... 

           But then a twinge of disquiet makes him come upright. 

           He looks at the boat again... At the length of FISHING LINE 
           dangling from a cleat... 

           THE SEAGULL CARCASS IS GONE...

           ANGLE ON: QUINT -- as a LARGE DORSAL FIN glides slowly past 
           in the background, unseen by him. 

           Fear grips him. He scans around but sees nothing. He turns 
           and swims back to the step ladder, breath quickening. 

           He grabs hold of the ladder and starts climbing up when:

           WHAM! THE WHITE SHARK breaches the surface, reaching for him.

           Quint kicks upward as it CLAMPS DOWN onto the bottom step of 
           the ladder instead, but then his bare feet land on top of its 
           slippery head -- he SHOUTS in terror -- struggling to pull 
           himself away until the shark twists away with its bulk --

           -- its tail SMACKS HIM SIDEWAYS and he falls into the water.

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Quint is briefly stunned by the blow, sinking downward. 

           He opens his eyes, coming back to his senses even as he sees 
           the terrifying form of the shark coming around again. 

           EXT. OFF THE STERN - ORCA - DAY

           Quint bursts upward, reaching frantically for the ladder -- 

           -- but the mangled bottom rung BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND and he 
           drops underwater again.
           He lets it go and then he’s up and reaching for the higher 
           rungs, and he’s got it, and he’s climbing up when he sees -- 

           THE HARPOON is sitting there.

           A moment of decision, then he snatches it up with dark 
           determination, turning, still on the ladder outside the boat.

           He glances down: the tail’s rough skin cut through his shirt, 
           leaving harsh grazes, seeping blood. 

           Gripping the ladder with one hand, harpoon in the other, he 
           sinks his body down LOWER into the water...

           He sees the shark coming, dorsal fin cutting the surface. 

                                 QUINT
                        Either thou, or I. Come on!

           The shark submerges. Quint rises up out of the water, up one 
           ladder rung, to try and keep track of it. 

           THERE -- it’s still coming, and coming fast, like a terrible 
           wraith in the grey-green water, speeding straight for him. 

           He raises the harpoon. He YELLS out a battle cry.

           JAWS breach the surface, gaping toward him, but he is ready.

           Quint springs up the ladder and STRIKES DOWN HARD with 
           harpoon, spearing its back beside the dorsal fin.

           The shark WRENCHES AWAY, SPRAYING WATER UP -- Quint narrowly 
           misses being hit by the tail again, but the harpoon’s broom 
           handle is SNAPPED like a toothpick --

           But as the shark dives -- fishing line flies out past Quint, 
           attached to the harpoon tip, which held fast deep in the 
           shark’s flesh.

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           Quint rolls over the gunwale into the boat, as fishing line 
           reels out FAST -- 

           -- the other end is attached to the LIFE RAFT CANISTER. He 
           grabs it, pulls its ripcord and hurls it overboard.

           Panting for breath, Quint watches anxiously as the life raft 
           hits the surfaces and SELF-INFLATES in a matter of seconds. 

           It’s a SMALL, TWO-MAN RAFT made of tough rubber. 
           Almost immediately, the raft is then YANKED FROM BELOW, and 
           towed across the surface by the shark as it tries to dive. 

           While undoubtedly big, this is no super shark, and it won’t 
           be strong enough to pull the raft under completely.

           A grin cracks across Quint’s face.

                                 QUINT
                        Haha! You sonofabitch!

           The raft skims away across the surface as the shark runs. 
           Quint turns and leaps onto the ladder to the bridge.

           EXT. FLYING BRIDGE - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           Quint attacks the controls, firing up the engine. He glances 
           behind him to see the life raft towed away over the water.

                                 QUINT
                        You’re not getting away. Not now!

           He cranks the throttle and spins the wheel around.

           EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY

           HIGH ANGLE: The life raft skips and tumbles, dragged quickly 
           by the shark below, while the Orca chases after it.

           EXT. BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY

           ON QUINT: driving his boat in pursuit, eyes blazing. 

           EXT. SWIMMING AWAY FROM THE GROUP - NIGHT - DAY FOUR 1945

           Quint, Hart and Parks are swimming, dragging Roberts and Lt 
           Barnes with them, desperate as the sky gets darker.

           Behind, remnants of their large group are just visible 
           between the rolling waves. Ahead, LIGHTS shine outward from 
           the floating PBY, searching for stray survivors to pick up.

           Quint’s breath is ragged and uneven. He freezes in terror as 
           a dorsal fin swoops past. Hart sees the growing fear in him.

                                 HART
                        Hey, Quint. We get out of this, I 
                        want to learn fishing. I want you to 
                        teach me. Will you teach me?

                                 PARKS
                        When I get out of this, I’m never 
                        going near the ocean again. Why the 
                        hell you want to learn to fish? 
                                 HART
                             (long beat)
                        Sharks. I want to learn to fish so I 
                        can catch one of these sharks and 
                        fucking kill it. 

           They all take in the cold desire for revenge. Quint glances 
           at Hart, whose face is dead serious. He’s no greenie anymore.

                                 QUINT
                        Okay. 

           EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           THE LIFE RAFT is pulled away from the Orca until...

           Finally it slows to a stop. It settles upside down, but the 
           line still jerks it slightly from somewhere below.

           Quint pilots the Orca, slowing to a stop alongside it. Sharp 
           and tense now, he eyes the raft, anticipating further moves.

           EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT - DAY FOUR 1945

           Quint checks on Roberts in his arms as he carries him. His 
           eyes are closed, his breath thin and raspy.

           The PBY taxis vaguely toward Quint’s group in the gloom. 

                                 PARKS
                        Hey! Over here!

                                 HART
                        We can make it. Keep kicking.

           But they barely have any energy left. Every few seconds, one 
           of them slips under and struggles back up, gasping for air. 

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           Quint climbs down from the bridge, watching the raft that 
           sits just off his stern...

           WHAM! Suddenly the shark bursts up from below and attacks the 
           raft -- teeth piercing its rubber hide. The shark vanishes 
           again as air starts hissing out of the it.

           Frantic, Quint rushes to grab a LONG BOAT HOOK POLE. 

           He runs back with it and hurls it out to try and catch the 
           fishing line between the raft and the shark. 

           He misses. He tries again, but it’s JUST OUT OF REACH.
           The raft SQUEALS and GRADUALLY COLLAPSES as it is tugged from 
           below -- one side sinking beneath the water. If he loses it, 
           he loses the shark too.

                                 QUINT
                        No no! Please!

           Quint tries going for the raft itself with the boat hook. But 
           the deflating raft is PULLED AWAY from him by the shark.

                                 QUINT
                        No!

           The deflated raft is just limp rubber and canvas now, DRAGGED 
           DOWNWARD away from the boat...

           Desperate, QUINT JUMPS OVERBOARD after it, boat hook in hand. 

           EXT. OFF THE STERN - CONTINUOUS

           He plunges underwater, swimming and reaching like a madman -- 
           and just manages to hook one of its sturdy handholds!

           Quint kicks back up, gasping, eyes searching for the shark, 
           towing the boat hook and raft behind him as he swims -- 

           UNDERWATER POV: COMING UP FROM BELOW, see legs flailing... 

           EXT. STERN - ORCA - CONTINUOUS

           Quint claws his way up the boat ladder, pole in hand when --

           The shark speeds past below, snagging the line so the boat 
           hook is yanked with it -- SMACKING HIM in the head, knocking 
           him down across the gunwale. 

           Quint strains and pulls the boat hook inward until he can 
           grab the LIFE RAFT’S HANDLE --

           -- which he wrenches down and hooks it over a horn cleat. 

           Immediately, the fishing line PULLS TAUGHT and Quint sees the 
           shark BREACH THE SURFACE at the end of the line, FIGHTING. 

           Quint spins around, thinking fast, and spots a RIGGING WINCH 
           on a wall near the bridge, used for raising lobster cages...

           EXT. REAR DECK - ORCA - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint comes from the cabin, fitting work gloves on his hands. 

           He grabs the fishing line, feeling the tension of the shark 
           in the line. 
           As the shark turns toward the boat, Quint gets some slack, 
           which he pulls back across the deck toward the winch --

           A SUDDEN TUG on the line makes him slip and fall, but he 
           recovers and loops the line around the winch spool. He starts 
           CRANKING THE HANDLE, which now acts to reel in the line.

                                 QUINT
                             (under his breath)
                        Come on. Come on in now.

           Quint cranks the line. The shark fights away -- 

           He lets it spin out a bit -- then catches the handle again 
           and cranks it in, careful to not dislodge the harpoon. 

           Then the shark is visible, swimming at the surface, getting 
           closer. It’s tiring, from blood loss and dragging the raft.

           Quint is also battered, bleeding from his leg, side and 
           forehead. A flicker of uncertainty in his eyes.

                                 QUINT
                             (to himself)
                        Now what are you gonna do, huh?

           He glances around until he spots a big GAFF HOOK on a metal 
           pole, stowed nearby. He gets an idea...

           He heaves on the winch arm then quickly slams a HOLDING BOLT 
           into it, to stop it from reeling out --

           He leaps down across the deck to grab the gaff hook. 

           The shark splashes nearby, 20’ off the stern now, fighting 
           the line, blood blooming from the harpoon in its back.

           Moving fast, Quint ties an end of COILED ROPE onto the gaff --

           Then he climbs out onto the hook ladder again, gaff in hand.

                                 QUINT
                        Come on! I’m here! You see me.

           The shark swims closer to the boat then tries to dive. Quint 
           notices the line rubbing and straining against the gunwale. 

                                 QUINT
                             (to the line)
                        Please hold. Don’t break now.
                             (to the shark)
                        Come on, you bastard!

           Then the grey blur is coming up again, right below him. 
           Quint rears back up as -- WHAM! It attacks the bottom and --

           HE SWINGS THE GAFF HOOK with all his might -- STABBING IT 
           DEEP through the muscle of the shark’s tail.

           The shark thrashes and swipes -- Quint lets go and falls onto 
           his back inside the boat as the FLYING GAFF’S ROPE WHIPS OUT.

           HE GRABS THE ROPE with both hands, which yanks him up to his 
           feet again and HE YELLS as he heaves against it.

                                 QUINT
                        Fuck you! You’re mine!

           THE SHARK, as long as the width of the boat, is now stuck 
           with two lines, flailing near it in the bloody water. 

           Rope burns through Quint’s gloved hands. He lets go to grab 
           the remaining slack so he can tie it off but then -- 

           THE SHARK catches the FISHING LINE with its teeth - it SNAPS!

           Quint looks down, realizing the unsecured gaff rope he’s 
           holding in his hands is now the only line to the shark -- 

           WHAM! He’s pulled hard against the stern -- almost yanked 
           overboard -- but still HE DOESN’T LET GO.

           Heaving inward, he just manages to hook the rope around a 
           cleat. 

           The shark tries to reach the rope with its jaws too -- but it 
           can’t twist to reach its own tail where the gaff is embedded. 

                                 QUINT
                        Stop it! Stop fighting!
                             (beat, dark)
                        This is where it ends!

           Quint quickly removes the loops of fishing line from the 
           winch spool and then rigs the gaff’s rope up to it instead. 

           Quint grabs hold of the winch handle once again and starts 
           CRANKING IT AS HARD AS HE CAN, straining with the effort...

           EXT. THE OCEAN - NIGHT - DAY FOUR 1945

           Quint and his boys struggle closer to the plane in the dark 
           until at last, its spotlight turns and finds them. 

                                 PARKS AND HART
                        Help! We’re here! Help!
           Quint can hear the GHOSTLY CRIES of the wounded who have 
           already been picked up by the plane. But he also hears the 
           PIERCING SCREAMS of fresh shark victims far behind them...

           They see the CREW at the plane’s doors, shouting instructions 
           inside, guiding the plane toward them. 

                                 RESCUER 1
                        I see you! We’re coming!

           It gets closer, feet away now. Then a RESCUER is reaching:

                                 RESCUER 2
                        Come on, give me your hand.

                                 QUINT
                        The Lieutenant, get him on.

           Hart and Parks maneuver Lt Barnes into the rescuers’ hands. 
           He is pulled inside, while the others continue to wait.

           EXT. ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           ON QUINT AT THE WINCH: the rope runs out taught behind him, 
           disappearing behind the stern. Still he cranks furiously. 

           SEE BEHIND HIM: the tip of the shark’s tail appears at the 
           stern, dragged inch by inch up out of the water...

           EXT. OCEAN OUTSIDE PBY - NIGHT - DAY FOUR 1945

           The RESCUERS come back to the door of the plane.

                                 RESCUER
                             (to Hart)
                        Your hand! Come on, let’s go!

                                 HART
                        No, Roberts next!

           They push Roberts into the waiting hands and watch him lifted 
           on board. Quint, Hart and Parks hold each other, waiting.

           But Hart notices Quint looking down into the water, scanning 
           it, and he is terrified. Did he see something?

                                 HART
                        Quint. Hey, Quint.
                             (beat, he looks at him)
                        It’s okay. We’re okay.

           EXT. ORCA - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           QUINT AT THE WINCH: sweat and blood stream down his face. 
           Behind him, the stern dips as the gaff hook and the SHARK’S 
           TAIL are pulled across the gunwale... Still it kicks and 
           thrashes, dragged backward, throwing water into the air.

           Quint closes his eyes against the effort and the past: 

           EXT. OCEAN OUTSIDE PBY - NIGHT - DAY FOUR 1945

           Quint, Hart and Parks tread water beside the door of the 
           plane as the rescuers keep working to help them.

                                 RESCUER 1
                        Alright, last three. Come on.

           Rescuer 2 lifts Parks in through the door. 

           Quint glances at Hart, who nods to him. He and Hart each grab 
           a rescuer’s hand.

                                 RESCUER 1
                        Got you! Nice and easy now.

           Rescuer 2 starts to drag Hart inside when -- he’s JERKED 
           DOWNWARD, and a SMALL GASP escapes his mouth. Quint looks 
           over, cold fear gripping him --

                                 QUINT
                        No...

           But then there’s THRASHING, and a SCREAM GURGLES from Hart’s 
           mouth, and he is TORN AND PULLED UNDER by a LARGE SHARK --

           Hands grab Quint from behind, lifting him away as he 
           struggles against them, FIGHTING to get back in the water.

                                 QUINT
                        No! Hart! Let me go, let me go! I 
                        have to bring him back! No!

           Quint is pulled inside the door of the plane, crying and 
           screaming as the rescuers easily restrain him.

                                 QUINT
                        I promised! You have to let me go! 

           CLOSE ON QUINT: his whole being is cracked open and torn up. 
           He doesn’t hear the words of the rescuers, he doesn’t notice 
           the plane crowded with gruesomely injured survivors.

           Rescued at last, Quint is left a sobbing wreck.

           EXT. ORCA - DAY, AUGUST 1946

           QUINT CRANKS THE WINCH, in tears from exertion and memories.
           Behind him, the grey hulk of the shark is dragged backwards 
           by its tail across the gunwale, flailing and squirming until-- 

           It rolls over the fulcrum of the stern and CRASHES INSIDE THE 
           REAR DECK, still very much alive and kicking.

           BAM! In one swoop, its tail connects with the empty CHUM 
           BUCKET and METAL TOOLBOX, sending them flying -- 

           THE TOOLBOX HITS QUINT in the ribs -- he stumbles and falls --

           HE LANDS BESIDE THE SHARK, a foot away. HE YELLS IN FEAR, 
           snatching his feet away as it SNAPS FOR HIM -- 

           HE KICKS at its nose but he’s caught on his back between the 
           wall and the furious shark’s huge jaws --

           Desperate, he reaches out for the ROCKING CHAIR nearby. His 
           fingertips just manage to grab hold as THE SHARK LUNGES -- 

           Quint twists and kicks off the wall, sliding across the 
           soaked floor as -- he topples the chair over into his place.

           Quint scrambles away to the cabin door as it snatches his 
           rocking chair in its jaws and instantly CRUSHES IT to pieces. 

           Out of reach now, Quint catches his breath on the floor, 
           watching as the shark continues to flail helplessly... 

           Its bulk fills the entire rear deck but here, out of its 
           element, it seems absurd and clumsy, weighing it down.

           Here, this apex predator seems as pathetically vulnerable as 
           an injured man adrift on the sea... Its awesome presence 
           inspires fear even as its impotence deserves pity. 

           As it squirms and bleeds, Quint stares into its black eyes. 
           Cold tears begin to well in his own tired, bloodshot eyes.

                                 QUINT
                        Here we are, together again. Every 
                        day I see what you did to us. 
                        Sometimes I drink and it goes away. 
                        Sometimes it doesn’t go away. 
                        Sometimes I think I’m still there, 
                        floating, waiting my turn to die. 

           Quint gets to his feet, quivering, and goes into the cabin.

           ANGLE ON: THE SHARK continues to thrash for a few moments. 

           Then Quint is back, CARRYING SOMETHING. It snaps toward him 
           but he edges around behind it where it can’t reach him.
           Quint runs a hand along its back as it bucks, almost as if to 
           reassure it. He inches forward, passing its dorsal fin. 

           Quint swings a leg across its back to straddle it, behind its 
           head. Jaws maw open, bucking, but it cannot reach him.

                                 QUINT
                        Now it’s your turn.

           REVEAL: in his hand is a HATCHET. He pauses for a moment, as 
           all the pain and fear and rage wells up inside him... 

           Then Quint raises the hatchet high, YELLS OUT LOUD and he 
           sinks it down into the top of the shark’s head. He furiously 
           lifts it and brings it down, again and again, hacking the top 
           of the shark’s skull apart. Blood spatters against him. 

           ANGLE ON: THE SHARK’S TAIL slaps frantically as Quint digs 
           deeper and deeper, down toward its brain.

           ANGLE ON: QUINT continues the gruesome, fanatical execution 
           until finally the shark goes limp beneath him.

           At last he drops the axe and steps away from the carcass, 
           covered in blood. He sits down on the floor, facing it.

           He looks up at the sky above, breath calming, listening to 
           the quiet and the gentle lapping of the water. 

           Finally it’s peaceful, and beautiful. 

           ANGLE ON: LAURA’S SCARF lying crumpled on the deck nearby. 
           Shark’s blood seeps into it, utterly ruining it...

           EXT. AMITY ISLAND HARBOR - DAY - AUGUST 1946

           A CROWD of dock workers, fishermen and passers-by gather 
           along the jetties, gasping and pointing as Quint brings the 
           Orca in, everyone in awe at the huge shark slumped inside it.

           FISHERMEN secure the boat while Quint climbs from the bridge.

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                        Unbelievable... You’re alone? Hey, 
                        you brought that monster in alone?

           Quint eyes them, clothes still bloodstained, face beat up and 
           bruising. He’s young, but he cuts an imposing figure now.

                                 QUINT
                        Nobody else on board.

           He steps onto the dock and starts away through the crowd.
                                 FISHERMAN 2
                        That’s impossible. You can’t bring in 
                        something like that on your own.

                                 FISHERMAN 3
                        I never seen one this big, not in 
                        thirty years.

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                        You’re not from the island, are you? 
                        What brings you here to Amity? 

                                 QUINT
                        Came from the Vineyard, I’m looking 
                        for a new berth maybe. 

                                 FISHERMAN 2
                        What’s your name, son?

           Quint stops for a moment, looking at their salty faces. His 
           own demeanor has changed, he’s more confident, stronger. 

           And now he has a familiar twinkle in his eye.

                                 QUINT
                        You can call me Quint. Shark ain’t 
                        going anywhere, so... Buy me a drink, 
                        I’ll tell you all about it.

           The fishermen grin, instantly taking a liking to him.

           INT. FISHERMAN BAR - NIGHT - LATER

           Quint sits at a table with the fishermen and OTHER LOCALS 
           gathered around. He holds a confident rhythm and wily charm.

                                 QUINT
                        So... the gaff held, and the winch 
                        held. Gave me just enough leverage. 
                        Inch by inch it dragged him - right 
                        out of the water. Then he’s flapping 
                        and fighting, you know like a snapper 
                        does, only he’s the size of my whole 
                        boat. Never seen a killer like that 
                        looking helpless before. Almost makes 
                        you pity him.
                             (beat, deadpan)
                        But then the bastard ate my rocking 
                        chair.

           The fishermen laugh at the absurdity of it.

                                 QUINT
                        That’s when I knew he had to die. 
           More laughing.

                                 QUINT
                        Anyway, that’s about the sum of it.

           Fisherman 1 raises a glass. The others follow suit.

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                        Helluva tale. Here’s to Quint. 

                                 QUINT
                        No, no, no! 

           He stops them before they drink. He raises his glass.

                                 QUINT
                        Not to me. Here’s to... Here’s to 
                        swimming with bow-legged women.

           They cheer that and drink. A BARMAID smiles at him from 
           across the room but it makes his own smile fade slightly.

                                 QUINT
                             (turning to Fisherman 1)
                        Hey, there a telephone in here?

                                 FISHERMAN 1
                        In the back. Through that door.

           Quint gets up, slipping away from the drinkers.

           INT. ADMIN OFFICE - BACK OF BAR - NIGHT

           Quint comes into a back office and closes the door. He picks 
           up the phone and dials a number. He listens as it connects.

                                 MR. FOSTER (PHONE)
                        Foster residence.

                                 QUINT
                        Hello, Mr. Foster. 

                                 MR. FOSTER (PHONE)
                        Quint... You’re back on shore.

                                 QUINT
                        Stopped in over at Amity Island. 

                                 MR. FOSTER (PHONE)
                        Amity? You’re moving on, then?

                                 QUINT
                        Making progress.
                                 MR. FOSTER (PHONE)
                        I spoke to my Navy contacts. They 
                        agreed to help. You can consider 
                        yourself discharged from service.

                                 QUINT
                        Thank you... Mr. Foster? How is she?

                                 MR. FOSTER (PHONE)
                             (pause)
                        You made your decision, Quint. She’s 
                        not your concern anymore.

           CLICK. The line goes dead. Quint stands there, dazed. He 
           hangs up the receiver and sits down in a chair.

           Outside the window he sees the harbor and beyond it, the sea.

           Suddenly, the phone rings. Quint looks at it, suspicious. He 
           gets up again, and lifts the receiver to his ear...

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        I know you’re there. 

           He closes his eyes to the sweet sound of her voice. 

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        I know you won’t tell me where you 
                        are. I know you won’t talk because 
                        you think you’re protecting me, or 
                        that I can’t help you. So just listen 
                        instead. This isn’t how you fix it. 
                        This isn’t how you get better. You’re 
                        making a mistake.

           Tears appear in his eyes. In the bar, the fishermen banter.

                                 LAURA (PHONE)
                        I would’ve married you. I just wanted 
                        you to know that. But I have a life 
                        of my own and I’m choosing to go live 
                        it now. 
                             (long beat)
                        Goodbye, Quint. 

           CLICK. She hangs up the phone, leaving him numb.

           INT. FISHERMAN BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Quint comes back into the bar to cheers, a few backslaps and 
           a new drink from waiting fishermen. He takes a large drink.

           A few OFF-ISLANDERS, rich summer residents, are watching. 
           They nudge one forward, MANSFIELD, who approaches Quint. 
                                 MANSFIELD
                        Mister Quint? You caught that shark 
                        out there? On that boat, the Orca?

                                 QUINT
                        That’s why we’re drinking.

                                 MANSFIELD
                        Could you find a shark like that 
                        again?

           Quint pauses, eyeing the guy. A few others take notice too.

                                 MANSFIELD
                        My friends and I are looking for a 
                        charter boat, looking for big sport. 
                        We were wondering if we could hire 
                        your services, to take us out again, 
                        perhaps find another shark like that. 
                        We have some gear, anything more the 
                        boat needs we could purchase for you. 

                                 FISHERMAN 2
                        Hah! It’s a fluke boy-- There’re no 
                        sharks like that in these waters! 

                                 QUINT
                        There’s sharks like that in all 
                        waters. 

           The sudden gravity of his pronouncement silences everyone.

                                 MANSFIELD
                        That’s what I hoped you’d say.

                                 QUINT
                        You want to pay me to take you out 
                        and kill sharks? 

           Beat. Mansfield NODS. Quint thinks long and hard as a new, 
           unexpected avenue of life seems to open up before him...

           INT. HOSPITAL BARRACKS - GUAM - DAY - JULY 1945

           QUINT sits with his back to a wall in bed, inside a hospital 
           tent full of SURVIVORS in various grim states. 

           A man arrives and drops a NEWSPAPER down on the bed.

           ANGLE ON THE NEWSPAPER: the headline reveals that this is 
           just a day after the atomic bomb has been dropped on 
           Hiroshima -- “Reports indicate the entire city is destroyed.”  

           The man sits: it’s Roberts. Quint can’t even look at him.
                                 QUINT
                        We did that. That container we 
                        carried to Tinian. We delivered the 
                        bomb. That’s why we were secret, why 
                        no one knew we were lost.

                                 ROBERTS
                        I know.

                                 QUINT
                        They say maybe a hundred and fifty 
                        thousand people died. Civilians. A 
                        hundred and fifty thousand.

           Beat. Roberts considers that, but says nothing. Quint finally 
           looks at him, profound pain in his eyes.

                                 QUINT
                        What are we supposed to do now?

           Roberts is quiet for a moment.

                                 ROBERTS
                        I’m going to ship out again.

           Quint can’t even comprehend this. Quint glances around then 
           leans closer in a hushed tone.

                                 QUINT
                        The Navy fucked us, Roberts. They 
                        weren’t even looking for us, it was a 
                        fluke that plane found us. And you’re 
                        going to go back to work for them?

                                 ROBERTS
                        Quint, I been on the water my whole 
                        life. Don’t know anything else. Don’t 
                        have anything else. My blood’s in the 
                        ocean now. Maybe yours is too.

           Quint stares at Roberts, unnerved by this.

           INT. OLD SAILOR’S SHACK - NIGHT - AUGUST 1946

           Quint wears an apron and rubber gloves, spattered with blood, 
           in a spacious WOOD SHACK full of fishing gear and junk with a 
           mezzanine layer above.

           He lifts the lid from an industrial cooking pot and uses 
           tongs to reach into the bubbling hydrogen peroxide inside. 

           He lifts out the whitened, stiffened jaws of the shark he 
           caught -- huge, man-eating jaws.
           He rinses them off in a sink and lays them out on a table. 

           He stares at his trophy with some satisfaction... But then... 
           FAINT, DISTANT SCREAMS begin to echo in his mind once more. 

           Behind him, the shark’s mutilated corpse hangs by its tail 
           from a rafter, silhouetted and hidden by shadow. 

           Quint looks at it. Then he picks up a knife and walks to it.

           EXT. OLD SAILOR’S SHACK - MORNING

           Quint stands outside the shack beside two LARGE BARRELS, 
           watching his FOUR OFF-ISLANDER CLIENTS unload their gear from 
           a nice car nearby. They approach while Quint drinks a beer.

                                 MANSFIELD
                        Well, here we are.

                                 QUINT
                        Okay. You brought some apricot 
                        brandy, you buy lunch - maybe dinner 
                        too when we bring in a good bird. 
                        Then champagne, caviar, whole deal.

           He stands and points to the barrels... Full of bloody CHUM.

                                 QUINT
                        You take those down to the boat while 
                        I close up.

           The off-islanders sneer at the smell from the barrels.

                                 MANSFIELD
                        What is that?

                                 QUINT
                        That’s my shark. We’ll use him. 
                             (off their look)
                        Come on now. This isn’t a party, get 
                        to work. 

                                 OFF-ISLANDER 2
                        “Please” would be nice.

           Quint shoots the older, richer man a look that withers him.

                                 QUINT
                        You’re going on my vessel, you hear? 
                        I know what I’m doing, not you. This 
                        isn’t no pleasure cruise or day sail. 
                        I’m talking about sharking. You’ll do 
                        what I say when we’re reckoning with 
                        death.
           Beat. The off-islanders are spooked by his intensity... But 
           then Quint’s face cracks into a smile and he starts cackling.

                                 QUINT
                        Look at your faces. Haha! Bunch of 
                        city folk, can’t take a joke. Get the 
                        damn barrels onboard, will you. You 
                        see a shark, Mister Mansfield, 
                        swaller! Hahaha!

           Quint heads inside, leaving them to lift the barrels.

           INT. OLD SAILOR’S SHACK - CONTINUOUS

           Quint goes about grabbing his duffel and a few remaining 
           supplies. Whether he’s drunk or not is unclear, but he’s 
           certainly energized, upbeat and talking wildly now --

                                 QUINT
                             (calling out to them)
                        Porkers! Time to catch a porker! No 
                        more cutting money for you, time to 
                        work! Wars over, you boys get ready 
                        to fight now!

           The off-islanders are gone, carrying barrels to the boat, and 
           Quint pauses. 

           He looks down at his arm -- his sleeve is rolled up to 
           reveal: a USS INDIANAPOLIS tattoo on his arm.

           He frowns. Then he pulls his sleeve down to cover it. He 
           walks back outside but WE REMAIN IN THE SHACK.

                                 QUINT (O.S.)
                        Alright now, easy with that Mister 
                        Mansfield! Don’t spill it on those 
                        nice clothes of yours! Don’t wanna 
                        stain ‘em! What’re you here for, a 
                        country club picnic?! Haha!

           ANGLE ON A WINDOW: but now Quint’s huge SHARK JAWS are newly 
           hung in front of the glass, creating a toothy frame. 

           PUSH IN THROUGH THE JAWS: to see them down below in the 
           habor, bustling on deck and Quint at the helm of the Orca. 

           Hear his shouted orders and cackling banter as the boat pulls 
           away from the dock, driving out to sea.

           EXT. BRIDGE - ORCA - DAY

           Quint drives the Orca, sun on his back and wind in his hair. 
           He glances back at his clients on the deck below, fussing 
           with their gear as Amity Island recedes behind them.

           He sips from a mug and turns back to face the great blue 
           expanse stretching out ahead of them. He smiles.

           He starts to SING A FAMILIAR TUNE to himself...

                                 QUINT
                             (soft)
                        Farewell and adieu, to you fair 
                        Spanish ladies... Farewell and adieu, 
                        to you ladies of Spain... For we’ve 
                        received orders, to sail back to 
                        Boston... And so never more shall we 
                        see you again.

           He chuckles to himself. He takes another sip. But then

                             (continuing the song)
                        We’ll rant and we’ll roar, like true 
                        Yankee whale men... We’ll rant and 
                        we’ll roar, across the salt sea... 
                        Until we sight Amity beside Martha’s 
                        Vineyard... Straight up the channels 
                        of New England we’ll roll...
                             (break)
                        Let every man here drink off his full 
                        bumper... Let every man here drink up 
                        a full glass... Drink and be jolly, 
                        and drown melancholy... And here’s to 
                        the health of our true hearted lass.

           THE END
