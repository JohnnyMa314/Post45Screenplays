           The iconic PARAMOUNT PICTURES’ LOGO appears, Circa 1970-72,  
           appropriately showing signs of “scratched” celluloid.   

           Then OVER BLACK, a familiar New Yorker:   

                                 WOODY ALLEN (V.O.) 
                        I'll tell you who believes in America… 

                                                        FADE IN:  

           INT.  ROBERT EVANS' OFFICE – DAY (1970) 

                                 WOODY ALLEN (CONT'D)  
                         The mob.  The mafia.   

           While Woody’s hair is uncharacteristically long and scraggly, his 
           iconic eyeglasses are an immediate giveaway as is his own 
           peculiar style of delivery & manner.        

                                 WOODY ALLEN (CONT'D) 
                        No it's true; it's true.  Because 
                        where else but in America could 
                        "organized crime take in over forty 
                        billion dollars a year and spend so 
                        little on office supplies?" 

           As the comedian speaks, our VIEW imperceptibly retreats.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN (CONT'D)  
                        And oh, oh, get this: you know the two 
                        mobsters under federal indictment?  
                        The same ones that are in the news 
                        lately?  They recently spent the night 
                        at the White House.  Nixon had to 
                        sleep on the sofa.  

           By now we are watching Woody over the shoulder of his seated 
           audience of one, the famous -- or infamous -- ROBERT EVANS.   

                                 EVANS (O.S.)  
                        Poor Dick.  He can never catch a 
                        break.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        Well I hear Pat Nixon welcomed the 
                        change.  But Nixon had a rough night; 
                        you know, twisting and turning.  The 
                        next morning, he had a lotta 
                        aggravation to shake off, so he carpet 
                        bombed Cambodia.   

           Evans laughs this up.  A WASPish rascal decked out in yacht club 
           attire: double-breasted suit, Gucci loafers, no socks.        

           His desk NAMEPLATE informs us: 

                                     ROBERT EVANS 
                          HEAD OF PRODUCTION, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS   

                                 WOODY ALLEN (CONT'D) 
                        Oh and, Evans, you should see how 
                        these mobster guys communicate with 
                        each other.   
                                 EVANS  
                        Why's that, Woody?   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        They don't just come out and say what 
                        they want.  These guys send coded 
                        messages to each other.  Like it’s all 
                        some kinda’ game.     

           Evans picks up VARIETY MAGAZINE:  

                          EVANS TENURE OVER BY END OF MONTH 

                                 EVANS  
                        I think I can relate.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        Oh but hey, Evans, do you know what 
                        the real joke about organized crime 
                        is?   

                                 EVANS  
                        No.  Tell me, what?   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        The mob is like a regular company; I 
                        mean, a business, a firm, like 
                        American Steel.   

           For Evans, a fuse has been lit.  His mind visibly drifts.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN (CONT'D)  
                        Makes you wonder what U.S. 
                        corporations are doing to the country.   

                                 EVANS 
                             (wondering aloud)   
                        Yeah.  Yeah it does.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        Like, what is the American Dream 
                        really about?     

                                 EVANS  
                              (mumbling)  
                        Organized crime… 

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        A classless, melting-pot society, we 
                        ain't.  It's all business.       

           Said noticing Evans’ distraction.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN (CONT'D)  
                        I, I say something wrong?  

                                 EVANS  
                        Wrong?  No, no, no.  Woody, you're 
                        great; you're beautiful; you're the 
                        best.     
           He gets up to escort Woody out.  Wall-to-wall PHOTOS show Evans 
           with a multitude of icons from megastar Kurt Douglas to mob 
           lawyer Sidney Korshak to Hanoi-bomber Henry Kissinger.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        But going back to what we were talking 
                        about.  "Play it Again, Sam."  We’ll 
                        film in San Francisco.  Hunky dory 
                        with that?     

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        Um, yeah.  If you think it would work.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Woody, you'll love San Fran.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        I did a show in Berkeley once.   

                                 EVANS  
                        How'd it go?   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        Yeah, not bad.  In the cab ride over 
                        there, I could still smell the 
                        marijuana from the previous 
                        passengers.  I was half-high during my 
                        set, I kept giggling at my own punch-
                        lines.     

                                 EVANS  
                        You know what they say: if you reach 
                        one person…  

                                 WOODY ALLEN 
                             (amused)  
                        Right.   

           Out they go -- 

           INT.  OUTER OFFICE – SAME  

           Evans' secretary is busy taking calls.   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        What about Diane?  Think we could cast 
                        her as Linda? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Remind me.  Diane…?  Diane…?   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        She played Linda on Broadway.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You like her for Linda in the movie?   

                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        I love Diane for everything.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Can't wait to meet her.  
                                 WOODY ALLEN  
                        Great, okay.  Gee, thanks, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Not at all, Woody.   

           Woody heads off, a bounce in his step.  Evans stares off, a man 
           deep in thought.  To his secretary:  

                                 EVANS (CONT'D) 
                        Get Peter Bart on the phone, will ya, 
                        Cathy? 

                                 SECRETARY (CATHY) 
                        Barbara Streisand has left two 
                        messages.  She's still not happy with 
                        the guy cast as the step-brother for 
                        “On a Clear Day.”      

                                 EVANS  
                        Okay uh, I'll call her -– no wait.  I 
                        can't deal with that now.  Send candy 
                        -- the uh, the fancy French ones.  But 
                        um, make sure to get Peter Bart on the 
                        phone.  Top priority.     

                                 SECRETARY  
                        People keep asking why you relocated 
                        your office to Beverly Hills and off 
                        the Paramount studio lot.  

                                 EVANS  
                             (touchy)  
                        Because the studio is broke -- that's 
                        why.   
                              (reconsidering) 
                        No no, wait.  Don't say that.   

                                 SECRETARY  
                        I wasn't going to.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Say -- I don't know what to say.  Say 
                        I'm a snob.   

                                 SECRETARY  
                        A snob?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Yeah.  Tell people, tell 'em "Bob 
                        Evans only lunches in 90210 and only 
                        works in 90210." 
                             (then)  
                        It's half-true.  Right? 

                                 SECRETARY  
                             (doesn't know) 
                        Right. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Ah who cares if it's true or not?  
                        Once it sounds good, it plays.  That's 
                        all that matters: impressions and 
                        conceptions.       
           ALI MACGRAW enters, a ravishing chic-hippie.  She wears a 
           paisley-patterned SILK SCARF as a headband like revolutionary 
           bandana.   

           Evans brightens up, delighted to see her as she is to see him.  
           They embrace, a warm and loving married couple.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh hello, darling.   

                                 ALI  
                        Hi.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You just missed, Woody.   

                                 ALI  
                        No, I passed him in the hall.   

           Evans guides her inside -- 

           INT.  EVANS' OFFICE – SAME  

                                 ALI (CONT'D) 
                        Boy, is he in a good mood.   

                                 EVANS  
                        The little guy should be.  I just 
                        green-lit a picture for him.   
                             (then)  
                        How'd the screening go?   

           Ali goes into character à la Jennifer Cavalleri:  

                                 ALI  
                        "Love means never having to say you're 
                        sorry." 

           They laugh and hug, enjoying the joke.      

                                 EVANS  
                        Ah the Academy will love ya, baby.   

                                 ALI  
                        Save it, Evans; Mia Farrow, I ain't.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I never hustled Mia and I would never 
                        hustle you.     

                                 ALI  
                        You better not.   
                             (then) 
                        Evans…? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Hmm? 

                                 ALI  
                        Do you really like "Love Story?"  I 
                        mean really?   
                                 EVANS  
                        Ali, are you kidding?  "Love Story" is 
                        about us.  And it's the one picture 
                        I'm banking that will save me.  For a 
                        little while, at least.    

           Said pouring two drinks, offers one to Ali.   

                                 ALI  
                        Evans, it's only twelve.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Tell that to my anxiety.     
           Shows his wife the cause of said anxiety: the NY Times.   

                               BLUHDORN'S FOLLY 

                                 ALI  
                        It's better than "Bluhdorn's Blow-Job"   

           She holds up "Hollywood Close-Up," which says:   

                             BLUHDORN'S BLOW-JOB     

                                 EVANS  
                        Jesus.  The article actually says 
                        "blow job."  Is this what we’re down 
                        to?  Smut as news?        

           He pours Ali's drink into his and downs the glass in one.   

                                 ALI  
                        It got my attention.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I need a monster hit, baby.  Badly.  

           Intercom BUZZES.   

                                 SECRETARY (OVER INTERCOM)  
                        Creative Affairs, Mr. Evans.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh that's Peter.  I gotta take this.     

                                 ALI  
                             (playful)  
                        Oh no, you can't leave me.   

                                 EVANS  
                        One second, darling.   
                             (into phone)  
                        Hello, Peter?...Where are you? 

           Said pouring himself another drink.  But Ali takes the  
           glass and empties it in a potted plant.     

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)  
                        Okay, stay there, I'll come to you.     
                                 ALI  
                        Now?   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)  
                        Yes, now.  I have something running 
                        around my mind; I can't shake it…okay.   

           Hangs up.   

                                 ALI  
                        Why call me for lunch if you’re now 
                        gonna run off at lunchtime?     

                                 EVANS  
                        It’s just this unexpected meeting.   

           He goes to kiss her goodbye, but Ali pulls back.   

                                 EVANS (CONT’D) 
                        What?   

                                 ALI  
                        Don't forget our deal, Evans.  Never 
                        let anything get between us.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Ali, sweetie, it's one meeting. 

           SMOOCHES her and off he goes.    

                                 ALI  
                        Why are you so desperate to see Peter, 
                        anyway?   

                                 EVANS  
                        I feel inspired.   

                                 ALI  
                             (calling out) 
                        About what? 

           EXT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIOS – DAY  

           Executives and wannabes come and go under the ICONIC ENTRANCE.  
           Gas-guzzlers curb up and swerve inside.   

                                 PETER (V.O.) (PRE-LAP) 
                        You want Paramount to do what?  

           INT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIOS – STAGE 5 – SAME  

           Evans wanders around w/PETER BART, his mild-mannered consigliere, 
           his voice of reason, the straight man to Evans’ shoot-from-the-
           hip eccentricity.  The mammoth soundstage is empty and bare 
           except for POSTERS and DEBRIS.   

                                 PETER  
                        Say it to me one more time –- actually 
                        don’t.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Why?  What's wrong, Peter? 
                                 PETER  
                        Oh nothing's wrong, Evans, nothing at 
                        all.  The studio is only bleeding 
                        money from one humiliating flop after 
                        another.  I mean good god, what acid 
                        were you on when you okayed this 
                        turkey? 

           He SLAPS a large "Paint your Wagon" MOVIE POSTER on a wall.         

                                 EVANS  
                        "Paint your Wagon" was a successful 
                        stage musical, Peter.     

                                 PETER  
                        Yeah -- in the fifties, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        "The Sound of Music" is the highest-
                        grossing picture of all time… 

                                 PETER  
                        And I bet the guys at Twentieth had 
                        the "Sound of Music" in mind when they 
                        gave the green light to "Doctor 
                        Doolittle" or "Star," and no one went 
                        to see either of them.     

                                 EVANS  
                             (lamenting)  
                        "The Sound of Music" was bigger than 
                        "Gone with the Wind."  What happened?   

                                 PETER  
                        Times changed.  Or people changed, I 
                        don't know.  Either way the Hollywood 
                        Land that Harry Warner and Daryl 
                        Zanuck built is gone -- long gone.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (mournful)  
                        Who you tellin’?   

                                 PETER  
                        Corporations, conglomerates -- they're 
                        the heart and soul of this town.        

                                 EVANS  
                             (scornfully)  
                        Thanks be to Howard Hughes.  That 
                        hyper-hygienic weirdo started all 
                        this.   

                                 PETER  
                        And killed a wonderful studio like RKO 
                        in the process; I know.  But you know 
                        what else I know, Evans?     

                                 EVANS  
                        That I need Vitamin A in my diet?   

                                 PETER  
                        We need new thinking, new solutions, 
                        because the 1970s doesn't give a 
                        single iota about the past or what 
                        used to work.    
                                 EVANS  
                        Okay, we made mistakes -- but, Peter, 
                        I'm a big believer in second chances.   

                                 PETER  
                             (not feeling it)  
                        Good for you, Evans. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Good for us, Peter -- we have my new 
                        idea, don't forget. 

           They exit... 

           EXT.  BACKLOT – SAME  

           ...and stroll along.  The place is nearly as empty.  Some staff, 
           some extras -- nothing like the hustle and bustle of the golden 
           age.   

                                 PETER  
                        I’ve forgotten it and so should you. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Why?   

                                 PETER  
                        You want Paramount to do a picture 
                        about gangsters?    

                                 EVANS  
                        No.  I want Paramount to do a picture 
                        about American organized crime.      

           Smiles into the distance -- for our benefit, a CLOUDY IMAGE takes 
           shape, showing a movie premier, a real 1970s celebrity affair, 
           movie posters show early-disco gangsters.  

           Then:    

                                 PETER  
                        Why in god's name?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Because this mobster flick is gonna be 
                        unlike any other? 

                                 PETER  
                        How?  

                                 EVANS  
                        We're gonna show how the mob is 
                        structured like a company.  But with 
                        the added bonus of the mob having 
                        their own rules and rituals.  And 
                        Italians, let me tell you, love rules 
                        and rituals.   

                                 PETER  
                        I thought the mob was Sicilian, not 
                        Italian.   
                                 EVANS  
                        What's the difference between a 
                        Sicilian and an Italian?  

                                 PETER  
                        Are you telling a joke or are you 
                        asking me a question?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Asking you a question.   

                                 PETER  
                        Uh, I think it's like the difference 
                        between a Hawaiian and an American.  A 
                        Hawaiian is Hawaiian as well as an 
                        American.  But an American is not 
                        Hawaiian.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Okay look, Italian, Sicilian, it 
                        doesn't matter because everyone from 
                        that Mediterranean part of the world 
                        is fucking dramatic.  And drama is 
                        what makes a good fucking picture.  
                        And like all good pictures, it starts 
                        on the fucking page.   

           Feeding off Evans' exuberance:  

                                 PETER  
                        Do you have a fucking script? 

                                 EVANS  
                        No.   

           Peter's face and shoulders slack with disappointment.   
           Then, with sudden realization:  

                                 PETER  
                        Yeah you do.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I do what? 

                                 PETER  
                        You have a script, a gangster script -
                        - a gangster book, anyhow.    

                                 EVANS  
                        What book?   

                                 PETER  
                        "The Godfather."   

           Evans lights up.  Stunned.   

           INT.  CANTEEN – SAME  

           ...move through.  Pour coffee.  Peter takes a pastry.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Paramount owns "The Godfather?   
                                 PETER  
                        You have to ask?  Evans, you bought 
                        The Godfather.     

                                 EVANS  
                        I did? 

                                 PETER  
                        You remember: you gave Mario some cash 
                        to pay off bookies.  Then to your 
                        surprise, he sent you the pages.   You 
                        sent them over to me, they were 
                        originally called "Mafia"; every 
                        publisher passed, but I told you they 
                        were good.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I don't remember any of this.  Why 
                        can't I remember this? 

                                 PETER  
                        You had just met Ali, you were high up 
                        in the clouds.  

                                 EVANS  
                             (dreamily) 
                        Ms. Flower Child/Snot Nose does have 
                        that affect on me; that's true.   

                                 PETER  
                             (sotto) 
                        You and every other actor she stars 
                        opposite to.   

                                 EVANS  
                        What? 

                                 PETER  
                        Nothing.   

                                 EVANS  
                        What's The Godfather about? 

                                 PETER  
                        You haven't read it? 

                                 EVANS  
                        I read everything.   
                             (then)  
                        Just remind me.   

                                 PETER  
                        Only you Evans, I swear to god.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Is that supposed to be a crack at my 
                        character, Peter?   

                                 PETER  
                        The Godfather is being translated into 
                        every known language on the planet 
                        because the book is currently 
                        rewriting the criteria needed for a 
                        book to be a blockbuster.  
                                 PETER (CONT’D)  
                        And The Godfather only exists because 
                        of you -- but you, Evans, you haven't 
                        read The Godfather.  Sweet Moses and 
                        Jesus.            

                                 EVANS  
                        When you read it, did you like it?   

                                 PETER  
                        Very much so; yeah.  Well, there were 
                        one or two allusions that concerned 
                        me, but… 

                                 EVANS  
                        What kind of allusions? 

           Peter lowers his voice, wary of being overheard.   

                                 PETER  
                        About Frank.  Remember, I came to you 
                        about them, but you didn't care 
                        because Sinatra pissed you off about 
                        trying to pull Mia during the shooting 
                        of "Rosemary's Baby" to star with him 
                        in "The Detective."     

                                 EVANS  
                        Frank even had Mickey Rudin serve Mia 
                        with divorce papers on the set when 
                        she sided with me.    

                                 PETER  
                        Didn't you arrange for both pictures 
                        to open on the same day? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Mia wanted "Rosemary's Baby" to kick 
                        “The Detective's” butt at the box 
                        office.   

                                 PETER  
                        But you own the rights to The 
                        Detective?  

                                 EVANS  
                              (nostalgic)  
                        Ahh.  My first deal.   

           Both men walk out another door... 

           EXT.  BACK LOT – SAME  

           ...and move through.  

                                 PETER  
                        Evans, you sabotaged your own 
                        investment.      

                                 EVANS  
                             (musing)  
                        Just another day on the farm, Peter.    

                                 PETER  
                        Funny farm, Evans.    
           Both men recede into the distance, their backs to us.   
           They approach a BACKGROUND PAINTING OF A SUNSET that's being 
           moved by two SCENICS.  Overhead, a real SUNSET scorches the 
           cloud-flecked sky.    

                                 EVANS  
                        It's all about finding an angle, 
                        Peter.  A way to convince the 
                        distribution mavens to go along with 
                        this mobster idea.   

           On that note, we dreamily --  

                                                    DISSOLVE TO: 

           INT.  EVANS' HOME - PROJECTION ROOM – NIGHT   

           Peter and Ali are half-asleep and bleary-eyed watching  
           "The Roaring Twenties," the Cagney/Bogart 1939 b/w classic 
           flickering across the home movie screen.   

           Evans, wide-awake, leafs through a hardback copy of Mario Puzo's 
           "The Godfather," surrounded by MOVIE REELS in cans.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (reading aloud)  
                        "A lawyer with his briefcase can steal 
                        more than a hundred men with guns." 
                             (commenting)  
                        Ain't it the sour truth.   

           Ali sits up, to Peter:  

                                 ALI  
                        I forget, what are we supposed to be 
                        looking for again? 

                                 PETER  
                        Ask your husband.     

                                 EVANS  
                        A pattern.  So we know what not to do 
                        the next time around.   

                                 PAUL KELLY AS NICK BROWN  
                             (on screen) 
                        You two guys think you're pretty cute. 

                                 CAGNEY AS BARTLETT 
                             (on screen)  
                        Shut up.  The girl is singing. 

                                 KELLY AS BROWN  
                             (on screen)  
                        Now, you listen to me.  You tipped off 
                        the feds I was running in a load last 
                        night, and they took it from me. 

                                 CAGNEY AS BARTLETT  
                             (to Bogart as Hally) 
                        He makes noise when he eats spaghetti 
                        too. 
           Evans suddenly looks up -- "Spaghetti"   

                                 EVANS  
                        Who directed this?  Peter? 

                                 PETER  
                        H'm?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Who directed "The Roaring Twenties?"   

                                 PETER  
                        Uh…Walsh.   

           Evans starts rummaging through the film reels, movies they've 
           already watched.   

                                 ALI  
                        Didn't Walsh direct "Hombre?" 

                                 PETER  
                        Probably the best western of them all.   
                             (apologetically to Ali) 
                        After "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance 
                        Kid," of course.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Who directed "White Heat?" 

                                 ALI  
                             (to Peter)  
                        I wasn't in "Butch Cassidy."   

                                 PETER  
                        Are you sure? 

                                 ALI  
                        Am I sure? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Hey you two?  Who directed "White 
                        Heat?" 

           Peter points to the screen, emphasizing: 

                                 PETER  
                        Walsh.   

                                 ALI  
                        Katherine Ross was in "Butch Cassidy."   

                                 PETER  
                        Anyone ever tell you’re Katherine 
                        Ross’ spitting image? 

                                 ALI  
                        No.  Never.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Who directed "Little Caesar?"

                             (to Evans)  
                        Even Herb Stempel could answer that 
                        one.   

                                 ALI  
                        Evans, do I look like Katherine Ross?  

                                 EVANS  
                        You look like the heaven, moon and the 
                        stars, baby.   

                                 ALI  
                        Is that yes or no?    

                                 EVANS  
                             (moving on) 
                        Who directed "Public Enemy?" 

                                 PETER 
                        Uh, Wellman, William Wellman.  
                        Actually, you know he has cancer.   

                                 ALI

                                 EVANS  
                        I sent flowers.   

                                 PETER  
                        Why are you asking these questions 
                        about who directed what? 

                                 EVANS

                        What?/What'd you say? 

           Evans holds up film reels: "Hoodlum Empire" and "Pay or Die"  

                                 EVANS  
                        All these gangster pictures, most of 
                        'em anyway, they were all directed by 
                        Jews.  Not Italians.

                        Sicilians. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Italians, Sicilians, it doesn't 
                        matter.   

                                 ALI 
                        Why not? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Because there's nothing Italian or 
                        Sicilian on that screen or in these 
                        cans of film.

           Manhattan skyline like the scary tower of Mordor.

                        Charlie, Paramount owns the rights.  
                        You're not getting the opportunity 
                        here.   

           INT.  GULF + WESTERN, NYC – BLUHDORN'S OFFICE – SAME  

           The ill-famed CHARLIE BLUHDORN, a busy, dynamic conglomerate 
           king, multitasks a multitude of assistants coming & going.   

           He speaks with a thick, exuberant Austrian accent, so he 
           pronounces w's as v's so "what" sounds like "vat."

                        No, Evans, it is you who does not get 
                        it.   

           INTERCUT BACK & FORTH: 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)   
                        What's the problem, Charlie? 

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Burt Lancaster. 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Burt?  What about him?   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        He wants to make The Godfather.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        I can’t believe it.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        He wants the starring role, too.   
                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Burt's too old to play Michael 
                        Corleone, Charlie.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Lancaster wants to play the godfather, 
                        you putz.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        That's verkakte, Charlie.   

           This pleasantly surprises Bluhdorn: 

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Evans, you know Yiddish? 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Geez Charlie, I thought I was speaking 
                        Italian.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        You're speaking bupkis, Evans.  
                        Lancaster is offering me a million 
                        bucks for the rights.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        A million? 

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        A million.  And that's a million more 
                        than you've ever made for me, Evans.     

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Charlie, the way The Godfather the 
                        book is selling, I promise you here 
                        and now The Godfather the movie will 
                        make you twenty times that if done 
                        right.  And Burt Lancaster, with all 
                        respect, won't do it right.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Promises, smomishes, Evans.  The board 
                        of directors wants the million -- I 
                        want the million.  Get something from 
                        my crazy investment.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Goddamn it, Charlie, The Godfather 
                        will pay off in spades; it will be the 
                        kind of movie people in Kansas City 
                        will want to see.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                              (interested)  
                        Kansas City…? 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)   
                        The Godfather holds a promise of 
                        greatness, Charlie, and if you give me 
                        a million bucks to make the darn 
                        thing, we can live up to that promise.  
                        Audiences from all over will come.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Are you going to make the picture in 
                        Kansas City? 
                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                             (evasive)  
                        Uh well, um -- look the point is, 
                        Charlie, The Godfather will play in 
                        Peoria.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        If you're trying to shtik me, Evans… 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Charlie, when you hired me, you 
                        trusted me enough to tell me to decree 
                        by my gut.  Trust me now.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        All right, Evans; all right.  I'll 
                        talk to the board of directors.  Who 
                        can say what they'll say?  But I'll 
                        talk to them and see what they say.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Charlie.  Thanks.    

           He hangs up and we stay with Evans, who turns around  
           to Peter eager to learn the outcome. 

                                 PETER  
                        Well…?     

                                 EVANS  
                        We're on.    

                                 PETER  
                        That was a close one.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Too close.  Now to find a director.   

           Both men move out to -– 

           INT.  CORRIDOR – SAME  

           They stroll along.   

                                 PETER 
                        Well I found us a producer, anyway.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Who?  

                                 PETER 
                        Al Ruddy.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Ruddy's not Italian.   

                                 PETER  
                        Why does Ruddy have to be Italian? 

                                 EVANS     
                        Because we want audiences to smell the 
                        spaghetti.   

                                 PETER 
                        I'm not too sure you should keep 
                        relying on that analogy.   
                                 EVANS 
                        Sure I should, and Ruddy ain’t 
                        Italian.    

                                 PETER 
                        Hey, you wanna film on location in New 
                        York and on the cheap or not?  Ruddy’s 
                        our guy.     

                                 EVANS 
                        Bluhdorn thinks we're filming in 
                        Kansas City.   

                                 PETER 
                        Who gave him that idea?   

                                 EVANS  
                        What's it matter who gave who what 
                        idea?  We're filming in New York.  

                                 PETER 
                        Then we gotta rope in Al Ruddy.  
                        Nobody knows New York better and or 
                        how to stretch a dollar.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Maybe Ruddy knows a director.  

                                 PETER 
                        There's Bogdanovich.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I didn't know Bogdanovich was Italian.   

                                 PETER  
                        Bogdanovich is Italian?   

                                 EVANS  
                        It doesn't matter what he is.  
                        Bogdanovich is signed up to do a 
                        comedy at Warner.   

                                 PETER  
                        Okay.  Arthur Penn.     

                                 EVANS 
                        Busy doing a western, something to do 
                        with Custer.  

                                 PETER 
                        Peter Yates.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Nah, he's in the middle of a war 
                        picture with Peter O'Toole 

                                 PETER  
                             (eureka)  
                        I know -- Costa-Gavras.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Forget it.  He won't leave France.   

                                 PETER  
                        Too bad.  I loved Z.   
                                 EVANS 
                        As did I, but Peter, this picture 
                        doesn't need a good director; it needs 
                        a good Italian director –- a maestro.  
                        Comprende?   

                                 PETER  
                        Don't you mean capiche? 

                                 EVANS 
                             (not listening)   
                        Is there or is there not a competent, 
                        visionary director with Italian 
                        heritage in this vile, corrupt 
                        cesspool of a town?    

                                 PETER  
                        There's one in San Francisco.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Who?   

                                 PETER  
                        You don't like him.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I like everybody.   

                                 PETER  
                        Coppola.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Except Coppola.  

           They pronounce Coppola as cop-pa-la.   

                                 PETER  
                        Ah, Francis is okay.   

                                 EVANS  
                        He's loony-tunes.   

                                 PETER  
                        A touch on the eccentric side, maybe.   

                                 EVANS  
                        No.  Hell no.     

                                 PETER  
                        Bob… 

                                 EVANS  
                        I hate it when anyone calls me Bob.  
                        It's always before they're gonna say 
                        something they know I won't like.   

                                 PETER  
                        Francis may be brilliant, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        That's your WASP-wannabe-New York 
                        Times bullshit coming out.  

                                 PETER  
                        You loved "Patton."   
                                 EVANS  
                        Patton's a great picture -- but 
                        Coppola didn't direct "Patton."   

                                 PETER  
                        Coppola's a shoo-in to win best script 
                        this year.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I bet Edmund North wrote all the good 
                        parts.  

                                 PETER  
                             ("be reasonable") 
                        Evans… 

                                 EVANS  
                        All Coppola has to show for himself as 
                        a director is some arty-farty flick 
                        which did no business.  He turned 
                        Broadway blockbuster "Finian's 
                        Rainbow" into a Hollywood disaster.  
                        And everyone rained on "The Rain 
                        People."     

                                 PETER  
                        Roger Ebert wrote "The Rain People" 
                        was interesting and provocative.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Ebert's from Chicago, a cultural 
                        wasteland.  What does he know? 

                                 PETER 
                        That Francis is experimental.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Which is film school-speak for anti-
                        American, pro-Euro-trash snobbery.   

                                 PETER  
                        New Wave had a big impact.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Coppola is a fast-talking, self-
                        publicizing hustler.   

                                 PETER  
                        Evans, are you criticizing Francis or 
                        describing yourself?     

                                 EVANS 
                        Coppola will never direct The 
                        Godfather.   

                                 PETER  
                        Is this because he won't kiss your 
                        ass.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Peter, believe me: Coppola is the last 
                        person on this earth I want kissing my 
                        ass.      

           Evans' secretary leans around a corner:   
                                 EVANS' SECRETARY  
                        David Merrick called.  Truman Capote 
                        didn't turn in a draft for "The Great 
                        Gatsby." 

           Evans sighs to himself.   

                                 EVANS (CONT’D) 
                        Another annoying problem.   

           Turns to Peter resignedly:    

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                        Call him. 

                                 PETER 
                        Capote?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Coppola.   

           EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO – DAYS LATER  

           Establish outside Zoetrope Studios.   
           Pre-lap a PHONE RINGING.   

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – SAME 

           FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA answers the ringing phone.   
           He has a professorial appearance: horn-rimmed eyeglasses, beard, 
           heavyset build.  He walks and talks as if he's under great 
           strain.  To a quick observer, he comes off like an amphetamines 
           junkie (which he might be).        

                                 COPPOLA (INTO PHONE) 
                        Hello?...No, I'm sorry, Francis Ford 
                        Coppola is not here.  May I take a 
                        message?...I believe he sent the check 
                        in the mail this morning...I will tell 
                        him.  Thank you.   

           He aggressively hangs up.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I swear every creditor in the state is 
                        after me.      

                                 PETER 
                        Are things as bad as that, Francis? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Oh you know, things could always be 
                        worse.     
                              (then)  
                        I think.    

           GEORGE LUCAS steps in from an adjoining room.  Looks like a cool 
           racecar driver, but is quiet and reserved as they come.   

                                 LUCAS  
                        More bills.   

           Said handing envelopes to buddy Coppola.   
                                 COPPOLA  
                        Looks that way.   
                             (re: Peter) 
                        See who’s here?   

                                 LUCAS 
                        Oh.  Hi, Peter.   

                                 PETER  
                        Hey, the legend of UCLA.   

                                 LUCAS  
                        No Francis was the UCLA boy-wonder. 

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (to Peter)  
                        George was the whizz-kid of USC. 

                                 PETER  
                        Oh sorry.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's confusing.  

                                 LUCAS 
                        Alphabet soup usually is.    

                                 PETER  
                        Francis tells me you're cutting your 
                        first picture.   

                                 LUCAS  
                        THX 1138.  

           Said gesturing inside the adjoining room, a makeshift facto 
           editing suite.  Two Editors review reels of film, chopping and 
           splicing.   

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)  
                             (re: Coppola)  
                        You hear?  Eleanor's pregnant.   

                                 PETER  
                             (to Coppola)  
                        Oh that's great.    

           Both men shake hands.  The editors call George back.    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It is great. 

           The phone RINGS again.   

                                 PETER  
                        But…? 

           Coppola YANKS the phone cord from the wall socket. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)  
                        Running a studio isn’t all champagne 
                        and caviar, huh Francis?   

           Coppola wanders around.  A man with a lot on his mind.    
                                 COPPOLA 
                        I've staked all my personal money, 
                        such as it is, into this place.  I 
                        stand to lose everything when I have a 
                        wife, kids, a new baby on the way…I 
                        don’t know what to do.    

                                 PETER  
                        Paramount is making a gangster 
                        picture.  The Godfather.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        The book The Godfather?   

                                 PETER  
                        You read it? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I haven't had time to read. 

                                 PETER  
                        It's good.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Oh? 

                                 PETER  
                        Very good.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Why are you telling me? 

                                 PETER  
                        Because we want you to adapt and 
                        direct.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        We?  Does Evans even know you’re here? 

                                 PETER  
                        I know there's a uh, a clash of 
                        personalities between you two.  But 
                        Francis, this is all Evans’ idea.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        You, you guys don't want me to go 
                        anywhere near this idea, Peter. 

                                 PETER  
                        Why not? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Peter, I'm…  

           The walls are festooned w/photos and posters of 1960s Euro movie 
           icons from Goddard to Truffaut to De Sica.  Coppola stares at 
           them as if they were staring at him in judgment.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        "The Godfather" is, you know… 

                                 PETER  
                        A terrific book. 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        And mainstream.   
                                 PETER  
                        What? 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        I should be filming Kerouac not…look, 
                        if you wanna adapt the Beat Generation 
                        to the screen, come to me.  But "The 
                        Godfather"… 

                                 PETER  
                        What's wrong with "The Godfather?"   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's not underground, it's not avant-
                        garde.   

                                 PETER  
                        You haven't even read it.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And still I know it's not something 
                        Fellini would make.  No auteur would.   

                                 PETER  
                        Why not? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's not art.   

                                 PETER  
                        What is art? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Not that.   

                                 PETER 
                        Francis… 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Yeah?   

                                 PETER  
                        Read the book first before making any 
                        snap negative judgments.   

           Said handing over a HARDBACK COPY.  Coppola flips through the 
           400-plus pages.  Takes a seat.  Opens on page one.   

           SCENE BECOMES A SERIES OF TIME DISSOLVES:  

           --   Coppola reading, upright on a chair  

           --   sitting back, one leg over the arm rest  

           --   lying flat on his back on a couch  

           --   in the makeshift kitchen, preparing pizzas for everyone,  
                his eyes on the open Godfather.   

           Over scene, we intercut on Peter  

           --   observing George Lucas edit THX 138   

           --   eating dinner with everyone, keeping an eye on Coppola  
                reading off to the side as he eats.   
           --   sleeping crumbled up in an armchair.  Coppola, awake, flips  
                to another page.     

           The morning sun washes over Peter's sleeping face.   
           He stirs awake.  No one is around.   

           MURMURING VOICES from the kitchen beckon him.     

           Peter stumbles over FILM REEL TINS strewn about the floor.  

           He stops at the doorway, unseen by Coppola and Lucas in the next 
           room.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Yeah okay, the book is pretty darn 
                        good, there's a lot going on.  But 
                        it's not something that would get Paul 
                        Crump off death row.  I mean, where’s 
                        the value?     

                                 LUCAS  
                        The way things are with us 
                        financially, Francis, I actually think 
                        this gig is a god-send.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        When did you start believing in god?  

                                 LUCAS  
                        When I saw this month's mortgage 
                        interest payments and realized that 
                        only a miracle could save us.    

           He pushes across the table unpaid bills and late notices.   

                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)  
                        And you getting paid to make "The 
                        Godfather" could be that miracle.     

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Yeah there's a lotta sense to that, 
                        George.  But the world is full of guys 
                        who say "Well, first I'll make the 
                        money and then I'll make the personal 
                        movies."  But somehow they never get 
                        around to doing it.  And I wanna make 
                        personal movies now.  Honest movies.   

                                 LUCAS  
                        Why can't The Godfather be personal or 
                        honest?  Or both?     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Trash is all Hollywood understands, 
                        especially Evans.  And "The Godfather" 
                        is…hmm…a little trashy in parts.  And 
                        I didn't open Zoetrope to make trash, 
                        little or otherwise.    

                                 LUCAS  
                        Think of it like serendipity, like 
                        some force is giving you a financial 
                        break to keep Zoetrope in operation.     
                                 COPPOLA  
                        Then may this force or whatever be 
                        with you, George, and you direct "The 
                        Godfather."   

                                 LUCAS  
                        I would if they'd asked me to, but 
                        they didn't ask me, they asked you, 
                        Francis.  

           Coppola flicks his eyebrows, restless and dissatisfied.   

           Lucas mouths to himself, "May this force be with you."  Writes it 
           down.  Scratches it out.  Rewrites "May the force be with you."  
           Happy -- underlines it twice.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        How can be the Picasso or Joyce or 
                        Stravinsky of filmmaking and show 
                        America to itself if I'm some…I don't 
                        know…some employee anchored to a 
                        paycheck?  

                                 LUCAS  
                        Artists have to survive, too.  Think 
                        of "The Godfather" like working for 
                        Rodger Corman again. 

           He gestures to a colorful poster on the wall: Coppola's 1963 B-
           flick for Corman: “Dementia 13”   

                                 LUCAS (CONT'D) 
                             (wry)   
                        Except this time you actually get 
                        paid.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        God just when I thought I was out, the 
                        system pulls me back in.      

           Spots Peter staring wide-eyed at him.  Awkward moment.  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT'D)  
                        Oh hey, morning, Peter.  How'd you 
                        sleep? 

                                 PETER 
                             (going with it)  
                        Great thanks.   

                                 LUCAS  
                        Want some coffee?  

                                 PETER  
                        That would be great.  Thanks.   

           Silence as coffee is handed over to Peter.  

                                 PETER  
                             (to Coppola)  
                        So did you read it? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        H'm?  Oh.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.   
                                 PETER  
                        Well, Francis…?  You in or out? 

           EXT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIO LOT – DAYS LATER  

           Peter and Coppola on the move.  

           Evans is up ahead, in mid-conversation with a new,  
           young actress: DIANE KEATON.   

                                 DIANE  
                        And I've also done commercials.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Commercials? 

                                 DIANE 
                        Yeah.  
                             (voice lowers) 
                        Deodorant commercials.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Well it's always nice to keep fresh.   

           Diane laughs, both out of enjoyment and nerves.  Woody Allen is 
           in the background with director HERBERT ROSS.      

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh I think Woody wants you.   

                                 DIANE  
                        Oh.  Uh, well, nice meeting you.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You two, Diane.  Have fun filming in 
                        San Francisco.  

                                 DIANE  
                        Oh thanks.  We will.  He’s hoping 
                        anyway, right?     

           BUMPS into an Extra.  Makes her all the more clumsy and giggly.  
           Evans looks endeared.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Diane…?   

                                 DIANE  
                        Um, yeah?   

                                 EVANS  
                        By any chance, did you attend Smith or 
                        Wellesley college…?   

                                 DIANE  
                        Me?  No.  Nu-uh.  Nope.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Just wondering.     

                                 DIANE  
                        Um…okay.   

           She continues on her way.   
           Evans spots across the way --   

           Peter and Coppola, with RUDDY, a big, tall, rasping-voiced,  
           rough diamond New Yorker.  

                                 RUDDY  
                        Francis, you were born to make this 
                        movie.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Ruddy, save the pitch.  I'm not saying 
                        yes to a single thing until I hear yes 
                        to some guarantees.   

                                 EVANS 
                             (wry)  
                        I can guarantee you a thing or two.   

           Peter tries to keep the mood light and non-argumentative.   

                                 PETER  
                        Hey, Evans, look who I brought back.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (begrudgingly)  
                        Francis.

                             (with same reluctance) 
                        Evans.   
                             (off an encouraging 
                             smile from Peter)   
                        How's the studio business going? 

                                 EVANS  
                             (sly smile)  
                        You tell me, pal.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Asshole.   

                                 PETER  
                        Alright, alright.   

                                 RUDY  
                        Evans, I think it's a stroke of genius 
                        getting Signore Coppola onboard.  
                        Mazel tov.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I do have some stipulations.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Is that Italian for wanting more 
                        money? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        How big is the budget, by the way?    

                                 EVANS  
                        Maybe two million.  Maybe.     
                                 PETER  
                             (low to Coppola)  

                                 EVANS 
                             (to Coppola)   
                        We were thinking urban, gritty, maybe 
                        throw in some hippies, something 
                        audiences can feel the funk and boogie 
                        to.   

           Peter and Coppola swap a knowing glance.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        Is that eye-exchange supposed to 
                        convey something?   

                                 PETER  
                        Uh, Evans-- 

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (to Evans)  
                        We were thinking the movie should 
                        stick to the book's nostalgic post-war 
                        time and setting.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh we were, were we? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And do a story about the emergence of 
                        America post-World War II.  The 
                        forties are after all about the growth 
                        of America, the growth of its business 
                        system.   

           Evans gives Peter a sour glare.   

                                 PETER  
                        It could work, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh sure.  With endless millions of 
                        dollars on tap, it could work very 
                        well, Peter.     

                                 RUDDY  
                        I might know a guy who knows a guy 
                        who's got a cousin who could swing us 
                        some cars from the forties.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Well if this friend of a friend's 
                        cousin can also swing us wardrobe 
                        along with buildings from the forties, 
                        all at basement prices, we could be 
                        going places.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        One other thing… 

                                 EVANS  
                        GOD… 

           They have to step apart from each other to make way for a CHORUS

                        We're not stereotyping this movie.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Who asked you to?

                                 EVANS  
                        What actor talks like that?   
                                 COPPOLA  
                        I just told you.  Chico Marx.  And you 
                        might as well know now that we have to 
                        excise all the book’s sleazy elements.    

                                 RUDDY  
                        The book has sleazy elements?

                        Lucy Mancini getting an operation on

                                 EVANS  
                        That sounds more weird than sleazy.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And the picture is not going to 
                        glorify murder.  Murder's a sin; 
                        gangsters are sinners -- all the 
                        "aren't mobster's groovy" stuff, all 
                        gone.   

           With the extras now gone, our guys can huddle up.   

                                 EVANS  
                        What's left?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        A story about power.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Okay, finally, now I'm with you.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And it's a story about succession.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You've lost me.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Like a king with an empire and three 
                        sons, each having a different part of 
                        the father's personality.   

                                 RUDDY  
                        Didn't Henry II have three sons?   

                                 PETER  
                        King Lear did.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Are we still talking about "The 
                        Godfather?"   
                                 COPPOLA  
                        Think of it as a metaphor.   

                                 EVANS  
                        A metaphor for what?  A piss-poor 
                        picture? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (with pride)  
                        For an American family trying to 
                        survive capitalism.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Fuck you and the pretentious horse  
                        you rode in on.  

           INT.  PARAMOUNT OFFICE – MINUTES LATER   

           Evans storms in, w/Peter and Ruddy hot on his heels.     

                                 PETER 
                        Francis' metaphor about family and 
                        capitalism isn't half-bad, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (paces around)   
                        No, Peter -- no no no - I don't like 
                        it - I don't like it at all.  

                                 PETER  
                        Evans, remember: Francis is Italian.   

                                 RUDDY  
                             (to Evans)  
                        And that's key.  Having an Italian 
                        onboard.     

                                 EVANS  
                        I know that's the… 
                             (exacerbated)  
                        Having an Italian at the helm was my 
                        idea.   
                             (points out the window) 
                        But not that fucking Italian.  

           Coppola can be seen outside, looking around.      

                                 PETER 
                        Francis is cheap, Evans.  The guy is 
                        broke, okay.  Do you know how much 
                        money he owes Warner Brothers?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Maybe you should remind him, Peter.  
                        Because the arrogant way Coppola's 
                        carrying on, anyone would think Warner 
                        Brothers owes him money.   

                                 RUDDY  
                        Exactly.  Evans, the guy's like a 
                        third world country.  We can use that, 
                        push him around.  
                                 PETER  
                             (to Evans)  
                        It will be like "Love Story" where you 
                        can call the shots.         

           Against every nerve firing in his body:    

                                 EVANS  
                        Make the deal.   

                                                        JUMP TO: 

           Evans watches outside the window:  

           Peter shakes hands with Coppola.  Ruddy slaps Coppola on the 
           back.  Smiles all round.  Coppola waves over to Evans.  Taunting.    

           Evans responds w/the MIDDLE-FINGER.   

           A STUDIO SECRETARY enters:    

                                 STUDIO SECRETARY  
                        Mr. Evans?   

                                 EVANS  
                        I wish I wasn't.  

                                 SECRETARY  
                        New York’s on line one.  It's urgent.   

                                                        JUMP TO:  

           Evans punches line one.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Charlie?   

           INT.  BLUHDORN'S OFFICE, NYC – SAME  

           Bluhdorn is absolutely spent.  Over scene,  
           he drains a Pepto-Bismol bottle.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE)  
                        It's over, Evans.  

                                                       INTERCUT:  

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        What's over? 

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        The whole caboodle.  They're shutting 
                        you down and selling the studio.     

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Who is?   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Who else?  The board of directors.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        But you said you'd talk to them.   
                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        I did.  And they want me to do what I 
                        do: make money.  And I can't make any 
                        making pictures.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Charlie, I've just this second okayed 
                        a deal to make THE GODFATHER.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Un-okay it, Evans.  This time next 
                        week, Sound Stage 30 will be a parking 
                        lot.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        They can't.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        That's how it works, Evans: here 
                        today, fercockt tomorrow.  At least we 
                        tried.   

           Evans shuts his eyes.  His universe has just ended.   
           Then with new resolve:    

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Charlie, stall 'em.   

                                 BLUHDORN (INTO PHONE) 
                        What for?   

           CUT TO, over the SOUND OF AN AIRPLANE in flight: 

           EXT.  NYC – GULF + WESTERN BUILDING – TEN HOURS LATER 

           Bluhdorn's VOICE echoes like the voice of god over Manhattan’s 
           notorious traffic and honking horns.   

                                 BLUHDORN'S VOICE 
                        Evans, you're crazy.     

           INT.  GULF + WESTERN – CORRIDOR – SAME  

           Evans marches toward Bluhdorn with Peter who carries a CAN OF 
           FILM.  Evans and Peter look sleepless and disheveled.       

                                 BLUHDORN (CONT'D) 
                        Bananas.    

                                 EVANS  
                        They inside, Charlie?   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        Evans, the last mensch the board of 
                        directors wants to see is you.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Fuck 'em.  They're seeing me and more 
                        besides.     

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        It's a hundred-to-one shot you’ll 
                        change their minds.   
                                 EVANS  
                        I'm a big believer in upsets, Charlie.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        You better have more than hope, Evans, 
                        or you'll be back selling pants with 
                        your brother uptown.       

                                 EVANS  
                        Ready, Peter?    

                                 PETER  
                        Yeah, no; I'm barely here, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Same here.   
                             (then)  
                        To hell with it, preparedness is 
                        overrated.  

           Inside they go --    

           INT.  BOARDROOM – SAME  

           The double bank of seats is occupied by board members,  
           all men, all stuffy and dour.  Some smoke.     

           Evans takes position at the head of the table,  
           trying to be all ease and charm.      

                                 EVANS  
                        Good morning, gentlemen.  I uh, I 
                        apologize for not being better 
                        dressed.  But when you take the red-
                        eye and have no hotel room, it's not 
                        easy keeping up with the style of the 
                        room.   

           No laughter.  Not even a smile.  It just hangs there.   

           In a corner, Bluhdorn exhales sharply.   

           Peter pulls down a PROJECTOR SCREEN behind Evans.  He hurries 
           over to the PROJECTOR at the opposite end,  
           gesturing to Evans to "do something."  

                                 EVANS   
                        I uh, I understand that you're 
                        thinking about getting out of the 
                        moving making business.  

                                 BOARD MEMBER #1  
                        We are getting out of the moving 
                        making business. 

           Murmurs of agreement ripple.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Ah.  I see.   

           This is going to be a slow death.  Painful to watch.   
                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        Well, hand on heart, I can't blame 
                        you.  Paramount is number nine in 
                        Hollywood when there are only eight 
                        major studios.  
                              (pensive)  
                        It's just sad, is all.  What happened?  
                        Where did the golden age go?  
                              (beat)  
                        But you know what?  That's all self-
                        pitying bullshit.  Guys like me messed 
                        it all up.  We got too cocky.  Took 
                        our past successes for granted, when 
                        it takes ball-busting, nerve-wracking 
                        hard work, with a lotta luck mixed in, 
                        to make a good, enjoyable picture.           
                             (beat)  
                        And that's the end of it.   

           Just when it looks like Evans is about to depart:  

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        But it doesn't have to be the end.  We 
                        at Paramount have learned from our 
                        mistakes.  From here on in, the money 
                        we spend is not gonna be through 
                        extravagances; the money we spend is 
                        gonna be on the screen.  

           On cue, Peter FLICKS ON the projector while PUSHING a desk-
           button. This activates the drapes to close, darkening the room 
           with the exception of the magical projector.  

           This BEAM OF LIGHT flickers film dailies of Love Story onto the 
           screen and partially onto Evans as he speaks.  

           Ali looks young and radiantly beautiful.  Her co-star Ryan O'Neal 
           looks fresh and appealing.  Together they make an inviting 
           couple.       

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)     
                        One in particular is Love Story.  I 
                        think Love Story is gonna start a new 
                        trend in movies.  A trend towards the 
                        romantic, towards love...towards 
                        people.   
                             (beat)  
                        I think Love Story is going to bring 
                        the people back into the theater in 
                        droves.  I would also like to bring up 
                        another project, and that's The 
                        Godfather.  

           Images change to footage of bestseller lists:  
           Godfather tops them all.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        The Godfather and Love Story are the 
                        two biggest books of the last decade.  
                        Paramount owns them both.  If it 
                        weren't for Paramount, neither book 
                        would have been written.  We were in 
                        there in the beginning, and we would 
                        like to be there to the end, working 
                        closely with the cast and crew, to 
                        make these bestsellers the great 
                        movies they're going to be.   
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                        We at Paramount don't look at 
                        ourselves as passive backers of film.  
                        We look at ourselves as a creative 
                        force unto our self.  Trendsetters, 
                        not trend followers.  And that is why 
                        Paramount is going to be paramount in 
                        the industry in the seventies.   

           Evans stops.  The projector stops.  As the drapes open, letting 
           back in sunlight, Evans exits followed by Peter, leaving a 
           thoughtful silence in the air.   

           INT.  GULF + WESTERN FOYER – LATER  

           Evans and Peter wait quietly.   

           Bluhdorn's SHADOW looms over them.   

                                 BLUHDORN   
                        You're a bigger scam artist than I 
                        gave you credit for.   

                                 PETER  
                        Are we fired? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Is Paramount finished? 

           Bluhdorn BEAR-HUGS them both.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        You're some showman, Evans.     

                                 EVANS  
                        We're okay?   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        Go back to work, scam artists.  Make 
                        pictures, work hard, and may whatever 
                        god you believe in grant you mazel.   

           He breaks away for the elevators.     

                                 PETER  
                             (to Evans)  
                        I guess Mike Nichols' performance tips 
                        paid off.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Where was Nichols when I was a half-
                        assed actor? 

                                 PETER  
                        Now what?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Now... 

           EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO – ZOETROPE PICTURES – DAYS LATER    

                                 EVANS' VOICE (CONT'D)  
                        ...we get ourselves a script.  
           The sound of a TYPEWRITER CLACKING fills the air.  

           INT.  ZOETROPE – OFFICE – SAME  

           Coppola types using an OLIVETTI TYPEWRITER.  His fingers dance on 
           the keys like Debussy playing Deux Arabesque.   
           A hardback copy of The Godfather is open beside him.  

           Typewriter keys rap words onto a yellow page:   

           George Lucas enters.   

                                 LUCAS 
                        Started already? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Just the opening.   

           Lucas reads over typed pages.   

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)  
                             (smiling) 
                        What?  No good?   

                                 LUCAS  
                        No it's good, it’s good.   
                             (then)  
                        You're opening the movie with the 
                        wedding, huh? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It seems a good way to introduce 
                        everybody.   

           Lucas nods.  Smiles after reading: 

                                 LUCAS  
                        Yeah, the wedding's a great way to 
                        introduce the characters, all right.     
                             (then) 
                        But is it the right way to open the 
                        movie?   

           Coppola stops typing.  Intrigued by his friend's comment.     

                                 LUCAS  
                        A wedding has a lot of people, a lot 
                        of noise, it might be a bit sudden.  
                        You might need some kind of prologue.  
                        You had such a terrific beginning in 
                        "Patton."  Maybe you should come up 
                        with something just as unusual.  
           Coppola sits back.  The gears of his mind turning.    
           An EDITOR working on THX 1138 calls Lucas back.   

           Coppola picks up The Godfather.  Starts reading with a fresh 
           outlook.   

                    “All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera 
                    had trusted in law and order.”   

           Coppola underlines this, very important.    

                                                        JUMP TO:  

           Coppola murmurs to himself, reading p.29: 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        "The undertaker closed his eyes for a 
                        moment and then began to speak.  His 
                        voice was quiet, the voice he used to 
                        console the bereaved.  ‘I raised my 
                        daughter in the American fashion. I 
                        believe in America.’"  
                             (to himself) 
                        I believe in America.   

           Inspired, Coppola moseys into an adjoining --  

           INT.  A STUDY – SAME 

           Here sits the author himself, MARIO PUZO.  A portly, supremely 
           intelligent, lovable guy, puffing on a cigar, reviewing the 
           horseracing page.    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Mario…?  You busy?   

                                 MARIO  
                        H'm?  Me?  No.  What’cha need? 

           Said putting away the sports page, embarrassed.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I was reading your book again, you 
                        know, and I was thinking and thinking 
                        and thinking about the opening of the 
                        movie.   

                                 MARIO  
                        Okay.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And um, and I think we should actually 
                        stay close to the book and open with 
                        the undertaker's story.    

                                 MARIO  
                        Bonasera?  But I thought you wanted to 
                        open at the wedding?    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I do and we still can, with Bonasera 
                        having a private audience in Don 
                        Corleone's office.   

           Puzo's eyes light up -- an idea, an opportunity. 
           Our VIEW slowly isolates Coppola as he explains himself.  Scene 
           is reminiscent of when Michael lays out his plan to kill 
           Sollozzo, both men are coming out on their own.         

                                 COPPOLA (CONT'D)  
                        Bonasera came to America thinking he 
                        left the old world behind him.  Only 
                        to discover that America has failed to 
                        live up to its promise.  Class 
                        prejudice, inequality, injustice -- 
                        they exist here as any where else.  So 
                        to make things right with himself and 
                        his family, Bonasera has to revert 
                        back to the old traditions: patronage; 
                        protection; vengeance.  And America's 
                        failure to overcome these mistakes is 
                        what defines and fuels the Don's 
                        power.      
                             (beat)  
                        What'd you think?   

           Mario can only stare back.  Speechless.    

           SCENE BECOMES A SERIES OF DISSOLVES  

              of Coppola and Mario collaborating over pool...working 
              separately... taking a break, playing dice.

           a young, thoughtful MARTIN SHEEN, long-haired, moustache,

                        They tried to kill him, my father.  
                        They did.  They nearly did.  Mr. uh…

                        Mr. Brasi went after them.

           TEST CAMERA POV:  a film clapper snaps and reveals --  

           a young, very unsure of himself Al Pacino.  Alone in a chair, 
           tense and tight, unsure of everything.  

                                 AL PACINO AS MICHAEL  
                        The story goes that he killed six men 
                        in two weeks.   

           Comes out of character.  Speaks directly to our OFF SCREEN 
           Coppola, while shifting awkwardly in his chair.         

                                 AL PACINO (CONT'D) 
                        S--so I'm not saying it like, Sonny, 
                        you know, and say, "Sonny" you know, 
                        or "Freddy, come here; I'd like you to 
                        meet…" I'm not doing that.  

                                 COPPOLA (O.S.) 
                        Michael isn't sure how far to go.  So 
                        he does it in this very indirect 
                        way... 
                                 COPPOLA (O.S.)  (CONT’D)  
                        He doesn't say, "Lookit, my father is 
                        a criminal, a gangster, who's been 
                        shot."  So he kinda instead tells her 
                        little anecdotes.      

                                 AL PACINO  
                        Okay. 

                                 COPPOLA (O.S.) 
                        So at first it's nice.  Even when 
                        you're uh -- it's lighter.  But the 
                        scene is a serious scene.   

                                 AL PACINO  
                        Okay.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        So you wanna go again?   

                                 AL PACINO  
                             (forcing himself)  
                        Let's do it.   

           INT.  EVANS' OFFICE, LA – DAYS LATER 

           Al Pacino's real-life screen tests play on a DROP-DOWN SCREEN.  
           Evans and Peter are eyes-glued.  Coppola looks happy & excited 
           about his new find.    

                                 EVANS  
                        Who's the dark midget?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Al.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Who's Al?  

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Al Pacino.   

                                 PETER 
                        Who? 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        He's new, he's done some Broadway and 
                        uh--   

                                 PETER 
                        Why's he reading for Michael Corleone?     

                                 EVANS 
                             (to Coppola)   
                        Why's he reading at all?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Isn't it obvious? 

                                 EVANS  
                        No.   

                                 PETER  
                             (to Coppola)  
                        Not to me.   
                                 COPPOLA  
                        Al is Michael Corleone.   

                                 EVANS  
                        He's what? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Look at that face and tell me Al's not 
                        Michael Corleone.   

           Evans looks at Pacino.  Then back at Coppola.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Al's not Michael Corleone.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Have you read the book? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Have I read it?  I bought the darn 
                        thing, Francis, before it was even 
                        written.  

                                 PETER  
                             (cutting in) 
                        Francis --?  Francis --?  I've gone 
                        with you on everything so far -- true?  
                        But I have to admit I'm leaning toward 
                        Evans on this--      

           Coppola cuts in by reading aloud The Godfather: 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        "Michael Corleone," he uh, yeah, "He 
                        was handsome in a delicate way."   
                             (re: Pacino)  
                        There.  There is "handsome in a 
                        delicate way" personified.  

           A pensive silence. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Ryan O'Neal.  That's Michael Corleone.     

                                 PETER  
                        O'Neal's too WASPy.   

                                 EVANS  
                        O'Neal's Irish.   

                                 PETER  
                        Park Avenue Irish.  Not Queens Irish.     

           Coppola watches this exchange, baffled.     

                                 EVANS  
                        O'Neal was born to play Michael.     

                                 PETER  
                        Redford would be better.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Redford isn't in "Love Story."  O'Neal 
                        is.   
                                 COPPOLA  
                             (dry)  
                        A blonde, blue-eyed Michael Corleone?   

                                 EVANS  
                        There are blonde, blue-eyes in 
                        Northern Italy.  

           Coppola becomes increasingly exacerbated:  

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Sicily isn't in Northern Italy.      

                                 PETER 
                        Mario describes Carlo Ricci as blonde 
                        and blue-eyed in the book.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Because Carlo Ricci is from Northern 
                        Italy on his mother's side.   

                                 EVANS  
                        There you go.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        There I go what?  

                                 PETER 
                        I think we're getting off point.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        What is the point?   

                                 EVANS  
                        That we need star power.  And plenty 
                        of it.  Charlie wants girls to scream 
                        at premiers.  And right now Ryan 
                        O'Neal is the only magnet we have.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Girls?  Screaming?  For a mob picture?     

                                 EVANS  
                        When it comes to Charlie Bluhdorn, 
                        Francis, the bottom line is the bottom 
                        line. So don't go supposing you can 
                        click your auteur heels and fly on 
                        back to sunny Frisco if this picture 
                        goes pear-shaped.  Because if we –- 
                        and mentally note, we –- if we fail to 
                        put asses on seats, it'll be our asses 
                        on the block.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (insisting) 
                        Then okay Al Pacino as Michael 
                        Corleone. 

                                 EVANS  
                             (insisting back)  
                        That gutter rat has no star power.     
                                 COPPOLA  
                        Al Pacino is America personified.  He 
                        has the facial features of the Old 
                        World while still looking like the 
                        authentic brand of an Ivy Leaguer.  
                        That means when Al's wandering around 
                        Sicily with the shepherds, he'll still 
                        look like the part: an Anglo-Saxon-
                        Catholic in exile.   
                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)  
                        And that authenticity is what will 
                        attract asses into seats.         

           Evans sits back, worn out.  Just when Coppola, just as tired, 
           thinks he’s won --    

                                 EVANS  
                        What about Burt Reynolds for Michael?     

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Ohh, I'm gonna shoot myself.   

                                 PETER  
                        Alright, alright, let's, I don't know, 
                        let's table Michael for the time 
                        being.  What about his girlfriend, his 
                        wife, what’s her name?  Kay?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I haven't tested anyone for Kay yet.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You mightn’t have to.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I'm not casting your wife as Kay.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I wasn't thinking of Ali; she's not 
                        WASPy enough.  But I know someone who 
                        might be.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Is she in LA?     

                                 EVANS  
                        Actually, she's in San Francisco.  
                        Filming a different picture.   

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – DAYS LATER 

           TEST CAMERA POV: FILM CLAPPER SNAPS AND REVEALS -- 

           Real-life JAMES CAAN in a military uniform, auditioning  
           for Michael, adding a cheekiness to the character.    
           He plays against real-life DIANE KEATON. 

                                 CAAN AS MICHAEL 
                        But uh, Mr. Brasi went after them.  
                        And so the story goes that he killed 
                        six men in two weeks.   

                                 KEATON AS KAY 
                        You're trying to scare me.  You don't 
                        want me to marry you.   
           Keaton's eyes change, more into the scene, more seductive as we, 
           IN A TRICK-JUMP CUT, reveal that Keaton is now auditioning with 
           Pacino.    

                                 KEATON AS KAY (CONT'D)  
                        That's very clever.  But, it's not 
                        going to work.

                        Okay, so?  You like Diane? 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        I loved her in "Lovers and Other 
                        Strangers."   

                                 PETER  
                        Diane was great in that.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And she'll be greater in this if she 
                        plays opposite Al.   

                                 EVANS 
                        I hope this “Al” refers to someone 
                        other that this Pacino midget.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Look at Diane.  Look at her reaction 
                        to Al.  Look at Al's reaction to 
                        Diane. 

                                 EVANS  
                        What reaction?  I don't see anything.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        They like each other.   

                                 EVANS  
                        And may their romance together be 
                        happy and long.  But this Pacino guy, 
                        I don't know.     

           Then out of no where:    

                                 ALI 
                        He undresses you with his eyes.   

           Everyone turns to her.   

                                 ALI (CONT'D) 
                        Pacino.  His eyes work you over.     

                                 COPPOLA 
                             (excited) 
                        That's what my wife said.  Exactly 
                        that and exactly like that. 
                             (then to himself)  
                        Or was it George' wife who said it?     
           Evans and Peter turn back to Ali.   

                                 ALI 
                        It's true. 

           An ASSISTANT sticks her head in the door.  

                                 ASSISTANT  
                        Barbara Streisand called about the 
                        casting of the step-brother again for 
                        "On a Clear Day."    

                                 EVANS 
                             (to Peter)   
                        God.  Three months and they still 
                        haven't found a suitable guy.   

           Peter shrugs.   

                                 ASSISTANT  
                        And producer Howard Koch has called 
                        three times.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Why?     

                                 ASSISTANT  
                        He wants to replace Elaine May. 

                                 PETER  
                        Again?   

                                 ASSISTANT  
                        She refuses to show him or anyone her 
                        rough cut.     

           Evans goes to respond when -- 

                                 ALI  
                        Oh no.  I'm not going to the doctor 
                        again on my own.  No, sir.  

           Evans exhales, too tired to fight any longer.    

                                 EVANS 
                             (to Coppola)  
                        Fine, yeah, okay -- Francis, Pacino 
                        can be Michael. 
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                             (to Peter)  
                        Call his agent.   

           EXT.  WEST HOLLYWOOD – MORNING  

           Peter exits a deli with PACINO'S AGENT busy eating a bagel.     

                                 PACINO'S AGENT  
                        You can't have Pacino.   

                                 PETER  
                        Why not?   

                                 PACINO'S AGENT  
                        I'm after signing Pacino up to a flick 
                        at MGM.   
                                 PETER  
                        What flick at Metro? 

                                 PACINO'S AGENT 
                        Talk to Jim Aubrey, it's his flick.     

                                 PETER  
                        You talk to Jim Aubrey.  Pacino needs 
                        this part more than air. 

                                 PACINO'S AGENT  
                        What Pacino needs and what I need are 
                        two very different things.  And I need 
                        to keep in with MGM boss Jim Aubrey.   

           Walks off, food in his mouth.   

           INT.  BISTRO RESTAURANT – LUNCH  

           Peter joins Evans and Ali, they're in the middle of  
           their Caesar's salads.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Pacino's agent said that? 

                                 PETER  
                        That's what he said.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I can't believe it.

                        I thought you'd be happy.   

                                 ALI  
                             (to Evans)  
                        If it gets out that another studio 
                        stole an actor right from under you, 
                        you'll look weak when you're already 
                        looking weak.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (snapping) 
                        I know that.   

           This commotion attracts unwanted attention from Patrons.

                             (hurt) 
                        I was only trying to help.   

           Evans cups her hand apologetically:  

                                 EVANS  
                        I know.  
                             (kisses her) 
                        Sorry.      
                             (refocusing)  
                        I need a phone.

                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE)  
                        Sidney, I love you, you know I love 
                        you, but I can’t involve myself.

                        Kirk, you own the studio.   

                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE)  
                        But I don’t run the studio, Sidney.  I 
                        promised Jim Aubrey when I hired him: 
                        no interference.   

                                 KORSHAK (INTO PHONE)  
                             (being amiable)  
                        I understand, Kirk; I understand.     

                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE)  
                        Anything else and I would do it.   

                                 KORSHAK (INTO PHONE)  
                        I know.  No problem.  Forget about it.     
                             (then)  
                        So uh, how's the hotel business 
                        treating ya?     

           Kerkorian visibly senses a rat.   
                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE)  
                        Good.  Yeah.  Good. 

                                 KORSHAK (INTO PHONE) 
                             (suggestive)  
                        Construction on schedule?   

                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE)  
                        Yeah.  Well, you know. 

                                 KORSHAK (INTO PHONE)  
                        I do know, Kirk.  One delay and costs 
                        spiral, budgets overrun.  The whole 
                        project can become a terrible dilemma.    

                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Yeah that, that's true.   

                                 KORSHAK (INTO PHONE)  
                        But avoidable if handled right.  I can 
                        help if you like.  You know I 
                        represent their bosses, right?     

           Kerkorian makes a face.  Then:   

                                 KERKORIAN (INTO PHONE)  
                        Sidney, what uh, what was that actor's 
                        name again? 

           INT.  EVANS' OFFICE, LA – MINUTES LATER  

           Evans enters to be met with -- 

                                 SECRETARY 
                        James Aubrey wants to talk to you.   

           Evans takes possession of the phone.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)  
                        Jim?

                        I'll get you for this, Evans.

                             (confused)   
                        Jim, I-- 

                                 AUBREY (INTO PHONE) 
                        You can have this Pa-chin-o or 
                        Pinocchio or whatever the hell this 
                        nothing-nobody actor is called.  

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        I can?  Oh Jim that's-- 

                                 AUBREY (INTO PHONE) 
                        But know this, asshole: when I'm 
                        through getting even with you, you'll 
                        be back auditioning for Matador parts.  
                        Fucker.  
           He SLAMS down the phone and we return to FULL SCREEN on: 

                                 EVANS  
                             (to Secretary)  
                        Call Peter Bart.  Tell him to call 
                        Francis Coppola and tell him Pacino is 
                        a go.  And send Sidney Korshak a case 
                        of Dom's.  Better make it two cases.  

           SOUND OF: baby noises, from Evans’ office.   

           Evans goes to investigate.  Puzzled.   

           INT.  EVANS’ OFFICE – SAME  

           Evans’ BABY SON JOSHUA is in his chair, semi-sitting, semi-
           slumped over.   

           Joshua coos and smiles at his dad.   
           Evans smiles broadly with pure delight.     

                                 EVANS 
                             (softly)  
                        Hey…hey, what are you doing here?  
                        H’mm?   

           He starts SPINNING THE CHAIR. Going slowly.    
           Joshua makes happy noises. Giggles.  His eyes shine.   

           Sensing something, Evans looks over -- 
           Ali is sitting on the couch.  Enjoying the exchange of loving 
           warmth. 

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                        Well, hi.   

                                 ALI  
                        You look happy for once.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (playing with Joshua’s 
                             head)  
                        Of course I am.  My handsome son is 
                        sitting behind my desk.  And my wife 
                        is looking more beautiful today than 
                        yesterday.   

                                 ALI  
                             (joining him)  
                        I’m fat.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh sweetie, please.  You’ll lose that 
                        in a month.   

                                 ALI  
                        Guess who I ran into at the store.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Don’t know.  Who?   

                                 ALI  
                        Orson Welles.   
                             (beat)  
                        He wants to read for Vito Corleone.    
           EXT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIOS BACKLOT – DAYS LATER  

           Coppola follows Evans and Peter.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Orson Welles, huh?        

                                 PETER 
                        Good news, right?    

                                 EVANS  
                        You know who'd be my dream actor for 
                        Vito Corleone.  Carlo Ponti.   

           This jars Coppola.  Doesn't like where this is going.   

                                 PETER 
                        Sophie Lauren's Carlo Ponti? 

                                 EVANS    
                        Carlo would be marvelous.  

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (announcing)     
                        Mario Puzo thinks Marlon Brando would 
                        be perfect as Vito.     

           Evans and Peter halt abruptly. 

                                 COPPOLA (CONT'D)  
                        Mario even sent him a letter.  And get 
                        this: Brando's interested.       

           Evans glares accusingly at Peter.   

                                 PETER  
                        Hey this is all him, don’t look at me.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I will look at you.   
                             (re: Coppola) 
                        You brought this hurricane into my 
                        life.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I was originally going for Laurence 
                        Olivier, because he almost looks like 
                        the mobster Vito Genovese, who Mario 
                        used as a basis for Don Corleone.  But 
                        I think Mario's own choice might be on 
                        the money.       

                                 EVANS  
                             (snide)  
                        That's what you think, huh?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Who's America's answer to Laurence 
                        Olivier?  Brando.   
           Evans flashes his fierce side, a junk-yard dog: 

                                 EVANS  
                        I'm gonna lay it on the line for you 
                        this one time: you mention that name 
                        again in my presence -- you're out!  

           Coppola goes to respond when he stops himself, suddenly inspired.  
           He starts writing on his notebook -- sudden, odd behavior.  

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        What, what are you… 
                             (to Peter) 
                        What's he writing? 

           INSERT Coppola's writing:  

                     Let me lay it on the line for you and 
                     your boss, whoever he is.  Johnny 
                     Fontane will never get that movie! 

           EXT.  EVANS' HOME – DAYS LATER      

           Evans plays tennis with Ali.   
           Coppola harasses him from the umpire's chair.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Orson Wells would be terrific as The 
                        Don.  So would Ernest Borgnine.  
                        Edward G. Robinson.  Anthony Quinn.  
                        George C. Scott, even.  But Brando 
                        would be better than any of them.   

           Evans stops, annoyed.  The BALL bounces past him.   

                                 ALI  
                        Game!    

           She waits for some accolade wearing a playful smile.  Instead:   

                                 EVANS 
                             (to Coppola)  
                        The studio is struggling to stay 
                        afloat and you want us to okay another 
                        Queimada? 

           Ali rolls her eyes and returns to the base line to receive Evans’ 
           serve.        

                                 COPPOLA  
                        But I can control Brando -- I know I 
                        can.   

                                 EVANS 
                        As long as I live and breathe at 
                        Paramount, Francis, Marlon Brando will 
                        never appear in this motion picture or 
                        any Paramount motion picture.    

           Serves with a FEROCIOUS SWING and GRUNT.   

                                 ALI (O.S.)  
                        Ow!  

           Evans winces, apoplectically.    
           INT.  BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT – DAYS LATER 

           Coppola pesters Evans while he's busy having lunch with Japanese 
           investors, who look unsure about what's happening.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Brando is the greatest living actor.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Francis, I'm in the middle of a 
                        luncheon.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Don't believe me Brando's every 
                        actor's hero, ask anyone.   

                                 EVANS  
                        A bloated, passé down-&-outer would be 
                        more accurate, Francis.      

           Coppola stops a waiter.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Quick.  Who's the greatest actor? 

                                 WAITER  
                        Uh, the guy on the motorbike.  In “The 
                        Wild One.”     

                                 EVANS  
                        Francis…? 
                             (calm & measured) 
                        Fuck off and die.   

           A hushed silence falls.  Coppola -- get this -- collapses right 
           to the floor like a bag of bricks.  Beyond exhausted.  This 
           naturally attracts wide-eyed attention of patrons and waiters.    

           Evans chuckles to himself in spite of himself.   
           Turns to his very-confused lunch guests.      

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        This is what you get when you order 
                        Italian, gentlemen.  Nothing but 
                        drama.   

           Coppola goes on bended knee:

                        I am bringing you brilliant casting 
                        choices -- and you won't even let me 
                        pursue it?   

                                 EVANS  
                        All right, Francis; all right.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        You'll let me cast Brando? 

                                 EVANS  
                        I'll let you have your chance to test 
                        Brando – if - if, number one, he does 
                        the screen test for nothing.   
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                        If, this is number two, if the man-
                        child puts up a bond guaranteeing that 
                        if he pulls any of his Mutiny of the 
                        Bounty shenanigans we will be 
                        reimbursed for any overruns -- 
                        immediately.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        No argument.  Thank you, Evans.  Thank 
                        you.   

           He goes to leave.  Delighted with life.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh and Francis?     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Yeah?   

                                 EVANS  
                        I have a third condition.  Brando must 
                        do the picture for nothing.     

           Coppola's jaw drops -- what???!!!  Evans smiles back at him as he 
           forks food into his mouth, smug and triumphant. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Get outta that one, smart guy.     

           EXT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – DAYS LATER 

           We can see Coppola inside... 

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – SAME  

           ...pacing around nervously.  Everyone looks tense and quiet.   
           Coppola's wife Eleanor rushes in.      

                                 ELEANOR  
                        He's here.   

           Attention falls on the door.  Approaching footsteps, the sound of 
           spurs from cowboy boots.   

           Coppola and Co. are frozen.     

           A SILHOUETTE OF A TALL MAN appears, big in build.   
           We don’t see him, but we know this can only be one person: MARLON 
           BRANDO. 

           EXT.  BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT – DAY LATER  

           A young JACK NICHOLSON, beaming a half-cheeky, devilish, Brando-
           like smile.   

           He sits opposite Evans, who looks puzzled and perplexed by the 
           young, as yet unknown actor facing him.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Well, the flick is a romance musical.  
                        The director, Judy Garland's former-
                        hubby.  The star, a cabaret diva.   
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                        Now um, they're already in production, 
                        you would just have to… 
                             (finally)  
                        Hey?  You feeling okay? 

           Nicholson simply nods, remaining silent and smiley.   
           Both bizarre and unnerving.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        Anyway, we're uh, we're looking for a 
                        certain, I don't know, a type.  Rodger 
                        Corman dropped your name, so uh, all 
                        goes well, there'll be ten grand in it 
                        for ya.  Should be only a few weeks 
                        work… 

           Nicholson keeps on smiling.  

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        Okay, okay, what, what is this? 

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        What'd you mean?  What's what?   

                                 EVANS  
                        "What's what?"  What's this?  You.  
                        Why aren't saying anything?  Why are 
                        you just smiling all the time?   

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        Can I talk to you straight, pal?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Please.  Do.  Pal.   

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        We don't know each other, but um, I 
                        just directed a movie which didn't do 
                        too well.  I'm also starring in a 
                        movie that's doing better critically 
                        speaking, but it ain't exactly setting 
                        the box office alight, neither.  Um…  
                              (then)  
                        Are you married?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Happily.   

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        Well I got myself an ex-wife, see, as 
                        well as a beautiful baby daughter, so 
                        that means alimony and it means child 
                        support.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Welcome to modern living.   

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        Yeah but that's the point I'm getting 
                        at, see?   

                                 EVANS  
                        I can't see a thing past your weird, 
                        big smile.  
                                 NICHOLSON  
                        I need fifteen grand to keep moving in 
                        this modern world.  Because, let's 
                        face it, the way taxes and prices are 
                        today, ten grand ain't gonna do it for 
                        me, you understand?     

           Evans doesn't know whether to laugh or flame out.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Tell me something.   

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        Anything.   

                                 EVANS  
                        How does a guy like you get off 
                        talking like that to a guy like me? 

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        Well, gee pal, you know, I'm Irish; 
                        so, I got something on my mind, I get 
                        it out there.  I mean what else am I 
                        gonna do with it?     

           Evans just stares, open-mouthed.  Can't believe this guy.   
           Thinks this over.  Just when we think he's about to tell this guy 
           to hit the bricks he says:  

                                 EVANS  
                        How about twelve and a half? 

                                 NICHOLSON  
                        Grand? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Yeah.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You mean it? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Yeah.   

           Nicholson SLAPS the table with delight:  

                                 NICHOLSON 
                        Hot doggone it.  You don't know what 
                        this means to me, pal; you don't know 
                        how this helps me.  I won't ever 
                        forget it.     

           Peter appears with Coppola.   

                                 PETER  
                        Evans… 

                                 EVANS  
                        Hey, Peter.  Watch yourself around 
                        this Irishman.  He'll swipe the cream 
                        from your coffee.   

                                 PETER  
                             (insistent)  
                        Evans… 
                                 EVANS  
                        What?   

                                 PETER  
                        It's Brando.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh what the Christ?  From one maniac 
                        Irishman to the next.  What's Brando 
                        done now? 

           INT.  NYC – BLUHDORN'S OFFICE – DAY LATER  

           Bluhdorn takes two calls at once, a receiver on each ear.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                             (to phone line #1)  
                        I think three dollars a share is fair 
                        -- so offer a buck fifty.  That's 
                        right, I'm buying the only way I know 
                        how to buy: cheaply.      
                             (into phone line #2)  
                        And you.  I told you to buy South 
                        Puerto Rico Sugar at five eights of a 
                        point.  No buts -- buy South Puerto 
                        Rico Sugar at five eights of a point.   

           He SLAMS down both phones.

           Office doors open.  Evans, Peter and Coppola march in.

                        Uh, Charlie… 

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        Don't Charlie me, Evans.  If it's bad 
                        news, out with it immediately. 

           Inspired, Coppola quickly jots down in his notebook:

                                 EVANS  
                        A casting quandary has arisen 
                        regarding Vito Corleone.

                        You know what I do with quandaries, 
                        Evans?  I deal with them "as a cleaver 
                        deals with meat." 

                                 EVANS  
                             (to Coppola)  
                        Show him.

           A clanky PROJECTOR starts up.   
           Bluhdorn and the others watch the real-life BRANDO SCREEN TEST on 
           a drop-down screen.     

                                 BLUHDORN  
                             (aghast)  
                        Is that, is that who I think it is?   

                                 EVANS  
                        It is.       

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        No.  No way.  Never, never -- 

           Cuts himself off, watching Brando fiddle w/props & makeup.     

                                 BLUHDORN (CONT'D)  
                        What's he saying?    

                                 EVANS  
                        Keep watching, Charlie.  Keep, keep 
                        watching. 

           Brando turns around…then after a moment faces the camera with 
           rolled-up Kleenex tissues into both cheeks.  Smiles.     

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        That mick is incredible -- incredible.  
                        He looks like an olt' guinea.     

           Evans sees Coppola smiling triumphantly only at him.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (whispering) 
                        Smile now, fuck-face.  I'll get you 
                        the next time.   

           Everyone watches Brando's self-transformation -- his new walk 
           with a limp, developing new, impromptu mannerisms.

           FILM CAMERA POV:  we are watching the real-life actor SALVATORE 
           CORSITTO as Bonasera over the shoulder of Marlon Brando as Vito 
           Corleone  

                                 CORSITTO AS BONASERA  
                        America has made my fortune.   

           As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to tighten on 
           Corsitto, as opposed to pulling back like the movie.   

                                 CORSITTO AS BONASERA  
                        And I raised my daughter in the 
                        American fashion.  I gave her freedom 
                        -– but, I taught her never to dishonor 
                        her family.  

           View lands in CLOSE, when: 

                                 COPPOLA (O.S.) 
                        Okay, that's where we need to open.  
                        Tight on Bonasera.   

           Reveal Coppola conferring with his cinematographer GORDON WILLIS.  
           Actors do their own personal rehearsals while receiving makeup.   

                                 COPPOLA (CONT'D)   
                        His tormented, anguished face needs to 
                        fill the screen.  Then as he tells his 
                        story, we do a pull back,  

                                 WILLIS 
                        Well by my count, Bonasera's speech or 
                        monologue is nearly three minute long.  

           Shows a stopwatch to the cameraman, TONY KARP, busy fiddling 
           around with a special-looking MOVIE CAMERA.    

                                 WILLIS (CONT’D) 
                        What do you think, Tony?  

                                 TONY KARP  
                        The computerized lens will give you 
                        the smooth pull-back you want.   

           Said tinkering around a RECTANGULAR BOX under the lens, which 
           holds the motor and gears.   

                                 TONY KARP (CONT'D)  
                        We can program where the lens needs to 
                        be at the required time.   

           A CAT purrs up against Coppola's leg, distracting him.    

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Whose cat is that? 

                                 WILLIS  
                        I heard someone say it's a stray.   

           Coppola picks up the cat and absently-mindedly places him in an 
           unseen Brando's lap.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Here, Marlon.   
           BRANDO’S HANDS play with the cat, cradling him, rolling him 
           around in his hands.  
           CUE CARDS with dialogue are everywhere.   

                                 WILLIS  
                             (to his crew)  
                        Let's get an overhead light over 
                        Marlon.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Easy on the light.  The room needs to 
                        be dark.   

                                 WILLIS 
                        How dark?  Because I like to go pretty 
                        dark.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Then go nuts because we want this 
                        scene to sharply contrast with... 

           EXT.  STATEN ISLAND – GODFATHER SET – WEEKS LATER  

           HIGH ANGLE ON: wedding scene, set-up and rehearsals.  Big and 
           bright.   

                                 COPPOLA'S VOICE (CONT'D) 
                        ...the wedding scene.   

           Coppola finishes up with Willis and his team.  

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Vito Corleone's business dealings 
                        inside his dark office pay for this 
                        bright and deluxe affair.  That's what 
                        we want to show: the fusion of 
                        business with family.  Evil and good.       

           SCENE BECOMES A SERIES OF SCENES  

           Showing Coppola, via FORREST-GUMP-like composite cinematography, 
           directing the Wedding Cast, a large motley group, or conferring 
           with Willis about camera shots, or reviewing budgets with the 
           Production Designer.   

           END ON:  

           Ruddy stepping up to Coppola.  Excited.     

                                 RUDDY  
                        Francis -- ?  Ain't he perfect?   

           Said motioning over to a hulk of a guy in a wedding tux, seated 
           alone, in the distance.   
           This is the one and only LENNY MONTANA, aka, Luca Brasi.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                             (intimidated)   
                        For what?    

                                 RUDDY  
                        Who else?  Luca Brasi.  Ain't he Luca 
                        or ain't he Luca? 
           Coppola warms to the idea.  Lenny is in his own world, intently 
           talking to himself.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Yeah.  Yeah, he is a Luca Brasi.   
                             (then)  
                        What’s he doing?   

                                 RUDY  
                        Practicing his lines.  Poor guy’s 
                        nervous about meeting Marlon, he wants 
                        to impress.       

                                 COPPOLA  
                        He ever acted before?   

                                 RUDY 
                        Some wrestling.  You gotta know how to 
                        act when ya wrestle.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        He wrestled on TV? 

                                 RUDY 
                        Riker's Island.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Riker's, the prison? 

                                 RUDDY  
                        Okay, look, don’t freak out but Lenny 
                        was a solider in the Colombo family.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        The Colombo crime family? 

                                 RUDDY  
                        The guy’s hoping for a career change.           

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Please tell me he hasn't killed 
                        anyone.   

                                 RUDDY  
                        Well, um… 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Ruddy… 

           Cuts himself off, inspired by Lenny practicing his lines.   

                                 RUDDY  
                             (not noticing)  
                        New York's a tough town, Francis.  
                        It's not prim and proper like where 
                        you grew up in "West Egg F. Scott 
                        Fitzgerald" country.       

                                 COPPOLA 
                             (not listening)  
                        Gordi --?   

                                 WILLIS  
                        Yeah?     
                                 COPPOLA  
                        Grab a camera.    
                             (to staff)  
                        Bring over Diane and Al.  Quick.  And 
                        bring them some food.     

                                                        JUMP TO: 

           CAMERA POV: filming real-life Diane and Pacino as Kay and Michael 
           respectively.  They notice Lenny reciting his lines.    

           INT.  EVANS' BEDROOM – DAYS LATER  

           Evans watches the rushes from his bed.  He bounces his baby son 
           with both hands while talking to Peter on the phone, the receiver 
           held up by a BUTLER decked out in a P.G. Wodehouse-like Jeeves 
           uniform.     

                                 PACINO AS MICHAEL (ON SCREEN) 
                        You like your lasagna?   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        I hate it.   

           SPLIT SCREEN TO REVEAL: 

           Peter in a Paramount Studios office.  Resting the phone receiver 
           oh his shoulder because he's busy organizing and shuffling script 
           coverage reports with two secretaries.     

                                 PETER (INTO PHONE) 
                        You hate it?  All of it?  

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        I hate Pacino.  I hate the wedding.  I 
                        hate Pacino.   

                                 PETER (INTO PHONE) 
                        But do you like Pacino?   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        It’s the whole thing.  It’s not what I 
                        thought it would be.  

                                 PETER (INTO PHONE) 
                        What you think it would be? 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        I don't know -- not this.   

                                 PETER (INTO PHONE) 
                        It is interesting in parts.  

           Ali hurries into the bedroom, holding up baby JOSH.  He is 
           wearing new baby clothes. 

                                 ALI 
                        Evans, look.  Look what I bought Josh.  
                        Doesn’t he look so cute?   

           Evans’ gaze never leaves The Godfather dailies:  
                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        It's too ethnic. 

           Ali frowns.  Looks at Josh, and he stares back, cooing.  

                                 PETER (INTO PHONE) 
                        It's colorful. 

                                 EVANS  
                             (to butler)  
                        When you look at the screen, what'd 
                        you think, David?   

                                 BUTLER  
                        Not my sort of people, sir.  

           Evans salutes his coffee cup in agreement.     

                                 EVANS  
                        WASP rage.  But where’s our parade?             

           Ali realizes that Evans is ignoring her and Josh.   

                                 ALI  
                        Sorry we disturbed you.   
                             (then)  
                        Oh.  Evans?  You’re Jewish.     

           She and Josh depart.   

                                 EVANS  
                        What’s that supposed to mean?         
                             (into phone)  
                        No, no, Peter, not you.  One sec. 
                             (calling out to Ali)  
                        Ali?   
                             (beat)  
                        Ali -- ? 

           SOUND OF: a door slamming closed. 
           Evans lowers his gaze. Unhappy.   
           Peter’s voice attracts his attention.    

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)  
                        When um, when is Francis gonna make 
                        this Pacino actually do something?   

                                 PETER (INTO PHONE) 
                        I was wondering about that myself.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        What're they shooting now? 

           INT.  LONG ISLAND, NY – GODFATHER SET – DAY  

           We are on the famous Guggenheim estate, the living room, made up 
           to be the famous Woltz bedroom. 

           We find Coppola, Willis and crew huddled over the famous HORSE'S 
           HEAD.  Only it looks old and dusty.  Hard to tell if it's real or 
           a fake.  By the way, everyone is sweating from the scorching 
           heat.     

                                 COPPOLA 
                        What's that?   
                                 PRODUCTION DESIGNER  
                        That's what the dog company sent us.  

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It looks like Mr. Ed.  

                                 WILLIS  
                        We can't use that.   

                                 STUDIO HENCHMAN  
                        Tick-tock, gentlemen.  Dollars and 
                        cents are disappearing here.     

           Just the sound of this guy’s voice gives Coppola and his crew a 
           bout of anxiety.  They all exchange a knowing look of weariness, 
           starting to really hate this guy.

                        Yeah.

                        place the head in front of John when

           We break away to find a TECHNICIAN talking on a telephone.   

                                 TECHNICIAN (INTO PHONE) 
                        Well now they're doing a scene about 
                        putting the frights on some bigwig 
                        from Hollywood...   

           INT.  LITTLE ITALY, NYC – DELI/COFFEE SHOP – SAME  

           CAESAR is the other caller, a tough and rough guy in his forties, 
           a genuine Mafioso.  His silk suit sharply contrasts against his 
           coarse facial features, like he's been in numerous fights over 
           the years.   

                                 TECHNICIAN'S VOICE (OVER PHONE) 
                        ...Like we had to when that studio guy 
                        ignored Frank's telegrams; remember? 
                                  CAESAR (INTO PHONE) 
                        I get what you're getting at.  

                                 TECHNICIAN'S VOICE (OVER PHONE)  
                        Don't forget me, babe.   

                                 CAESAR (INTO PHONE)  
                        Yeah yeah yeah, kid; yeah.   

           Hangs up.  Takes up a tray of coffees and donuts.  Goes to leave, 
           when he sees an unpeeled ITALIAN LEAGUE STICKER on the counter.   

           Throws a glance at the OWNER, a fellow Italian-American.     

           Taking the hint-slash-veiled threat, the owner STICKS it on the 
           glass to the main door. 

           Caesar, satisfied, goes to leave, when he stops at the door, 
           waiting.     

           The owner opens the door like a doorman.   
           Caesar heads out -- 

           EXT.  LITTLE ITALY STREET – SAME  

           Caeser shoulders his way through through a massive gathering for 
           "Italian-American Unity Day."  A big, busy, noisy rally.  

           American and Italian FLAGS are held aloft.   
           A banner reads:   

                          ITALIAN AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHT LEAGUE 

           A small, stocky, immaculately-dressed MAN addresses the crowd 
           from an elevated platform with fiery passion. 

                                 JOE COLOMBO  
                        We represent good, we do good, we are 
                        good.  We will absorb anything, fight 
                        anything, fight anyone that is 
                        discriminating or defaming our people 
                        at all times.   

           BIG APPLAUSE AND CHEER   

           The speaker gives a big wave, soaking up the atmosphere.  He also 
           happens to be crime family head JOE COLOMBO.   

           Colombo descends a makeshift staircase.  Accepting good wishes 
           from passer-bys – “Hey, Billy-boy.  How are ya?”      

           Caesar hands his boss a coffee.  Whispers in his ear.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        Wha --? 

           Caesar whispers some more as an underling helps Colombo put on a 
           CAMEL HAIR COAT.    

           Colombo slides into the back of a black sedan.  Caesar leans in, 
           free to talk normally.     

                                 CAESAR  
                        Whattaya wanna do?   
                                 COLOMBO  
                        "What’d I wanna do?"  Like I gotta 
                        tell ya.    

           Caesar nods.  Sedan pulls out and WIPES FRAME, revealing...

           ...cars pulling out.   

           Evans waits by the curb, finishing up a meeting with A-list actor 
           WARREN BEATTY.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Warren, be a pal.  Direct "The Great 
                        Gatsby" and play the great man 
                        himself.   

                                 WARREN  
                        I'll do you one better, Evans.  I'll 
                        direct and star if you star opposite 
                        me as Nick Caraway.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Warren, be seneschal.  My acting days 
                        are over; in fact, they never really 
                        got started.   

           As Warren tips the valet and hops into his two-door Mercedes:   

                                 WARREN  
                        You'd make the perfect Caraway, Evans.  
                        The great believer.       

           Peels out, leaving a disappointed-looking Evans. 

           The Valet curbs Evans' two-door Mercedes.  Valet looks different 
           from all the other clean-cut kids working through college.  This 
           Valet is bigger.  Meaner.  Slyer.  But Evans is too distracted to 
           notice.            

                                 VALET  
                        There you go, Mr. Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Thanks.   

           Tries to tip and take his car keys, but: 

                                 VALET  
                        She sure is a beauty.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Yeah.  

                                 VALET  
                        You drive that mighty pretty wife of 
                        yours in this car, Mr. Evans?  

           Evans focuses, something is not right here.   
                                 VALET (CONT'D)   
                        Man oughta take care.  Make sure he 
                        doesn't do or make things he 
                        shouldn't.  Know what I mean, Mr. 
                        Evans?   

           Said slipping a BUSINESS CARD inside Evans' breast lapel.   

                                 VALET (CONT'D)  
                        Loved Rosemary's Baby, by the way.  
                        The best.    

           Evans enigmatically watches the valet head off.   

           He takes out the business card:  Italian American Civil Rights 
           League 

           INT.  EVANS' BACK GARDEN – NIGHT 

           Evans paces up and down the patio, the phone cord taut from the 
           living room.  He holds BABY JOSHUA, in his other arm, bouncing 
           him up and down.     

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Who or what is the Italian American 
                        Civil Rights League?  

           SPLIT SCREEN on Al Ruddy, on The Godfather set in NYC.  In the

                        established themselves.    

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        If they're only new how come I know 
                        who they are? 

                                 RUDDY (INTO PHONE) 
                        Maybe that's to do with their

           He motions back "I'm coming."

                             (upset)   
                        Mr. Bluhdorn…  

           Police rush past her.   

                                 POLICE #1  
                        Mr. Bluhdorn.  You have to come with 
                        us, sir.     

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        What?  Why?  What's wrong?   
                                 POLICE #2  
                        Bomb scare.   

           They take hold of Bluhdorn and guide him off. 

           EXT.  GULF + WESTERN – HOURS LATER 

           Staff crowds the plaza on Columbus Circle.  Bomb Unit is on 
           scene, as NYPD have cordoned off the area, holding back the 
           press.   

                                 POLICE DET.  
                        It's all clear, Mr. Bluhdorn.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        So it was bogus?   

                                 POLICE DET.   
                        We have to take every threat that 
                        comes in seriously, sir, what with the 
                        Black Panther trying to blow up 
                        stores, the Weather Underground doing 
                        god knows what all.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        That's crazy.  What am I to them? 

                                 POLICE DET 
                        You know your business better than me, 
                        Mr. Bluhdorn.  And the threat did come 
                        in.     
                             (then)  
                        Made any enemies lately?  

           Bluhdorn looks away, thinking.   

           EXT.  SHERATON HOTEL, NYC – DAYS LATER  

           A tour guide explains the significance of this midtown location 
           to a gaggle of tourists.   

                                 TOUR GUIDE  
                        And it was here at the Sheraton Hotel 
                        that notorious Albert Anastasia, head 
                        of Murder Inc., was infamously 
                        assassinated in the hotel's barber 
                        shop.  Wow, huh?  

           INT.  SHERATON HOTEL – CONFERENCE ROOM – SAME  

           Bluhdorn addresses the room, which is occupied by Evans and 
           Peter, Coppola and Ruddy.  But his focus is on Colombo, Caesar 
           and a bunch of Mafioso hoods in loud, double-breasted Mafioso 
           suits.         

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        I would like to thank Al Ruddy for 
                        arranging this meeting and for 
                        bringing together Joseph Colombo and 
                        the other leading members of Italian-
                        American Civil Rights League.   

           Our VIEW examines the room similar to the "Meeting with the Five 
           Families" in THE GODFATHER. 
           Colombo rises to address everyone.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        Thank you, Charlie.  And let me start 
                        by stating that the Italian-American 
                        Civil Rights League is under God's 
                        eyes.  And as long as the League 
                        continues to do good things, the 
                        League will get stronger and stronger.  
                        And those that go against the League 
                        will feel its sting.  This is who we 
                        are.      

           Colombo's crew APPLAUDS as he retakes his seat.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        I thank you, Joe, for stating plain 
                        your mind.  And in that spirit of 
                        openness, allow me to reciprocate by 
                        plainly stating that my first job was 
                        working in the Cotton Exchange, here 
                        in New York, earning fifteen dollars a 
                        week.   
                             (harder)  
                        Today I'm rebuilding cities in the 
                        Dominican Republic with the stick -– 
                        ask the locals.  
                             (in a threatening 
                             manner) 
                        That's who I am.  

           Discommoded MUMBLINGS from Colombo's crew as if under threat.       

                                 RUDDY  
                        Charlie, Charlie, hold it a second.   
                             (to Colombo)  
                        Joe?  Everybody?  No one’s out to hurt 
                        anyone, least of all you guys.   

                                 CAESAR  
                        That don't look to be the case from 
                        our end, Ruddy.  We've been hearing 
                        things.   

                                 RUDDY  
                        What things? 

                                 CAESAR  
                        It's like an Italian American can't 
                        make a buck no more without being 
                        tagged a gangster.   

           His fellow League members murmur in agreement.  Coppola smirks to 
           himself. 

                                 PETER  
                             (whispered)  
                        Why are you smiling?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        The irony of the mafia complaining 
                        about being perceived as the mafia.        
                                 RUDDY 
                             (to Colombo & co)   
                        Hey, fellas, fellas, fellas: I promise 
                        you here and now, from my lips to St. 
                        Antony’s ears, The Godfather the 
                        picture will not be the tired, by-the-
                        numbers stereotype of the Italian-
                        American community.   

                                 EVANS 
                             (breaking in)  
                        Believe me, gentlemen, the Jews and 
                        the Irish come off just as corrupt.     

           Disgruntled faces stare back at him.   

                                 EVANS  
                        A--and WASPS, too.  Naturally.  Right, 
                        Francis?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (wry) 
                        The Godfather derides all ethnicities 
                        equally.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        I wanna see the script.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (now concerned)  
                        See what?   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        That's what you guys call it, right?  
                        The uh, the pages the actors learn 
                        from.  I wanna see it.  

           The last thing Coppola wants, so -- 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Well we uh, we tend to take the 
                        Goddard approach and uh, avoid a 
                        fully-fledged script in favor of using 
                        the camera to film in the moment.   

                                 CAESAR  
                        God-who?    

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        Francis, pass the darn thing already, 
                        what's wrong with you?   

           Peter elbows Coppola to hurry him up.  He finally slides the 
           bound script across the mahogany table.  

                                 RUDDY  
                             (to Colombo) 
                        You should know, Joe, you're the only 
                        person outside production to see it.  

                                 COLOMBO  
                        A gesture I'll cherish until my last 
                        breath.      

           Colombo places his Ben Franklin eyeglasses on his nose.  Starts 
           reading.  
                                 COLOMBO  
                        What’s “watching in close view" mean?  

           Evans, Bluhdorn, Peter and Ruddy look to Coppola.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's a camera angle, when a camera 
                        angle is tight on someone or 
                        something.   

           Ruddy gestures "hurry it up."    

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)  
                        It's a close-up.    

           Colombo rubs his eyes.   

                                 COLOMBO (CONT’D) 
                        These damn glasses.   

                                 CAESAR  
                        What's up, Joe?   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        I need a new prescription.   
                             (re: script))  
                        Here. Caesar.  Start reading.   

                                 CAESAR  
                        Ah Joe.  Not me.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        What's wrong with you? 

                                 CAESAR  
                        What'd I know about reading?  I'm a 
                        lover.       
                             (to Mafioso #1)

                        Me Paulie?  Or Paulie Junior?   

                                 CAESAR  
                        You Paulie.  Read this for Joe.  Loud 
                        and clear.

                        pubic speaker.  
                             (re: passes the script 
                             to Mafioso #2) 
                        Louie should read it. 

                                 MAFIOSO #2 
                        I hate the sound of my voice.   
                             (Mafioso #3)  
                        Bruno?  You gotta pair of lungs.  
                        Let's hear ya.       

                                 MAFIOSO #3 
                        I sing.  I don't read.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        Oh for--   
           He peevishly takes the script and slides it back to Coppola.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        You read it.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Me?

                        You’re the writer, ain'tcha?

                        Joe, for cryin’ out loud, it's over 
                        170 pages.  All you need is the gist.

                             (to Coppola)  
                        Then give me the gist.    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's about a father.   

                                 CAESAR  
                        Yeah…? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And his three sons.   

           Colombo’s eyes LIGHT UP with interest.     

                                 COLOMBO  
                        So it's about what a man leaves 
                        behind?     

                                 COPPOLA

                        Alright, fellas, it's like this: we 
                        control the Teamsters.  That means we 
                        control the supply trucks and the food 
                        trucks.  Now I ain’t saying anything 
                        unfortunate is gonna happen, but god 
                        forbid these supplies and food don't 
                        show up.  And not just in New York, 
                        neither.  Chicago, Detroit – 
                        California.   

                                 CAESAR  
                        Forget about it.

                        I didn't threaten nobody.

           Uniform "no" from his crew.

                        This picture, this movie, is not a 
                        smear campaign against Italians in 
                        America.  It's about the mafia, it's 
                        about--     

                                 COLOMBO

           Chilly silence.   

                                 COLOMBO (CONT'D)  
                        What, what's a mafia?   
                             (to his crew) 
                        Any of you guys know anythin’ about 
                        any mafia? 

           Murmurs of "no" and "nu-uh" ripple.

                             (back to Ruddy & Co)  
                        We don't know nothing about no mafia.  
                        Maybe there’s mafia in Italy.  I don’t 
                        know.  Get on a plane and jet on over 
                        to Italy and find out.  You want 
                        honest, god-fearing, hard-working 
                        stiffs, the kinda guys who laid the 
                        bricks that built this country, get on 
                        a subway and get off at Bensonhurst.

                        Hey, Joe, you don't like the word 
                        mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever, no 
                        problem, we'll take out any mention of 
                        the word mafia or Cosa Nostra or 
                        whatever.      

           Colombo looks to Coppola for verification.  Everyone looks to 
           Coppola for verification.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Uh, yeah.  Okay.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        You'll take them all out?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Well it's only mentioned one time-- 

                                 RUDDY  
                             (to Colombo)  
                        Gone.  Finito.   

           Colombo keeps looking at Coppola.  Taking the hint, Coppola 
           purposefully flips through the script.  Stops on page twenty 
           three.   
           He crosses out Mafia.  "Greaseball, goombahs" remain.   

                                 COLOMBO  
                        Okay.  Well, we hear that you're 
                        looking to film on our fair city 
                        streets.     

                                 RUDDY  
                        We were hoping to, yeah.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Certainly, we plan to pay for such 
                        services.  After all, this ain't 
                        Russia.     

           Mild laughter.   
           Coppola, inspired, writes on his fat, messy notebook:  

                              WE'RE NOT COMMUNISTS  

           INT.  EVANS' BEDROOM – DAYS LATER  

           Godfather Dailies of the "Meeting of Five Families" flicker 
           across the drop-down screen.  The footage is dark and rough, hard 
           to see anything.   

           Evans, showered and in a bathrobe, pulls the blinds to block out 
           the sun, squinting at the screen with a pained face.     

           Goes to cross the room -- when -- he suddenly seizes up in 
           tremendous pain -- AAGH!   

           Drops to the ground, hand on his back.   

           Ali, also showered, rushes in.     

                                 ALI  
                        What happened?  What’s wrong? 

           Evans, in pain, points to The Godfather Dailies.   

                                 EVANS  
                        That.  That’s what’s wrong.  That and 
                        my sciatic nerve.       

           Ali helps him onto the bed.   

                                 ALI  
                        Your sciatic nerve is acting up 
                        because you're in such a state.   

                                 EVANS  
                              (re: godfather 
                             dailies)  
                        Look at what I have to deal with.  
                        Shitty lighting and lab work.  I can't 
                        see a thing.  Can you see anything?   

                                 ALI  
                        Aw Evans.  It's only a movie. 

           Evans almost pushes her away in a semi-temper. 

                                 EVANS 
                        Is that all you can say to me?   
                                 ALI  
                        There's nothing more to say.  You're 
                        obsessing about nothing, Evans -- 
                        nothing.     

           Evans struggles over to his bedside table.  Pops open a 
           prescription bottle, which Ali rolls her eyes to, holding in her 
           frustration.   

                                 EVANS 
                        You've been out of the game too long.  
                        You've lost your edge.   

                                 ALI  
                        What edge?  What are you talking 
                        about? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Here.   

           Takes a script out of a beside drawer.  Tosses it over.   

                                THE GETAWAY 
                                 by Walter Hill 
                   This screenplay is dedicated to Raoul Walsh 
                    Based on the novel by Jim Thompson 

                                 ALI 
                             (unenthused)   
                        What's this?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Sam Peckinpah's directing.   

                                 ALI  
                        Why are you telling me?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Because I got you the lead female 
                        role.  It goes against your type.     

                                 ALI  
                        I don't care where it goes; I don't 
                        want it. 

           Pushes away the script.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You'll be staring opposite Steve 
                        McQueen.   

                                 ALI  
                        You star opposite Steve McQueen if you 
                        think it's so swell.      

                                 EVANS  
                        You're losing your media halo.   

                                 ALI 
                        And what if I am?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Chanel might replace you.   

                                 ALI  
                        Let them.   
                                 EVANS  
                        You have to maintain your position.  
                        We both do.     

           Ali stares at her husband long and hard.   

                                 ALI  
                        Do you want me to leave?  

                                 EVANS  
                             (re: godfather dailies)  
                        I want to be able to see this damn 
                        movie.  

           Fed up, Ali storms out.      

           Evans stews for a moment.  Bedside phone abruptly RINGS, giving 
           him and us a start.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (to himself)  
                        This better be good news.    
                             (into phone)  
                        Yeah? 

                                 PETER (OVER PHONE) 
                        Evans…?  You better come in.   

           Evans hangs his head.  It's bad news.   

           INT.  EVANS' OFFICE – DAYS LATER 

           Godfather dailies are projected on a screen.   

           Peter stands with two other executives, studio accountants, 
           grave, dour expressions.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Go.   

                                 EXECUTIVE #1  
                        The weekend's returns for "Willy Wonka 
                        and the Chocolate Factory" are in.   

                                 EVANS 
                        And? 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 
                        They're disappointing.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Are we going to take a loss? 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 
                        Our numbers suggest no and that we 
                        will eventually recoup our budget.   

                                 EVANS 
                        What does “eventually” mean?   
                                 EXECUTIVE #2  
                        That Wonka is not going to be the 
                        massive hit we calculated it would be 
                        and, let's not forget, the hit this 
                        studio very much requires.     

                                 EVANS 
                        Does New York know? 

                                 EXECUTIVE #2  
                        It was New York who told us.   

           Evans and Peter swap an uneasy glance.  Silence falls as this 
           horrible news sinks in.       

           Executive #1 idly focuses on The Godfather dallies.  Pacino is 
           visible in the hospital foyer.   

                                 EXECUTIVE #1  
                        Hey.  I know him.   

                                 PETER  
                        Pacino?  How? 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1  
                        Sorry, I don’t mean know him, know 
                        him.  Twentieth has him in a picture, 
                        I saw it last week.  "Panic" in 
                        something. 

                                 EVANS  
                        Twentieth can have him back.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1  
                        I can't believe that's the same guy.  
                        Last week he was dirty and sweaty.  
                        Now he’s clean-cut and proper.  A real 
                        preppy.       
                             (then)  
                        That guy’s a really good actor.   

           Evans and Peter are both struck by that endorsement.  Look at 
           each other.  Then, in a new light, watch Pacino as Michael 
           running through the hospital to assist his father.  

           INT.  ITALIAN RESTAURANT, BRONX NYC – GODFATHER SET – NIGHT  

           FLIM CAMERA POV: real-life Pacino as Michael exiting the bathroom 
           and standing still, coolly sizing up Sollozzo and Mccluskey -- 
           not "blasting" as Clemenza instructed him to.   

           Coppola and Crew are filming.    
           The mood of the set is like the scene: taut and terrifying.  
           Evans and Peter watch in person, riveted.   

           CAMERA POV: Pacino finally crosses the restaurant and sits with 
           Sollozzo and McClusky.   

           Evans blurts out, nerves gone:  

                                 EVANS 
                        B--but he's not shooting, Clemenza 
                        told him to come out shooting.   

                                 VOICES

           Evans belts up.  Gestures "sorry" 

           The scene continues with Pacino acting as Michael, silent and 
           fraught with anxiety and indecision.   

           Evans and Peter are frozen.  

           Pacino as Michael stands and shoots -- bang like a cap gun.

           Evans and Peter swap an impressed look and move outside w/ Ruddy.   

           EXT.  BRONX STREET – SAME 

           Stage Lights are being set up for "Michael being picked up” 
           scene.   

           Peter and Ruddy join Evans as he thoughtfully sizes up all the 
           work being done by the crew.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Okay, so the runt ain't all bad.   

           Ruddy exhales with relief.  Then:   

                                 RUDDY  
                        And Francis…? 

                                 EVANS  
                        He's doing a man's job -- but don't 
                        tell him that.   

                                 RUDDY  
                        You kidding?  It's working under the 
                        gun that's driving this guy.   

                                 EVANS  
                        That's something, at least.     

           Ruddy becomes hesitant.  
                                 RUDDY  
                        So then, you’re happy, Bob?   

           Evans turns to him -- Bob?     

                                 EVANS  
                        Why did you call me, Bob?

                                 RUDDY 
                        Nothing's wrong…   

                                 PETER 
                        But there is something.   

                                 EVANS  
                        There's always something.   

                                 RUDDY  
                        Francis wants to film the Sicily 
                        section in Sicily.   

                                 PETER 
                        He what?  

           Ruddy shrugs.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Napa County not good enough for the 
                        young prince?   

                                 RUDDY  
                        Francis says the authentic scenery 
                        will be worth it, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        No. Sorry, Ruddy, no can do.  I've 
                        given in on everything and this is one 
                        thing I can't give in on.  On this I'm 
                        remaining firm.  No means no.  So no.     

           Stage Light comes on full blast with a sizzle sound effect, 
           flaring screen white, silhouetting Evans & Co.

           Equally recognizable is Bar Vitelli, the setting where Michael 
           discusses his marriage with Appollonia's father. 

           A charming, 18th-century stone-flagged building, draped in

           gentle gentleman, playing a variation of "The Godfather Waltz" on

           A HANDKERCHIEF is held up to her face.   
           Ali looks up to see the unmistakable silhouette of the king of

           EXT.  ST. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL – GODFATHER SET – DAY 

           Cast and Crew prepare to film the baptism scene.  Eleanor Coppola 
           hands over BABY SOFIA to Diane Keaton. 

           Ruddy and Coppola discuss:  

                                 RUDDY  
                        Towne just turned in a draft for Hal 
                        Ashby.  "The Last Detail."    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Bobby's doing that? 

                                 RUDDY  
                        “Bobby?”  You know this script doctor 
                        guy? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        From our Rodger Corman days.  

                                 RUDDY  
                        So you're good to call Towne?  

           Eleanor steps up to her husband.   
                                 ELEANOR  
                        I'm not sure Diane knows how to hold a 
                        baby.  She keeps letting Sophia's head 
                        drop back.   

           Both Coppola and Ruddy turn to look.    

           EXT.  CORLEONE GARDEN – GODFATHER SET – DAYS LATER 

           The crew and Brando prep to film the "Don's death" scene as 
           Coppola strolls around with the future Oscar-winning script 
           writer ROBERT TOWNE.  He looks like an extra out of "Easy Rider," 
           a sixties zonked-out, Pete Townsend-like rock star.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        We really need this scene to be about 
                        the father and son relationship, we 
                        want the audience to know that they 
                        love each other. 

                                 TOWNE  
                        But without one saying it to the 
                        other?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Right.  See the problem is the book 
                        doesn't feature this scene.  We don't 
                        have any kind of reference.  But Evans 
                        – I can't believe I'm saying this – 
                        Evans is right: the movie needs some 
                        kind of resolution between Vito and 
                        Michael.   

           INT.  GODFATHER SET – ROOM – NIGHT  

           On a small video screen, Towne watches real-life DAILIES of 
           Brando as Vito, and Pacino as Michael: Vito visiting Genko dying 
           in the hospital (deleted in the theatrical version).      

           Vito takes a distant Michael aside in the corridor.   

                                 VITO (ON SCREEN)  
                        Just a minute, Michael.  I wanna talk 
                        to you.  What are your plans when you 
                        get out? 

                                 MICHAEL (ON SCREEN) 
                        Finish school.   

                                 VITO (ON SCREEN) 
                        That's fine.  I approve of that.  
                        Michael, you never come to me as a son 
                        should.   

           Towne rewinds to the wedding, and plays Michael explaining to Kay 
           at the wedding: 

                                 MICHAEL (ON SCREEN) 
                        That's my family, Kay.  That's not me.   

           INT.  KITCHEN – GODFATHER SET – NIGHT  

           Coppola makes pizzas for the cast and crew as he confers with 
           Towne.    
                                 TOWNE 
                        So in the beginning, if I'm getting 
                        this right, the story arc starts off 
                        with this emotional and psychological 
                        gulf between the father and the son. 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Right.  The father is one way, the son 
                        is another.   

                                 TOWNE  
                        Each has his own ideals and way of how 
                        to live in the world.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        But circumstances change all that.  
                        The son decides to abandon his 
                        principles and take up the sword to 
                        defend his father and his family. 

                                 TOWNE 
                        So the son's own principles are 
                        untested?   

           This gives Coppola pause, intrigued by that question.   

                                 TOWNE (CONT’D)  
                        Then it is personal for Michael.  
                        Everything must be.  His father 
                        getting shot, the second attempt on 
                        his life, how the cops helped, getting 
                        punched in the face -- Michael must 
                        take this personally.  Who wouldn’t?  

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Okay.  But Michael would still handle 
                        it in a business-like manner.   

                                 TOWNE  
                        Right.  He doesn't fly off the handle 
                        and shout and scream for blood.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        He's cool, he's calm.   

                                 TOWNE  
                        He knows what he wants and he's going 
                        to do it, he's prepared to go all the 
                        way.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Something he learned from the old man.   

                                 TOWNE   
                        From The Don; right.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Because the Don, well, he takes things 
                        personal too.  If a bolt of lightning 
                        strikes a friend, he'll take it 
                        personal.  When Michael joined the 
                        Marines, he took that personal.  
                        That's what makes him great, or uh, 
                        you know, pushes him to live by his 
                        own code of ethics.   
                                 TOWNE  
                        Which is why he doesn't have faith in 
                        politicians or in the law, he doesn't 
                        think they'll help him or protect his 
                        family.  So he must.  

                                 COPPOLA   
                        Whatever it takes.   

                                 TOWNE 
                        No restraint, no limits.   
                             (beat)  
                        But there's a dark side to all that, 
                        isn't there?  

                                 COPPOLA  
                        What, whattaya mean?   

                                 TOWNE  
                        There's no reward for living honestly.  
                        Michael can't live well or ethically, 
                        the system won't let him.  The dream 
                        is corrupt.   
                             (then)  
                        The great promise of America, 
                        somewhere, somehow, it went wrong.        

           This hangs for a moment.   
           Prelap the SOUND of typewriter keys... 

           INT.  THE DON'S OFFICE – GODFATHER SET – NIGHT/SUNSET 

           ...rapping words onto a yellow page.   

           Alone, Towne works feverishly through the night.   

           Pulls a sheet out of the machine.  Crumbles it up, unhappy.  
           Rolls in a fresh page.  

           TYPEWRITTEN TEXT fills the screen: 

           Pre-lap Brando's voice as we dissolve to: 

           EXT.  GARDEN PATIO – GODFATHER SET – DAY  

           CAMERA POV: Real-life Brando and Pacino as the Don and Michael 
           act out the father advising the son: “I work my whole life, I 
           don't apologize, to take care of my family.”   
           Over scene we reveal Coppola and the crew filming, everyone doing 
           their part, concentrating, working hard.  CUE CARDS with Brando’s 
           lines are held up.   

           Towne watches his words being acted out.   

           Once Brando as Vito shuffles off and Pacino as Michael sinks back 
           into his chair, deep in thought --   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Okay cut it.  Thanks everyone, thank 
                        you.   

           Some clap.  Coppola turns to Towne: 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        That'll get you a writer's credit, 
                        Bobby.  Mario, me and you.  
                        Guaranteed.   

                                 TOWNE  
                        C'mon, Franny, don't be ridiculous.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        You don't want the writing credit? 

                                 TOWNE  
                        You get an Oscar, mention me.    

           The eccentric scriptwriter walks off, smiling.

                        Well that's it.

                        That's why it's an emergency meeting.

                        Why didn't you say Business Affairs is 
                        holding an emergency meeting? 

                                 PETER  
                        Because I didn't think I would have to 
                        since we don't have a meeting 
                        scheduled with Business Affairs.

                        What do you think Business Affairs 
                        want?  To talk about business, to talk 
                        about Paramount's financial health, 
                        which isn't very healthy.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Do I have to be there? 

                                 PETER 
                        Do I have to answer that?

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Paramount Studios is dying, gentlemen.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Oh c'mon now.  That sounds a little 
                        overdramatic.   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        And your assessment of my assessment 
                        is simply not compatible with economic 
                        reality.   
                             (condescending)  
                        Not to mention grammatically mangled.     

                                 EVANS  
                        We've had some hits.  

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Oh I beg your pardon, please set us 
                        and the record straight.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I will.  "Rosemary's Baby," "True 
                        Grit," uh… 

                                 PETER  
                        "The Odd Couple."   

                                 EVANS  
                        Right.  "Romeo & Juliet."   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Excuse me -- excuse me, excuse me.  Is 
                        that what you two are clinging to? 
                        Hits -- modest hits, at that -- from 
                        the 1960s?  

           Peter and Evans exchange caught-out glances.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (still trying)  
                        The late 1960s.   

           Ms. Vanderlee looks at her Business Affairs colleagues.  They 
           share her askance.   

           Evans suddenly remembers:     

                                 EVANS  
                        "Love Story."   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        What about it?   

                                 EVANS 
                        That was the top grossing film of the 
                        year.   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Very true.  Love Story was the box 
                        office smash of the year -- two years 
                        ago.   
                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                             (then)  
                        "Love Story" may have saved your puffy 
                        behinds in 1970, gentlemen… 

                                 EVANS  
                        Puffy --?   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        ...But I promise you, it will not save 
                        you in 1972.  Last year Paramount 
                        failed to score a single hit in the 
                        top twenty.  Not one.  Instead you two 
                        geniuses gave to the movie world a 
                        peculiar romance involving a child and 
                        some woman old enough to be his great 
                        grandmother.  Not to mention Barbara 
                        Streisand's first ever flop. 

                                 PETER 
                        "On a Clear Day" wasn't our idea. 

                                 EVANS 
                             (to Ms. Vanderlee)  
                        That was Charlie Bluhdorn all the way.  
                        A way for him to star-bang Streisand.   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Would you care to call New York and 
                        remind Mr. Bluhdorn of this?  

           This shuts up both men.  Ms. Vanderlee opens a big BLACK BOOK, 
           getting down to business.     

                                 MS. VANDERLEE (CONT'D)  
                        Now let's review Paramount's coming 
                        lineup for the year, shall we?   

                                 PETER  
                        Uhm well, we have a picture coming up 
                        with Woody Allen. 

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Woody Allen the comic?   

                                 EVANS  
                        It's an adaptation of one of his 
                        Broadway plays.       

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Never cared for Mr. Allen’s style of 
                        humor myself, neither.   

           Not a good start.     

                                 PETER  
                        W--we have a Western.  "Bad Company."   

                                 EXEC #1  
                             (interested)  
                        Is John Wayne in it?   

                                 PETER  
                        Jeff Bridges.   
                                 EXEC #1 
                        Jeff who?  

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        What about "The Great Gatsby?"  Why 
                        haven't you mentioned that? 

                                 PETER 
                        Because we haven't made "The Great 
                        Gatsby."   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                             (shocked)  
                        You mean you're not even in post-
                        production?  Why not? 

                                 EVANS 
                        It's a tough 180-pages to lick.   

           Ms. Vanderlee SLAMS shut her big black book -- had enough. 

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Gentlemen, for your sakes, I hope you 
                        can put our minds to rest by naming at 
                        least one project in post-production 
                        that at least appears commercially 
                        attractive. 

           A loooooong silence.  Until Evans mumbles -- 

                                 EVANS  
                        "The Godfather."  

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        I'm sorry, what?   

                                 PETER

                             her files) 
                        Ah yes.  Mario Puzo's big, bad 
                        bestseller.  

                                                    INTERCUT TO: 

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS, SF – DAY  

           Coppola works an editing machine from the late 1960s called a 
           "Movieola" (looks like a sowing machine), examining footage of 
           "The Godfather" playing on a small viewing screen.   

                                                        BACK TO: 

           Ms. Vanderlee, reading from a sheet. 

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        "The Godfather."  Originally budgeted 
                        at one million dollars.  Then 
                        ballooned to two million dollars, then 
                        2.5 million dollars.   
                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        And now, to date, has chewed up over 
                        six million dollars.   

                                 PETER  
                        Six million?   

           Evans and Peter share flabbergasted glances.  

                                 EXEC #1 

                                 EVANS  
                        Canadian dollars?   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        We're not amused.   

                                 EVANS 
                        Believe me, I'm crying like a little 
                        girl on the inside.   

                                 PETER 
                             (to Ms. Vanderlee)  
                        How's that possible?   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        Let's take a for instance, shall we?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Must we?   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE  
                        The assassination of Santino Corleone.   

           Which she pronounces as San-tin-o Cor-leo-nye.   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE (CONT’D)   
                        Instead of filming on an actual toll-
                        booth, production hired out an 
                        abandoned airstrip, and built a toll-
                        booth and dressed the whole area to 
                        look like a highway. 

           Evans shifts awkwardly in his chair.   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE (CONT’D)  
                        Take another example: the Vito 
                        Corleone funeral scene.  Twelve 
                        thousand was spent on flowers alone, 
                        over.   
                             (emphasizing)  
                        On flowers.   

           Awkward silence.   

                                 MS. VANDERLEE (CONT’D)  
                        You risked everything on this picture, 
                        gentlemen. 
                             (listing)  
                        The studio, its proud history, its 
                        employees.   
                             (then)  
                        I pray it will be worth it.      
           INT.  CORRIDOR – MINUTES LATER 

           Evans and Peter move through, hurriedly and harassed.  Evans 
           keeps one hand on his sore, sciatic-ridden back.       

                                 EVANS  
                        I want Coppola and The Godfather here.   

                                 PETER  
                        In LA?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Where I can keep an eye on both of 
                        ‘em.  Everyone’s assess are on the 
                        line.       

                                 PETER  
                        Francis' contract assigns him 
                        discretion to edit in San Francisco.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Then we need to find a way that breaks 
                        Francis' contract.  

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – DAY/NIGHT 

           George Lucas assists Coppola cut the post-Sollozzo killing 
           montage scene. 

           Coppola turns to editor, PETER ZINNER:   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        How long is the movie at this point? 

                                 PETER ZINNER  
                        Uh…I got 103 minutes and thirty-four 
                        seconds.   

           Not the news Coppola was expecting.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It took an hour and a half for us to 
                        get to Michael killing Sollozzo?   
                             (worried)  
                        How long is left?  

                                 PETER ZINNER 
                        I'd say, oh about ninety-six minutes, 
                        give or take.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        The movie is over three hours long?

                                 PETER  
                        We might have something. 

           Evans pours himself a drink, more Scotch than Tab.   
           His hands shake, bad nerves.       
                                 EVANS  
                        Anything.  

                                 STUDIO LAWYER  
                        A clause exists on Mr. Coppola's 
                        contract regarding "manageable 
                        length." 

                                 EVANS  
                        A clause? 

           Peter nods yes.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)  
                        Okay.  Good.  That's good, but  --  

           Evans is rendered mute by a wave of back pain.  Eases himself 
           into a chair and manages to speak over the strain. 

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)   
                        Only what does "manageable length" 
                        mean? 

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS, SF – NIGHT 

           Coppola on the phone to Evans.   

                                 COPPOLA (INTO PHONE)  
                        It means what? 

           SPLIT SCREEN:  
           to reveal Evans in his LA office, shuffling about using a WALKING 
           CANE: 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)  
                        It means you have to cut the picture 
                        to within uh… 
                             (reading a page)  
                        Two hours and ten minutes.   

                                 COPPOLA (INTO PHONE) 
                        Evans, I'm trying to edit eighty hours 
                        of film, okay?  Unspooled, it's like 
                        ninety-five miles long. I can't 
                        possibly--   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        If it's a second longer than two hours 
                        and ten minutes when you show the 
                        first cut, I'm relocating the work 
                        prints to Los Angeles.      

           He hangs up and we go FULL SCREEN on Coppola.  He's too visibly 
           stunned to be mad.  Slowly hangs up the receiver.     

           Then he gradually starts to flame out into an exploding rage – 
           his hands slashing at any and all objects -- tears the cluttered 
           room to bits.   

           Lucas and the editors observe from the doorway.   

                                 LUCAS  
                        Evans must have called.    
           Coppola's OSCAR STATUTE for "Patton" CRASHES against the wall, 
           just missing Lucas.     

           EXT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – SAME  

           We watch Coppola in the distance, trashing the room.  San 
           Francisco's nightlife continues all around us. 

                                                  FADE TO BLACK:    

           After a moment, a voice breaks the silence.   

                                 VOICE  
                        Cue it. 

           A projector starts up.  The haunting opening chords to Nino 
           Rota's music fills the air.      

                                                        FADE UP:  

           INT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIOS SCREENING ROOM – WEEKS LATER 

           The first rough cut of The Godfather flickers across the screen.   

           In the reflected blue light, Peter and Paramount Exec's watch on 
           one side.   

           Coppola, Ruddy, Towne, and other crew members watch on the other 
           side.  

           At the very back is Evans – get this – lying in a PORTABLE BED.  
           His back is propped up against ten of the PUFFIEST PILLOWS ever 
           made.  Smokes a cigar over tumblers of Irish Whisky dispensed by 
           Studio Catering staff.         

           SCENE BECOMES A SERIES OF DISSOLVES OF 

           -- Evans watching, disgruntled, shifts around in his bed.   

           -- Coppola studying Evans's reaction.   

           Finally the end credits roll over Diane Keaton as Kay lighting 
           candles in a church for Michael's soul. 

           Voice lowered, Peter leans over to Evans who stares blankly at 
           the screen: 

                                 PETER  
                        It's just over two hours.  

           He shows Evans a legal pad with SCRIBBLED NOTES on further cuts.  

                                 PETER (CONT'D0  
                        Take out a couple of more scenes, we 
                        might be able to bring it down to 
                        ninety minutes.  

           Evans' face contorts -- more cuts???!!!  Peter doesn't notice, 
           too busy eyeing his legal pad.   
                                 PETER (CONT'D) 
                        We might maneuver out of this, after 
                        all.          

           Evans tries to rise out of bed –- can't.  Too sore.  So: 

                                 EVANS 
                        Francis…? 

           Coppola breaks his attention away from his fawning clique.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D) 
                        May I have a word with you?  Alone.  

           Evans is wheeled out of the room.   

                                 TOWNE  
                        That is one bizarre sight in the 
                        middle of all this.  

           Coppola is inspired. Scribbles down on his notebook:  

                      a bizarre sight in the middle of all this 

                                  TOWNE (CONT'D)  
                        No wonder the industry's in trouble 
                        with guys like that running the joint.         

           INT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIOS OFFICE – MINUTES LATER  

           Evans, alone, paces about using his walking cane, gathering his 
           thoughts.  Expects Coppola any second.      

           Clock reads: 2:24pm 

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:  

           Evans, still waiting.  Clocks reads: 2:45pm 

                                                    DISSOLVE TO: 

           Evans looks out the window, left and right.  Stewing, fuming.  
           Clock reads: 3:07pm 

           Door opens.  Coppola is escorted inside, like the wiseass 
           troublemaker entering the principle’s office.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Nice of you to show, Francis.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Yeah sorry, I was, you know.   

                                 EVANS  
                        No.  I can’t say I do know.  Know 
                        what?  

           This sharp rhetorical question gives Coppola pause.   
           Evans' Secretary backtracks out, glad to clear the firing line.     

           To break the awkward silence:   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Was talking with Peter.  He’s happy, 
                        anyway.  There're one or two scenes 
                        he'd like to cut, but my guys say the 
                        picture's terrific.  That I shouldn't 
                        touch a frame.   

                                 EVANS  
                        The picture stinks, Francis. 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Wh--what?   

                                 EVANS 
                        You deaf, auteur boy?  It stinks to 
                        high heaven.  It's all plot and no 
                        heart -- no family -- no feeling -- no 
                        anything.  You shot a great film, but 
                        where the holy fuck is it?  In your 
                        kitchen with the spaghetti? 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Now listen, Evans, I-- 

                                 EVANS  
                        No you listen, y'fat fuck, and listen 
                        good because I ain't gonna say it 
                        twice.  You shot a saga, pal, but you 
                        turned in a trailer.  We're going back 
                        to the cutting room, and we are gonna 
                        put that half-assed picture you think 
                        is so perfect back together.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        We?   

                                 EVANS  
                        You and me, buddy.  Here.  In LA.  You 
                        can leave your pansy, Godard-
                        worshiping, ass-kissing assistants 
                        back in San Francisco where they 
                        belong.    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Fuck you and fuck that -- I'll never 
                        agree.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I ain't askin’, Francis -- I'm 
                        tellin’.  Life is change.  Get ready.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                             (realizing)   
                        Wait a minute here, wait a second.  
                        You actually want me to make the 
                        picture longer?           

           INT.  ZOETROPE STUDIOS – CUTTING ROOM – DAYS LATER

                        He wants you to make the picture 
                        longer?   

           Coppola is present.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Ask him yourself.   

           Said gesturing to a defiant, pissed-off Evans.   

                                 BLUHDORN 
                        Evans, say it ain't so?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Can't do it, Charlie.    

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        Evans, no studio head in the history 
                        of studios has ever told a director to 
                        make a picture longer.   

                                 EVANS 
                        I'm a big believer in making history, 
                        Charlie.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        I'm not.  Francis says the picture is 
                        fine.  His people say the picture is 
                        fine.  Hell, Evans, even your people 
                        say the picture is fine.   

                                 EVANS 
                        I quit.   

                                 BLUHDORN  
                        Whah --? 

                                 EVANS 
                        I ain't signing my name to that 
                        picture, not in its present shape; no, 
                        sir.  Thanks for the chance and the 
                        memories, Charlie.  And, Francis, go 
                        fuck yourself two times; on second 
                        thoughts, make it three.

           The door closes with a KA-CLICK.   

           INT.  ELEVATOR – MOMENTS LATER 

           Evans is going down.  Alone.  A face of furious anger... 
           His expression begins to soften...showing regret... 

           He becomes teary eyed.     
           The elevator doors open and a woman gets on.   
           Evans quickly recovers and folds his arms.   

           They ride down together, shoulder to shoulder.   
           Evans, struggling to hold it together.   

           The elevator stops.  Doors open.  The woman departs.   
           As soon as the doors close, Evans breaks down SOBBING, his hands 
           covering his face in shame.    

           The elevator reaches the foyer.   
           Evans quickly wipes clean his tear-stained cheeks.   

           INT.  FOYER – SAME 

           Evans goes to push through the revolving door, when: 

                                 VOICE  
                        Mr. Evans…? 

           Evans looks over his shoulder.  A RECEPTIONIST at the Welcoming 
           Desk is holding up a TELEPHONE.   

           He takes the phone.   

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        H--hello?   

           An unusually soft-spoken Bluhdorn is on the other end: 

                                 BLUHDORN'S VOICE (OVER PHONE) 
                        Evans… 
                             (beat)  
                        Cut the picture the way you want.  
                        I'll back you.   

           CLICK! -- line disconnects.  Evans slowly lowers the receiver.  

           Coppola appears beside him.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        We might be able to catch the four 
                        o'clock if we leave now.   

           He goes for the revolving door, when it STICKS with a suited man 
           inside.  The man turns around, facing Coppola, and PUSHES AGAINST 
           THE GLASS -- a car exhaust BACKFIRES like a gunshot.     

           Coppola reacts, visibly stirred by the image before him.    

           An usher force-pushes the door to rotate --  

           Coppola, thoughtfully, takes the next door with Evans.  Sunlight 
           washes out frame...

           Evans and Coppola are on their feet watching the screen and each 
           other.  They're like two heavyweights in the ring.   
                                 EVANS 
                             (making a face)   
                        What kind of music is that? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Music with heart and character.  You 
                        know, the very ingredients you said 
                        were lacking in mobster pictures.     

                                 EVANS 
                        It's a little… 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        What?   

                                 EVANS 
                        It’s ethnic.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        What, excuse me?   

                                 EVANS  
                        Listen, Francis, I'm not out to insult 
                        you or anybody, but you can't really 
                        expect me to sign off on this kind of 
                        thing.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Why not?   
                             (pointedly)  
                        Because it's lower class?   

           Evans notices the two editors are staring at him.      

                                 EVANS 
                        Don't look at me like that.  I could 
                        never show my face at the club again.  
                        They'd all laugh at me, whisper behind 
                        my back.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Who's they?   

                                 EVANS  
                        They.  

           Stony silence in response.   

                                 EVANS (CONT'D) 
                        Be reasonable, Francis. 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Okay, how’s this?  We test it.     

                                 EVANS 
                        To who?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        To a test audience, who else?  And 
                        we'll decide yah or nah by their 
                        reaction.   

                                 EVANS  
                             (sticks out his hand)  
                        Shake on it?   
           They shake – a firm grip on both sides.   
           Neither wants to let go first.       

           INT.  DOWNTOWN MOVIE THEATER – NIGHTS LATER  

           Forty people watch a rough cut of The Godfather... 

           INT.  THEATER FOYER – SAME 

           ...Nino Rota’s and Carmine Coppola's music blaring. 

           Evans and Coppola wait for the outcome.   

           Doors swing open.  The audience streams out, all with satisfied, 
           enjoyment on their faces.  Coppola turns triumphantly to a 
           sighing Evans.    

                                 EVANS  
                        Let's get back.      

           INT.  PARAMOUNT STUDIOS – CUTTING ROOM – DAY/NIGHT 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: of Evans and Coppola cutting The Godfather: 
           talking...bickering...storming away from each other, in a huff.      

                                                        JUMP TO: 

           They're reviewing scenes of Kay lighting church candles.  
           This is the original, unreleased ending.     

           Everyone looks terribly fatigued.   

           Evans dials a phone.  Waits for a response.     

                                                    INTERCUT TO: 

           EXT.  EL PASO, TX – GETAWAY SET – SAME  

           The PHONE RINGS from inside Ali's trailer. 
           We also hear Ali GIGGLING inside.   

           The nanny can be seen in the distance, playing with Josh. 

                                                        BACK TO: 

           Evans hangs up.  Annoyed.  Stress levels rising.    

           On screen: Diane Keaton as Kay prays.   

                                 EVANS 
                        You call that an ending?   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        She’s praying for Michael’s soul.   

                                 EVANS  
                        She’s what --? 
           While the two egos go at it, editor Peter Zinner starts tinkering 
           around with the Steenback editing machine -- working on a new 
           idea, juxtaposing the baptism scene with the Mafia Hits.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        A New England WASP is engaging in the 
                        traditions of the Old World.  That's 
                        poetic drama in motion.     

                                 EVANS 
                        It's flat-out boring.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's my picture, Evans.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Damn right.  But it's also the 
                        writer's picture, Francis.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I co-wrote it.   

                                 EVANS  
                        And it's the producer's' picture. 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I helped produce.  

                                 EVANS  
                        And it's the composer's picture.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I hired the composer.   

                                 EVANS 
                        And it's the executives' picture, and 
                        I hired you, Francis, at a time when 
                        you couldn't direct a cartoon in this 
                        town.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Can’t believe I'm living outta Jimmy 
                        Caan's maid's room like an immigrant 
                        for this?   

                                 EVANS  
                        You'll be Jimmy Caan's maid if you 
                        don't get your act together and come 
                        up with an ending.  

                                 PETER ZINNER  
                        Got it.   

           Evans and Coppola look.   
           Zinner puts on the montage juxtaposition of the baptism and 
           murders of the heads of families.   

                                 PETER ZINNER (CONT’D)  
                        Good and evil.   
                             (beat)  
                        And of course irony.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Why irony?   
                                 PETER ZINNER 
                        Because, look, Michael's becoming a 
                        Godfather, in family and in business.  
                        His arc complete.     

                                 COPPOLA  
                        God, yeah.   

                                 EVANS  
                        But we can’t end at the baptism? What 
                        about the revenge killing on uh, 
                        what’s his name?   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Carlo.   

                                 PETER ZINNER  
                        The baptism scene isn’t your ending, 
                        per se.  But it allows you end on…one 
                        sec...   

           Works the Steenbeck editing machine.  Brings up the scene when Al 
           Neri closes the door on Kay.   

                                 PETER ZINNER (CONT'D) 
                        There.  The final curtain.  Kay's look 
                        says it all.       

           Coppola and Evans sit back.  Turn to each other.   
           Then look at Zimmer, impressed.   

           A SECRETARY rushes in:  

                                 SECRETARY  
                        New York is on the horn.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Not now.   

                                 SECRETARY  
                        Marlon Brando has pulled out of 
                        attending the premier.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        You're kidding me? 

                                 EVANS  
                        You got any pull with him? 

                                 COPPOLA 
                        The guy ignored me flat for six 
                        months; so, no.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I shoulda hired Elia Kazan.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        You try directing Brando.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I'm a producer not a director.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Then produce.   

           A second secretary rushes in: 
                                 SECRETARY #2  
                        Charlie Bluhdorn is apparently foaming 
                        at the mouth. He wants to talk to 
                        either of you.   

           Both Evans and Coppola turn to each other, saying:  

                                 EVANS / COPPOLA  
                        You talk to him  / You talk to him.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Fuck it.   

           Evans picks up the nearest phone.  Speed dials.     

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                        Hello, this is Bobby -- I mean, this 
                        is Robert Evans.  May I please speak 
                        to Henry Kissinger? 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE) 
                             (beat) 
                        Yes, I'll hold.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Kissinger? 

                                 EVANS 
                        I might be able to swing him to come.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Kissinger should be dumped into a 
                        prison, not invited to a movie 
                        premier.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Henry's misunderstood.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Mis-what --?  

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)  
                        Hello, Henry?...The Godfather's the 
                        problem, Henry...No, not the book.  
                        The picture.  We made it and…Yeah, we 
                        made it into a movie...Well the 
                        premiere's tomorrow night.  It's all 
                        or nothing, Henry, and I'd be shooting 
                        sevens if I could saunter in there 
                        with you by my side. 
                             (beat) 
                        Forget about shuttling to Moscow, 
                        Moscow will still be there the day 
                        after tomorrow.   

           Peter enters with his assistants.   

                                 PETER  
                        Okay, what's going on?  Bluhdorn's 
                        going ballistic.    

                                 EVANS  
                             (feeling the pressure)  
                        Henry, you're not hearing me.  I need 
                        you tomorrow night...Right.    

           Hangs up.  To secretary #1:   
                                 EVANS  
                        What line? 

                                 SECRETARY #1  
                        What? 

                                 EVANS  
                        Bluhdorn?  What line? 

                                 SECRETARY #1 
                        I'm not sure.  

           All the phone lines are flashing.  Evans starts punching lines: 
           "Hello, Charlie?"  Tries another: "Charlie?"  Finally hits a 
           third line:   

           Bluhdorn's FIERCE YELLING VOICE can be heard filtered over the 
           receiver. 

                                 EVANS (INTO PHONE)  
                        Charlie, Charlie, Charlie -- Henry 
                        Kissinger is coming.   

           Evans holds up the receiver so everyone can hear Bluhdorn's 
           ecstasy.

           A GALA in full swing across the street... 

           EXT.  ASTOR THEATRE – SAME  

           ...The Godfather Premier.  The hottest place in town.   

           An endless series of limos unloading CELEBRITIES and POWER 
           BROKERS to an exciting crowd and clamoring photographers.   

           Blinding flash bulbs POP! -- POP! -- POP!  

           The red carpet brigade surge forward over the glare of klieg

           It's just as crazy and loud inside. 

           Evans moves through with Robert Towne: 

                                 EVANS  
                        What'd you think about doing a rewrite 
                        job on "The Great Gatsby"? 
                                 TOWNE 
                        Nah.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Why not?   

                                 TOWNE 
                        Who would want to try and outclass 
                        Fitzgerald?  Not me, anyway.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Great.   

                                 TOWNE  
                        I do have another story in mind, 
                        Evans, it that’ll cheer you up.       

                                 EVANS  
                        Depends.  What’s it about?   

                                 TOWNE  
                        “How Los Angeles became a boomtown 
                        through incest and water.  A second-
                        rate shamus gets eighty-sixed by a 
                        mysterious socialite." 

           We break away and find the Ladies Restroom.  As a woman dressed 
           to the nines steps out, we slip past... 

           INT.  LADIES ROOM – SAME  

           ...more women VIP's leave, revealing: 

           Ali, by the sinks, staring off.  Something's wrong.  

           She rotates her WEDDING RING on her finger.  Only to pull it off.  
           Then: 

           BLURGGH! -- someone vomits from behind a stall.             

           Ali refocuses.   

                                 ALI  
                        Diane -- ?

                        Yeah?   

                                 ALI  
                        You okay?  

                                 DIANE KEATON (O.S.)  
                        Oh yeah.  Fine.  Great.  Just ate 
                        something, that’s all.  Sorry.

           INT.  ASTOR THEATRE – FOYER – SAME  

           Guests enjoy fancy, delectable hors d'oeuvres.   
           Coppola finishes up an interview, sipping champagne.    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I don't like directing and battling it 
                        out every day on the set. I thought I 
                        would, I thought I'd love being the 
                        big cheese.  But, now, I find myself 
                        very disillusioned.  Except with the 
                        writing, for me that's most pleasant.  
                        It's just you and the material, and 
                        you're not this constant target for 
                        being shot at.  And what's weird is 
                        after saying all that, I'm trying 
                        right now to close a deal to direct a 
                        whole other movie.       

           The interviewer and Coppola exchange farewells.  Coppola takes a 
           big satisfied sip of champagne.   

           Voices nearby dominate, one guest being introduced to another 
           guest:   

                                 GUEST'S VOICE #1  
                        And this is famed British director 
                        Nicolas Roeg.     

                                 GUEST'S VOICE #2 
                        How do you do?  Wow, it's a pleasure. 
                        I love your work.   

                                 GUEST'S VOICE #1 
                        Nicholas actually caught an earlier 
                        showing of The Godfather this 
                        afternoon.   

                                 GUEST'S VOICE #2 
                        Ohh.  And did you enjoy it? 

                                 NICHOLAS ROEG'S VOICE  
                        Well it's very well made, but it lacks 
                        decency.   

           Coppola goes white.     

                                 NICHOLAS ROEG'S VOICE  
                        It's a doom-laden, black, nasty thing 
                        that pretends to present a Leftist 
                        critique of the system when in fact it 
                        slyly promotes the privatization of 
                        government services, while replacing 
                        civic responsibility with a cold 
                        corporatocracy.  It’s a very right-
                        wing philosophy.     

           Coppola looks devastated.  He empties his champagne into a potted 
           plant, sickened w/himself.   

           Ruddy joins him, ecstatic about: 

                                 RUDDY  
                        Hear what that schmoozer Bluhdorn did?     

                                 COPPOLA  
                             (distracted)  
                        What? 
                                 RUDDY  
                        He angled the success of Puzo's book 
                        to totally con the theater exhibitors 
                        into doling out money up front.  
                        Almost thirty million bucks.   

           This gets Coppola's attention.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        How'd he pull that off?   

                                 RUDDY  
                        He "made them an offer they couldn't 
                        refuse": if you want the movie now, 
                        pay us money now.  

                                 COPPOLA  
                        And the theaters agreed?   

                                 RUDDY 
                        The theaters want to cash in on the 
                        book's success.  
                             (commenting)  
                        I'm telling you, pal, this is the 
                        start of a new era.      

           Guests are DING!—DING!—DING! into the main screening room.   
           Ruddy leads a queasy-looking Coppola onwards.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It's all about the money, isn't it?  
                        Not art or truth, or even 
                        entertainment.  It's all about the 
                        dollars.   

           Ruddy, not listening, is scoping around for: 

                                 RUDDY 
                        Where's Evans?   

           INT.  ASTOR THEATER – BALCONY – NIGHT  

           Evans surveys the crowd below.  Ali is behind him.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You still wanna play Daisy Buchanan?  
                        Because I wouldn’t get your hopes up.  
                        Robert Towne just turned down 175 
                        thousand bucks.  Can you believe that?   
                        It gets better.  He wants twenty-five 
                        grand to write something I couldn't 
                        tell you what it's about.  I swear, 
                        the "Great Gatsby" is cursed, you 
                        know, like "Macbeth" or--  

           He cuts himself off when he notices something in a mirrored-
           reflection. 

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)    
                        Hey.  Where's your wedding ring? 

                                 ALI 
                        Bob…?   
           That awful word -- "Bob."  Evans’ face slowly creases with a 
           horrible realization that something terrible is about to happen.   

                                 ALI (CONT'D)  
                        We need to talk.   

           Evans turns around.  Ali is struggling to maintain eye contact, 
           ashamed, holding back the tears.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You've met someone.   

                                 ALI 
                             (blurting out) 
                        N--no.   

                                 EVANS 
                        You're lying, Ali.     

                                 ALI  
                        Yes.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Is it who I think it is?    

                                 ALI  
                        Yes.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Is it too late?  Can I do something to 
                        change things?   

                                 ALI  
                        You won't change, Evans.  You can't.  
                        You love the game too much.   

                                 EVANS  
                        I love you.   

                                 ALI  
                        I'll always be second.   

                                 EVANS  
                        What about Josh? 

                                 ALI  
                        You're his father, that won't ever 
                        change.  Never.  And I won't hit you 
                        for alimony.   

                                 EVANS  
                        You wouldn't need to, I'll always pay 
                        for-- 

                                 ALI  
                        Stop.  No one is warmer or more 
                        generous than you, Evans.     

                                 EVANS  
                        But it's not enough?   

                                 ALI  
                        I'm the one who's not enough for you, 
                        Evans.  That's the problem.   
                                 EVANS 
                        Ali… 

           People rush in, on a high, semi-drunk -- it's screening time.   

           They whisk Evans away.  He, in stunned silence, goes with the 
           forward-moving flow.  Looks back at Ali as she recedes, smaller 
           and smaller...a blur.   

           INT.  ASTOR THEATER – FOYER – MINUTES LATER 

           Coppola waits outside the screening room.  On automatic pilot, he 
           exchanges polite smiles and handshakes with well-wishers,.    

           Evans is placed beside him.   

           There, both men stand, shoulder to shoulder.   
           Each reeling from their private hell. 

                                 EVANS 
                             (absently)  
                        Any interest in adapting Fitzgerald?

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Yeah.  Sure.  What the hell, right?  
                        God knows I have a family to support.   

                                 EVANS  
                        Don'tcha think "The Godfather" will 
                        bring you some cash.   

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I think we missed an opportunity and 
                        failed.  

           Evans looks at him.   

                                 COPPOLA   
                        We took a popular, pulpy, salacious 
                        novel and turned it into a bunch of 
                        guys yammering in the dark about 
                        capitalistic survival games.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Yeah.  I suppose we did. 

           It's go time.  They start to walk in.   

           INT.  SCREENING AUDITORIUM – SAME  

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Was it worth it?   

                                 EVANS  
                        No.   
                             (beat)  
                        But I’m damned if I can think of one 
                        thing I'd do differently.  
           Coppola "hmm's" in agreement.  They move down an aisle. 

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)  
                        You regret directing this picture? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        You know it’s funny, Evans, but it 
                        occurs to me that I’m not the man or 
                        the filmmaker, I thought I was.  

                                 EVANS  
                        Who are you? 

                                 COPPOLA  
                        Someone who wants to be famous.   
                             (beat)  
                        And rich.     

                                 EVANS  
                        Isn’t that how it goes for all of us?    

                                 COPPOLA  
                        It’s not very honorable, is it?   

                                 EVANS  
                        It is what it is, Francis.     

           They sit down in their designated seats.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Is that all there is, Evans?   

                                 EVANS  
                        God I hope not, Francis.   

           Lights go down.  Projector starts up.  Our VIEW imperceptibly 
           begins to loosen on Evans & Coppola, illuminated by the 
           flickering blue light of the screen.   

                                 COPPOLA 
                        Where are we going? 

                                 EVANS  
                        I don't know.  To a better place, 
                        let’s hope.       

                                 COPPOLA  
                        I think to make it work the way we 
                        want it to work, we have to do more 
                        than hope.   

           We hear four famous words from the screen:  

                          “I believe in America”   

                                                       FADE OUT: 

                                   The End
