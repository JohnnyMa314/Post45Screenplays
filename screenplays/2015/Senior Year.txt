           INT. RUBY SUE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Three outfits laid out on a bed: shoulder pads, bright 
           colors, crazy patterns. All very 90s. 

           RUBY SUE CONWAY (17) twirls her hair as she ponders which one 
           to wear. Flawless skin, perfect body, piercing eyes - she’s 
           every boy’s dream.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (to herself)
                        First Day. Senior year. Most 
                        important decision of your life. 

                                 MOM CONWAY (O.S.)
                        Ruby Sue! Breakfast is ready!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I heard you the first time! What 
                        the fuck!?

           She cranks up the volume on her radio - Third Eye Blind’s 
           Semi-charmed life drowns out her mother’s retort.

           ON SCREEN CHYRON: 1997

           She reaches for the most dated outfit of the three.

           EXT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           A red convertible screeches to a halt. Ruby’s best friend 
           BRIE and her boyfriend CAM are chilling in the back seat. 

           Behind the wheel, Ruby’s boyfriend: BLAINE BARNES (17), star 
           quarterback. Square jaw, chin dimple, Top Gun attitude. He 
           rocks sideburns like a young Luke Perry.

           Ruby Sue hops over the door and gets busy making out with 
           Blaine right away. He floors it, mid face suck.

                                 BRIE AND CAM
                        Woooo! Seniors!

           Brie and Cam raise their arms in victory. The car speeds away 
           as Third Eye Blind plays us out.

           INT. HARDING HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING

           A locker door slams. Reveal: Ruby Sue and Brie. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        This is our year, Brie.
                                 BRIE
                        Totally. So fresh.

           As they stroll down the hallway...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        It’s just like we dreamed it. Me as 
                        prom queen. You as my friend. 
                        Nothing’s gonna get in our way.

           They turn the corner and see...

           The new girl, TIFFANY BAXTER (17): big hair, big breasts, 
           prom queen dreams and she’s talking to Blaine. Her 
           flirtatious, over the top laughter finds its way to...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        What. The. Slut!?

                                 BRIE
                        Remember Tiffany Baxter from cheer 
                        camp? She moved into our district. 
                        No big.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No big?! Seriously? They look 
                        pretty fucking big to me.

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah, her tits grew like two full 
                        cup sizes, but whatever. Big tits 
                        are like... so last year. Guys like 
                        eyebrows now.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah? When’s the last time a guy 
                        tried to feel up your eyebrows?

           Leaving Brie without an answer, she marches toward Tiffany.

                                 BRIE
                        Don’t even sweat it, Ruby.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I’m not even sweating it! As if...
                         (abruptly)
                        Hey Blaine!

                                 TIFFANY
                        Hey, Ruby Sue!

           Pretending that she just now notices Tiffany...
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oh hi. Who are you?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Really? Cheer camp. Every summer 
                        for the last five years...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Rachel?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Tiffany.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        But you look like a Rachel. You 
                        should think about that. Names are 
                        important.
                         (off Tiffany’s look)
                        Can you excuse me for a second 
                        while I talk to my boyfriend?

           She positions herself between Tiffany and Blaine.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        We need to talk about what we’re 
                        wearing to prom this year! Have you 
                        thought about it? 

                                 BLAINE
                        It’s the first day of school, Ruby.

           He looks past Ruby, making eye contact with Tiffany.

                                 BLAINE (CONT’D)
                        I mean... a lot can happen between 
                        now and then.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I know! I’m just saying. I want us 
                        to look good in our crowns.

                                 BLAINE
                        Seriously, Ruby? Is that all you 
                        think about?

           The bell rings. As the hallway clears...

                                 BLAINE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go to history or math or 
                        something.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You’re starting quarterback, you 
                        don’t have to go to class!
           Ruby Sue, left alone in the hallway, checks her look in the 
           reflection of a trophy case.

           Push through the reflection, revealing: photos of prom kings 
           and queens from years gone by. 

           INT. HARDING HIGH - CHEMISTRY CLASS 

           Students funnel into class. SETH NOVACELIK (17) stares at 
           Ruby Sue from across the room. Black t-shirt, black jeans, 
           very metal. His best attempt at not being awkward.

           He puts his books down next to his best friend, ODIE (17).

                                 ODIE
                        Seth, what are you doing?

                                 SETH
                        I’m sitting next to my best friend. 
                        What are you doing? 

           Odie physically lifts Seth out of the chair.

                                 ODIE
                        I cracked the code. I know how he 
                        picks the lab partners. I can pair 
                        us up with the girls of our dreams.

           Odie looks over at the CHEMISTRY TEACHER (50s).

                                 ODIE (CONT’D)
                        He does it the same way every 
                        class. Total number of kids, divide 
                        it by 2, then we count off. Ones 
                        pair with threes, twos pair with 
                        fours. Is any of this making sense? 

           We see what Seth sees: little numbers appear over each 
           student’s head as he does the math.

                                 SETH
                        So my partner would be...

           Seth’s number matches up with a FAT KID picking his nose.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Oh Jesus God, no. Not Glenn.

           Seth looks over at Ruby Sue.

                                 ODIE (O.S)
                        Unlimited spank material with an 
                        outside shot at hand joes.
           The number above Ruby Sue’s head sparkles. The same number 
           hovers over an empty seat on the other side of the room. A 
           KID ON CRUTCHES inches his towards the open seat.

                                 ODIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Thank me later.

           ON SETH

           Sprinting for the seat. He goes airborne. The kid on crutches 
           positions himself to sit down. Seth lowers his shoulder and 
           takes the kid out. Blind-sided, the kid hits the floor. Seth 
           sits down, composing himself.

                                 KID ON CRUTCHES
                         (making a scene)
                        Are you serious, Novacelik!? That 
                        was my seat.

                                 SETH
                         (under his breath)
                        Just take it easy, man. Hold on.

           He goes in his pocket and hands the kid some bills.

                                 KID ON CRUTCHES
                        Two dollars! 

                                 CHEMISTRY TEACHER
                        Is there a problem here, fellas?

                       SETH
                                               KID ON CRUTCHES
           Nope. 
                                         This prick took my seat!

           Ruby Sue looks back at them, making accusatory eye contact at 
           Seth. He quickly averts his gaze.

                                 CHEMISTRY TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna be switching seats in a 
                        minute to pair up for lab partners 
                        so it really doesn’t matter where 
                        you sit right now.

           Seth looks back at Odie. Odie winks at him, knowingly.

           The chemistry teacher walks back up front. The kid jabs Seth 
           in the ribs with the knob of his crutch.

                                 KID ON CRUTCHES
                        Fuck you, Novacelik. Fucking creep.

           Seth takes the shot and cringes. We fade out as the teacher 
           starts his count.
           INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - LATER

           Seth, now sharing a desk with Ruby Sue spots Odie at a desk 
           with Brie. The plan worked. They silently celebrate, flashing 
           heavy metal horns to each other.

           They stop as soon as the girls look up. Once the boys put 
           their heads down, the girls make gag faces at each other.

                                 SETH
                        Some of these assignments might 
                        require us to meet up outside of 
                        class. So you’ll have to pick me 
                        up. Still working on the license.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Look, I don’t know what kind of 
                        scam you and your weirdo friend 
                        pulled back there to get partner’d 
                        with me and Brie... but it tells me 
                        you’re pretty smart.

                                 SETH
                        Guilty.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        This chemistry stuff probably comes 
                        really easy for you doesn’t it?

                                 SETH
                        I mean, yeah. I don’t drink or 
                        smoke or go to parties or anything 
                        like that so my brain is like, you 
                        know, laser focused.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You’re really amazing like a little 
                        bit. I’m terrible at science.

           She touches his arm. A jizz rocket shoots down his spine.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT'D)
                        Get me an A in this class and I’m 
                        gonna owe you a lot of favors.

           All Seth hears is handjoes. He fumbles with a beaker, 
           catching it just before it falls off the table.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, another bad grade is gonna 
                        kill my GPA. I’ll probably be stuck 
                        in this town forever.
                                 SETH
                        Not on my watch. And my watch has 
                        Dave Mustaine on it.

           He flashes his Megadeath watch. He’s that clueless.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I don’t know how to interpret that.

                                 SETH
                        Have no fear. Chem-master Seth is 
                        here.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Seth and Odie, sitting next to each other, working on the 
           assignment while...

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Everybody’s eyes naturally go to 
                        the top of the pyramid.

           Ruby Sue and Brie sit together bullshitting.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        So I do this vogue thing then 
                        transition into something like... 
                        Hiyah! Sporty Spice.

           Ruby throws a kick.

                                 BRIE
                        So much girl power.

           The girls high five.

           Seth works on the assignment while Odie brags.

                                 ODIE
                        See man? Chicks like these, they’re 
                        begging for bad boys like us.

                                 SETH
                        Oh yeah, no doubt. Hey, can you 
                        check my math on this?

           Seth slides the paper over for Odie to check.

                                 ODIE
                        I mean, why should Blaine Barnes 
                        get to finger pop these chicks? 
                        What’s he got that we don’t?
                         (looking at the paper)

                                 ODIE (CONT'D)
                        No, see, this is wrong. It’s 
                        supposed to be an isotope.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY - LATER

           Ruby Sue holds court at the cool kid table.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What if I get my parents a ski trip 
                        for their anniversary?

                                 BRIE
                        Awww.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        And when they’re gone I’ll throw 
                        the most bitchin’ party ever.

           As her friends laugh and high five, Ruby clocks...

           TIFFANY walking toward their table. Ruby Sue deftly pops a 
           fresh stick of gum in her mouth before Tiffany arrives at the 
           empty seat next to her.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Hey, is anybody sitting here?

                                 BRIE
                        No.

           Ruby shoots daggers at Brie.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, but there’s gum on it.

           Tiffany pulls the chair out and inspects it.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Really? I don’t see any...

           Ruby Sue takes the fresh wad of gum out of her mouth and 
           presses it onto the seat.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Sorry.

           She turns her attention back to the table like nothing 
           happened. Tiffany stands there for a beat.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Can I talk to you for a second?
                                 RUBY SUE
                        I’m kinda busy... eating lunch.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Because If I did something to you 
                        or if I threaten you some how...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You don’t threaten me.

                                 TIFFANY
                        So what’s the problem then?

           Ruby stands up, ushering her away from the table as...

           Blaine grabs a strawberry off her plate.

                                 BLAINE
                        Watch this. Skinny post. Deep 
                        route. Right off O’Dell’s dome. 
                        Gonna have to be a dime. 

           Blaine launches the strawberry across the cafeteria.

                                 CAM
                        That spiral is so tight!

           Following its trajectory to...

           SETH’S TABLE

           Where the strawberry bounces off Odie’s face and does a 
           splash landing in Seth’s soup.

                                 BLAINE (O.S.)
                        That’s good for six!

                                 ODIE
                        I’m gonna get that son of bitch, 
                        Blaine Barnes. Mark my words.

           Seth tries to dry himself off.

           ON RUBY SUE 

           With Tiffany.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Look at them - nerds, skeezers, 
                        wannabees, weirdos. They all want a 
                        seat at that table.

           Ruby ushers her through the cafeteria.
                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        But you know why none of them try 
                        to sit there? Because they’re smart 
                        enough to know they don’t belong. 

           Ruby Sue pulls a random seat out for Tiffany to sit on.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        So if you think you’re gonna sit at 
                        my table then you need to wake up 
                        and smell the teen spirit.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Is that how it’s gonna be?

           Ruby shrugs.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Everybody wants to be on top of the 
                        pyramid, but how can it stand 
                        without people on the bottom?

           Ruby Sue walks away, leaving Tiffany glaring daggers. 

           INT. HARDING HIGH - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           In close on a chubby face pleading for mercy. It’s GLENN from 
           chemistry class.

                                 COOL KIDS (O.S.)
                        Tubs of blubs! Tubs of blubs!

           Glenn clings to the side of bleachers as Blaine, Cam and 
           another COOL DUDE try to stuff him into the gap between the 
           bleachers and the wall known as “the crevasse”. 

                                 BLAINE
                        Tubs of blubs going in the 
                        crevasse!

                                 GLENN
                        Please! I’m afraid of the dark!

                                 BLAINE
                        I know, that’s why were trying to 
                        help you get over your fear.

                                 CAM
                        He’s not gonna fit!

                                 BLAINE
                        Oh yeah, he is. Look at him, all 
                        lubed up with sweat.
           Glenn’s chubby fingers slide off the ledge as Blaine’s foot 
           smushes his face into the darkness.

                                 GLENN (O.S.)
                        Nooooo!

           The cool kids laughter turns into another chant.

                                 COOL KIDS
                        Tubs of blubs! Tubs of blubs!

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        I can’t believe you guys did that.

                                 BLAINE
                        Take it easy, we’re just having 
                        some fun.

                                 TIFFANY
                        No, I mean, I can’t believe you 
                        were able to pick him up! That was 
                        awesome. You must be, like, the 
                        strongest guy.

           She flirtatiously touches his bicep.

                                 BLAINE
                        I know. I thought he was lying 
                        about being afraid of the dark, but 
                        the way he fought, man... I think 
                        he really is.

           Blaine and Cam high five.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Who’s afraid of the dark?

                                 BLAINE
                        Nobody. Just guy talk, babe.

           He winks at Tiffany and gives Ruby Sue a kiss on the cheek.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hey! Did you just throw somebody 
                        into the crevasse?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Uh... yeah and it was awesome.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        That’s so childish, Blaine.
                                 BLAINE
                        Jesus, Ruby! Why can’t you just let 
                        me be me! Everybody else does!

                                 TIFFANY
                        Yeah. Lighten up, Ruby Sue. Boys 
                        will be boys.

           Ruby Sue glares at her, furious. Seth, king of bad timing, 
           climbs the bleachers. Trying to act way cooler than he is.

                                 SETH
                        ‘Sup dudes! Hey, Ruby Sue.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (under her breath)
                        Oh God. Not this asshole.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Who’s this guy, Ruby? Your new date 
                        to the prom?

           Seth takes the bait, offers his hand.

                                 SETH
                        Seth. Novacelik. But you can call 
                        me chem-master Seth. Ruby does.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I do not call him that!

                                 GLENN (O.S.)
                        Seth? Is that you? You gotta get me 
                        outta here, man.

           Seth peers down into the crevasse.

                                 SETH
                        Glenn?

           Blaine and his friends exchange a look. Ruby knows the score.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, fine. Whatever.

           Blaine and the boys dump Seth into the crevasse. He goes in 
           easy compared to Tubs of Blubs.

                                 TIFFANY
                        See! Wasn’t that fun?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I guess you were right, Tiffany. 
                        I’ll see you at cheer practice.

                        We’re gonna have a lot of fun then.

           Ruby walks down the bleachers.

           INT. GIRL’S LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ruby Sue takes her poms-poms out of the locker. Brie sits on 
           the locker room bench with a clipboard.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        How many new tryouts?

                                 BRIE
                        Five.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        How many are realistic?

                                 BRIE
                        One and a half. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Tiffany?

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah. It’s like, you’d think they 
                        get in the way, but they don’t.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Alright! God! Enough about her 
                        tits. They’re all anyone’s talking 
                        about. It’s time we gave her a 
                        lesson in humility.

                                 BRIE
                        Yeah, totally. 
                         (beat)
                        What’s humility?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        It’s like... when you humiliate 
                        someone. 

                                 BRIE
                        Oh yeah, totally.

           Ruby slams the locker shut.
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON

           Ruby Sue paces back and forth in front of a dozen teenage 
           cheerleaders. Brie stands nearby with the clipboard.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Let’s go Bears! Pyramid position!

           The girls start lining up. 

           Tiffany climbs on top of MARTHA, a heavy-set brick house.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Hold up! I wanna try something... 
                        Martha, you’ve been such a trooper. 
                        We never could have pulled off the 
                        Hope Diamond last year without you.

           FLASH: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LAST YEAR

           Martha stands firm, supporting Ruby Sue and four other girls 
           on her shoulders and extended arms. Her body shakes, face 
           bright red, forcing a smile.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - PRESENTLY

           The other girls nod their appreciation at Martha.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I feel like you haven’t got your 
                        chance to really shine. I wanna 
                        make you top position.

           Martha’s eyes light up.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Tiffany, since you gained so much 
                        weight this summer, maybe you 
                        should be on bottom?

                      MARTHA
                                                   TIFFANY
           Yes!
                                         Are you serious?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Tiffany trembles beneath Martha’s full weight as she sits on 
           her shoulders. Ruby Sue circles them.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Back straight. I need a smile, 
                        Tiffany.
           Ruby Sue walks behind Tiffany, leaning in, she whispers...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Having fun yet?

                                 CHEERLEADER (O.S.)
                        She can’t do it, Ruby!

           We remain on Tiffany’s quivering face as Ruby Sue walks away.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Five more minutes! The first game 
                        is on Friday.

           INT. RUBY SUE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue and Brie sit in the window frame smoking cigarettes 
           so the smoke goes outside.

                                 BRIE
                        I heard from Lisa, who is really 
                        good friends with Samantha, that 
                        Tiffany wants to be prom queen.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oh does she?

                                 BRIE
                        It’s what I heard...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Well I heard that Tiffany caught a 
                        scorching case of gonorrhea.

                                 BRIE
                        Oh my God! For reals!?!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No, but after we tell everybody 
                        they’re gonna think it’s for reals. 

                                 BRIE
                        You’re like, an evil genius.

           They high five.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           The bleachers are filled with students and parents. The 
           football teams jog off the field for halftime. Blaine 
           purposefully bumps into the BEAR MASCOT, knocking him down.
           The cheerleaders sprint onto the field shaking poms-poms. 
           They get into a huddle.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        This is what everybody came here to 
                        see. It’s halftime, bitches!

           They break huddle and count off. Like a well oiled machine 
           they hoist each other into the air. At the very top, standing 
           tall, Ruby Sue beams.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Hit it!

           Music plays and she starts vogueing.

           DOWN BELOW

           Tiffany and Martha stand at the ready for Ruby’s dismount.

                                 MARTHA
                        I just wanna say, I think it’s 
                        super brave that you’re out here. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well, I’m not a quitter, Martha.

                                 MARTHA
                        I had a UTI once, so I can relate. 
                         (shrugging)
                        Wiped the wrong way.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 MARTHA
                        Because you got the clap from that 
                        truck driver...

                                 TIFFANY
                        What!? Who told you that?

           FLASH: INT. GIRL’S LOCKER ROOM - EARLIER

           Ruby Sue stands in front of a few of the cheerleaders.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Top secret you guys. Tiffany is 
                        going through a really bad case of 
                        gonorrhea and needs our support. 
                        And you can’t tell anybody! Unless 
                        it’s somebody you really trust.
           The girls nod. Ruby Sue holds up a towel, barely touching it. 

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        And be really careful what towel 
                        you use because it’s super contage 
                        and you don’t want people to think 
                        you’re a slut.

           She drops the towel into a waste bin.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - PRESENTLY

           Tiffany is red in the face, furious.

                                 MARTHA
                        So... was the truck driver hot?

           Tiffany snaps.

                                 TIFFANY
                         (screaming)
                        That should be me up there!

           Tiffany grabs a handful of Martha’s hair, pulling her out of 
           position, dragging them both to the ground...

           Transition to SLOW MO: the girls launch Ruby Sue skyward...

           Ruby Sue, soaring through the air...

           The crowd, gasping...

           Blaine in his football jersey, mouth agape.

           Seth: shocked. He spills scolding hot cocoa on Odie who 
           screams next to him.

           The deafening THUD pulls us out of slow motion. 

           The crowd goes silent. Ruby Sue - motionless on the field. 
           Everything is still, everyone in shock except for... 

           Tiffany and Martha, fighting on the ground next to Ruby’s 
           supine body. Tiffany screams and flails uncontrollably until 
           Martha goes beast mode. She scoops up her much smaller 
           adversary and body slams her directly on top of Ruby Sue.

                                 CROWD
                        Oooh.
           Fists clenched, Martha breaths heavily, slowly realizing what 
           everyone else knows.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK

           A heart monitor beeps.

                                                         FADE IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The room is dark. A silhouette lies in bed.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           The silhouette sits up.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        Hellooo--oooo.

           She bangs into something. It falls over with a clang.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What. The. Eff!

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The NURSE ON CALL is behind the front desk. Tracking Ruby Sue 
           from behind. The nurse has her head down, working.

                                 NURSE
                         (nose in her work)
                        May I help you?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. Can you stop whatever you’re 
                        doing and get me an orange juice or 
                        something? My mouth is super dry.

           As the nurse finishes up her work.

                                 NURSE
                        No, but you can go down the hall 
                        and get it your...
                         (looking up)
                        Holy shit!
           Reveal: RUBY SUE is now a 37 year old woman. Dressed in a 
           hospital gown, she sees her own reflection in the mirror 
           behind the nurse. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (to her reflection)
                        What are you looking at? Old Bag.

                                 NURSE
                        That’s... you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Who’s me?

           ON SCREEN: Present Day.

                                 NURSE
                         (pointing)
                        That’s a mirror.

           Ruby Sue waves at the mirror, puts 2 and 2 together - she’s 
           not a seventeen year old knock out anymore. She faints.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - LATER

           MOM and DAD CONWAY (60s) sit across from an empty desk.

                                 DAD CONWAY
                        What the hell is going on? I just 
                        want to take my daughter home.

           The door flies open. Enter DR. BILL (50s) - hyper focused 
           eyes, Billy Mays style ‘all natural’ jet black beard.

           Looking a bit disheveled, he tosses a briefcase on the desk, 
           immediately popping it open.

                                 DR. BILL
                        Sorry about that. Busy day. I’m Dr. 
                        Bill. Are you the parents?

           He pulls out a tape recorder and hits record. As...

                                 MOM
                        Uh... Your nose is bleeding.

                                 DR. BILL
                         (laughing it off)
                        Hey! Who’s the doctor here.

           He wipes his nose on a handkerchief.
                                 DR. BILL (CONT’D)
                        OK. Let’s get to it then.

           Dr. Bill takes a deep breath, steels himself. He leans in 
           close to Ruby’s dad.

                                 DR. BILL (CONT’D)
                         (dead serious)
                        When is the first time you showed 
                        your daughter your penis?

                                 DAD
                        Come again? 

           Dr. Bill pulls an anatomically correct doll from his case and 
           sits it on the desk, facing the dad.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is this?

           He slides a Polaroid across the desk.

                                 DR. BILL
                        You tell me.

           Mom Conway picks up the photo, eyes it carefully.

                                 MOM
                        That’s not my husband’s penis.

           Tilting the picture so her husband can see it.

                                 DAD
                        You son of a bitch.

                                 DR. BILL
                        Darlene and Bobby Vance?

                                 MOM
                        Conway! Our daughter was in a coma.

           She flings the Polaroid at him.

                                 DR. BILL
                        Ohh! I’m sorry. They got me running 
                        back and forth between the 
                        courthouse and the hospital. I 
                        swear sometimes I don’t know if I’m 
                        coming or going.

           He puts the tape recorder back in the briefcase. 

                                 DAD
                        We just want to see our daughter.
                                 DR. BILL
                        Right, right. Ruby Sue Conway. 

           He finds his file, gives it a quick read.

                                 DR. BILL (CONT’D)
                        OK. Yes. I met with your daughter. 
                        Interesting case. It appears she 
                        was unable to perceive any temporal 
                        changes while in the coma.

                                 DAD
                        What the hell does that mean?

                                 DR. BILL
                        She thinks she’s still a seventeen 
                        year old cheerleader. As far as she 
                        is aware, the accident just 
                        occurred.

           Off her parent’s wide eyed look...

           INTERCUT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Ruby Sue, now dressed in her 90s cheerleader uniform, sits in 
           the waiting room.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        My pager’s not working.

           She shakes the pager next to her ear.

           INTERCUT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 DR. BILL
                        It’s imperative that Ruby Sue be 
                        allowed to adjust on her own terms. 
                        At her own pace while we monitor 
                        and assess her progress. I’ll be 
                        watching this case very closely. 
                        The medical community is going 
                        learn a lot from your mistakes.

           Ruby Sue’s Mom and Dad look like they just saw a train wreck 
           happen in front them.

           INT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - DINNER TABLE - LATER

           The sound of silverware sliding across porcelain amplifies 
           the awkward silence.
           Ruby Sue sits across from her parents, not touching her 
           plate. They try their best to make things seem normal.

                                 MOM
                        Honey, eat something. Please. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (bitter)
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 DAD
                        Not hungry? After 20 years?

                                 MOM
                        I know this all seems overwhelming, 
                        but just remember that we’re your 
                        family and we’re all here for you. 

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                         (Thick African accent)
                        And these potatoes are delicious.

           Reveal: PETER (18), a Nigerian exchange student seated next 
           to Ruby Sue. He puts his hand over hers and smiles sincerely.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No. This is not working for me. 

           She stands up from the table.

                                 MOM
                        What’s wrong with you? Sit back 
                        down and finish your plate.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What’s wrong with you!? Replacing 
                        me with an African guy?!

                                 DAD
                        Not replacing you, honoring you.

                                 PETER
                        And I am honored to call you sister. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Is this guy for real?

                                 MOM
                        Apologize to Peter right now!

                                 DAD
                        The Ruby Sue fund gives foreign 
                        exchange students an opportunity to 
                        be a real American teenager.
           He gestures to some framed pictures of them with kids from 
           various countries of origins over the years.

                                 MOM
                        It gave us a chance to fill the 
                        void you left behind.

           Peter stands up.

                                 PETER
                        And I... one day dream... that you 
                        will wake to see all the good done 
                        in your name, just as you awoke 
                        from your coma today.

           Her mom almost comes to tears at his speech.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        For I am a Ruby Sue kid and I 
                        eagerly await the adventures in 
                        store for us. Together.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Has everybody gone fucking crazy!?

           Ruby Sue storms off. Peter looks at her parents.

                                 PETER
                        Have I overstepped my bounds?

                                 DAD
                        No. That was beautiful. Thank you, 
                        Peter. 

           Her door slams offscreen.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        You gave him my fucking room?

                                 PETER
                        May I also be excused from the 
                        place of eating?

           Mom and Dad smile at him and nod yes.

           EXT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           The sun rises above the neighborhood.

           Dad Conway steps out of the house with his briefcase and 
           coffee. He stops in the middle of the driveway, confused.
                                 DAD
                        Honey! Did you move the car?

           He sips his coffee, scratches his head.

           INT. CONWAY CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby is behind the wheel. A top 40 hit plays on the radio.

           She changes the channel to another song.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What happened to all the good 
                        stations?

           Focused on the radio, she blows through a stale red light.

           EXT. HARDING HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT

           Ruby Sue drives the wrong way through the parking lot, 
           cutting off other cars trying to park.   

           A TEACHER in SWEATER VEST, waves his hand at the violation. 
           She hops out of the car, tosses her keys at him. They bounce 
           of his chest and fall to the ground.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        In case you need to move it.

           She sashays across the parking lot toward the school.

           INT. HARDING HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Two SECURITY GUARDS have Ruby hemmed up. She drags her feet 
           as they pull her toward the office.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What’s your problem!? Get off me!

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ruby Sue’s parents and Dr. Bill sit across from PRINCIPAL 
           SMITH (60), a monotone, Steven Wright style speaker.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        It’s not that I don’t appreciate 
                        the importance of your situation. 
                        It’s that your daughter is forty 
                        years old.
                                 DR. BILL
                        Physically she is. But mentally, my 
                        area of expertise, she is no 
                        different from any other student.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Look, we offer nighttime classes in 
                        remedial subjects...

           INTERCUT. INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue sits in a chair across from a punk rock looking kid 
           with a leather vest and MOHAWK.

                                 MOHAWK
                        Are you like... somebody’s mom or 
                        something?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Do I look like somebody’s mom?

                                 MOHAWK
                        You look like Ronnie Halbeck’s mom. 
                        Did he get caught with cigarettes 
                        again? Let’s take an ussie and tag 
                        him on facebook.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        If you touch my face or my ussie, 
                        I’m going to empty a bottle of mace 
                        into your eyes.

           INTERCUT. INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 DAD
                        OK, I gotta question. Why the hell 
                        am I still paying school taxes if 
                        my kid can’t go to school here?

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Yeah, I’m still bumping my head 
                        against why a 37 year old would 
                        want to come back to high school in 
                        the first place.

                                 DR. BILL
                        She thinks she’s seventeen! Where 
                        else is she gonna go? 

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        There’s still the legal question...
                                 DR. BILL
                        Legal? Buddy. This is encouraged. 
                        We’re in the public sector here. 
                        They’ll make you man of the year.

                                 DAD CONWAY
                        That speaks to my point!

                                 DR. BILL
                        Sure it does! Look, I don’t need to 
                        explain this to an old war horse 
                        like yourself, but I get her deemed 
                        special needs and whereever she 
                        hangs her pom-poms gets a plump 
                        bump in state funding. Funds which, 
                        correct me if I’m wrong, get 
                        distributed at the principal’s 
                        discretion...

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        For no particular reason, I’m 
                        sensing my mind changing. Mister 
                        and Misses Conway, how would you 
                        like a freshly paved parking lot in 
                        your daughter’s honor?

                                 DR. BILL
                        Throw in a new scoreboard and you 
                        got yourself a deal!

           Principal Smith pops up and shakes the doctor’s hand.

                                 DR. BILL (CONT’D)
                        Play your cards right and I’ll be 
                        shipping you weirdos like this on 
                        the regular.
                         (to her parents)
                        No offense.
                         (to Principal Smith)
                        But you know what I’m saying?

                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (OVERLAY)
                        Remember when I told you 2016 was 
                        going to be a year full of 
                        surprises? 

                                                         FADE IN:
           INT. HARDING HIGH - MATH CLASS - DAY

           Two dozen bored to death teenagers look up at Principal Smith 
           from their desks.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Well here’s one - your new 
                        classmate, Ruby Sue Conway. She’s 
                        older than my wife. Make her feel 
                        at home...

           He leaves Ruby Sue standing in front of the class by herself. 
           All eyes on her. She owns the moment.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Sup? I’m Ruby Sue. Here’s the 411. 
                        I like Dave Mathews and Jamiroquai. 
                        I’m good at field hockey, cheer 
                        leading and anything I put my mind 
                        to. I don’t like losers, back 
                        stabbers or bad perms. Thanks.

           The math teacher, MR. PATEL, stands up. He’s got a really 
           tight perm on his head. Clearing his throat...

                                 MR. PATEL
                        Thank you, Ruby Sue. I’m also a fan 
                        of Jamiroquai. Please have a seat.

           He motions toward an empty seat in the front.

           INT. HARDING HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

           Ruby Sue sashays through the crowded hallway, leaving 
           whispers and murmurs in her path.

                                 TEENAGE BOY (O.S.)
                        She’s older than my mom.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL 
                        I heard she was frozen.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL 2 (O.S.)
                        O.M.G. Look at her outfit. Are 
                        those pleats?

                                 TEENAGE BOY 2 
                        Whatever. I’d still hit.

           Suddenly, Ruby Sue stops dead in her tracks in front of a 
           wall of photographs. Everything else fades away. Like a 
           beacon calling her, she approaches the row of framed 
           pictures: every year’s Prom Court. 
           Tunnel vision on... 1997 

           Tiffany Baxter and Blaine Barnes, smiling at the camera.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        That shoulda been us.

           Ruby Sue snaps out of it. She’s alone in the hallway with 
           SETH NOVACELIK, now 37, dressed like a teacher.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I’m sorry? Do I know you?

           He takes his glasses off. Gives her a “how about now” pose.

                                 SETH
                        Nothing?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Look. I have a pass. OK? I just 
                        don’t have it on me.

                                 SETH
                        It’s Seth! From chemistry class...

           Drawing a blank, Ruby Sue searches her mind for a match.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Your boyfriend threw me in the 
                        crevasse. We laughed about it.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ohhh. Right. Yeah...

                                 SETH
                        I’m a teacher now. Chemistry. Go 
                        figure, huh? Matter-a-fact, you’re 
                        in my eighth period class.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oooh. I don’t think I’m gonna make 
                        that one, teach. 
                         (whispers)
                        Girl stuff.

                                 SETH
                        Yeah, no that’s cool. I get it. 

           He leans against the lockers, tilting his head down.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Actually starting a new chapter in

                         (beat)
                        Not for drugs.

           Clearly reading off the notes he scribbled on his hand...

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        The reason you woke up from that 
                        coma is standing right in front of 
                        you. Because now I’m ready. Ready 
                        to ask you what I’ve been asking 
                        myself for the last 20 years.

           He lifts his head. The hallway is empty. She’s gone.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Me and You.
                         (trailing off)
                        Why not?

           He sees her turning the corner in the distance. On the wall 
           in front of him, he notices - an empty space where the 
           picture from 1997 was. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME

           Ruby Sue enters. Suddenly a hundred talking teenagers become 
           silent. A fork drops. Everyone hears it. After a beat she 
           confidently marches toward the... 

           COOL TABLE 

           Ruby Sue reaches for her old seat. BRITTANY (17), the new 
           queen bee, plops a bag down so she can’t sit in it. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Can you move that hideous bag so I 
                        can sit in my seat? Thanks.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Uh... I know this is a senior 
                        table, but I mean... seriously?

           The cool kids at the table snicker and laugh.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Seriously what? That’s my seat. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Wake up call, lady. This bag 
                        belongs here more than you do.

                                 LANCE
                        You just got owned!
           LANCE (17), the coolest boy in school spreads high fives 
           around the table.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Is that like getting dissed? Did I 
                        get dissed? Did you just diss me?

           Brittany stands up, gets in Ruby’s face.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Let me tell you how this works. 
                        This is where the hottest haps 
                        trend, therefore where the coolest 
                        peeps hang. So go back to whatever 
                        cryogenic chamber you crawled out 
                        of because you’re not on this 
                        level. Two fingers. You’re out! 

           Brittany flashes a sideways peace sign to cheers from her 
           table. Ruby Sue awkwardly turns and faces the rest of the 
           cafeteria. It looks different, suddenly terrifying.

           She makes the long, slow walk to the other side. Students at 
           every table follow Brittany’s trend, moving their bags onto 
           empty seats so she can’t sit down.

           She reaches the end of the line, finds herself staring at... 

           THE NERD TABLE

           Ruby Sue plops down in a seat, feeling humiliated.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What the hell happened to this 
                        place? It used to be awesome.

           TIM (16), a skinny boy with a mouthful of braces, speaks with 
           a cracked, pubescent voice.

                                 TIM
                        Nobody wants to sit with you 
                        because you’re 40.

           An ASIAN GIRL (16) with bloodshot eyes, clearly high...

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        This lady’s a narc. I know one when 
                        I see one.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I’m not a narc, you nerd!
                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Yeah, well only nerds sit at this 
                        table so if you’re not a narc...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        First off, I’m not 40. OK? And I’m 
                        not a fucking...

           SPLAT! A blob of mashed potatoes lands on her face. Lance, 
           Brittany and the cool kids high five across the cafeteria.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (realizing)
                        I’m a nerd.

                                 TIM
                        Welcome to reality. I’m Tim.

           A big kid, LIONEL (17) extends some napkins so she can wipe 
           the mashed potatoes off her face.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Thanks.

                                 TIM
                        This is Lionel. It takes him a few 
                        years to warm up to you.

           Lionel lowers his head, averting eye contact.

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Way to go. You just made enemies 
                        with Brittany. She’s the biggest 
                        bitch in school.

                                 TIM
                        She throws the best parties though.

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        How would you know?

                                 TIM
                        Because I heard! Anyway she’s 
                        really hot so nobody hates her.

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        I hate her. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Why? What’d she do to you?

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Nothing. She’s just a bitch.
                                 TIM
                        She makes fun of Ruby Suh. A lot.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Wait, who, what?

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        She makes fun of me, OK. Geez!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, I get that part, but what did 
                        he say your name was? Because it 
                        sounded like...

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        Ruby Suh.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. That’s not gonna fly. You need 
                        a new name. She needs a new name.

                                 TIM
                        Why? Her last name is Suh. With an 
                        H. You’re Ruby Sue. With an E.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I don’t care how she spells it. 
                        We’re pitching new names for her.  
                        Everybody. Come on. Let’s hear ‘em.

           Ruby Sue takes out a pad and pencil.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m glad I sat here because 
                        this kind of thing needs to get 
                        nipped in the bud right away.

                                 TIM
                        Janet!

           Ruby Sue writes it down.

                                 ASIAN GIRL
                        I’m so confused right now.

           She squeezes her head with her hands.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Let me clear it up for you. Your 
                        new name is Janet. Deal with it.

           She tears off the page, hands it to the newly named - Janet.
                                 JANET
                        I feel like I should argue with 
                        you, but I’m really high right now 
                        so... whatever.

           An awkward beat passes.

                                 TIM
                        Um... Janet, are you gonna finish 
                        those fries?

                                 JANET
                         (not missing a beat)
                        No, do you want some?

           She slides the basket of fries over and he digs in.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           Half a dozen high school girls in tights and work out clothes 
           are warming up and stretching on the side line. Cheer 
           captain, Brittany leads them through the drills.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Let’s go ladies!

           The girls line up in row. Brittany walks the line eyeing each 
           of them up and down.

                                 BRITTANY (CONT’D)
                        Chelsea. Tuck the shirt in or lose 
                        the gut.

           CHELSEA (16), chubby, unties the knot in her shirt, covering 
           her midriff. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT’D)
                        Sound off! Brittany!

           Brittany steps forward, does a high kick and twirl. Each girl 
           does her own variation on the move down the line.

                                 LISA
                        Lisa!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Samantha!

                                 CHELSEA
                        Chelsea!

                                 JESSICA
                        Jessica!
                                 MISSY
                        Missy!

                                 CHRISSY
                        Chrissy!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ruby Sue!

           The other girls look shocked. They turn and stare as Ruby 
           Sue, mid routine, is calling out her dance moves.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Roger Rabbit!

           The other cheerleaders watch with open mouths, but Ruby Sue 
           hasn’t lost a step.

           As she notices nobody is following her lead...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        You guys just gonna watch, what’s 
                        going on? Running man!

           She transitions into the running man. Then...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Sporty Spice!

           A high kick misses Brittany’s nose by less than an inch.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        And that’s how it’s done.

           She has to put her hands on her knees to catch her breath.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Little winded. Gimme a sec before 
                        you ask questions.

           A slow clap, steeped in sarcasm, breaks through the line. 
           TIFFANY (still hot at 37) steps forward. Her jacket tells the 
           story: she’s the cheerleader coach.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well, well, well. I needed to see 
                        it to believe it.

           Ruby recognizes her right away.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (with vitriol)
                        Tiffany.
                                 TIFFANY
                        Tryouts are over. Now take your 
                        cottage cheese ass off my practice 
                        field. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fuck you. I’m working on it and 
                        last time I checked I’m still team 
                        captain. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        You wanna have a cheer off? We can 
                        have a cheer off right now!

           Tiffany pushes her back.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I said... Tryouts are over!

           Ruby Sue gets in her face.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Nothing is over!

                                 BRITTANY
                        Mom! I got this! Let me take this 
                        bitch down.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Hey! You take bitches down when I 
                        say you take them down.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Mom? Ohhh, so that’s how those JV 
                        moves got on my team. 

           Tiffany takes a step toward Ruby. Their eyes narrow. 

                                 TIFFANY 
                        I think it’s time you get to 
                        steppin’. 

           Tiffany takes her jacket off.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Get to steppin’ up your ass!

           Ruby drops her pompoms. They’re nose to nose.   

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        You wanna squash this beef? 

                                 CHEERLEADER (O.S.)
                        Kick her ass, Coach B!
                                 TIFFANY
                        I don’t need to kick her ass. I 
                        already did. 
                         (to Ruby Sue)
                        I did everything she ever wanted. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        But I would have done it better.

                                 TIFFANY 
                        Guess we’ll never know. Will we?

           Ruby Sue takes a step back. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I guess you’re right. Nothing I can 
                        really do about it.

           She starts to walk away. Then...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Unless I invoke rule 17b...

           Tiffany’s eyes go wide. The cheerleaders gasp.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Once a bear, always a bear. Any 
                        cheerleader in good standing cannot 
                        be removed against her will.

                                 TIFFANY
                        We only made that rule because you 
                        were kicking girls off the team!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I guess it’s like a black fly in 
                        your chardonnay. Bitch!

                                 TIFFANY
                        OK. You wanna be a part of this 
                        team? I got one spot left...

           She snaps her fingers. One of the girls carries over the 
           mascot BEAR COSTUME.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                         (whispering)
                        Wear the bear.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You wouldn’t!

                                 TIFFANY
                        I would and I am. Wear. The. Bear!
           All the girls start chanting.

                                 CHEERLEADERS
                        Wear the bear! Wear the bear!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Stop it! Stop chanting!

                                 CHEERLEADERS
                        Wear the bear! Wear the bear!

           Two big girls grab her from behind, tying her arms back.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No! This is bullying! 

           Brittany places the bear helmet on Ruby Sue’s head.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (screaming)
                        I’ll murder your babies!

           Ruby Sue breaks free, arms flailing. She frantically zig-zags 
           across the field with the helmet on until WHAM! She runs face 
           first into a goal post and falls over.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER

           Ruby Sue stands in the spot where she parked her car. A piece 
           of paper has been taped to the fence. Her car has been towed.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        If I gotta eat one more shit 
                        sandwich today...

           She looks over and sees some kids getting on a school bus.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh. Fine!

           She straps her on bookbag and walks toward it.

           PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby Sue bangs on the door of the school bus. The BUS DRIVER 
           notices her, opens it.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Does this go to Valley Circle?
                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Hey lady. The yellow ones are for 
                        students. Why don’t you get an Uber 
                        or something?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fuck you, you’re the goober!

           The door shuts in her face.

           INT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Peter is at the kitchen table working on a laptop. Ruby walks 
           in, goes straight for the freezer, grabs a tub of ice cream. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (re: the carton)
                        What the hell is gluten free? Fuck 
                        it. I’m eating it.
                         (tasting it)
                        Oh, that’s pretty good.

           She goes to town on the ice cream.

                                 PETER
                        Sister Ruby! Do not spoil your 
                        appetite. There are frozen pizza 
                        bagels in the toaster oven.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What are you doing?

                                 PETER
                        Updating my social status online.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK, well, you need to stop surfing 
                        the web because you’re tying up the 
                        phone line and people are probably 
                        trying to call me.

                                 PETER
                        I assure you, no one has called.

           She walks behind him, looking over his shoulder.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        That doesn’t look like AOL...
           MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby and Peter eat pizza bagels in front of the laptop. She 
           looks amazed as he guides her through the new technology. 

                                 PETER
                        It is called wireless. 
                         (animated)
                        And it runs at the speed of your 
                        imagination. Whatever your inner 
                        most dreams may be, the internet 
                        can find it.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        For reals?

                                 PETER
                        For example, your father dreams of 
                        big breasted Japanese women, while 
                        your mother dreams of a more 
                        fulfilling marriage. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ew. I don’t wanna know about that.

                                 PETER
                        May I have the honor of creating 
                        you a facebook page?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No! Wait, what is that? Is it cool?

           Peter turns the laptop toward him and gets busy.

                                 PETER
                        It is a cost effective advertising 
                        scheme that disguises itself by 
                        making users feel important.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Why would anybody want that?

                                 PETER
                        Because it is the best way to keep 
                        track of your ex-girlfriend.
                         (beat)
                        Say cheese!

           She smiles on cue and Peter captures a photo of the two them.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oh hey, that’s a really good 
                        picture. It’s like instant!
           BaDing! The computer alerts them of...

                                 PETER
                        You have a friend request!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Really? Already. That’s gotta be 
                        like a record or something, right? 
                        Who is it?

                                 PETER
                        It could be anyone. Let us see!

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (excited)
                        Oh my God!
                         (instantly disappointed)
                        Oh shit. It’s Seth.

                                 PETER
                        Shall we accept his request?

           Seth’s profile pic is of him leaning against a Maserati.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (changing her tune)
                        Ooh. Is that a Maserati? Yeah. 
                        Click on that. Who’s all on here? 

                                 PETER
                        Everyone. Here are your parents.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Who cares? Type in Luke Perry.

           Peter types it in. Ruby watches the screen.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        What happened to his side burns? 
                        Ooh, I wonder if Blaine still has 
                        his? 
                         (realizing)
                        Oh my God, Blaine!

           She grabs the computer from Peter and searches for Blaine.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        This is great! It’s like a space 
                        age yearbook.

           Ruby Sue finds Blaine’s profile.
                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        There he is! Looking good! I wonder 
                        what he’s up to. I can almost see 
                        his abs under his shirt.

           ON SCREEN: 

           A photo of BLAINE (now 37), looking a lot like Luke Perry. 
           Scratch that, basically it’s Luke Perry.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        I was gonna play the field, but 
                        that looks like a nice landing 
                        spot. Look at his tan, it’s golden 
                        brown. So money.

                                 PETER
                        It says he is married, however.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oh yeah? Let’s see what the 
                        competition looks like.

           She clicks on his pictures, turns to Peter.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        These pizza bagels are delish.

           She turns back, sees Blaine with his wife... TIFFANY.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        What. The. Slut!?

                                 PETER
                        Ahh yes. Cheerleader coach, Barnes. 
                        Your friend has done well for 
                        himself. She is a mother I would 
                        most to like to...

                                 RUBY SUE (OVERLAY)
                        Fuck you! I’ll be home when I feel 
                        like it.

           EXT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A ‘96 Camaro, engine running, waits on Ruby’s street. Seth 
           leans against it - his best cool guy pose.

           Ruby Sue spills out the front door of her house, clinging to 
           a bottle of whisky. She stomps towards the Camaro. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What is that? Where’s the Maserati?
           He opens the passenger seat for her.

                                 SETH
                        Yeah, uh, that’s in the shop... 

           He slides the seat forward so she can climb in the back.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Why’s another dude in the car?

           Seth climbs into the passenger seat.

           INT. ‘96 CAMARO - MOMENTS LATER

           ODIE (now 37) is behind the wheel. Seth is turned around 
           facing Ruby in the backseat.

                                 SETH
                        You remember Odie, right?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Why would I remember Odie?

                                 ODIE
                        OK, so where we going?

           Ruby Sue hands him an address on a piece of paper.

                                 SETH
                        Wait. Is this where we have the 
                        faculty Christmas party? This is 
                        Blaine and Tiffany’s house.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. We’re gonna fuck it up!

                                 ODIE
                        Nice!

           Odie takes a swig of the whisky straight from the bottle.

                                 SETH
                        I’m sorry. Are you drinking? Hold 
                        on! What are we doing?

                                 ODIE
                        Donuts... on his lawn!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah! That’s what I’m talking 
                        about. Odie gets it.
           Ruby Sue and Odie high five over the seat. Seth shoots Odie a 
           nasty look. 

                                 SETH
                        Hey! I’m a teacher. She’s my 
                        colleague. We can’t be doing donuts 
                        on their lawn.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Don’t be such a pussy, Seth. That’s 
                        your problem. You coulda been cool, 
                        but you never had any balls.

                                 ODIE
                        Yeah. Don’t be a pussy, Seth.

                                 SETH
                         (to Ruby Sue) 
                        Excuse me.
                         (turning to Odie)
                        Are you outta your fucking mind?

                                 ODIE
                        How many times did we used to say 
                        we could hang with the cool kids if 
                        we only got the chance?

                                 SETH
                        Cool kids? Do you hear yourself? 

                                 ODIE
                        This is payback. Blaine Barnes is a 
                        piece of shit. He’s got it coming.

                                 SETH
                        You’re 37 years old!

                                 ODIE
                        Not tonight I’m not!

           Odie kills the headlights, leaves the fogs on. He pushes a 
           tape into the deck. Cranks it. 

           AC/DC Thunderstruck blares...

           EXT. NICE SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           The Camaro goes airborne, cresting a hill. Smashing through 
           the shrubs, it explodes a mailbox on impact.

           Dirt, mud and smoke are kicked up from the spinning tires as 
           it carves donuts on the front lawn.
           INTERCUT. INT. ‘96 CAMARO - CONTINUOUS

           Odie, bliss on his face, works the wheel. Ruby Sue attempts 
           to pour whisky into her mouth, but the centrifugal force 
           sends the liquid streaming into Seth’s face as he death grips 
           the dashboard for safety.

           Lights turn on inside the Barnes house.

                                 SETH
                        Get outta here, man! Go go go!

           The Camaro, spinning its tires, sprays hot mud against the 
           windows in the front of the house.

                                 ODIE
                        I’m trying, man! We’re stuck.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Lemme out! Open the door!

           Ruby Sue climbs over the seat, spilling into Seth’s lap.

                                 SETH
                        What are you doing?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Squashing beef. Lemme out!

                                 SETH
                        Are you crazy? No way! 

           She opens the door and face plants on the lawn. The Camaro 
           frees itself, hopping the curb, leaving her in the yard. 

           Police sirens go off in the distance.

                                 ODIE
                        Five-O. We gotta blow, hoss.

                                 SETH
                        No! We can’t blow! My date is 
                        taking a mud bath on the lawn.

                                 ODIE
                        Sorry dude. They’re not gonna get 
                        me. Not today. Not ever.

           Odie floors it, peeling out in a cloud of smoke. His finger 
           waves goodbye out the window.

                                 ODIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, Barnes!
           Ruby Sue gets to her feet. Like an injured boxer, she chicken 
           legs across the lawn, spilling booze all over herself.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (re: the whiskey)
                        Didn’t spill a drop.

           She downs what’s left in a single swig and smashes the bottle 
           against the front door.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (screaming)
                        Tiffany! 

           Police sirens grow louder as they get closer.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (screaming at the house)
                        Come out and face me!

           The front door opens. It’s Tiffany. Ruby charges at her with 
           bad intentions...

           WHAM! Suddenly she’s flying sideways. A police officer 
           tackles her from the side. They land in the mud.

           Ruby Sue looks up from her back at the HULKING FEMALE COP.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Martha?

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby Sue is handcuffed in the back of the police car, fuming. 
           Brittany, takes selfies against the police car as Ruby Sue 
           curses her from behind the glass.

           MARTHA, now a COP, is chatting with Tiffany and her husband, 
           Ruby’s old boyfriend, BLAINE. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Honestly, it’s not the property 
                        damage or that she tried to attack 
                        me, it’s Ruby Sue’s well being that 
                        I’m concerned about.

                                 BLAINE
                        Is that... is that really her?

           Ruby Sue’s screams are muffled behind police car glass.
                                 RUBY SUE 
                        Blaine! You asshole! How could you 
                        get with her?! She’s an STD whore!

                                 BLAINE
                        Yeah, that’s her.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I don’t want her to spend the rest 
                        of her life in prison, you know, 
                        because she missed so much already.

                                 MARTHA
                        So you don’t want to press charges?

                                 TIFFANY
                        The thing is, Blaine might want to 
                        run for office someday so we don’t 
                        want to appear soft on crime.

                                 BLAINE
                        Huh? What?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Why don’t you take Brit inside?

           He starts to walk away, but Tiffany pulls him back and jams 
           her tongue down his throat. Her one eye stays open to be sure 
           Ruby sees it. She does and she fumes.

                                 MARTHA
                        Ahem.

                                 TIFFANY
                        So yeah... I mean, I know Ruby Sue 
                        was the only one who liked you, 
                        Martha, but our hands are kinda 
                        tied on this one. We’re gonna have 
                        to press charges to the fullest.

           Tiffany goes inside. Martha gives Ruby a thumbs up as she 
           walks back to the... 

           POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Leaning against the car, Martha gives Ruby the news.

                                 MARTHA
                        I got her to drop the charges if 
                        you promise not to do it again.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I don’t know what came over me. I 
                        promise it won’t happen again.
           The bedroom on the second floor lights up behind Martha. Ruby 
           Sue sees Tiffany in the window wearing her prom queen crown. 
           She does a beauty queen wave then gives Ruby the finger.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (flipping out)
                        I’ll kill her!

           Ruby rages, slamming her head against the police car window.

           Martha spins around to see what’s bothering her, but Tiffany 
           quickly disappears behind the curtains.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Bill leans forward in his chair.

                                 DR. BILL
                        Would you say it’s like they’re 
                        judging you for how you look on the 
                        outside and not giving you credit 
                        for who you are on the inside?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Nailed it. Welcome to my life.

                                 DR. BILL
                        And you don’t see the irony in 
                        that?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What do you mean? Like a no smoking 
                        sign on your cigarette break?

                                 DR. BILL
                        Uh... no. High school can be a real 
                        struggle for a lot of kids. Not 
                        everybody gets to be popular. 
                        Little example. Talking about 
                        nobody in particular here...

           He leans back in his chair.

                                 DR. BILL (CONT’D)
                        Setting - locker room. A young 
                        freshman drops his pants. No big 
                        deal, right? Wrong. He’s the only 
                        guy not circumcised. Should that 
                        haunt him for the rest of high 
                        school? Is that fair? Huh? People 
                        drawing anteaters on his locker...
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Jesus! Who’s counseling who here?

                                 DR. BILL
                        I’m saying there’s a lot of good 
                        kids that catch a lot of bad 
                        breaks. That’s life. Figuring out 
                        how to live with that is what being 
                        an adult is about. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I don’t want to be an adult. I want 
                        to be the prom queen. That’s step 
                        one. Step two is weather girl. Step 
                        three I marry a governor. 

                                 DR. BILL
                        OK, but in the mean time can’t you 
                        just be friends with the kids who 
                        want to be friends with you?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Am I talking to a brick wall? 
                        They’re nerds! 

                                 DR. BILL
                        You know, Ruby Sue. Sooner or later 
                        people like you look back and 
                        realize there’s more to high school 
                        than being popular. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        And you know what people like you 
                        don’t realize? That I busted my ass 
                        to be popular. You think that’s 
                        easy? Being the best field hockey 
                        player, the best cheerleader, best 
                        looking. That didn’t fall into my 
                        lap. I earned that. Well, maybe not 
                        the best looking part, but I lived 
                        my life under a microscope because 
                        everybody wanted what I had and I 
                        never got what I wanted. 

                                 DR. BILL
                        And what’s that?

           She leans forward in her chair.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I want that fucking crown on my 
                        fucking head.
                                 DR. BILL
                        OK. Well, sounds like we’re making 
                        progress. I know I feel better.

           He reaches over and manually turns the little timer on his 
           desk. Ding! Session over.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - PEP RALLY - DAY

           The marching band plays a tune in front of the stage. Two 
           cheerleaders hold up a giant paper banner of a snarling bear. 

           Lionel plays tuba in the back of the band. Next to him, Tim 
           stares intensely at the triangle, dinger at the ready.

           Confetti cannons erupt as the football team, led by Lance, 
           bursts through the banner in their varsity jackets. They hoot 
           and holler through a column of pom-pom waving cheerleaders.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                         (total deadpan)
                        Give it up for your Harding high 
                        bears.

           He holds the mic out for a response and gets only the sad 
           ding of the triangle. The entire school is packed into the 
           gymnasium - bored and could care less. 

           Ruby Sue stands off to the side in her mascot suit, holding 
           the bear helmet under her arm.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Sounds like you guys are ready to 
                        take it to the next level. Ladies?

           Brittany leads the cheerleaders rushing onto the stage as 
           Principal Smith exits.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (CONT’D)
                         (to Brittany)
                        I warmed them up for you.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Sound off! Brittany!

           The cheerleaders sound off in front of the lifeless crowd. 

           Ruby Sue, dressed as the bear, runs across the stage. Playing 
           the role of hype man, she points at each girl and tries to 
           pump up the crowd.

                                 LISA
                        Lisa!
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Samantha!

                                 CHELSEA
                        Chelsea!

           Tiffany stands off to the side, looking on proudly, mouthing 
           cheers along with the girls. 

                                 JESSICA (O.S.)
                        Jessica!

                                 MISSY  (O.S.)
                        Missy!

                                 CHRISSY (O.S.)
                        Chrissy!

           Tiffany hits the music and the girls go into their routine. 
           Ruby Sue, dressed as the bear, joins in and dances with them. 

                                 BRITTANY
                         (through clenched teeth)
                        Get off my stage!

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (in the bear suit)
                        Your stage? I’m saving this mess.

           Tiffany fumes as she motions for Ruby to get off the stage.

           When the girls turn and wiggle, the bear turns and wiggles, 
           getting a little bit of a rise from the crowd.

                                 BRITTANY
                        I said... get off my stage!

           Brittany kicks her in the ass, sending her falling into the 
           laps of the marching band. The crowd roars with laughter at 
           Ruby’s expense.

           ON RUBY - helmet off, red in the face angry. She picks 
           herself up off the floor.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Son of a bitch!

           The bear helmet lands at Lionel’s feet.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (to Lionel)
                        Get me back up there!

           ON STAGE
           The girls do a brief acrobatic routine before forming a giant 
           pyramid with Brittany at the top. The music changes into a 
           classic 90s MC Hammer style tune.

           Suddenly, as if propelled by some unseen force, the bear 
           leaps back onto the stage!

           Ruby breaks off some funky fresh authentic 90s dance moves.

           Brittany is helpless to stop it from the top of the pyramid.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Get me down!

           Ruby Sue hammer dances across the stage. She spins in one 
           spot like a figure skater, faster and faster until Tiffany 
           kills the music. Ruby Sue stands before the shocked, silent 
           crowd, arms raised in victory. 

           Peter, seated in the audience, leaps to his feet and points.

                                 PETER
                        That bear is too legit to quit!

           The crowd erupts in applause.

                                 CROWD
                        Bear! Bear! Bear!

           Tiffany runs over and closes the curtains on Ruby Sue’s 
           celebration as the upstaged cheerleaders look on furiously. 

           EXT. FIELD HOCKEY GAME - DAY

           Less than a dozen people watch as Brittany streaks down the 
           field with the ball.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Pass it! Don’t be so selfish.

           INTERCUT: BENCH - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue is on the bench next to Janet.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ugh. If I was in there this game 
                        wouldn’t even be close.

                                 JANET
                        Yeah, they’d really be giving it to 
                        us. Coach made the right move.
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Are you kidding me? Field hockey’s 
                        in my veins. I’m the best player 
                        this school ever had. You got that 
                        loser blood pumping through your 
                        body, I’m trying to give you a cool 
                        blood transfusion.

                                 JANET
                        So how come you never play then?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Blood of a champion.

           The coach jogs passed them. Ruby shouts out to her.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Because our moron coach wouldn’t 
                        know field hockey gold if it 
                        screamed in her face!

           FIELD HOCKEY GAME

           Brittany weaves between two defenders and scores a goal. The 
           team celebrates around her as a whistle blows signalling the 
           end of the game. 

           BENCH

           Everyone celebrates on the field except for Ruby and Janet.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Why aren’t you out there 
                        celebrating?

                                 JANET
                        ‘Cause you said to watch and learn.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Then sit up straight. Posture sends 
                        a message. And right now yours is 
                        saying something ghoulish.

           Janet sits up straight as the team comes running back to the 
           bench, still in celebration mode.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Nice goal, Brittany.
                         (sotto)
                        Took you long enough.
           Janet giggles at her zinger. Brittany finishes up at the 
           water cooler and walks over to them.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Hey, Ruby Sue. There’s something I 
                        need to say to you.

           Ruby Sue stands up, fists raised.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You wanna do it?

                                 BRITTANY
                        No. Not fight. I just want to tell 
                        you that what you did yesterday was 
                        pretty bad ass. Everybody’s talking 
                        about it. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. I guess it was kinda dope.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Maybe you’re cooler than I thought. 
                        So I wanna like, offer you a truce.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        So offer it.

           Brittany looks at her friends. They nod in unison.

                                 BRITTANY
                        We talked it over and we want you 
                        to be in our study hall group. But 
                        we don’t really study though... 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Lemme guess, you talk shit on 
                        people?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Pretty much, yeah.
                         (to her friends)
                        Told you guys she was cool.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. Lets do it.

           Janet perks up.

                                 BRITTANY
                         (re: Janet)
                        Not her though.
           Ruby Sue looks at Janet who is still trying her hardest to 
           sit up straight.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oh yeah, of course not.

           Janet sleeks back into her ghoulish posture as Ruby leaves 
           with the cool kids.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           A few kids study quietly in the auditorium. 

           The cool kids hang out around Lance as he strums a guitar, 
           near the edge of the bleachers.

           Brittany and Ruby Sue climb up the steps and join them.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Lance is probably the best musician.

                                 LANCE
                        What’s another word for babe?

                                 BRITTANY
                        I don’t know. You wanna Google it?

           Ruby Sue looks shocked.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Umm, Brittany? Once you let a guy 
                        do that, no one’s gonna respect 
                        you. Trust.

           Brittany gives her a confused look. Changing subjects.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh my God, you guys, I forgot to 
                        tell you. I totally caught Mr. 
                        Novacelik checking out Tinder while 
                        we were taking our chemistry test.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Oh my God!

           Everyone laughs, but Ruby’s forced laughter is the loudest.

                                 BRITTANY
                        I know! I bet he spanks it in the 
                        bathroom.

                                 POPULAR GIRL
                        What a horn dog.
                                 RUBY SUE
                        He totally made a pass at me my 
                        first day back. He was all sweaty 
                        and nervous. It was disgusting. 

                                 LANCE
                        No way!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Wanna know the worst part? I’m 
                        pretty sure he finished. Like... in 
                        his pants.

           Everybody reacts, grossed out.

                                 LANCE
                        That’s a great story. You should 
                        write a song about it. I would.

           Ruby Sue leans over and whispers in Brittany’s ear.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (dead serious)
                        I think Lance wants to fuck me.

           Before Brittany can react, Lance jumps to his feet.

                                 LANCE
                        It’s about that time!

                                 BRITTANY
                         (to Ruby Sue)
                        Oh, yeah, there’s this thing we 
                        sometimes do that I invented...

                                 LANCE
                        Time for one lucky nerd to get 
                        tossed into the crevasse!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        First off, you didn’t invent that. 
                        And second, it’s kinda played out.

                                 BRITTANY
                        A, I’m pretty sure I did and B, no 
                        it’s not because it’s LOL.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I know we’re better than them, but 
                        do we have to physically throw them 
                        in a hole to prove it? Seriously, 
                        it’s... major redunds. 

           Everyone just stares at her like she’s nuts.
                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Whatever. Fine. So who you gonna 
                        throw down there?

           All the kids smirk, sharing a knowing look.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (less confidently)
                        So... who you throwing down there?

           Brittany takes a step forward.

           INT. CREVASSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue lands on her ass in the darkness. Laughter howls 
           above her.

                                 BRITTANY (O.S.)
                        FYI! Google is a search engine, you 
                        dinosaur.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (to herself)
                        Dammit! I just got played.

           She gets to her feet, squinting into the darkness. She hears 
           something moving nearby.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Hellooooo! I can hear you.

           The blue light of a cell phone screen illuminates a face in 
           front of her. It’s Tim Manning.

                                 TIM
                        Ruby Sue?

                        Oh yeah, right. What are you doing 
                        down here?

                                 TIM
                        Probably same thing you’re doing.
                                 RUBY SUE
                        I didn’t get thrown down here if 
                        that’s what you’re thinking. 
                        Somebody buttered the railing and I 
                        slipped. It’s messed up.

           A second cell phone illuminates Lionel’s face.

                                 LIONEL
                        Follow me if you want to live.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        How many of you guys are down here?

           The lights turn away.

                                 TIM (O.S.)
                        It’s a world that your kind doesn’t 
                        know about.

           Ruby Sue follows.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hold up! I don’t have one of those 
                        phone lights.

           She watches them disappear around the corner.

           INT. OBSOLETE STORAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue steps into a dead end hallway filled with overhead 
           projectors, VHS players, microfiche machines, etc.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Where are we?

                                 TIM
                        School storage. Underneath the gym.

           Ruby Sue examines an old, dust covered cabinet. She blows 
           away the dust and reads...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        This is the card catalog.

                                 TIM
                        The what?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        How nerds finds books...

           She wanders around the room, looking at everything.
                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Overhead projectors... Holy shit! 
                        Is that Oregon trail? What’s this 
                        stuff doing down here?

                                 TIM
                        It’s old and useless.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        But Oregon Trail...

                                 TIM
                        Once you get used to it, it’s 
                        really not that bad down here. Sure 
                        the drop is kinda jarring, but it’s 
                        a great place get some work done. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        That’s the most pathetic thing I’ve 
                        ever heard. Just tell me how to get 
                        outta here.

                                 LIONEL
                        Crawl through that vent until you 
                        get to the boiler room. 

           Another cellphone light appears, illuminating a ZIT FACED 
           CHUBBY KID (15). Orange Dorito dust surrounds his mouth. 

                                 ZIT FACE
                        Take thine enchantment. 

           He holds out a small bag of Doritos.

                                 ZIT FACE (CONT’D)
                        As tribute for the rat king. 

                                 TIM
                         (off Ruby’s look)
                        I should’ve mentioned the rats. 
                        Just give them Doritos and they’ll 
                        leave you alone.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. This is sick. How long has that 
                        dude been down here? No. Don’t tell 
                        me. I got a better idea...

           INT. CREVASSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby Sue stands illuminated beneath a beam of light shining 
           through the gap.
           She points to Lionel.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You, Andre, boost me up.

           The cool kids can still be heard having a laugh above them.

                                 TIM
                        They’ll just throw you in again.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I told you! The rail was buttered. 
                        Clean your ears out.

           She starts physically climbing up Lionel. He’s not really 
           ready, but he’s sturdy enough for it not to matter. Her foot 
           presses against his face.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           A hand rises out of the darkness, grabbing the railing. Ruby 
           Sue inhales deep like she’s pulling herself out of quicksand.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Look who’s back from the dead.

           Ruby Sue stands proudly atop the bleachers.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Look at you, back from the...
                         (insecure)
                        future.

           Every kid in class cranes their necks to see what’s going on. 
           Brittany gets emboldened and steps toward her.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Do you know who you’re talking to?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Somebody about to get that retarded 
                        smirk wiped off their retarded face.

           Brittany gasps.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Ohhhhh.

           Ruby Sue leans in close so just Brittany can hear.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (whispering)
                        Ya played ya’ self. 
                                 BRITTANY
                        You know what? I think this study 
                        hall is getting OLD.

           She turns around and walks down the bleachers. Her friends 
           follow her down the aisle.

           The door slams behind the cool kids. The other kids in study 
           hall look on in disbelief.

           BENEATH THE BLEACHERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Like the hand of God, Ruby Sue reaches down into the 
           crevasse.

           Tim grabs hold and with a boost up from Lionel he is able to 
           climb out.

           STUDY HALL

           Ruby Sue helps Tim back to his feet.

                                 TIM
                        How did you do that?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I stood up for myself. You should 
                        try it sometime.

           She looks back into the crevasse at Lionel with his hands in 
           the air like a toddler waiting to be lifted up.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (to Lionel)
                        Um, you’re probably gonna have to 
                        go that other way. I have a field 
                        hockey game and I don’t want to 
                        throw my back out so... I guess 
                        we’ll check you later?

           Lionel gives a thumbs up.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           An agitated Ruby sits across from Principal Smith. 

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        We received an anonymous tip that 
                        you used one of the words on our no-
                        no list. Are you aware of this? 
                                 RUBY SUE
                        A what list?

                                 PRINCIPAL WALSH
                        They’re banned words, but nobody 
                        likes to “ban words” in fear of 
                        being labeled fascists. So here we 
                        are, two adults using baby talk.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. So what did I say?

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        You said the R-word. I’m afraid we 
                        have a zero tolerance policy on it.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What the fu... udge is the R-word?

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        I can’t say it. All I can say is 
                        you fudged up real bad.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        So how am I supposed to know what I 
                        said then?

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Here. The one that starts with R.

           He hands her the anonymous tip.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hey! I recognize this handwriting. 
                        It wrote ‘slut’ on my locker this 
                        morning.

           Ruby Sue reads over the note.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t say retard anymore? 
                        Seriously? What do you say when 
                        somebody’s acting retarded?

                                 PRINCIPAL WALSH
                        I’m getting the impression you 
                        don’t understand why that word is 
                        offensive so I’m going to give you 
                        detention to think about it.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I can’t have detention. There’s a 
                        football game today. I’m the bear.
                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Maybe you should have thought of 
                        that before you used the R-word.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ugh! This is so retarded.
                         (realizing.)
                        Fuck.

           INT. DETENTION ROOM - DAY

           Ruby Sue sits in the back of the room, eyeing up the tough 
           looking kids in detention. The teacher in the SWEATER VEST 
           sits at his desk at the front of the class. He stands up.

                                 SWEATER VEST
                        I’m gonna leave you guys alone for 
                        a minute. But I’ll be right outside 
                        that door. So no trouble making!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Wait! I don’t think it’s a good 
                        idea to leave...

           Sweater vest is already talking on the phone.

                                 SWEATER VEST
                        What’s poppin?

           The door closes behind him. Immediately all the bad kids spin 
           around and face Ruby Sue.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        So um... Which no-no words did you 
                        guys say?

           They just stare at her. The nearest BAD KID takes out a 
           cigarette and lights it.

                                 BAD KID
                        Tranny.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You can’t say Tranny? Really? So 
                        what do you call a guy in a dress?

                                 BAD KID
                         (deadpan)
                        A woman.

           Ruby Sue thinks for a beat then...
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ohhhh...

           She nods like she gets it

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           The stands are packed with students and fans. The marching 
           band plays a halftime tune.

           NEARBY - GAME TUNNEL

           Tiffany gives her final instructions to the cheer team.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Alright, let’s go! Remember pretty 
                        girls in the front. Looking at you 
                        pizza face.

           The girls sprint toward the field, waving pom-poms. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Seth watches the cheerleaders take the field.

                                 SETH
                        Hey! Where’s the bear?

           Other people chime in until a chant moves the crowd.

                                 CROWD
                        Where’s the bear? Where’s the bear?

           INTERCUT: TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue charges down the tunnel, carrying the bear helmet.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hold up! I’m here to save this.

           Tiffany blocks her from leaving the tunnel.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Where were you?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Detention. Like you didn’t know. 
                        You sneaky slut.
                                 TIFFANY
                        Ooh. Detention? That’s a direct 
                        rule violation. I’m afraid I have 
                        to kick you off the team.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I am the team. You’re gonna have a 
                        riot on your hands if you don’t let 
                        this bear dance.

                                 TIFFANY
                        No, I think we’ll be just fine.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Come on! My parents are here! They 
                        brought hot cocoa and everything!

           Tiffany snatches the bear helmet away from her.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You disgraced this squad for the 
                        last time.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I don’t get you, Tiffany. You won 
                        prom queen, you married Blaine. I’m 
                        supposed to hate you, not the other 
                        way around.

                                 TIFFANY
                         (through clenched teeth)
                        We both know why I hate you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No. I really don’t. And believe me, 
                        I’ve had plenty of time to think 
                        about it.

                                 TIFFANY
                         (whispering)
                        How did you know I had gonorrhea?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Wait. What?

                                 TIFFANY
                         (screaming)
                        How did you know I had gonorrhea!?

           Ruby Sue turns red in the face, stifling laughter.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Oh my god. You really had that?
           Tiffany explodes, tackling Ruby to the ground.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You wanna wear the bear? You’ll 
                        wear it to your fucking grave!

           She mounts Ruby and hits her with the fury helmet.

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Ladies! Please!

           Seth runs in and breaks them apart.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        You have to let it go! Let it go! 
                        Both of you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Girl power kick!

           Ruby Sue throws a high kick that connects with Seth’s face, 
           knocking him to the ground.

           Seth is on his back, eyelids fluttering. Ruby points at him.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (to Tiffany)
                        You did that!

                                 TIFFANY
                        You’re lucky your boyfriend was 
                        here to save you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        As if. He’s not my boyfriend.

                                 SETH
                         (coming to)
                        Ahhh... What happened?

                                 TIFFANY
                        This isn’t over you bitch.

           Tiffany does a quick self inventory then storms off. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ow. That really hurt my foot.

           She shakes her foot out as Seth struggles to get back up.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Seth and Ruby Sue sit alone in the empty bleachers.
           Seth’s eye is completely swollen shut. His nose is stuffed 
           with bloody tissues.

                                 SETH
                        Does your foot feel better?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, the ice really helps.

           Ruby Sue, leg elevated, ices down her foot.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        How’s your face?

                                 SETH
                        Better. I can see shapes out of 
                        this eye now.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Tiffany is such a bitch. Punching 
                        you in the face and stomping on my 
                        foot. Who does that?

                                 SETH
                        You’re kinda right. Should I press 
                        charges?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Nah. That would be tacky.

           Beepbeep! The camaro pulls up behind the bleachers.

                                 SETH
                        That’s my ride.

           Seth stands up.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        You gonna be OK here?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, I’m totes cool. I just need 
                        to be alone for a minute. You know, 
                        like... reflecting and shit.

           Seth starts to walk away, then...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Seth. Wait.

           He turns, revealing a bruise the shape of a bear foot, 
           covering one side of his face. She pretends like she doesn’t 
           notice as she extends the bag of mostly melted ice.
                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Can you throw this out for me?

           She tosses the baggy at him.

                                 SETH
                        Sure.

           It spills all over him when he attempts to catch it. He looks 
           down at the mess. A car horn blasts.

           Odie rolls down the window of the Camaro.

                                 ODIE
                        What the fuck? Happy hour!

                                 SETH
                        You sure don’t want to come with?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No, I’m OK. I need to think about 
                        some stuff anyway. 

                                 SETH
                        Maybe some other time then?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, sure.

                                 SETH
                        For real?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. Just bring your Maserati, 
                        already. What the fuck?

                                 SETH
                        Oh yeah, of course. How ‘bout 
                        Saturday night then?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. Pick me up.

           Beeeeeeep! Odie lays on the horn.

                                 SETH
                        Awesome! Gotta go!

           Seth waves goodbye as he gets in the Camaro.
           EXT. FIELD HOCKEY GAME - DAY

           Girls run up the field in their skirts. Brittany has control 
           of the ball. A BIG GIRL on the opposing team charges her way. 
           Intimidated, Brittany quickly fires a pass to a teammate down 
           field. It’s intercepted by a player on the visiting team.

           The two girls move it down field like Lemieux and Gretzky, 
           crisscrossing the breakaway until they put it between the 
           GOALIE’s legs.

           Tight on the scoreboard, Bears: 0 Visitors: 5.

           BENCH

           Where Ruby Sue sits next Janet.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Come on! These girls suck. If I ate 
                        anything today I’d puke. I don’t 
                        know why they don’t put us in.

                                 JANET
                        Probably because we suck.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Even if you suck as bad as you 
                        think, there’s still no way it 
                        could stop me from lighting up that 
                        scoreboard. I could beat this team 
                        with you shackled to my leg.
                         (yelling at the field)
                        Move the ball!

           A whistle blows on the field. The COACH brings the team in 
           for a time out. Two girls carry an injured teammate in on a 
           roman chair.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        We’re getting creamed out there!

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh, fuck you. That girl has bacne 
                        and a voice like Louis Armstrong.

                                 COACH
                        Ladies! I need you to focus. OK, 
                        they’re bigger than us, stronger 
                        than us, faster than us. But what 
                        do we have?

           The team goes silent.
                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Teamwork! Looking for teamwork on 
                        that one, guys. Come on!

           Ruby Sue points to SHARLENE, the injured player.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Sharlene is injured, put me in.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Take a seat, grandma. This isn’t a 
                        knitting contest.

           The coach goes over to the Sharlene.

                                 COACH
                        Can you play?

           Sharlene shakes her head, no.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Alright? What are we down, five? 
                        Ruby Sue you’re in.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yes!

                                 COACH
                        Not you. Ruby Suh.

           Her finger lands on Janet. She freezes. The ref blows the 
           whistle signalling the end of the time out.

                                 JANET
                        Uh... I’m really high right now...

                                 BRITTANY
                        Stay out of my way, stoner.

           She purposely bumps Janet’s shoulder as she struts past.

                                 JANET
                        What do I do?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hit somebody!

           Ruby Sue shoves Janet onto the field. A piece of tape on the 
           back of her jersey covers up her name. Written in black 
           marker it says “Janet”.
           FIELD HOCKEY GAME - MOMENTS LATER

           Janet, head down with the ball, gets knocked to the ground by 
           a bigger girl on the other team. 

           Ruby Sue paces on the sidelines, fuming.

           Brittany gets control of the ball. She sprints up field 
           toward the opposing goal. Raising her stick to shoot... a 
           girl comes out of nowhere and steals the ball. Brittany 
           swings and the ball is gone.

           Instead of chasing after her opponent, she grabs the back of 
           her calf and falls to the ground, faking an injury.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Ahhh!

           A whistle sounds. The REFEREE runs up to her. It’s Martha, 
           moonlighting as a Field Hockey Ref.

                                 MARTHA
                        Gonna need another player, Coach.

           Brittany, Martha and the Coach look to the sidelines where 
           Ruby Sue is warming up by throwing air punches.

                                 COACH
                        Here comes a lawsuit... Conway! 
                        You’re in.

           Ruby Sue puts her mouthpiece in and sprints onto the field.

           She runs past Janet. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Keep the big one off me.

                                 JANET
                        How?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Tell her a story, blow smoke in her 
                        face, whatever you gotta do...

           MOMENTS LATER

           The two teams line up for a face off. Ruby Sue pushes her own 
           teammate out of the way so she can take the face off.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I got it.
           Ruby lines up across from a tough girl on the other team.

                                 TOUGH GIRL
                        I’m gonna bury you on this field.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Bring it. Butch.
                         (beat)
                        Sorry, Martha.

           Martha shrugs and drops the ball in between them. 

           WHAM! Ruby Sue delivers a forearm shiver to the girl’s 
           throat. She goes down gasping for air.

                                 MARTHA (O.S.)
                        Clean hit!

           Ruby commands the ball down the field, weaves through two 
           defenders and puts the ball in the net.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        That easy!

           Ruby Sue steals the ball as two defenders converge on her. 
           Her stick work is on another level. She knocks the ball 
           between a girl’s legs and regains it on the other side.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Welcome to the 90s!

           She cuts back and jukes out another girl, then rips a shot 
           past the goalie. The whistle blows.

           Down field, Janet watches in awe.

                                 JANET
                        You truly are great.

           EXT. TENNIS COURTS - CONTINUOUS

           Word spreads. Students and teachers get wind of what’s 
           happening. They jog over to the field hockey game.

           SOCCER FIELD 
           More kids get in on the action and jog over to watch the 
           field hockey game.

           EXT. FIELD HOCKEY GAME - CONTINUOUS

           Janet has the ball, head down and focused on controlling it. 
           The big girl on the visiting team comes out of nowhere. She 
           lays into Janet, knocking her on her ass. She steals the 
           ball, moving it back up field.

           Nothing between her and the Bear’s goalie. She winds up...

           THWAP! Her eyes go cross. Ruby Sue stands behind her, her 
           stick between the girl’s legs.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        We used to call that the vagina 
                        popper!

           The big girl drops to her knees and Ruby steals the ball.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Seth walks to his car, briefcase in hand. A few kids sprint 
           by him on their way to the field hockey game.

                                 SETH
                        Whoa! Where’s the fire?

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Crazy old lady’s lighting up the 
                        scoreboard.

                                 SETH
                        Crazy old..? Oh my God, Ruby Sue!

           EXT. FIELD HOCKEY GAME - MOMENTS LATER

           SCOREBOARD - Bears: 6 Visitors: 6

           Half the student body is crowded around the field hockey 
           game. Seth pushes his way through the mass of bodies.

           NEARBY: The team is huddled around Ruby Sue. She’s doubled 
           over, hands on her knees sucking wind.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Ok, I scored the last six goals. I 
                        don’t think they’re gonna let me 
                        score another one. Somebody else 
                        needs to step up.
                                 MARTHA
                        Let’s go ladies. Clock is ticking.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Janet, get open.

                                 JANET
                         (to herself)
                        Why me?

           Ruby Sue is already jogging across the field.

           CROWD

           Seth, now at the front of the crowd, watches the action.

                                 SETH
                        Come on, Ruby!

           Brittany, stuck behind the growing wall of spectators can’t 
           even see her own game.

           FACE OFF

           Martha prepares to drop the ball.

                                 MARTHA
                        This is the kinda hard nose field 
                        hockey I been waiting to see for 
                        twenty years. Now finish strong!

           She drops the ball. Ruby Sue wins the face off. Half the 
           opposing team converges on her, five sticks hacking at her 
           ankles as... the big girl lowers her shoulder...

           Ruby Sue hits the dirt, but the ball is soaring through the 
           air... The crowd watches it sail toward...

                                 JANET
                        Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.

           The ball drops right in front her. She hits it as hard as she 
           can. It’s a slow dribbler... under the goalie’s stick. GOAL. 
           The whistle blows. The crowd storms the field.

           Janet is hoisted up onto the shoulder’s of her teammates. Mid 
           celebration, she spots Ruby Sue among the crowd. Their eyes 
           meet. Ruby Sue smiles proudly and gives her a thumbs up.
           EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Ruby Sue and Janet walk through the parking lot after the 
           game. A convertible filled with kids pulls up next to them.

                                 COOL GUY
                        Hey, Ruby Sues! We’re heading over 
                        to pizza dudes to celebrate. You 
                        guys coming?

           Ruby and Janet look at each other.

                                 COOL GIRL
                        Come on! It’ll be fun!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Uh, yeah. We were like, already on 
                        our way there.

                                 COOL KIDS
                        Nice! See you!

           The convertible speeds off.

                                 JANET
                        Shit. I’m supposed to watch a Dr. 
                        Who marathon with my cousin.

           Ruby grabs her shoulders, looks her straight in the eyes.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (dead serious)
                        Janet. Stick with me and you’ll 
                        never have to watch another episode 
                        of Dr. Who ever again. I promise 
                        you this.

                                 JANET
                        Why? I like that show.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No... No you don’t.

           Janet, slightly confused by that, watches Ruby walk off.

           INT. TIFFANY’S CAR - NEARBY - CONTINUOUS

           Tiffany and Brittany sit in the car, fuming as they watch 
           everybody praise Ruby Sue and Janet.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Why’d you let her on the field, are 
                        you retarded?
                                 BRITTANY
                        Mom! You can’t say that.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Oh, gimme a break. I can’t say 
                        retard in my own car? What’s the 
                        matter with you? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        How was I supposed to know she was 
                        that good?

                                 TIFFANY
                        She’s good at everything! And now 
                        everybody knows. She’ll spread like 
                        a Goddamn wild fire and she’s not 
                        gonna stop until she has your 
                        crown. Now you tell me, how do we 
                        put something like that out?

                                 BRITTANY
                        Start a bunch of other fires, draw 
                        away the air and suffocate it.

                                 TIFFANY
                        What?! Are you stupid? You snuff it 
                        out before it starts.
                         (beat)
                        Build other fires? What are they 
                        teaching you here?

                                 BRITTANY
                        I play three sports. I’m in five 
                        clubs. I’m trying everything. What 
                        else do you want me to do?

                                 TIFFANY
                        I told you not to try and out high 
                        school Ruby Sue. But what did you 
                        do? You dropped the ball.

           Tiffany turns on the engine.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        From now on, I’m calling the shots. 
                        And your birthday party just got 
                        cancelled. That’s the first shot!

                                 BRITTANY
                        But Mom! It’s my 18th.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I don’t give a fuuuuuuuck.
           She floor it. The car jumps the curb and they speed off.

           EXT. PIZZA DUDES - EVENING

           Establishing: Kids walk up to the local pizza joint where 
           everybody hangs out after school.

           INT. PIZZA DUDES - CONTINUOUS

           Lionel wears a vertical striped red and white pizza shirt. A 
           little paper hat sits atop his head.

           He plops a cheesey, saucy pie down in front of Ruby Sue, 
           Janet and the other field hockey players. 

           Lionel wanders off as Ruby Sue holds court...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Dig in, you guys deserve it. 

           The other girls reach for some slices. Ruby leans over so 
           only Janet can hear her.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                         (whispering)
                        They totally don’t, but part of 
                        being popular is making people feel 
                        more important than they really are.

           The door jingles open. Lance, Brittany and their friends roll 
           in. Lance has a guitar case strapped to his back. Tim, 
           dressed like Lionel, greets him from behind the register.

                                 TIM
                        Sup, bros? Welcome to Pizza Dudes.

                                 LANCE
                        Give us a pie. We’re taking the 
                        table in the back.

                                 TIM
                        Uh... The one that’s reserved 
                        under... not your name? 

                                 LANCE
                        That a problem?

           Lionel and Tim share a quick look.

                                 TIM
                        Nope. All yours.
                                 LIONEL
                        That table was reserved for our 
                        moms, dude.

                                 TIM
                        Gotta pick your battles, man.

           INTERCUT. RUBY SUE’S TABLE - CONTINUOUS

           The field hockey players laugh and eat their pizza.

                                 FIELD HOCKEY PLAYER
                        Ruby Sue... say you like a boy, but 
                        you’re not sure he’s into you, what 
                        would you do to catch his gaze?

           Ruby Sue, busy chewing her pizza, mishears the question.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Um, yeah... That’s not something 
                        you can catch. They’re just born 
                        that way. Weird question though.

           The confused players scratch their heads at her answer as 
           Lance and Brittany stroll up to their table.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Great game today, guys. Great team 
                        win. Especially you, Ruby Sue.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Thanks, your leg looks better.

                                 BRITTANY
                        It was just a cramp. I’m good now, 
                        Lance stretched me out.

                                 JANET
                        Maybe phrase that differently.

           Ruby Sue high fives her.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah, Janet! That was a good one.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Anyway, I’m throwing a party this 
                        weekend. It’s gonna be awesome. You 
                        and your friends should come.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Really? That’s funny because I’m 
                        throwing a party too. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUBY SUE (CONT'D)
                        I was gonna make a big 
                        announcement, but I guess now 
                        everybody knows...

                                 BRITTANY
                        Oh! Maybe we can combine parties?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hmm. Well, I would have to invite 
                        you first.

           Ruby Sue gives Janet a look.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think, Janet?

                                 JANET
                        Lance can come for sure.

           Lance pumps his fist.

                                 LANCE
                        Nice!

           Brittany shoots him a dirty look.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Let me get back to you Brittany. 
                        It’s not a no, but it’s not a yes.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Whatever. It’s gonna be lame 
                        anyway. Come on, Lance. Let’s go.

           Brittany storms off. Lance smiles at Janet before he leaves.

           Ruby Sue catches Janet staring at Lance’s butt.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Don’t make it so obvious.

                                 JANET
                        What?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Your crush on Lance.

           Janet blushes.

                                 JANET
                        He’s not bad I guess.
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Whatever! You totally want to jump 
                        his bones.

                                 JANET
                        Shh! Be quiet.

           Ruby Sue lifts up her legs as if she were in labor.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (teasing obnoxiously)
                        You wanna have his babies!

           Lance looks over at them. Janet pushes Ruby’s legs down.

                                 JANET
                        Stop it! OK, yes. I wanna have his 
                        babies. Geez.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I can help you do that... If you 
                        want to pry him away from Brittany.

                                 JANET
                        You can?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Just be straight with me. What do 
                        you like about him?

           Lionel comes over, starts cleaning up loose cups and napkins.

                                 JANET
                        Aside from being like, the hottest 
                        guy... He’s really good at guitar.

                                 LIONEL
                         (coughing)
                        No he’s not.

           Ruby Sue raises an eyebrow at Lionel.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (knowing)
                        Interesting...

           REGISTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruby Sue approaches the register as Lionel fills up a cup of 
           soda behind the counter. His eyes are locked...

           ON JANET, in her seat, staring dreamily at...
           LANCE jamming on his guitar at the cool table. An unhappy Tim 
           holds sheet music up for him to read. Lance motions for him 
           to turn the page and he does.

           REGISTER

           Soda overflows the cup as Lionel continues to stare at Janet. 

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Ahem.

           He notices Ruby Sue and snaps out of it.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Somebody’s got a crush on Janet...

                                 LIONEL
                        No I don’t.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Come on! You’re toast jelly of 
                        Lance... Did I say that right?

                                 LIONEL
                        That guy sucks. I’d play circles 
                        around him. Shred him to the bone.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. I don’t believe in tipping, but 
                        I do have a tip for you.

           She leans over the counter.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Bring your guitar to my party this 
                        weekend. I got a plan.

           Ruby Sue walks away then double back when she remembers...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        And wear your tightest pants.

           INT. HARDING HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Ruby Sue struts toward her table. A bounce in her step, she’s 
           feeling like a million bucks. 

                                 TEENAGE BOY (O.S.)
                        Hey, Ruby Sue! See you at the party 
                        Saturday!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fuck yeah!
           Random waves and salutations come her way. Meanwhile...

           At the far end of the cafeteria, Brittany and the cool kid’s 
           table seems far less appealing now.

           RUBY SUE’S TABLE

           This is the place to be. Ruby Sue takes a seat next to Janet, 
           across from Tim and Lionel. 

           The YEARBOOK GIRL (16) runs over to the table.

                                 YEARBOOK GIRL
                        I just e-mailed you those questions 
                        for the yearbook interview. 

           Ruby Sue pulls out a smart phone. Ding! The e-mail arrives.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Got it!

           The Yearbook girl exits.

           INTERCUT. HALLWAY, JUST OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

           Tiffany has Brittany cornered in the hallway...

                                 BRITTANY
                        Now everybody wants to go to her 
                        party instead of mine. Everybody 
                        thinks she’s better at field hockey 
                        than me. This is totally not 
                        working. You don’t even understand. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Brittany. It’s all part of mommy’s 
                        plan. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        For her to be more popular than me? 
                        Some plan, mom!

           Tiffany raises a hand to slap her. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Do you want me to slap the shit out 
                        of you in front of your friends? 
                        Like I did to your father? Hmm?

           Brittany immediately cools off.
                                 BRITTANY
                        No.

                                 TIFFANY
                        We need to appear weak before we 
                        strike. Didn’t I tell you she’d 
                        throw a party once she found out 
                        about yours?

           Brittany nods “yes” as another TEACHER waves to Tiffany. She 
           immediately puts on a facade.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Hey! How are you?

           Her smile turns deadly serious.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Now go in there and get yourself 
                        invited to that fucking party.

           Brittany sulks back toward the cafeteria.

           INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

           MISSY and CHRISSY from cheer-leading come over to Ruby Sue’s 
           table. Missy pulls out her iPad. 

                                 MISSY
                        Ruby Sue! Settle this debate. Which 
                        dress should I wear to your party?

           She squeezes between Tim and Lionel, holding up the iPad so 
           Ruby and Janet can see it. Her hair falls in Tim’s face.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hmm... Janet?

           Chrissy leans over Lionel, pressing herself against him.

                                 JANET
                        I kinda like the green one.

           Tim subtly takes a whiff of Missy’s scent.

                                 CHRISSY
                        Told you! Janet has like, the best 
                        style sense.

           Lionel and Tim excitedly fist bump under the table.

                                 MISSY
                        Yeah. We love your glasses.
           They run off together as...

                                 TIM
                         (sincere)
                        Thank you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        For what?

                                 JANET
                        Incoming...

           Brittany plops herself down at the table.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What’s up, Brittany?

                                 BRITTANY
                        So I need like... the biggest favor 
                        from you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. You’re not really high on my 
                        favor list right now.

                                 BRITTANY
                        OK. I know we got off on the wrong 
                        foot or whatever and most of that 
                        was my fault. I admit it, but that 
                        was only because my mom doesn’t 
                        like you. She totally pressured me, 
                        but I can’t help it. You’re cool.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Get to the favor already.

           Brittany grabs Ruby’s hand like she’s royalty.

                                 BRITTANY
                         (breaking down)
                        Nobody’s coming to my party. Please 
                        let me come to yours and say it was 
                        my idea to combine them. Please?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Awww. It’s like ten thousand 
                        spoons...

                                 JANET
                         (finishing her line)
                        When all you need is a knife!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fuck yeah, Janet! Nailed it.
           They high five.

                                 BRITTANY
                        So...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. Fine. We’ll combine parties. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        OMG! Thank you so much. This is 
                        gonna be the best time ever.

           She throws her arms around Ruby Sue. 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I know.

                                 BRITTANY
                        OK, there is one more thing though. 
                        Somebody has to buy us beer. Like, 
                        a lot of it. And vodka.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Jesus! Just show your tits to that 
                        homeless guy outside the liquor 
                        store. He’ll get you whatever you 
                        want. Amateur hour over here.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Wait, how long has he been around? 
                        Seriously. How old is that guy? 

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Old enough to get me a six pack 
                        last week.

                                 BRITTANY
                        But you’re over 21...

           Ruby Sue’s face says it all. She just now realizes this.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I know! Hello? It was a joke.

                                 BRITTANY
                        So then, if I give you the money...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yes. I’ll save your lame ass party.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Thanks. I won’t forget this.
           Brittany leaves. We follow her past a vent in the wall 
           where... Something moves behind the grate. Zit Face looks on 
           with bewilderment.

                                 ZIT FACE
                        The tides of power are shifting!

           A rat stands up on his shoulder. He feeds it a Dorito.

                                 ZIT FACE (CONT’D)
                        Patience, my little friend. Our 
                        time is soon.

           He sleeks back into the darkness.

           RUBY SUE’S TABLE - CONTINUOUS

                                 JANET
                        Ew, you really want Brittany at 
                        your party?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You know what they say. Keep your 
                        friends close and your frenemies 
                        closer.

           Janet nods her head, getting it.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

           Ruby Sue and Janet walk up to the liquor store.

           The creepy HOMELESS GUY perks up when he sees Ruby Sue.

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Hey! Alright. If you’re showing, 
                        I’m going...

           Ruby Sue walks right by, completely ignoring him.

                                 JANET
                        Is he talking to you?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        No.

                                 JANET
                        I don’t think I’m allowed in there. 
                        Besides I got weed on me, I don’t 
                        wanna get busted.
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Relax. Just act like you’re exactly 
                        where you’re supposed to be.

           Ruby Sue opens the door and steps into...

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby and Janet stand in an endless aisle of booze.

                                 JANET
                         (in awe)
                        There’s so much. Why is there so 
                        much? 

           She turns to Ruby Sue, already filling her cart with bottles.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Cotton candy vodka? This must be in 
                        like every statutory rapist’s 
                        liquor cabinet.

           She shrugs and throws it in the cart.

           REGISTER - MOMENTS LATER

           A CLERK smiles as he checks out bottle after bottle of booze.

                                 CLERK
                        You guys must be having one heck of 
                        a party, huh?

                                 JANET
                         (blurting it out)
                        I’m adopted!

           The clerk looks confused as Ruby Sue shoves Janet out the 
           door. She grabs the bag full of booze and is just about 
           outside when...

                                 CLERK
                        Excuse me.

           Ruby Sue makes a face, knowing she’s busted.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want to say anything when 
                        your daughter was here, but... 

           He leans over the counter, whispering...
                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        If I catch you showing your tits in 
                        the parking lot again, I’m gonna 
                        have to call the cops.

           He gives her a look that says “understand me?”

           INT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Ruby Sue’s parents are dressed for a weekend ski trip.

                                 MOM CONWAY
                        There’s pizza bagels in the 
                        freezer.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I know! We went over this.

           Ruby Sue and Peter stand next to each other in the kitchen.

                                 DAD CONWAY
                        Honey, they’ll be fine.

                                 PETER
                        I have printed some coupons for 
                        your ski lift and lodging.

           He hands them the coupons with a smile.

                                 MOM CONWAY
                        You guys are the best!

           She hugs them both.

                                 MOM CONWAY (CONT’D)
                        This is exactly what your father 
                        and I needed, Ruby. Thank you.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You guys deserve it! Now get outta 
                        here, already!

           Her dad gives her a hug and picks up their bags. As soon as 
           her parents leave...

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t sure about you, but you 
                        kept your mouth shut. I guess you 
                        are a Ruby Sue kid. Respect.

           Peter gives her a fist bump.
           INT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Music blasts. Full blown party: The living room is packed 
           with teenagers.

           Lance and his band supply the tunes, jamming out on a little 
           stage in the corner. 

           People make out, do keg stands, rip bong hits...

           A really HAMMERED DUDE wobbles through the crowd. He face 
           plants through a coffee table, landing at Ruby Sue’s feet.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Guys! Cut the music! What the fuck?

           The band stops playing. All eyes on Ruby Sue.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Somebody get me a sharpie so I can 
                        draw on this loser’s face!

           The crowd erupts! The band jams on.

           INTERCUT. INT. SETH’S BASEMENT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Smooth jazz plays as Seth stands in front of a mirror, 
           getting ready for a romantic evening. He holds two collared 
           shirts up to his chest, deciding which one to wear. 

           INT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           The party rages on. Flip cup in the kitchen. Ruby’s team of 
           field hockey players against some football studs. The crowd 
           cheers them on.

                                 CROWD
                        Go! Go! Go!

           Ruby gets the lead, but the football players catch up when 
           one of the girls can’t flip her cup in time.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Flip it! Flip it!

           It comes down to Janet and a really big offensive lineman.

           SLOWMO: Janet flips her cup, rotating end over end, until... 

           REAL TIME

           The crowd erupts.
                                 CROWD
                        Janet! Janet! Janet!

           The big lineman offers her a congratulatory fist bump.

                                 OFFENSIVE LINEMAN
                        That was awesome.

           INTERCUT. SETH’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Boink! Seth plucks out a nose hair. Winces from the pain.

           INT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Through the lens of cell phone camera: Ruby Sue, double 
           fisted, pours booze down two kid’s throats.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        We’re outta cups! Weeze the juice!

           Brittany, pokes her face in frame from behind the camera.

                                 BRITTANY
                        We’re so wasted!

           Everybody is having fun. A lot of it.

           EXT. BACK PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim is talking to Missy. Beer in hand, extra foamy.

           Clearly drunk, he puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                 TIM
                        I’ve masturbated to you before.

           She looks at his hand, resting there on her shoulder.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Not with that hand.

           He smiles awkwardly.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A sweet ass Maserati screeches to a halt at a stop sign.
           INT. MASERATI - CONTINUOUS

           Odie, in sunglasses and driving gloves, sits behind the 
           wheel. Seth looks nervous in the passenger seat.

                                 ODIE
                        Bennigans gonna be bumping tonight!

                                 SETH
                        Yeah, so hey, I’m gonna need one 
                        more tiny favor from you.

                                 ODIE
                         (feeling good)
                        What’s that?

                                 SETH
                        Think you can make yourself scarce 
                        once we get to her place? 

                                 ODIE
                        Fuck you! This is my boss’s car! 
                        It’s my ass on the line here.

                                 SETH
                        If you’re worried about the car, 
                        you can hang out in the trunk.
                         (off Odie’s look)
                        See, the way a date works...

                                 ODIE
                        Hey, the way being a man works is 
                        you go get a driver’s license and 
                        pick up your own damn dates. 

           Seth takes a deep breath, coming to terms with his reality.

                                 SETH
                        Then can you at least tell her 
                        you’re my driver?

                                 ODIE
                        Fuck that! Tell her what I told you 
                        to tell her: Odie is a mean party 
                        animal and he is down with it.

           Odie pulls a dime bag from his shirt pocket, flicks it.

                                 SETH
                        Jesus Christ! What is that?

                                 ODIE
                        Crushed Ritalin, son!
           EXT. RUBY SUE’S STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Cars fill up the driveway and lawn. The party rages inside 
           the house. Peter is sitting on the curb reading a text book 
           with a headlamp when the Maserati pulls up.

                                 PETER
                        Mr. Novacelik! What brings you to 
                        the house of Conway?

                                 SETH
                        Hey, Peter! I’m picking Ruby Sue 
                        up. What’s going on in there?

                                 PETER
                        You mean the festivities? Ruby Sue 
                        has chosen tonight to throw this 
                        year’s dopest party.

                                 SETH
                        Really? Tonight?

                                 PETER
                        Oh yes. I myself have elected not 
                        to go, for someone of my complexion 
                        must work twice as hard to achieve 
                        their dreams. Therefore, I am using 
                        this opportunity to study.
                         (off Seth’s look)
                        But if you follow the trail of 
                        drunk white teenagers you are 
                        assured to find her.

                                 SETH
                        Peter, I wish I could I say you 
                        were wrong.

           Seth points down the street.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                         (to Odie)
                        There’s a spot.

           INTERCUT. RUBY SUE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Janet watches Lance riff on guitar. He looks her way, winks.

           NEARBY

           Ruby Sue tops off Brittany’s beverage. 
                                 RUBY SUE
                        You know, Brittany. You wouldn’t 
                        even be that bad of a prom queen. 
                        At the end of the day it’s still 
                        gonna be my crown, but you deserve 
                        a piece of it. Like, figuratively, 
                        do you know what that means?  

           Lance’s band wraps up the song.

                                 LANCE
                        Alright! We’re gonna take five.

           Lance walks off stage, makes a beeline for Janet.

                                 LANCE (CONT’D)
                        Need a drink?

           She slams her beverage in one gulp.

                                 JANET
                        Yes.

           Then...

           ON STAGE

           A hand pulls the amp cord out of Lance’s guitar. He plugs it 
           into a different jack and a heavy metal scale riff swells out 
           of... Lionel’s Twin-necked, V-shaped double guitar. 

           He’s on stage, power stance, wearing pants tight enough to 
           compromise his decision making.

                                 LIONEL
                         (into the mic)
                        This shred medley goes out to 
                        Janet.

           Every head in the crowd turns. He lets it rip. Fingers moving 
           a thousand miles an hour, shredding like a young Michael 
           Angelo Batio. (Seriously, Google him.)

           The crowd is silent, in shock.

           NEARBY THE STAGE

           Tim, busy making out with Missy, uses his free hand to turn 
           on the fog machine they brought.
           ON LIONEL

           In the zone. Shredding balls. Melting faces. The crowd to 
           starts to feel it. Heads nod. Sparks fly out of the speakers.

                                 LANCE
                        He’s gonna blow the amp!

                                 JANET
                         (feeling it)
                        Hell yeah he is.

           Lance runs on stage. He tries to unplug Lionel, but the amp 
           bursts into flames just before he can.

                                 LANCE
                        Ahhh!

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           Peter plugs his ears. Odie and Seth, all about the metal.

                                 ODIE & SETH 
                        Woooooo! Yeah!

           They high five as...

           WHOOOOP! Red and blue police lights hit the windows.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Cops!

           Kids flee. The curtains catch fire. An entire living room 
           wall goes up in flames.

           EXT. RUBY SUE’S STREET  - CONTINUOUS

           Half a dozen cop cars surround the house. Teenagers flee in 
           every direction. It’s mayhem.

           Hammered dude runs by with sharpie penises all over his face!

                                 HAMMERED DUDE
                        Best party ever!

           Seth finds Ruby Sue in the chaos, grabs her hand.

                                 SETH
                        We gotta split!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What are you doing here?
                                 SETH
                        We had a date, remember?

           He drags her toward the Maserati down the street.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Nice! You brought it. I was 
                        starting to think you didn’t really 
                        have one.

           It’s lights flash when Seth clicks the keys.

           INT. MASERATI - MOMENTS LATER

           Seth floods the engine. The car bucks forward.

                                 SETH
                        Goddamnit!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Do you even know how to drive this 
                        thing?

           He peels out. Then...

           Odie materializes out of nowhere, directly in front of the 
           car! Odie hits the hood and rolls up over the windshield. The 
           Maserati stops.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God! You just killed 
                        somebody!

           Odie pops up by the driver’s side window, blood trickling 
           down from his hairline. 

                                 ODIE
                        I’m driving. 

           He opens the door and pulls Seth out.

           EXT. RUBY’S STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Two police cars block the street so traffic can’t pass. 

           ON PETER

           Getting arrested. Hands cuffed behind his back, being placed 
           into a squad car as flames engulf the house. 
           STREET

           The Maserati fish tails around the corner. Going way too fast 
           and picking up speed. It bears down on the blockade.

           INT. MASERATI - CONTINUOUS

           Odie, sunglasses back on his face, blood trickling from his 
           hariline. He floors it.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Po-po! Twelve o’clock.

                        Odie. Odie! ODIE!

                                 ODIE
                        We’re doing 90 in a 15. Can’t turn 
                        back from that... Cup your nuts!

           EXT. RUBY SUE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A cop wisely moves the barricading police car out of the way.

           The Maserati blows past the arriving fire trucks.

                                 RUBY SUE (O.S.)
                        Now that’s a fucking party.

           Kids line the streets, cheering on the destruction.

           INT. HARDING HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

           Two police officers follow Principal Smith down the hall.

           ENGLIGH CLASS - CONTINUOUS

           The door opens. The cops step inside the class.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Ruby Sue Conway. I’m gonna need you 
                        to come with me.

                                 CLASS
                        Ooooooh!

           Ruby Sue gets up and follows them out.
           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Martha, in her police blues, sits on the edge of the desk 
           while Principal Smith paces back and forth in front of Ruby.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        This is bad. 

           Ruby sits across from a television playing scenes from last 
           night’s party as recorded on Brittany’s phone.

                                 RUBY SUE
                         (angry sotto)
                        Tiffany!

                                 MARTHA
                        Ruby, some of these kids are saying 
                        you peer pressured them.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Pressured them to do what? Have 
                        fun?

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH

           Ruby Sue holds a kid’s legs up while he does a keg stand.

                        Drink faster you wuss!

           PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           A livid Principal Smith points at the screen.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Do you know what happens when 
                        something like this goes viral?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Of course I do. That’s why I bought 
                        like... a whole a box of rubbers.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Is that an attempt to make this 
                        even worse than it already is?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        So a couple kids had the time of 
                        their life, what’s the big deal?
                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Well, aside from my job on the line 
                        and the well being of my students, 
                        I guess you’re right. It’s not.

                                 RUBY SUE (ON TV)
                        Why do you have a gag reflex? I 
                        thought you were gay.

                        Poser.

           The door swings open. Ruby Sue’s parents, dressed in ski 
           attire, rush into the office.

                                 DAD CONWAY 
                        What the hell is going on here? I 
                        just got off the phone with the 
                        insurance company...

                                 MOM CONWAY
                        They said an industrial strength 
                        fog machine blew our circuits. 
                        Honey, why was there a fog machine 
                        in the house?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I don’t know where that thing came 
                        from. Actually. 

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        There’s still a criminal matter 
                        here that needs to be addressed.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah! That fog machine was 
                        negligent. We should sue them and 
                        get a bigger house.

                                 MARTHA 
                        Ruby, serving alcohol to minors is 
                        a very serious offense. Somebody 
                        has to get in trouble for this.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Whoa! Wait a second. There is no 
                        way you can prove there’s any 
                        alcohol in those cups.

           Martha gives her a look as she hits play on the video.
           ON SCREEN

           Ruby takes a swig from a bottle of clear booze, holds up a 
           lighter in front of her mouth.

                        Fireball! Fireball! Fireball!

           A huge flame shoots out of her mouth as the crowd goes wild.

           Ruby knows she’s busted.

                                 DAD CONWAY
                        Silver lining here. Our daughter’s 
                        technically retarded. So find me a 
                        jury that’s gonna convict her.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Dad! That’s offensive!

                        I’m losing it here. I’m sorry. It’s 
                        just... I was having too good of a 
                        time on the slopes. I knew 
                        something like this would happen.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Good news, Martha’s an alum and 
                        she’s a damn fine cop.

                                 MARTHA
                        I talked to these parents and, 
                        given the circumstances, they’ve 
                        agreed not to press charges.

           Ruby Stands up for a high five.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Sweet, Martha! Way to come through.

           Martha leaves her hanging.
                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Ruby. You’re expelled. You probably 
                        guessed that. It’s the bad news.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        What the fuck, Martha! I thought we 
                        were friends. What’s the point of 
                        being a cop then if you can’t get 
                        people out of jail?

                                 MARTHA
                        I just got you out of jail. There’s 
                        nothing more I can do. Now I’m 
                        sorry, Ruby. But ya played ya self.

           Ruby Sue takes a step toward Martha.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You know what I’m thinking about 
                        right now, Martha?

                                 MARTHA
                        Don’t do it, Ruby.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Thinking about going upside your

           The entire school has convened to watch Ruby Sue as she’s 
           being escorted out in handcuffs. All eyes on her.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Wait! Stop. I need to say something 
                        them. They need to hear this!

           Martha nods at the cop. He lets Ruby Sue face the school.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        I’m about to say something that I 
                        wish somebody said to me a long 
                        time ago... 

           The bell rings and the hallway clears. Only Tiffany remains. 
           She looks right at Ruby and gives her a slow clap.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You never could beat me, Ruby Sue.
                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fuck you! Fuck this school! I’m 
                        tired of being held back by this 
                        place. I’m gonna get a real job and 
                        make some real money. Peace!

           Ruby Sue turns and walks face first into a closed door.

           Brittany and the cool kids laugh as Lance launches a small

           Where workers are painting over Ruby Sue’s name.

           INT. HARDING HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY (END OF MONTAGE)

           Tiffany replaces her 1997 picture in the trophy case. Above 
           her, a banner reads “Vote for Prom Queen”. Students line up 
           to stuff ballots into a blue ballot box. Tiffany presides.

           INT. CHEMISTRY CLASS - DAY

           Two blue ballot boxes are opened up on the table where Seth 
           and two students count the ballots.

           Tiffany enters carrying a third ballot box. She plops it down 
           on the table.

                        Last one. So exciting!

           She leaves as Seth breaks the seal on last ballot box. He 
           notices something and offers a confused look.

           INT. HARDING HIGH - HALLWAY - LATER

           Tiffany struts down the hallway.

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Tiffany! Hold up.

           She spins around to find Seth standing behind her.

                        Yeah, I was hoping maybe you could 
                        explain this.

           He holds up his hand, covered in faded blue paint.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Because it looks like you painted 
                        that box to look like one of our 
                        ballot boxes. Which would be... 
                        pretty awful.

                                 TIFFANY
                        What’s your point?
                                 SETH
                        Well, I’m a little worried that if 
                        I count those ballots there’s gonna 
                        be a whole lot of Brittany votes 
                        and not much else.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well I’m a little worried that if  
                        people see this picture of you at a 
                        teenage booze party, you might lose 
                        your job.

           She holds up her phone: A picture of Seth at Ruby’s party.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think?

           Seth laughs awkwardly.

                                 SETH
                        I hate you so fucking much.

                                 TIFFANY
                        So... I should send it?

                                 SETH
                        No. You don’t have to do that. Not 
                        necessary. We just had our signals 
                        crossed. We’re uncrossed now.

           Tiffany smiles and walks away.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Count the votes. You asshole.

                                 SETH 
                        I’ll do that. And hey, maybe you 
                        can, you know, delete the picture? 
                         (beat)
                        No?

           She’s gone with the slam of a door. Feeling defeated, Seth 
           rubs his face. When he takes his hand away, his face is blue.

           EXT. PIZZA DUDES - DAY 

           Establishing: Spring time. Birds chirp and flowers bloom.

                                 RUBY SUE (OVERLAY)
                        OK, so one order of pepperoni 
                        poppers, one cheesy crust calzone 
                        and... a large Pepsi drink.
           INT. PIZZA DUDES - CONTINUOUS

           Ruby Sue is behind the register wearing the standard red and 
           white striped Pizza Dude uniform.

           A teen boy hands her some money.

                                 TEENAGE BOY 
                        Hey uh, I heard you can score us 
                        some beers.

           Ruby ignores his request.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Here’s your change, bro. Have a 
                        totally awesome day.

           Lionel pokes his head out of the back office.

                                 LIONEL
                        Hey Ruby, can I talk to you?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Why? I called him “bro”.

                                 LIONEL
                        Oh, no. That was great. This is 
                        about next week’s schedule.

           He shows her the calendar.

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re really short handed on Friday 
                        the 19th. So if you don’t mind 
                        picking up an extra shift...

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Sure, what’s poppin’? 

           She takes the pen from him to write her name on the schedule.

                                 LIONEL
                        Nothing’s popping. I mean, it’s 
                        just, you know... the prom.

           SNAP! Ink hits Lionel’s face. The pen explodes in her fist. 

                                 LIONEL (CONT’D)
                        Are you... are you ok?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fine. Why wouldn’t I be?

           A single tear streams down her cheek.
                                 LIONEL
                        OK, cool. So I guess we’re good?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I said I’m fine!

           She turns and storms off.

           INT. BAXTER RESIDENCE - PROM DAY

           Brittany, in front of a mirror, looks gorgeous in her prom 
           dress. Tiffany enters frame wearing her ‘97 prom queen crown. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Your entire life has led us to this 
                        moment... Legacy. Say it with me.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Are you gonna wear the crown all 
                        night? It’s kinda creepy.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I need you to focus, baby. This is 
                        where it starts. Tonight prom 
                        queen. Tomorrow weather girl...

                                 BRITTANY
                        Mom, they already counted the 
                        votes. It’s kinda out of our hands.

                                 TIFFANY
                        It’s never out of our hands.

           She grabs Brittany’s hand in hers.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Now say it with me.

                                 BRITTANY AND TIFFANY
                        Legacy.

           The doorbell rings.

                                 TIFFANY
                        That’s Lance! 

           Tiffany gives Brittany a hug.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Now get outta here, I gotta put my 
                        dress on.
           EXT. FANCY HOTEL - PROM NIGHT

           Kids in tuxedos and prom dresses arrive for the prom.

           INT. PROM - NIGHT

           Tiffany chaperones, wearing her old prom dress. Her crown 
           sparkles like a disco ball. Blaine is by her side in his tux.

           DANCE FLOOR

           Teenagers dance and have a good time. Peter is there, so are 
           Brittany and Lance. We recognize some of the cheerleaders and 
           field hockey players too.

           NEARBY

           Lionel and Tim stand against the wall watching the action.

                                 TIM
                        We should probably ask somebody to 
                        dance. What do you think?

           Lionel shrugs.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Good call. Next song.

           ENTRANCE 

           Seth enters, wearing his tux. He tries to walk past Tiffany 
           and Blaine without making eye contact.

                                 BLAINE
                        Whoa! Chem-master Seth. Where’s my 
                        homework, buddy?

           He makes Seth flinch then punches him in the arm.

                                 BLAINE (CONT’D)
                        Ahh. Just kidding. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Sorry your girlfriend couldn’t make 
                        it. I guess I’ll just have to 
                        imagine the look on her face when 
                        Brittany wins Prom Queen.

           Seth smiles awkwardly and walks away.

                                 BLAINE (O.S.)
                        Loser.
           PUNCH BOWL - CONTINUOUS

           Janet, in her prom dress, serves punch. Seth approaches.

                                 JANET
                        Hey, Mr. Novacelik. Punch?

                                 SETH
                        You read my mind.

           She hands him a cup of punch. 

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        Janet, you’re a smart kid. Have you 
                        ever made a decision that would 
                        cost you your career, but you knew 
                        it was the right thing to do?

                                 JANET
                        Um... I’m only 17.

                                 SETH
                        Let me rephrase the question. Are 
                        you hungry?

           INTERCUT: INT. PIZZA DUDES - CONTINUOUS

           The phone rings. Ruby Sue answers.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Pizza dudes... Uh huh... Yeah. It’s 
                        gonna be a while, I’m like the only 
                        one here... What’s the address?

           Ruby Sue jots the address down.

           EXT. FANCY HOTEL - NIGHT

           Ruby drives the pizza dude van up to the Prom Venue. She 
           looks out the window and seeing the appropriate signage, puts 
           two and two together.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You gotta be kidding me.

           INT. PROM - NIGHT

           The prom goes on without a hitch. Everyone dancing and having 
           a blast. Principal Smith takes the stage.

           The music fades. He taps the mic.
                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Ladies and Gentleman. May I have 
                        your attention please.

           ON TIFFANY

           Ear to ear smile. Then sensing...

                                 TIFFANY
                        She’s here.

           Over her shoulder, the door opens and Ruby Sue enters 
           carrying the pizza.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Who ordered the pizza?

           Everyone turns, all eyes on Ruby.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (O.S)
                        I have in this envelope, the name 
                        of your prom queen...

           Tiffany pushes her way through the crowd.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Why is she here?

           The crowd parts.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Who ordered the Goddamn pizzas!?

           Seth steps out from the crowd.

                                 SETH
                        I did.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You son of a bitch!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hey! This is between you and me.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Good! I’m glad you’re here. Now I 
                        get to see your face when you 
                        become the first person to lose 
                        prom queen... twice.

           Ruby Sue drops the pizza boxes on the floor. 

           Principal Smith puts his glasses on, opens the envelope.
                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        This year’s prom queen is...

           On Ruby. On Brittany. On Tiffany. On Seth...

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Ruby Sue.

           A blood curdling scream escapes Tiffany’s throat.

                                 TIFFANY
                        We had a deal, you chubby fuck!

                                 SETH
                        For us to have a deal I would’ve 
                        had to count your bogus votes. 

           Tiffany lunges forward and strangles Seth.

                                 SETH (CONT’D)
                        She tried... to rig it...

                                 TIFFANY
                        I did no such thing!

           Seth turns purple.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You’re killing him!

           Ruby Sue tackles Tiffany to the floor. The two women get back 
           to their feet. Tiffany stands between Ruby and the stage.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        That crown is mine. Now get out of 
                        my way. You bitch.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You’ll have to kill me first.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        If that’s how you want to play it.

                                 BRITTANY (O.S.)
                        No. Stop!

           Brittany runs between them.

                                 BRITTANY (CONT’D)
                        It’s over! Let it go! She won.

           Tiffany shoves her out of the way.
                                 TIFFANY
                        Nothing is over!

                                 RUBY SUE
                        You know, Tiffany. I acted like an 
                        asshole, but I was in a coma for 
                        twenty years. That’s my excuse. 
                        What’s yours?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Fuck you! That’s my excuse.

           Tiffany charges Ruby Sue. They hit the ground hard and gator 
           roll across the dance floor until Seth intervenes.

                                 SETH
                        Stop! Violence is not the answer.

           Suddenly, a hand grabs his shoulder and spins him around.

                                 BLAINE
                        Get off my wife, Novacelik.

           Wham! He drops Seth with a punch to the face.

                                 BLAINE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking creep!

           He grabs Seth by the shirt collar, hoists him up and slaps 
           him across the face. Seth notices...

                                 BLAINE (CONT’D)
                        What?

           A rat is on Blaine’s shoulder, trying to bite his ear. He 
           drops Seth and struggles with the rodent.

           Blaine throws it. The rat explodes against the wall.

           Zit Face hisses from beneath the punch bowl table.

                                 BLAINE (CONT’D)
                        Now where was I?

           He grabs Seth again. Then... a primordial scream echoes out 
           of the darkness.

           ON ODIE

           Diving off the stage. Soaring through the air.

                                 ODIE
                        Blaaaiiine!
           He lands on Blaine, taking them both to the ground. Blaine 
           scrambles back to his feet.

                                 BLAINE
                        Jesus Christ! It’s raining nerds!

           He grabs Odie by the shirt collar and rears back to punch 
           him, then... PZZZZZZZZZZT! Odie tazes his balls.

                                 ODIE
                        Been waiting twenty years for that.

                                 SETH
                        You’ve been waiting 20 years to 
                        taze Blaine’s nutsack? By the way, 
                        you got here really fast.

                                 ODIE
                        Only got two speeds. Fast and 
                        jackhammer fast.

           They shake like Arnold and Carl Weathers did in Predator. 

           Meanwhile... Tiffany and Ruby Sue are still rolling around on 
           the ground, hands around each other’s throats. Finally, hotel 
           security arrives and separates them. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Get off me!

           They drag Tiffany out of the ballroom, kicking and screaming.

           Ruby Sue dusts herself off. This is her time. 

           The crowd parts for her. Battered and bruised, she quickly 
           tries to fix her torn shirt as she limps up the stage.

           The moment catches up to her. Tears well in her eyes. She 
           turns and bows to accept her crown.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        What are you doing?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        I’m winning. 

           He covers the microphone with his hand.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        You didn’t win anything. You were 
                        expelled. You’re not even supposed 
                        to be here. 
                                 RUBY SUE
                        But... you just said my name.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        I said...

           He points to Janet.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (CONT’D)
                         (into mic)
                        Ruby Suh. With an H.

           Janet freezes like a deer in headlights. Every face in the 
           crowd spins her way.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        Please come get this crown before 
                        someone else loses their job.

                                 JANET
                        Oh, I... uh, I go by Janet now.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Well, it’s up here if you want it. 
                        I’m sorry these animals ruined your 
                        moment. Congratulations.

           He hangs the crown on the mic stand and walks off stage.

           The crowd parts for Janet. Applause begins to swell as...

           Janet makes her way onto the stage. The crowd is behind her, 
           cheering and clapping.

           ON STAGE

           Ruby Sue has the crown in her hands, white knuckled as she 
           stares at it. Janet approaches, stopping in front of her. 
           After a beat, Ruby looks up at her.

                                 JANET
                        Maybe we can share it. Like... 
                        friends.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Fuck that. 

           She places the crown on Janet’s head. The crowd erupts.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        The right person won.

           Janet throws her arms around Ruby in a hug.
                                 JANET
                        Kinda ironic, don’t you think?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Yeah. I really do think.

           Janet turns to the cheering crowd. She’s elated. 

           Ruby Sue walks off the stage.

           DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The lights are dimmed as Janet makes her way onto the dance 
           floor. Lance is waiting for her. He extends his hand. She 
           walks past him and takes Lionel’s hand. A slow jam plays as 
           they dance and everyone dances around them.

           ON BRITTANY

           Feeling sorry for herself on the bleachers. A hand reaches 
           out to her. She looks up. It’s Tim.

                                 TIM
                        You’ve never seemed more obtainable 
                        to me than you do right now.

                                 BRITTANY
                        I’m not sure what that means.

                                 TIM
                        Wanna dance?

           She takes his hand and joins the rest of the school on the 
           dance floor.

           ON RUBY

           By the door. She takes one last look at what could’ve been.

                                 SETH (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Seth does his best cool guy pose against the wall.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Hey yourself.

                                 SETH
                        You and me. Why not?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        Because I gotta get back to work?
                                 SETH
                        Jesus Christ. Just dance with me.

                                 RUBY SUE
                        OK. All you had to do was ask.

           He takes her hand and they finally have their dance. As that 
           one Alanis Morisette song takes us out...

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.

                                 SETH (OVERLAY)
                        So... It’s not a Maserati, but it 
                        is a convertible...

                                                         FADE IN:

           CODA: EXT. FANCY HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Holding hands, Seth and Ruby Sue walk to his car.

           Ruby Sue kisses him.

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        Well, isn’t that nice.

           Seth and Ruby pull apart.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        The more I think about it. You too 
                        losers do deserve each other.

           Seth takes a step toward her.

                                 SETH
                        OK. Tiffany. Enough’s enough. Why 
                        don’t we just call it a...

           Wham! Tiffany close fist blasts him in the face. One shot KO. 
           He goes down hard. She shakes out her hand.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Where’s your crown now, bitch?

                                 RUBY SUE
                        That wasn’t my crown.

           Ruby points to the crown on Tiffany’s head.

                                 RUBY SUE (CONT’D)
                        That’s my crown.
                                 TIFFANY
                        So come and get it.

           They charge at each other.

                                                  CUT TO CREDITS.

           DURING CREDITS

           Ruby Sue and Tiffany trading shots.

           BLACK

           Tiffany has Ruby Sue in a sleeper hold. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Shhh. Shhh....

           Ruby elbows her in the gut, breaking the hold.

           BLACK

           Ruby Sue hoists Tiffany up and powerbombs her through the 
           convertible. Tiffany’s out. Ruby puts the crown on her head.

                                                         THE END.
