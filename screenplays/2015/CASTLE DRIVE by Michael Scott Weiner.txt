           February 17, 1970

           544 Castle Drive; Fort Bragg, Raleigh, North Carolina

           "Theme From a Summer Place" by Percy Faith fills the score.

           EXT. 544 CASTLE DRIVE - DAWN

           A light rain blankets the Officers's Quarters, where an
           ambulance's red and blue lights take turns illuminating a
           crime scene. Aside from the deliberate movements of a select
           few, everyone stands frozen. 

           Two PARAMEDICS roll JEFFREY MACDONALD (26, muscular) through
           a gathered crowd of NEIGHBORS to the ambulance.  He wears
           only his blood soaked blue pajama pants as he thrashes around
           in agony.  A paramedic holds him down.  A PHOTOGRAPHER'S
           flashbulb floods the screen with white.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           TITLE OVER BLACK:

           Huntington Beach, California

           Nine years later

           "Theme From a Summer Place" fades out, leaving only the rain. 
           Then "Psycho Killer" by the Talking Heads takes over.

           INT. JOE'S CAR - DAY

           JOE McGINNIS (37, unkempt), keeps one hand on the steering
           wheel and the other on a large semi-folded map of Los Angeles. 
           He sports a green army jacket with a "Vote for Nixon" button
           on the collar.  He mumbles street names as he passes
           intersection after intersection.  The ash at the end of his
           cigarette threatens to fall.  His car is filled with
           newspapers and spiral notebooks.  A journalist's car.  He is
           a bit lost and more than a bit aggravated.  

           We cut between Joe, lost on the streets of LA, and:

           EXT/INT. BOB'S BIG BOY/STERLING'S OFFICE - EARLIER THAT DAY

           Joe, agitated, smokes while talking on a pay phone outside
           the restaurant to STERLING LORD, his literary agent.

                                 STERLING
                        It's a bad move...

                                 JOE
                        ...It's got national attention...
                                 STERLING
                        ...It's a bad move...

                                 JOE
                        ...It's a huge story!  The Green
                        Beret Killer!

                                 STERLING
                        First, as of right now, he's just
                        the Green Beret Defendant.  And
                        second, even if people DID give a
                        shit about this guy nine years ago,
                        what makes you think they'll give a
                        shit today?

                                 JOE
                        The man's family is brutally murdered
                        and he blames a bunch of tweaked out
                        hippies doing their best Charles
                        Manson impression.  The army thinks
                        he's full of shit but they can't
                        prove HE did it and the guy's set
                        free. Now, nine years later, he's
                        recharged as a civilian for triple
                        murder? It's fucking Shakespeare! 

                                 STERLING
                        It's true crime!  Garbage. 

                                 JOE
                        In Cold Blood is garbage? 

                                 STERLING
                        In Cold Blood is In Cold Blood.  And
                        this is not In Cold Blood.  What
                        about the Alaska project?  Why not
                        keep pursuing that?  I've got two
                        more publishers willing to meet...

                                 JOE
                        We've been pitching Alaska forever
                        and no one gives a shit, Sterling! 
                        This is happening right now!  The
                        trial won't wait for me.  And if I
                        miss this shot... if I spend the
                        next two years writing more crappy
                        guest columns for more crappy
                        newspapers, while some other asshole
                        hits it big on this book... I'm going
                        to kill myself.  And then I'm gonna
                        come back and I'm gonna kill you.

                                 STERLING
                        We didn't sign you after President
                        to chase ambulances. 
                                 JOE
                        I'm not chasing ambulances...

                                 STERLING
                        ...And I can't advance you any more
                        money.  I'm all tapped out.

                                 JOE
                        I'm not asking you to.

                                 STERLING
                        Joe, listen to me... if this thing
                        goes through... if you spend six
                        weeks at this guy's trial and then
                        another three years writing a book
                        about it... and it flops...

                                 JOE
                        You can drop me.

                                 STERLING
                        I may have no choice.

           INT. JEFF'S CAR - DAY

           Joe finds the right street just in time.  He makes a hard
           left, his tires screeching.

           He parks at the base of a condominium, double checking to
           make sure he is at the right address.  He takes notice of a
           Citroen-Maserati with the vanity license plate "JRM-MD" parked
           in front.  He shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 JOE
                        Who is this guy?

           He takes a travel bottle of mouthwash out of his glove
           compartment and knocks it back like a shot of vodka.   He
           checks himself in the rear view mirror, takes a deep breath,
           then lights a fresh cigarette. He grabs a small blue spiral
           notebook as he exits the car.  A still moment in the car
           before he doubles back for a pen.

           EXT. JEFF'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           Meticulously landscaped, the condo sits up against the Pacific
           Coast Highway.  It's harshly bright out and Joe unsuccessfully
           pats himself down for sunglasses. The door opens...

           CANDY KRAMER (20s, blond, and all curves) greets him in a
           white leotard.  Joe can't help but raise his eyebrows.  

                                 CANDY
                        You must be Joe.  I'm Candy.
           Joe smiles.  No words are necessary.

                                 CANDY (CONT'D)
                        Jeff is finishing up his morning
                        workout.  Come on in. 

           She gestures towards the smoke coming from behind his back. 
           Awkwardly, Joe extinguishes his smoke on the sole of his
           shoe and then leaves it on the doorstep.

           INT. JEFF'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           It is as bright inside as it was outside.  Large windows at
           the far end overlook the Pacific Ocean, where a thirty-four
           foot yacht, christened the Recovery Room, is docked.  Between
           the floor to ceiling mirrors and the modern white furniture,
           the condo resembles something Anthony Masters would design
           for Stanley Kubrick.  Joe takes a tentative step inside as
           Candy shuts the door behind him. 

           In a work out room off to the side, Jeff finishes a set of
           situps.  "Drug Stabbing Time" by the Clash plays from behind
           the closed glass door.  He is more tan and muscular than in
           the first scene.  He sees Joe and turns off the music.  He
           exits the room and rushes over, smiling wide and wiping his
           hand against his gym shorts before extending it. 

                                 JEFF
                        You're taller than I thought.

           Joe smiles and accepts the gesture.

                                 JOE
                        Joe McGinnis. 

                                 JEFF
                        Jeff MacDonald.  It's a real pleasure
                        to meet you, Joe.  A real pleasure.

           They keep their hands locked for a long beat.

                                 JOE
                        Strong grip.

                                 JEFF
                        Man comes in for a life-threatening
                        procedure, he wants his surgeon to
                        have a strong and steady hand.  That's
                        why there are so few female surgeons. 
                        They just can't seem to get the
                        handshake right.

           Joe snickers.  They release.  Jeff hugs Candy around the
           waist with a strong arm.
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Drink?

                                 JOE
                        I'd love one.

                                 JEFF
                        Iced tea or scotch?

                                 JOE
                        I hate iced tea.

           Jeff laughs a forced laugh.

                                 JEFF
                            (to Candy)
                        One scotch and one iced tea.

           Joe feels like a jerk.  Jeff gives Candy a kiss as she exits
           to comply with his wishes.  Joe fidgets with his note pad.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        You know, I've had interview requests
                        from five national papers and about
                        a dozen local ones.

           Joe has trouble hiding his frustration. 

                                 JOE
                        Really?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.  At first I wasn't going to
                        give ANY per-trial interviews
                        whatsoever.  Not after I was crucified
                        for doing Dick Cavett back in '70.

                                 JOE
                        I remember watching that and thinking
                        that you came across pretty cold for
                        a guy who'd just been cleared of
                        killing his entire family.

           Jeff laughs as he puts his arm around Joe.  They head over
           to one of the large windows overlooking the water.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, you won't hear any arguments
                        from me, brother.  You know how much
                        easier life would have been if I
                        simply broke down in tears every
                        time I heard the name Colette?  But
                        I've never been the type to wear my
                        emotions on my sleeve.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        My father never did it.  I've never
                        done it.  It's not in my blood.

                                 JOE
                        Sure, but sometimes it's in a man's
                        best interests to let others see
                        what they want to see.  Even if it's
                        really just a lie.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, you would know, wouldn't you?

           Joe's not sure if that was a compliment.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, that won't happen this time. 
                        I guarantee it.  Safe.  That's the
                        word this time around, man.  Safe. 
                        If there's one thing the last ten
                        years have taught me, it's that a
                        man must create his own narrative.

                                 JOE
                        I couldn't agree with you more.

                                 JEFF
                        Which is why I agreed to talk to you
                        and only you.  Man, when Bernie told
                        me Joe McGinnis called...

           He moves off to the bedroom while talking.  He rummages around
           in the room while Joe stays by the window.  

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Talk about creating a narrative...

           Joe looks over to Candy, preparing his scotch at the wet
           bar.  She has to bend down to get the bottle.

           Jeff glides back into the room with a copy of Joe's book,
           The Selling of the President, firmly clutched in both hands.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Christ... it's a how-to guide on
                        image building... and what you did
                        to Nixon... What I would have paid
                        to see his face when he read it.

           Joe instinctively rubs the Nixon button on his jacket.

                                 JOE
                        His people were far too trusting. 
                        Sloppy, really.  They didn't think
                        things through, like you do.
                                 JEFF
                        It's a fine piece of investigative
                        journalism, Joe.  No nonsense.  No
                        holding back.  Just the truth, man. 
                        Unfiltered.  Fucking brilliant.

           He extends the book out to Joe with a pen.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Would you mind?

           Never one to turn away a fan, Joe accepts.  He thinks for a
           moment and then signs the first page.  He hands it back.

           Jeff spins the book around to read the inscription:

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        To Jeff, truth never lies.  Joe.
                            (pause)
                        Far out. 

           Candy comes back with the drinks.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Never thought you'd end up a
                        columnist, though.

                                 JOE
                        I'm not a columnist.  I'm just doing
                        the editor a favor for a few weeks. 

                                 JEFF
                        Well, I'm super excited about this
                        interview.  I already feel like we've
                        known each other for years.

           Jeff raises his glass as he turns towards the bedroom.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I'll take mine in the shower.
                        I know this great little place down
                        the road that serves the best huevos
                        rancheros this side of the border. 

           He leaves for the bedroom.  

                                 JOE
                            (to Candy)
                        I'm not a columnist.

           Candy smiles and then excuses herself to sunbathe on the
           back patio.  Joe finishes his drink alone.
           INT. JEFF'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff, dressed in a tight short sleeve polo shirt and lots of
           gold, speeds down the PCH in his Maserati.  Joe is hanging
           on to the oh-shit handle for dear life.  The windows are
           down and the wind is whipping through the car.

                                 JEFF
                        They're already camping out around
                        the courthouse.  Setting up satellite
                        feeds, running cables.  Grabbing b-
                        roll.  Do you know what b-roll is?

                                 JOE
                        I'm familiar, yes.

                                 JEFF
                        See, I didn't at first.  I had to
                        learn all this shit on the fly back
                        in '70.  Honestly, I was surprised
                        by how much makeup these TV people
                        wear.  Even the men.  

           A car cuts Jeff off and Jeff gets angry.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        That mother fucker.

           He speeds up and tailgates the other car, honking his horn
           repeatedly.  Joe is glued to his seat, helpless.  The car in
           front moves to the shoulder for Jeff to pass.  Jeff leans
           past Joe:

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Fuck you, asshole!

           The driver is a WOMAN.  Jeff laughs as he blazes by.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Figures.  Giving a car to a woman is
                        like giving a gun to a chimpanzee. 
                        She'll never understand how to use
                        it and it's incredibly dangerous.

           The speed down the road to...

           EXT. MEXICAN BISTRO PATIO - LATER

           Joe and Jeff sit in the patio.  Lots of hanging plants and
           fresh flowers surround them.  Jeff keeps his sunglasses on
           as Joe smokes.  Plates of food cover the table.  Jeff is not
           shy about eating.  Joe refills his glass of white wine, his
           blue note pad resting on the table, unopened.  
                                 JEFF
                        At least one international news
                        organization has been confirmed. 
                        Not sure if it's France or England...

           Joe cuts him off.

                                 JOE
                        Jeff, I'm excited that you're excited. 
                        Really.  But I didn't sit on the
                        highway for an hour and a half to
                        talk about other news organizations. 

                                 JEFF
                        Of course.  Where should we start?

                                 JOE
                        How about the Article 32 hearing?
                        The judge said the government didn't
                        have enough evidence to go forward
                        with the prosecution...

                                 JEFF
                        Colonel Rock.  A good man...

                                 JOE
                        But he never said you were innocent...

                                 JEFF
                        Joe, a person is either found guilty
                        or not guilty.  There is no such
                        thing as being found innocent.

                                 JOE
                        That's a good point.

                                 JEFF
                        The point is, I was cleared of all
                        charges and was honorably discharged.

                                 JOE
                        And you spent the next decade trying
                        to put this nightmare behind you.

                                 JEFF
                        Meanwhile, the government came up
                        empty, which was unacceptable to
                        them.  So, with their unlimited
                        resources and our taxpayer dollars,
                        they wasted year after year chasing
                        a lie.  Really, it was inevitable
                        that they'd eventually fabricate
                        enough evidence to convince a grand
                        jury to indict me.
           Jeff is growing angrier.

                                 JOE
                        But what about double jeopardy?

                                 JEFF
                        Bernie said something about jeopardy
                        not attaching because I was never
                        actually court martialed... I don't
                        know.  It sounds like a bunch of
                        legal tap-dancing bullshit to me.

                                 JOE
                        Hold on... let me get this straight... 
                        If you hadn't been cleared at the
                        Article 32 hearing, there would have
                        been a court martial, right?

                                 JEFF
                        ...Right.  And if I'd been vindicated
                        at the court martial, which I would
                        have been, without a doubt, then
                        jeopardy would've attached and none
                        of this would be happening.

           Jeff takes a large bite of food.

                                 JOE
                        So Bernie did TOO good of a job
                        representing you back then?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.  And he beats himself up over
                        it every day.  But it's not a problem. 
                        He'll destroy them this time around
                        just like he did the last time around.

           Joe thinks hard before asking his next question.

                                 JOE
                        Well, let's just say you ARE guilty...

           Jeff stops eating.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        ...for conversation sake...

           Jeff grabs his wine.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        If you truly are guilty of these
                        heinous crimes, and that's not for
                        me to decide... but let's say you
                        are.  You killed your family.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        A argument that escalated out of
                        control... whatever.  Do you think
                        that one night of inexplicable horror
                        erases all the good you've ever done
                        with your life?  All the good you
                        can still do with your life?  

           Jeff takes a deep breath before answering.

                                 JEFF
                        Nothing can take away all the good
                        I've done with my life.

           He starts eating again and doesn't look up:

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I'm a doctor, Joe.  I know that four
                        people on acid couldn't organize a
                        trip to the toilet, let alone the
                        murder of three people.  If I wanted
                        to make up a story about people
                        killing my family, hippies with
                        candles wouldn't be the best I could
                        come up with.   

           Jeff finally looks up.

           INT. JOE'S CAR - LATER

           Joe speeds down the PCH, lost in thought.  In his
           absentmindedness, he nearly slams into the BMW in front of
           him.  His tires screech as he narrowly avoids the collision. 
           He exhales hard.  Adrenaline snaps him back into focus.    

           INT. SANTA ANA RACETRACK - AFTERNOON

           Joe is at the betting window.  He takes crumpled up dollar
           bills and loose change out of his pocket in a way that
           indicates this is not the first time he's wrangled up change
           to make a bet.  He scans the list of horses...

                                 JOE
                        Put everything on Fatal Vision.

           EXT. SANTA ANA RACETRACK - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe sits with AVERY JAMES (30s, vulgar).  They have large
           cups of sodas in their laps and Avery has a satchel by his
           feet.  Joe chews on a straw as JOCKEYS prepare their horses. 

                                 AVERY
                        They'll convict him just for driving
                        a Maserati.  Asshole. 
           Avery takes a sip.

                                 JOE
                        It'll either be the prosecution of
                        the decade or the persecution of the
                        decade.  That's for sure.

                                 AVERY
                        In Cold Blood, part II?

                                 JOE
                        It better be.  I'm running on fumes.

           Joe sits forward and nervously gnaws on his straw.  The horses
           are set.  Joe fingers his ticket.

                                 AVERY
                        A man with your talent shouldn't
                        have to struggle.  Come do television
                        with me.  It's easy money...

                                 JOE
                        I'd rather starve than do television! 

           He nudges Avery.  

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Top me off.

           Avery groans as he reaches down to the satchel.  He removes
           a flask and pours some into Joe's soda cup, then his own.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Nancy's pregnant.  Did I tell you?

                                 AVERY
                        Shit.  Sorry, man.

           The gun!  The horses take off.  Joe tenses.

                                 JOE
                        Nah, it's good.  It was planned.

                                 AVERY
                        So was Pickett's charge.

           Joe chuckles as he intensely watches the race.  He tosses
           his straw and lights up a smoke.  The horses press on.  Fatal
           Vision is in the running.

                                 JOE
                        Come on Fatal Vision.  Come on, you
                        son of a bitch!
                                 AVERY
                            (theatrically)
                        Is this a dagger which I see before
                        me?  The handle toward my head? 
                        Come, let me clutch thee...

                                 JOE
                        Shut it...

                                 AVERY
                        I have thee not, and yet I see thee
                        still.  Art though not, FATAL VISION,
                        sensible to feeling as to sight? 

                                 JOE
                        Seriously...

                                 AVERY
                        A dagger of the mind, a false
                        creation, proceeding from the heat-
                        oppressed brain?

           The horses cross the finish line.  Fatal Vision loses. 

                                 AVERY (CONT'D)
                        I always hated Macbeth.

                                 JOE
                        God damn it.

           He tosses his ticket to the ground.

                                 AVERY
                        Shakespeare sucks.

                                 JOE
                        Says the television writer.

           INT. JOE'S HOTEL - LATER

           Joe walks into his hotel with a hand-full of mail.  We hold
           on one piece in particular: A collection agency letter from
           Pennsylvania.  Joe is stopped by the CONCIERGE. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Mr. McGinnis.  You have a package.

           A BELLHOP comes from behind the concierge stand with a large
           file box.   The note on top: "Truth never lies -- JM, MD"

                                 CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
                            (trying to be nice)
                        We still need to discuss your bill...

           Joe looks up and starts walking towards the elevator.
                                 JOE
                        Of course.  Of course.  I'm what,
                        two months behind?  Not a problem. 
                        See that box?  That's a very important
                        story.  You'll be reading about it...

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Yes, but...

           Joe slips past another TENANT into an open elevator.

                                 JOE
                        Just have that brought up, ok?

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Mr. McGinnis...

           The doors shut.

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Joe's smile fades.  He sighs deep and massages his forehead
           with his free hand.  He is very much alone in the elevator. 
           He notices a stain on the floor and focuses on it.

           INT. JOE'S HOTEL ROOM/STERLING'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe's hotel room doubles as an office. 

           NANCY MCGINNIS (pretty, slightly pregnant) reads a newspaper
           on the bed, its pages spread out around her.  She gently
           strokes her barely-noticeable baby bump.

           Joe enters and locks the door.  She straightens up as he
           walks past the bed without making eye contact.  He tosses
           the mail on his desk and finds a half-empty bottle of scotch. 
           He pours a drink and stares at the collection letter.  He
           picks it up, looks over to Nancy, puts it down, and smiles.

                                 NANCY
                        So?

                                 JOE
                        So, I hate California.  The ocean's
                        on the wrong side of the road and
                        even the ugly people are pretty.

                                 NANCY
                        Then let's pack up and go back to
                        Jersey.  No one's pretty in Jersey.

                                 JOE
                        Except for you.

           Nancy tilts her head with a "really" type of expression.
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Seriously though, it went great.

           Nancy inhales with excitement.

                                 NANCY
                        A book?

                                 JOE
                        He hasn't asked me yet.

           She relaxes as Joe crawls into bed with his scotch to give
           her a kiss.  He tramples the newspaper in the process.

                                 NANCY
                        What's he like?

                                 JOE
                        He's an asshole.

                                 NANCY
                        Then you two should get along nicely.

           Joe smirks and turns on his back.  They stare at the ceiling.

                                 JOE
                        He's fascinating, though.  He switches
                        between the grieving widow and the
                        persecuted victim at the drop of a
                        hat.  It's really kind of impressive.  

                                 NANCY
                        Sounds like an interesting character.

                                 JOE
                        Tell Sterling that.

                                 NANCY
                        Just tell Sterling how the government
                        may be railroading this guy.  It'll
                        infuriate the liberal in him. 

           The phone next to the bed rings.

                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        Speak of the devil.

           Joe moans and sits up.  He takes a long sip as the phone
           rings and rings.

                                 JOE
                        I like to make him wait.

           She rolls her eyes.  Finally, he picks it up.
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        McGinnis.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        So?

           Joe stands and cracks his neck.   A knock on the door.  Nancy
           tends to the door while Joe picks up the base of the phone
           and walks its long chord around the apartment.

                                 JOE
                        So?  He wants me to go to some fund-
                        raising thing the Long Beach Police
                        Department is throwing for him
                        tomorrow night to talk.

           Joe takes another drink while he looks out the window. Nancy
           opens the door, where the bellhop delivers the box.  She has
           him place the box on the bed and then tips him.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        Well, you know what I think.

           Nancy opens the box.  It is filled with documents and
           photographs.  She picks up a crime scene photo of Colette,
           dead on the bedroom floor and covered in blood.  She grimaces.

                                 JOE
                        You know what I think?  I think you're
                        afraid it'll be a hit and you'll be
                        stuck with me for another ten years.

           Joe paces.  Nancy continues to look through the box.  A crime
           scene photo of one of the girls, dead in her bed.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        I just don't see the angle.  Why
                        should I give a shit about MacDonald?

                                 JOE
                        Why should you give a shit?

           Nancy looks up from a photo of the living room and mouths
           "big brother" over and over to Joe as he talks.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        What if he gets acquitted?  No one
                        wants to read a 600 page book about
                        the guy who DIDN'T do it.  Where's
                        the story?

                                 JOE
                        Hear me out... Big brother makes
                        people really fucking angry, right?
           Nancy gives a thumbs up.  Joe smiles.  They make a good team.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        And?

                                 JOE
                        AND, what do people do when they're
                        really fucking angry?

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        They vote and they read books that
                        make them even angrier.  

                                 JOE
                        Right.  Now, if this guy, this doctor
                        who spends every waking moment of
                        his life helping those in need, is
                        acquitted, then that means the
                        government's been making a good man's
                        life miserable for a fucking decade. 
                        It's Kafkaesque. There's the story. 

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        Maybe.

                                 JOE
                        And he only wants to deal with me. 

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        You sure about that?

                                 JOE
                        What do you mean?

           Joe sits down.  Nancy notices his concern. 

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        He's already met with other writers.  

           This is like a punch in the gut.

                                 JOE
                        What?  I thought... who?

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        Joe Wambaugh, for starters.

                                 JOE
                        Wambaugh?  I thought he was on a
                        movie?  Who else has he met with?

           Nancy drops the photos and moves over to Joe.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        Does it matter?
                                 JOE
                        A little.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        Joe, I won't let this agency become
                        a propaganda machine for a murderer.

                                 JOE
                        You think I'd let that happen?

           Sterling takes a deep breath.  A pregnant pause before:

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        I'll call Dell.

                                 JOE
                        That's all I'm asking...

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        ...I'll call Dell.  I'll see what
                        the interest level in this thing is. 
                        Who knows?  Maybe I'm wrong.

                                 JOE
                        You're wrong.

                                 STERLING  (V.O.)
                        Maybe.

           Joe hangs up, his brow furrowed.

                                 NANCY
                        Wambaugh?

           INT. JOE'S HOTEL ROOM/ST. JOSEPH'S EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe sits at his typewriter, his blue note pad on one side, a
           tumbler of whiskey on the other.  He types "Jeffrey MacDonald:
           Living a Nightmare" at the top.  The collection letter sits
           next to him at the desk.  Nancy is sitting next to the box
           on the floor, taking the contents out and organizing them
           into piles.  We cut between this and Jeff conducting his
           duties as director of emergency medicine.  The underlying
           music is "Rambling Man" by Hank Williams.

           INT. JOE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe sits in the middle of the room, an ashtray in front of
           him and the telephone in his lap.  The collection letter is
           finally open.  He stares at it.  The clock reads 3:30am. 
           The Hank Williams song ends.  He picks up the phone as he
           looks over to the bed.  Nancy is fast asleep and breathing
           peacefully.  Joe has trouble resting the receiver between
           his shoulder and his ear.  He has equal trouble dialing a
           phone number.
                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 JOE
                        A collection agency?  

           She isn't in the mood.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        It must be three-thirty in the morning
                        there... You've been drinking.

                                 JOE
                        You know how insulting that is...

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        The girls are getting ready for school
                        right now.  I don't have time to...

                                 JOE
                        Why didn't you just call me?

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        I HAVE called you.  And I've written. 
                        And I've sent mail.  But you
                        disappear.  You always have...

           Joe reads the letter as he talks.

                                 JOE
                        So if I don't pay up, I'll be held
                        in contempt of court and arrested?

           Mandy is tired of arguing.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        Just call me later.  After you sober
                        up.  Maybe we can...

           Joe tosses the envelope to the side.  He takes a breath.

                                 JOE
                        Remember... remember after President,
                        when they tried to get me to run for
                        Congress.  Think I would have won?

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        I don't know.

                                 JOE
                        Touch of Evil was released seventeen
                        years after Citizen Kane.  It's only
                        been ten since President.
                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        The girls need to get to school...

                                 JOE
                        Nancy's pregnant.

           Pause.  He looks at Nancy, then looks away.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        Ok.

                                 JOE
                        She's barely gained any weight.  You
                        should see her.  She looks amazing.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        I don't want to hear...

                                 JOE
                        I wonder if it'll look like ours. 
                        Like yours and mine.  They all look
                        like me anyway, right?  I mean, me
                        more than you.  But I wonder if
                        they'll look like each other.  You
                        think they'd recognize each other if
                        they ever met?  I think they would.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        You can be cruel when you're drunk.

                                 JOE
                        We WERE happy, damn it!  For a moment. 
                        The spotlight.  The recognition.  It
                        was intoxicating.  And we were sharing
                        it... together.  It wasn't just for
                        me.  It was for us...

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        ...We're getting ready for school.  

                                 JOE
                        You're the only one who's ever seen
                        through my bullshit.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        I have to go.

           She hangs up.  He sits there motionless for a moment, staring
           at the letter, which lays discarded on the floor.  He looks
           back over to Nancy, still sleeping.  He picks up the receiver
           and dials another number.

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        Joe?  What time is it? Are you drunk?
                                 JOE
                        What's the interest level?

           Sterling sighs.

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        More than I thought, actually.  They
                        may be willing to offer up 300
                        thousand as an advance.

                                 JOE
                        Is that what they offered Wambaugh?

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        No.  They offered him 400.

                                 JOE
                        Well, fuck Wambaugh.  Tell Dell this
                        one is mine...

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        They won't do shit until you get
                        that murderer to give you total
                        access.  Without that, no deal...

                                 JOE
                        That won't be a problem, Sterling. 
                        Not a problem at all.

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        And maybe lay off the whiskey a bit.

           To this, Joe does not answer.  A Donna Summer song fades
           into the soundtrack, taking us to...

           INT. PARTY - NIGHT

           Joe lifts a stiff drink to his lips.  A subtle "fuck you" to
           Sterling.  Nancy is with him, elegantly dressed.  They spot
           Jeff, the consummate host, giving his GUESTS equal time.  

                                 JOE
                        They all want a piece of him.

                                 NANCY
                        He's taller than I thought.

           Joe's masculinity takes a hit.  He looks at her and she kisses
           him on the cheek.

                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        Go be a journalist.  I'll schmooze.
           INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe talks to the guests about how much Jeff means to them. 
           He tries taking notes but quickly abandons the idea.  He
           notices Candy talking to Nancy at the far end of the room. 

           INT. PARTY - LATER

           Jeff, flute of champagne in hand, addresses the crowd.  Joe
           sits at Jeff's personal table with Nancy and Candy.

                                 JEFF
                        It's easy to support someone when
                        they're doing well.  I know that. 
                        And it's just as easy to give up on
                        someone when they're not.  But you,
                        the people in this room, never gave
                        up on me.  Even when I gave you every
                        reason in the world to do so.

           He looks at Candy, smiling wide with pride.  He and Joe share
           a momentary glance that makes Joe squeeze Nancy's hand tight.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        And so...

           He raises his glass.  The guests follow suit.  It feels as
           if Jeff is toasting directly to Joe.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        As success comes and goes... and as
                        fame rises and falls like the tide,
                        I will always be grateful for the
                        love and support of my family and
                        friends.  Cheers!

           Cheers!

           "Nights on Broadway" by the Bee Gees kicks in.

           INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe is at the bar.  Just as he's about to order...

           A hard pat on the shoulder.  Jeff.  All smiles.  

                                 JEFF
                        Pretty wild, huh?  All these people
                        here to support me. They get it,
                        man.  They understand. 

                                 JOE
                        They seem very loyal.
                                 JEFF
                        How 'bout we step outside?  I never
                        could compete with Barry Gibb.

           EXT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER

           The sounds of the party are muted in the background. Jeff
           isn't as grandiose here.  As he talks, he walks over to the
           railing and gazes out into the night as if he can see the
           scene he describes.

                                 JEFF
                        We went to the Rialto Theater once
                        and sat way up in the balcony.  We
                        held hands all night and watched A
                        Summer Place.  Have you ever seen...

                                 JOE
                        I have.

                                 JEFF
                        Man.  Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee...
                        We sat through that movie twice
                        because we were so stunned by its
                        beauty, and it was always sort of
                        our favorite movie, you know?  Colette
                        and I always felt like we were those
                        two kids falling in love right up
                        there on that screen.  It was a
                        beautiful thing to a couple of ninth
                        graders.  So the theme to A Summer
                        Place sort of became our song.  I
                        take the record with me everywhere. 
                        When I can't sleep... I just listen
                        to it.  Over and over.  And I shut
                        my eyes and I think about Colette
                        and the girls, dancing on the beach. 
                        The sun setting behind them... It's
                        perfect.  That song and those girls...
                        my girls.  It's just perfect.

           As he talks, we momentarily dissolve away to the girls all
           dancing on the beach as the familiar theme to A Summer Place
           creeps into the score.  It's as perfect as Jeff wants it to
           be.  When we return to the present, we can feel the sunshine
           on his face.  When he's done, the color drains back out of
           the scene and the music fades.

           Joe wipes the condensation off his glass.  Jeff turns back
           from the railing and presses on.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        We got pregnant before we got married. 
                        It was a really tense time.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I'd just started medical school. 
                        She was working on her degree.  We
                        were so young.  No one thought we
                        were ready to be parents.  Christ. 
                        We weren't even sure.  And so, the
                        conversation came up.  THAT
                        conversation.  More than once. 
                        Colette and me... we were never really
                        considering it.  But Freddy, her
                        dad?  He was adamant about it.  

           He laughs.  A sad laugh.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I guess he finally got the abortion
                        he lobbied so hard for.  It just
                        took a little longer than expected.

           Joe looks away.  Jeff switches gears.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Nancy's beautiful.  I can see why
                        you married her. 

                                 JOE
                        She's slumming it with me. 

                                 JEFF
                        Don't sell yourself short.

           They take sips of their drinks.  A long pause.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Still, it HAS been a long time since
                        a book by Joe McGinnis was on the
                        bestseller list.  

                                 JOE
                            (taking the bait)
                        There's nothing worse than having to
                        admit to yourself that you USED to
                        be a big deal. 

           Another pause.  Then, a strong pat on the shoulder.

                                 JEFF
                        Come to Raleigh and experience the
                        joy of vindication with me.  Then
                        write the book with me.  Let's get
                        Joe McGinnis back on top.

           Jeff opens the door and is immediately embraced by his
           supporters.  Joe exhales as he takes a long drink.
           INT. JOE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe, an ashtray on his chest, lays in bed with Nancy.  Naked
           and sweaty.  "Always On My Mind" by Willie Nelson plays. 

                                 JOE
                        Total access... Christ, he's even
                        got me living in a frat house with
                        the entire defense team.  If people
                        only knew... never talk to a
                        journalist

                                 NANCY
                        Especially when he's writing a book
                        about your murder trial.  

                                 JOE
                        People only fuck up when they open
                        their mouths. 

           He puts out his cigarette and moves the ashtray away.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        The weather in Raleigh was 92 degrees
                        today with 90 percent humidity.

                                 NANCY
                        Send me a postcard.

           He laughs.

           INT. JEFF'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff lays next to Candy in bed with his eyes open.  It is
           3:30am.  Willie Nelson continues to play.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joe enters with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  We
           follow him through the house as the DEFENSE TEAM enjoys a
           good luck party.  One intern barbecues outside the dining
           area, another plays guitar, and a third mixes drinks.  It
           feels more like the launching of a political campaign than a
           murder trial.  

           A large painting of J Edgar Hoover hangs in the dining room. 
           Just past it is BERNIE SEGAL'S office.  Off to the side,
           Jeff shoots pool with WENDY ROUDER (mid-twenties and
           stunning).  They laugh and take turns at the felt.  Jeff
           notices Joe and they intercept him in the hallway.

                                 JOE
                        Not what I expected.
                                 JEFF
                        I know, right?  If the trial drags
                        into the fall, I'll be expected to
                        buy NC State season tickets for the
                        whole defense team! 

                                 JOE
                        Well, you look to be in good spirits.

                                 JEFF
                        Who wouldn't be with this company?

                                 WENDY
                        You pay for my company, Dr. MacDonald.

           Jeff hits his head with his palm in exaggerated fashion. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, that's right!  Joe, this is Wendy
                        Rouder.  She's an associate at
                        Bernie's San Francisco firm.  And
                        when she's not doing that, she's one
                        hell of a distraction.

           She rolls her eyes as she extends her hand.  Joe accepts.

                                 WENDY
                        I've read your book.  You're quite
                        the journalist celebrity.  We're all
                        very excited to have you on the team.

                                 JOE
                        Thank you.  

           Joe smiles a bit too long.  It's awkward.  After a moment,
           Joe blinks off his gaze and notices the intern at the bar.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Drink?  I'm starving.

           They make their way over to the bar.

                                 JEFF
                        Wendy here was instrumental in picking
                        that jury that I'm stuck with. 

                                 WENDY
                        We used the same process that helped
                        get Joan Little acquitted back in
                        '75.  Every pick is weighed against
                        a metric that was calculated using
                        the most sophisticated computers...

                                 JEFF
                        ...That say HE'S the ideal juror!
           Jeff points to the large J Edgar Hoover painting.  It stares
           back.  They make it to the bar.  Jeff orders:

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Three scotches.

           Joe looks off to Bernie's office.

                                 JOE
                        Does he ever come up for air?

                                 JEFF
                        If a shark stops swimming, he drowns.  

           INT. BERNIE'S DORM ROOM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe knocks.  Bernie looks up over his glasses and welcomes
           him in.  He drops his duffel bag at the door and enters.

                                 JOE
                        Mr. Segal...

                                 BERNIE
                        Bernie, please.  

                                 JOE
                        Ok.  Bernie.  Have a minute?

           Bernie takes off his glasses dramatically.

                                 BERNIE
                        Jeff faces three counts of murder
                        where the prosecution has had nine
                        years to build a case.  I've had
                        three months to prepare a defense
                        with practically no access to the
                        evidence.  If we lose, Jeff goes
                        away forever.  So, do I have a minute?
                            (he smiles)
                        For you, I have two.

           He motions to a chair across from his desk.  Joe sits.  Bernie
           puts his feet up and lights a cigar.  He pops open a fresh
           Tab soda.  Joe sips his scotch.

                                 JOE
                        So what's the strategy?

                                 BERNIE
                        Win.

           Bernie puts his feet on the floor and leans in.  He grabs a
           bottle out of his desk drawer and refreshes Joe's drink.
                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Their case is a turd.  It was a turd
                        in 1970, and it's a turd today.

                                 JOE
                        The defense rests.

           The pour is finished as Joe leans in to grab it.

                                 BERNIE
                        Son, We're in the business of
                        reasonable doubt here.  So let me
                        break down for you exactly how this
                        trial will go.  First, the government
                        will put on a bunch of witnesses to
                        say that there was no evidence of
                        intruders and that Jeff's injuries
                        were nowhere near as severe as the
                        rest of the family.  Then I'll force
                        them to admit what a cluster-fuck
                        the investigation was.  

                                 JOE
                        Ok.

                                 BERNIE
                        Then they'll put on some pseudo-
                        science bullshit about blood evidence
                        and puncture wounds.  I'm not worried
                        about that either, though, because
                        our expert will testify that their
                        expert is full of shit.

                                 JOE
                        Ok.

                                 BERNIE
                        Then it's our turn.  Not only do we
                        have psychiatrists up the ass who
                        will testify that Jeff is incapable
                        of this type of brutality, but we
                        also have a hypnosis session that
                        won't leave a dry eye in the house...

                                 JOE
                        Except for maybe Freddy Kassab.

                                 BERNIE
                        Freddy Kassab?  Fuck that guy.  He's
                        not even Colette's real father. 
                        You'd never know it though, since
                        he's filled with the righteous
                        indignation of a blood relative. 
                                 JOE
                        He seems very... intense.

                                 BERNIE
                        Intense isn't the word for it.  He's
                        a fucking lunatic is what he is.  He
                        was Jeff's biggest supporter back in
                        '70 if you can believe it.  Holding
                        press conferences to say what a
                        miscarriage of justice it was that
                        he was charged, and all that.  But
                        when it was over, he just couldn't
                        understand that Jeff wanted to put
                        it behind him.  He wasn't even thirty
                        fucking years old yet!  Christ, what
                        was he supposed to do?  Stick a gun
                        in his mouth and end it all?

                                 JOE
                        Maybe.

                                 BERNIE
                        And when he saw Jeff on the Dick
                        Cavett Show, acting like an asshole,
                        he took it as a sign that he was
                        guilty. So he started raising hell! 
                        He was a big enough pain in the ass
                        that DOJ finally reopened the
                        investigation just to shut him up.

                                 JOE
                        But Freddy Kassab didn't indict him. 
                        The grand jury did that.

                                 BERNIE
                        They wouldn't have if I was there. 
                        Especially not with our pièce de
                        résistance... we have one of the
                        intruders.

                                 JOE
                        You found Helena Stoeckley?

                                 BERNIE
                        God no.  That would be a disaster.  

                                 JOE
                        I don't understand.

                                 BERNIE
                        Back in '70, Helena was just some
                        junkie who matched Jeff's description
                        of one of the intruders.  So what? 
                        What does that mean?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        He could have seen her hanging around
                        the area and just made the whole
                        thing up.  But since then, she's
                        confessed to seven different people
                        about being in that house.  What
                        innocent person would do that?  Who
                        knows?  I don't know.  But I do know
                        that I don't want her to pop up and
                        give an explanation.  As long as
                        she's gone, those confessions come
                        in as statements against interest
                        and the mystery of the blonde in the
                        floppy hat remains alive!  So, you
                        tell me... reasonable doubt?

           Bernie smiles.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           In the game room, pictures of BRIAN MURTAH, the government
           prosecutor, have been pinned to the dartboards.  Wendy smiles
           at Joe as he enters with Bernie.  Bernie loves it.  Jeff
           hits one picture in the jaw.

                                 BERNIE
                        Look at this!  A dream come true!

           Jeff hands Bernie and Joe a dart.

                                 JEFF
                        Come on, hit him right between those
                        beady little fucking eyes!

           Bernie happily obliges.  Joe is a little more resistant. 
           But the group dynamic is too much.  He takes the dart.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        On three... one... two... three!

           The darts fly.  Both darts hit their target.  Everyone cheers.

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe wakes up at 3:30am with a headache.  He rummages around
           for aspirin and then downs five pills in one violent head
           nod. He heads out for a smoke.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe staggers towards the back of the house.  J Edgar Hoover
           stares at him.  He flips the painting off and notices light
           escaping Jeff's room.  He hears the theme song from A Summer
           Place playing softly on a record player.  He creeps up to
           Jeff's partially open door.  
           He knocks lightly, causing it to to open more.

           Jeff is sitting on the floor, topless and lost in the music. 
           His eyes are red.  A handle of scotch sits next to him.  The
           TV is on but muted and playing only static.  Jeff looks up
           to Joe, who waits for either permission or rejection.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey.

           Permission. 

           INT. JEFF'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joe enters and sits in a chair next to the window.

                                 JEFF
                        Open the window.

           Joe nods and opens the window by the crank, which proves a
           bit more strenuous than anticipated.  They sit a while.  Joe
           smoking, Jeff staring at the static.

                                 JOE
                        Nervous?

                                 JEFF
                        Yes.

                                 JOE
                        Want to be alone?

                                 JEFF
                        No.

           No more words.  They just share the bottle as Joe smokes.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           A low angle shot of BRIAN MURTAH, very close to the angle of
           the picture they were throwing darts at.

                                 MURTAH
                        Facts do not lie.  And the facts in
                        this case are as clear as they are
                        disturbing: in the early morning
                        hours or February 17th, 1970, the
                        lives of Colette, Kimberly, and
                        Kristen MacDonald came to an abrupt
                        and violent end.  Mutilated, stabbed,
                        beaten, destroyed.  The word "PIG"
                        written in Colette's blood.  A
                        massacre.  Four weapons, three deaths,
                        two children, and one survivor.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MURTAH (CONT'D)
                        Jeffrey MacDonald.  You will be shown
                        pictures during this trial that...
                            (emotional pause)
                        ...Will haunt you for the rest of
                        your lives just as they have haunted
                        me for the last nine-and-a-half years. 
                        But you MUST force yourself to look
                        at them.  Absorb them.  The damage
                        done to these fragile beings.  Once
                        you do, it will become as clear to
                        you as it is to me that it simply
                        does not make sense that Jeffrey
                        MacDonald is alive.

           Joe keeps his focus on Jeff, then shifts it to FREDDY AND
           MILDRED KASSAB, seated stoically in the second row.

                                 MURTAH (CONT'D)
                        The defendant claims a group of
                        hippies surprised him while he was
                        sleeping on his couch.  That one of
                        them, a blond woman in a floppy hat,
                        held a candle and was chanting "Kill
                        the Pigs, acid is groovy." That a
                        struggle ensued in the living room
                        and he was knocked unconscious by a
                        blow to the head.  And that, when he
                        awoke, his family was dead and the
                        attackers were gone.  It's quite the
                        story.  But facts don't lie.  And
                        the facts in this case, the physical
                        evidence, exposes this story as a
                        farce.  There were no attackers. 
                        There was no struggle.  There was
                        only Jeffrey MacDonald.  The evidence
                        in this case proves that the DEFENDANT
                        butchered his pregnant wife and two
                        small daughters.  That he read an
                        article about Charles Manson in
                        Esquire Magazine, that he inflicted
                        wounds upon himself, and that he
                        staged the crime scene.

           Murtah takes one last pause.

                                 MURTAH (CONT'D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
                        facts don't lie... People do.

           Murtah takes a seat. Bernie sips his water and stands.  Joe
           is riveted.  He looks over the jury to gage their interest.
                                 BERNIE
                        Mr. Murtah is a smart lawyer.  He
                        understands that appealing to your
                        emotions as parents, as children, is
                        his only hope.  He's relying on you
                        to get filled with so much rage over
                        the tragic loss of these innocent
                        victims that you will rule with your
                        hearts and not your heads.  This is
                        crucial to the government because,
                        if forced to argue the facts and the
                        law, Mr. Murtah is sunk.  He's sunk
                        because he knows he cannot prove
                        this case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
                        And that is the only thing that
                        matters.  The government has the
                        burden to prove, beyond a reasonable
                        doubt, that Dr. MacDonald, a man
                        with no history of violence... a man
                        who spends his days saving people,
                        not killing them, stabbed his wife
                        over forty times, broke both her
                        arms, and mutilated her body and the
                        bodies of his children.  And this
                        burden cannot be satisfied by words
                        like MAYBE or POSSIBLY.  They cannot
                        prove Dr. MacDonald MAY have stabbed
                        Colette forty times.  That he POSSIBLY
                        staged the crime scene.  To convict
                        a man on maybes and possiblies would
                        be a colossal miscarriage of justice.  

           Joe is impressed.  Jeff remains still.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Now, to Mr. Murtah's chagrin, this
                        case is not as simple as just
                        comparing injuries.  It goes much
                        deeper than that.  This is the story
                        of a family torn apart by an
                        unbelievable and unspeakable tragedy. 
                        Jeffrey MacDonald loved his family
                        dearly.  They were looking forward
                        to the future.  To the addition of
                        their first son.  Why, Jeffrey even
                        bought his daughters a pony for
                        Christmas.  Jeff loved his family so
                        much, in fact, that even though his
                        position as a Green Beret surgeon
                        was a full time job, he held a second
                        job so that Colette could stay home
                        with the kids and be a full time
                        mother.  A loving mother.  Jeffrey
                        did this so that his family could
                        live.  Not so they could die. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                            (pause)
                        You will hear testimony that when
                        the military police first found
                        Jeffrey and Colette on that horrible
                        night, they were embraced on the
                        floor of the master bedroom.  A
                        lovers' embrace. This is the story
                        of a family shattered.  And when the
                        time comes, we will ask you to allow
                        Jeffrey the space and freedom he
                        deserves to grieve, mourn, and move
                        on.  Thank you.  

           Bernie sits.  Jeff whispers to him and then looks back at
           Joe, who takes notes in his blue note pad.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           The team eats pizza.  Jeff sits next to Wendy.  He is reading
           a local newspaper with a picture of him on the front page.

                                 JEFF
                        I should have gone with grey over
                        blue.  Look at this... it's a dark
                        blob.  You totally lose the shape.

                                 WENDY
                        You're going to have the same problem
                        with the pinstripes.

                                 JEFF
                        Let's see how it looks on the news. 
                        Maybe I'll wear a red tie tomorrow.

           Joe enters.

                                 JOE
                        Red's a bit aggressive for a guy on
                        trial for murder,don't you think?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.  You're probably right.  It
                        might remind people of blood.

           Jeff moves to the window.  The media is camped out front.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Look at them.  Man, this is way more
                        intense than I'd imagined. 

                                 BERNIE
                        It's been a decade of foreplay, Jeff.

           He moves away from the window.  Joe has his note pad out.
                                 JEFF
                        I need some air.
                            (to Joe)
                        I'm tired of jogging alone.  It's
                        too much solitude for a man facing
                        life in prison.  Join me?

                                 JOE
                        Should we go out the back?

                                 JEFF
                        Nah.  We'll go out the front. 

           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

           Joe and Jeff jog through campus.  Joe struggles, drenched in
           sweat.  Jeff never stops moving, but they break for water.  

                                 JOE
                        How do you do it?  Shit, even when I
                        HAVE the time to exercise I can't
                        seem to find the time to exercise.

                                 JEFF
                        I don't like to feel my stomach
                        hanging over my seatbelt when I drive.

                                 JOE
                        Nancy would never let me disappear
                        for two hours to go jogging at home.

                                 JEFF
                        Women tend to succumb to assertive
                        conduct.  I never made exercising a
                        choice with Colette.  I just did it. 
                        She knew not to complain.

                                 JOE
                        She "knew" not to complain?

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, are we jogging here or what?

           Joe tries to stretch out a cramp.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Now get moving.  I don't want the
                        cameras to see us walking back.

           Joe starts his slow jog again.  The opening guitar riff of
           Jeff Buckley's "Hallelujah" transitions us back to the trial.

           EXT/INT. COURTROOM/544 CASTLE DRIVE - DAY/NIGHT

           Murtah examines RICHARD TEVERE:
                                 MURTAH
                        Sergeant Tevere, what happened on
                        the morning of February 17, 1970?

                                 TEVERE
                        Well, it was wet that night...

           We shift between the trial and the night of the murders.

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: light rain, Tevere approaches two MPs at
           the front door and then goes around back.  The MPs stand
           still as another jeep arrives.  SPECIALIST KEN MICA exits
           the jeep.  Tevere returns from the back of the house and
           screams for the MPs to get on their car radios.  Tevere runs
           back to the rear with Mica following behind him.  

           COURTROOM: MPs testifying. Jeff listening and whispering to
           Bernie. Joe taking notes in his blue note pad.  Mica stands
           with Murtah in front of a large model of the house. There is
           no roof on the model and it is populated with tiny figurines
           and furniture.  Mica uses a long pointer to show the jury
           where he entered the house --  the back door of the unit,
           which leads to a utility room and then to the master bedroom.

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: Mica follows Tevere into the master bedroom
           where he finds Jeff, topless, draped over Colette on the
           floor.  His blue pajama top covers her chest and a blood
           smeared white bathmat covers her abdomen.  Off to the side
           lays a bent Geneva Forge paring knife.  On the headboard of
           the double bed, "PIG" is written in blood. .

           COURTROOM:  Crime scene photographs.  More MPs testify as
           Murtah handles the evidence. 

           544 Castle Drive: Mica leans over Jeff, who moans in pain.  

           COURTROOM: Sketches of the four "intruders": three men (two
           white and one black) and one white woman.  The woman wears a
           floppy hat and has long hair.  Mica nods and points to them
           as he gives his testimony.

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: Outside, an MP holds up a club and ice
           pick.  The flash of a photographer's bulb floods the shot.

           COURTROOM: Photographs of the wooden club and the ice pick. 
           Glimpses of the evidence in bags on a long table.  

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: Tevere, gun drawn, makes his way down the
           hallway with Mica behind him.  He looks into Kimberly's
           bedroom.  The light from the hallway gives us a hint of the
           horror, as does the shock on Tevere's face. 

           COURTROOM: Joe watches Freddy Kassab stare daggers at Jeff.  
           544 CASTLE DRIVE: Tevere and Mica make their way to Kristen's
           bedroom, their observations are memorialized through crime
           scene photographs: a large pool of blood on the sheet and
           the floor; a large stuffed doll, staring dead-eyed at the
           toddler; three bloody footprints leading from the room to
           the hallway; a baby bottle.  Next to the bottle is the hint
           of more horror... we linger on a rocking horse

           COURTROOM: More shots of Jeff and Bernie at counsel's table,
           Joe taking notes, Murtah and MPs at the model...

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: Tevere and Mica move down the hallway to
           the living room.  Their observations memorialized through...  

           COURTROOM: More crime scene photographs: an overturned coffee
           table, an Esquire magazine caught underneath. A tipped over
           flower pot, the ball of the plant separated from the base.

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: Two PARAMEDICS, along with Mica and Tevere,
           push Jeff down the hallway on a rolling gurney.  Jeff tries
           to get up, grabbing Kimberly's doorframe.  He has to be
           subdued in order to get him out the front door.  By this
           point, there are a number of MPs in the house.

           COURTROOM: Murtah finishes up as "Hallelujah" fades out.  
           Bernie stands and straitens his suit.

                                 BERNIE
                        Sergeant Tevere testified that he
                        didn't see anyone else out that night. 
                        But you saw someone, didn't you?

                                 MICA
                        Yes.  A woman.

                                 BERNIE
                        A woman?  Please.  Elaborate.

           544 CASTLE DRIVE: We see what Mica describes:

                                 MICA (V.O.)
                        She was on the side of the road maybe
                        ten or twelve feet away.  Caucasian,
                        mid-twenties.  She had shoulder length
                        hair, wore a dark-colored raincoat
                        and a pair of rain boots. 

           COURTROOM:

                                 BERNIE 
                        And she had on a floppy hat, too.
                        Isn't that right?

                                 MICA
                        Yes.
           Joe perks up as Bernie continues:

                                 BERNIE
                        A white woman, mid twenties, with
                        long hair, rain boots, and a floppy
                        hat?  That's the same description
                        Dr. MacDonald gave of one of the
                        perpetrators that night, isn't it?

                                 MICA
                        More or less, sir.

                                 BERNIE
                        To your knowledge, did anyone ever
                        investigate this woman?

                                 MICA
                        To my knowledge?  No, sir.

                                 BERNIE
                        Now, aside from the overturned flower
                        pot and the coffee table, you
                        testified that you saw no signs of
                        intruders.  Is that correct?

                                 MICA
                        That's right.

                                 BERNIE
                        What about the four victims?

                                 MICA
                        Well, I...

           On to Tevere:

                                 BERNIE
                        By my count, there was you, Paulk,
                        Morris, Mica, Dickerson, D'Amore,
                        two paramedics, the Marshall, two
                        photographers, Ivory, and all the
                        other CID men.  In and out of the
                        house through the mud and grass and
                        rain.  That's a lot of people.

                                 TEVERE
                        I suppose.

                                 BERNIE
                        And you were asked on direct if you
                        noticed any grass or mud or wet
                        footprints in the house.  And you
                        said no.  Do you remember that?
                                 TEVERE
                        Yes.

                                 BERNIE
                        And you were asked those questions
                        because Mr. Murtah wanted to imply
                        that the absence of such evidence
                        would indicate that there were never
                        any intruders in the first place.

                                 MURTAH
                        Objection!  I don't think Mr. Segal
                        is in any position to tell the witness
                        what I was implying.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Mr. Murtah, we all know what you
                        were implying.  Overruled.

                                 TEVERE
                        I guess that's what he meant, yes.

                                 BERNIE
                        Ok.  Well, after all that foot
                        traffic, the running in and out, the
                        wheeling in and out of a gurney, do
                        you recall seeing any grass or dirt
                        or muddy footprints left behind?

                                 TEVERE
                        No, I do not.

                                 BERNIE
                        And in the hallway... you stated
                        that nothing was touched. 

                                 TEVERE
                        That's right.

                                 BERNIE
                        Well, the gurney is 20 inches wide. 
                        And the hallway is 32.  And Dr.
                        MacDonald was fighting to get into
                        his daughter's room, clawing at the
                        door frame.  With two paramedics,
                        you, and Tevere all crammed in there
                        with him.  Is that a fair description?

                                 TEVERE
                        Yes.

                                 BERNIE
                        How did all of that happen without
                        you touching a wall? 
                                 TEVERE
                        We may have touched the wall.

                                 BERNIE
                        And you may have kicked around some
                        items in the hallway.

                                 TEVERE
                        It's possible.

                                 BERNIE
                        Spread fibers...

                                 TEVERE
                        Not intentionally...  

                                 BERNIE
                        Tainted evidence...

                                 MURTAH
                        Objection!

                                 BERNIE
                        This crime scene wasn't contained at
                        all, was it?

                                 MURTAH
                        Objection!

                                 BERNIE
                        You were a herd of elephants
                        stampeding through that house!

                                 MURTAH
                        Your honor!

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        That's enough, Mr. Segal.  The next
                        question out of your mouth had better
                        be substantive.

                                 BERNIE
                        That's alright, your honor.  I have
                        no more questions for this... witness.

           Joe is impressed.  

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Lunch.  Jeff is reading the paper while Joe smokes and drinks
           a beer.  Wendy and Bernie go over trial notes.

                                 JEFF
                        Look at this.  You've been identified!
           Joe takes the paper and reads aloud.

                                 JOE
                        The defendant arrived at court this
                        morning dressed in a sharp double-
                        breasted pinstripe suit alongside
                        acclaimed journalist Joseph McGinnis.

                                 JEFF
                        Acclaimed, huh?

           Joe smirks.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        When's the last time anyone other
                        than your publicist called you that?

           Joe continues to read the article as Bernie gets up.

                                 BERNIE
                        We need to review these autopsy
                        photos, Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        Bernie, we're eating.

                                 BERNIE
                        I'd rather not spread these out all
                        over the table.  My office?

           Jeff stands in a huff as Bernie leads him away. Joe grabs a
           slice of pizza while Wendy revisits the testimony.

                                 WENDY
                        Just look at this list of blunders...
                        the flower pot was stood up. Jeff's
                        wallet was stolen by one of the
                        ambulance drivers, which is
                        incredible. No one investigated the
                        woman on the corner, which was
                        probably Helena Stoeckley by the
                        way. The garbage was emptied. The
                        toilet was flushed. The Esquire
                        magazine was read. The children's
                        fingerprints were never taken. Jeff's
                        pajama pants were thrown out and
                        burned... it goes on and on and on
                        like that.  How in the world can
                        anyone, let alone my twelve jurors, 
                        take that investigation seriously? 
                        Would you convict on this evidence?

                                 JOE
                        It's pretty thin.  And Jeff doesn't
                        strike me as the type...
                                 WENDY
                        Just wait until you hear what our
                        psychologists say...

           Joe checks to make sure Jeff's out of earshot.

                                 JOE
                        Do you think he's innocent? 

                                 WENDY
                        Bernie thinks he is.

                                 JOE
                        But do you?

                                 WENDY
                        I work for Bernie.

                                 JOE
                        I understand that.  But do you think
                        he's capable of...

           Wendy finally looks up from her legal pad.

                                 WENDY
                        Joe, I wouldn't dream of presuming
                        what a person is capable of.

           Joe puts down his pizza.  He looks to Jeff, barely visible
           in Bernie's office, nonchalantly skimming through photographs. 
           At one point, he laughs at something Bernie says.

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe locks his door and takes the telephone into his closet.
           He dials Nancy.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 JOE
                        What are you wearing?

           She laughs.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Nothing but a wedding ring.

           Joe smiles.

                                 NANCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So, is he a murderer?

           Joe sighs and stretches out in the closet.
                                 JOE
                        Bernie makes a strong case against
                        it.  And I hate to say it, but I
                        kinda like the guy.  He's even got
                        me jogging.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Jogging?  You?

                                 JOE
                        His energy is infectious.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Just don't get too friendly.  He
                        might actually be guilty.  What does
                        the government say?  Why did he do
                        it?  Why did he butcher his family?

                                 JOE
                        Who knows? They're not even TRYING
                        to establish a motive.  Their mantra
                        is, "we only need to prove that he
                        did it.  We don't need to explain
                        why."  It's infuriating.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        What's he saying to you?

                                 JOE
                        To me?  Nothing. He's not opening up
                        like I expected.  He just stays on
                        message, no matter what.  Like,
                        whenever I feel as if I'm on the
                        verge of having a real conversation,
                        he changes the subject to sports or
                        music or he takes me jogging.  

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        He's been preparing for this moment
                        for nine years, Joey.  He's hyper
                        aware of his image.  

                                 JOE
                        Well, it's bad for business.  All
                        this access and I've got nothing to
                        show for it.  This book is going to
                        end up being nothing more than a
                        summary of the god damn trial.  I'm
                        fucked here, Nancy.  What do I do?

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Maybe he just needs a little push.
           INT/EXT. COURTROOM/NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

           We cut between the courtroom and Joe's adventure.

           COURTROOM: autopsy photo of Colette.  DR. GEORGE GAMMEL:

                                 GAMMEL
                        Colette suffered multiple traumas to
                        her head and severe defensive wounds
                        to her upper extremities.  

                                 MURTAH
                        Did she fight back?  

                                 GAMMEL
                        Until her arms were broken and her
                        head was bashed in.

                                 MURTAH
                        Were there any stab wounds?

                                 GAMMEL
                        Along with the 16 deep knife wounds,
                        Colette also sustained 21 puncture
                        wounds to her chest that are
                        consistent with that of an icepick.

           Jeff looks back at the gallery, searching for Joe but he
           isn't there.  Jeff accidentally makes eye contact with Freddy,
           who stares at him with biblical fury.

           Next slide: Kimberly.

                                 GAMMEL (CONT'D)
                        Kimberley was killed immediately by
                        a vicious blow to the head, causing
                        her cheekbone to penetrate the skin.  

           NORTH CAROLINA CAMPUS: Joe, a satchel draped over his
           shoulder, walks through the campus, eventually finding a
           bookstore.  He enters.

                                 GAMMEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        She was also struck a number of times
                        after the fatal blow.  These, along
                        with the 10 stab wounds to her neck,
                        occurred postmortem.  Overkill.

           COURTROOM: Next slide, Kristen.

                                 GAMMEL (CONT'D)
                        Kristen was stabbed a total of 17
                        times with a knife and an icepick,
                        through both her chest and her back,
                        deep enough to penetrate her heart.
           NORTH CAROLINA CAMPUS BOOKSTORE: Joe scans a bookshelf until
           he finds a copy of his book, The Selling of the President.
           He looks around to make sure that he is not being watched. 
           Satisfied, he takes a copy of his memoir, Heroes, out of his
           satchel and places it on the shelf.  He briefly catches the
           attention of the CASHIER behind the counter, but a courteous
           smile and head nod sends the kid back to his chores. 

                                 GAMMEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        She was the only victim not to sustain
                        blunt force trauma to the head.

                                 MURTAH (V.O.)
                        Did she have any defensive wounds?

                                 GAMMEL (V.O.)
                        Yes.  There were multiple cuts on
                        her hands, including one that exposed
                        the bone on her right ring finger.

           BACK TO THE COURTROOM:

                                 MURTAH
                        So she fought back?

                                 GAMMEL
                        As hard as a 3 year old could.

           DR. SEVERT JACOBSON testifies:

                                 JACOBSON
                        Dr. MacDonald's wounds were all...
                        superficial.  The worst was a slight
                        pneumothorax.  A collapsed lung.  

                                 MURTAH
                        Could the defendant's wounds have
                        been self inflicted?

                                 JACOBSON
                        Yes.  In fact, the incision between
                        his ribs was very surgical.  You
                        see, if you grab a knife carefully,
                        by the handle and part of the blade,
                        the blade goes only up to your thumb. 
                        You can control the depth of the
                        incision.  Here, the wound was just
                        deep enough to cause the pneumothorax.

           Joe enters the courtroom, upset, and sits in the back row. 
           Jeff notices him.  Dupree ends the week's proceedings.
                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        I think this is a good place to recess
                        for the weekend.  I don't know about
                        you, but I could use a stiff drink. 
                        So go home, have a drink, and if you
                        have children, hug them tight.  I'll
                        see you back here Monday morning.

           The gavel comes down.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joe sits with Wendy and some of the other members of the
           defense team watching a sitcom.  Jeff is noticeably absent. 

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff sneaks around Joe's room, cautiously looking through
           his belongings. He uncovers a hidden bottle of scotch.  Then
           he flips through Joe's blue note pad, finding: "HE FAILED TO
           SAVE THEM - DEVELOP FURTHER"

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe and the gang are still watching television.  Jeff joins
           them and sits down next to Joe.  He grabs a bit of popcorn
           and talks softly so the others can't hear.

                                 JEFF
                        We got hammered by the medical
                        examiner today.  I felt so alone...

                                 JOE
                        I know...

                                 JEFF
                        I needed you there for support...

                                 JOE
                        I know...

                                 JEFF
                        And when I turned around to find
                        you, just to see a friendly face...

                                 JOE
                        I know.  I'm sorry.

                                 JEFF
                        Where were you?

                                 JOE
                        Dealing with Nancy.

           Jeff is concerned now.
                                 JEFF
                        Is everything alright?  The baby?

           Joe feigns frustration.

                                 JOE
                        The baby's fine.  I don't think she's
                        coming down, though... I'd rather
                        not talk about it right now... in
                        front of everyone.

           Jeff nods, his brow creased.  He sits back as the show plays
           on.  Neither Joe nor Jeff are laughing anymore. 

           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

           Joe and Jeff jog through the campus.  Joe struggles less now
           but he still sweats profusely.  They take a break for water.

           INT. NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE - LATER

           Joe and Jeff, still in their jogging clothes, browse the
           shelves.  Jeff stumbles upon Joe's book, Heroes.  He holds
           it up triumphantly.  Joe hides his face in shame, waving off
           the embarrassment of having written such crap.  

           Jeff takes the book to the register.  He shows the CASHIER
           Joe's photo on the back cover and then points to Joe, who is
           hiding in the back of the store.  This is the same cashier
           as when Joe was there the day before.  He does a double-take,
           trying to place Joe's vaguely familiar face.  Joe looks away.

           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe and Jeff walk back through the campus in shared silence. 
           Joe smokes while Jeff fans through his new book.

           INT. BERNIE'S DORM ROOM OFFICE - NIGHT

           A chalkboard stands behind Bernie with two columns: one
           labeled "Them," the other "Us." Under "Them" are the following
           names, all crossed out: Mica, Gammel, Hancock, Murray, Newman,
           Connoly, Ramage, Hawkins, Turbyfill, Cooper, and Jacobson.  

           Wendy writes three names on the bottom: Ivory, Stombaugh,
           and Kassab.  Under "Us"... nothing.  Bernie is on the phone
           as Joe enters, still sweaty from the run.

                                 BERNIE
                        It's a little late for this
                        revelation.  You had told me...
                            (pause)
                        What am I supposed to do with that?
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                            (pause)
                        Great.  Thanks.  No.  No, you don't
                        need to take the trip.

           He hangs up.  Everyone waits in silence.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Judith's out.

           Shock.

                                 JOE
                        Who's out?

                                 WENDY
                        What do you mean out?

                                 BERNIE
                        I mean out!  Like not getting on the
                        plane!  She agrees with that mother
                        fucker, Stombaugh.  She won't testify.

                                 WENDY
                        We've already paid her!  

                                 JOE
                        What?  Who's Judith?

           Bernie looks to Wendy to fill him in.

                                 WENDY
                        There's some blood evidence that
                        might suggest that Colette bled on
                        Jeff's pajama top before it was torn.

                                 JOE
                        So what?  There was blood everywhere. 
                        We've overcome worse than that. 

                                 WENDY
                        Jeff has always said that his shirt
                        was torn BEFORE he found Colette in
                        the bedroom.  So...

                                 BERNIE
                        So, this makes Jeff's explanation
                        sound like bullshit.  And OUR blood
                        expert just told me that she agrees
                        with THEIR blood expert.

           Bernie plops down in his chair and rubs his temples.
           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joe and Jeff sit on a sofa together in the entertainment
           room, laughing at Gilda Radner's Roseanne Roseannadanna on
           SNL.  Jeff has Heroes in his lap, half-finished already. 
           They share popcorn and a bottle of whiskey.  The skit ends
           and breaks for commercial.

                                 JEFF
                        When this is all over, who do you
                        think should play me in the movie? 
                        I'm thinking Redford or Newman.

                                 JOE
                        Gene Wilder.

           Jeff laughs hard.

                                 JEFF
                        Who's going to play you?

                                 JOE
                        Redford...
                            (pause)
                        Or Newman.

           Jeff's laugh turns to sadness as they watch the commercials.

                                 JEFF
                        She loved to laugh.  We'd just sit
                        and... Lily Tomlin would make her
                        laugh so hard she'd cry. 

           He takes a drink and stands. 

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        It gets lost that it was me who failed
                        to save them.  As strong as I was... 
                        As much as I can replay it in my
                        head again and again... what if I'd
                        been in bed instead of the couch? 
                        What if I'd woken up just a moment
                        earlier?  Been able to stop it before
                        it got started?  What if I hadn't
                        just finished forty straight hours
                        of pulling doubles at the hospital? 

           Joe takes a drink.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I failed to save them.

           This gets Joe's attention.  That line sounds familiar.
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I'll never be able to get past that. 
                        And I can still hear Kimmy screaming 
                        Daddy, Daddy... No one was there for
                        them at the end. And by the time I
                        regained consciousness and tried
                        mouth to mouth... it was too late. I
                        just simply wasn't strong enough.

           He walks out as he talks:

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I think I'd like to be alone now.

           Joe sits alone as SNL comes back on.

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe notices his blue notebook open to the page that says "HE
           FAILED TO SAVE THEM - DEVELOP FURTHER."  It is 12:15am.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           Later.  Joe lays awake on his bed.  He stares at the ceiling,
           troubled by something Jeff said.  It is now 3:00am.

                                 JOE
                        He gave them mouth to mouth?

           He goes to his desk, lighting a cigarette as he fumbles with
           the desk lamp.  He rumages through documents, photos, and
           medical reports.  He keeps repeating "mouth to mouth, mouth
           to mouth" as he searches.  He finds a crime scene photo of
           Kimberly and Kristen.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        If he gave them mouth to mouth, why
                        are they still laying on their sides? 

           The phone rings.  It's Freddy Kassab.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 FREDDY (V.O.)
                        Time to choose a side, Mr. McGinnis.

           EXT. 544 CASTLE DRIVE - NIGHT

           3:30am.  Joe is dropped off by a taxi a few blocks away from
           the house.  Freddy is waiting for him.  They walk and talk:

                                 FREDDY
                        What are you looking for, McGinnis?
                                 JOE
                        Perspective.  I don't know if Jeffrey
                        is going to be found guilty, but if
                        he is, I don't want him to be the
                        major architect of how Colette and
                        the kids are portrayed in the book. 
                        I need to hear from the people who
                        loved them most of all.  And that
                        would be you and your wife.  

           Freddy scoffs at this obvious emotional play.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I'm also well aware of the role you
                        played in bringing about this
                        prosecution.  Clearly, you have to
                        be a central figure in any book about
                        the case.  And again, I don't want
                        my major source of information to be
                        Jeffrey MacDonald.  I would deeply
                        regret having to minimize your
                        contribution simply because I was
                        denied access.

           Freddy stops walking.

                                 FREDDY
                        Alright.  But first thing's first...
                        you have to understand that he is a
                        master manipulator.  It took me twenty
                        years to figure that out, and I'm
                        nobody's fool.  Hell, I called that
                        son of a bitch my "son." So, don't
                        presume to know Jeffrey MacDonald
                        just because you've shared a beer
                        and a laugh together.

                                 JOE
                        I've read the transcripts.  I'm
                        familiar with his inconsistencies.

           They start walking again.

                                 FREDDY
                        Fuck inconsistencies.  You're a
                        journalist, right?  Look deeper. 
                        For instance, he testified that he'd
                        volunteered for the army but he told
                        Colette he'd been drafted.  It's a
                        small thing but it reveals something
                        bigger.  It proves that Jeff will be
                        whomever you want him to be.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FREDDY (CONT'D)
                        He wanted Colonel Rock to think he
                        was a patriotic American who signed
                        up while everyone else was draft
                        dodging.  He wanted Colette to think
                        he had no choice in the matter. 
                        That he had to spend time away from
                        home because the government demanded
                        it.  Who knows what the truth is? 
                        His testimony is full of that type
                        of subtle manipulation.  And it all
                        points to one conclusion... everything
                        Jeffrey MacDonald says is a lie.

           They reach the house.  Police tape still stretches across
           the door.  It feels like a tomb.

                                 FREDDY (CONT'D)
                        They give me unfettered access to
                        the house in case I think of something
                        else they missed.

           Freddy leads Joe around the back of the house.

           INT. 544 CASTLE DRIVE - CONTINUOUS

           They enter through the utility room and start in the bedroom. 
           The blood stains have turned brown.  For the first time, Joe
           looks truly uncomfortable.

                                 FREDDY
                        They keep the power on for me, too.

           Freddy turns on a couple of lights, making the scene exactly
           as it was on February 17, 1970.

                                 JOE
                        It looks different in person.

                                 FREDDY
                        You can't get any sense of scale or
                        dimension from those crime scene
                        photos.  It flattens everything out.

           Joe looks around.

                                 FREDDY (CONT'D)
                        To believe Jeffrey's story, you must
                        ignore all the physical evidence, as
                        well as common sense and logic.  

           Freddy walks to where the large stain of Colette's blood is.
                                 FREDDY (CONT'D)
                        Look around you.  According to Jeff,
                        there were at least four intruders. 
                        So that means, when Colette was
                        attacked, right here, there were the
                        four attackers, Colette, and Kimberly,
                        since there's no disagreement that
                        she was hit with the club over there
                        by the door. 

                                 JOE
                        There aren't any signs of a struggle.

           They move down the hallway to the living room.  On the way,
           Joe peeks into Kristen's room and takes notice of the large
           brown blood stain on the floor.  

                                 FREDDY
                        Jeff says that when he gave the girls
                        mouth to mouth, he could see the air
                        coming out of their chests.

           Joe processes the information...

                                 JOE
                        Wait.  That doesn't make sense. 
                        Kimberly didn't have any chest wounds.

                                 FREDDY
                        And the lights are off...

                                 JOE
                        I can't see a damn thing in there.

           They continue to the living room.  The coffee table in the
           living room is still turned over.  Freddy lays on the couch.

           This is all a bit surreal.  Freddy pantomimes the actions as
           he runs through the chronology of events.

                                 FREDDY
                        Jeff said he woke up to Colette and
                        Kimberly screaming and saw three men
                        and a woman standing over him.  He
                        sat up just as the negro lifted the
                        club over his head and struck him,
                        causing him to fall back onto the
                        couch.  He got himself back up into
                        a seated position and grabbed the
                        club, at which point he was stabbed
                        in the chest by one of the white
                        men.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FREDDY (CONT'D)
                        Jeff let go of the club and directed
                        his attention to the white guys, who
                        unleashed a reign of blows on him. 
                        At some point during the struggle,
                        his pajama top was pulled over his
                        head and got bound up around his
                        hands. He managed to push forward to
                        the edge of the couch and was hit
                        again, losing consciousness.  He was
                        never able to get up from a seated
                        position and the attack took between
                        15 to 20 seconds.

           Freddy sits up.

                                 FREDDY (CONT'D)
                        Now you.

           Joe thinks before starting.  He pantomimes the movements of
           the attackers.

                                 JOE
                        Well, if the black man raised the
                        club over his head...

           Joe stretches his hands over his head.  It's a low ceiling.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        The ceiling is too low.

                                 FREDDY
                        Go on.

                                 JOE
                        Where did the black man go while the
                        two white men were assaulting him?

                                 FREDDY
                        I guess he decided to step back and
                        wait patiently for his turn.

                                 JOE
                        And how could his shirt have been
                        pulled over his head if it was ripped
                        down the front?

           Joe's heart is racing. 

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Show me more.

           EXT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joe is dropped off in front of the house by a taxi.
           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe tries to sneak back into the house.  He notices light
           coming from the gym.  He finds Jeff working the heavy bag.  

                                 JEFF
                        Where've you been?

                                 JOE
                        I needed some air. 

                                 JEFF
                        It's four-thirty in the morning.

                                 JOE
                        I know.  I should get some sleep.

           The scene is tense.  Joe starts to walk towards his room.

                                 JEFF
                        Don't burn out so soon, Joe.  We're
                        just getting started.

           Joe pauses but does not respond.  He goes back to his room
           as Jeff goes back to the heavy bag.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           BILL IVORY testifies:  A diagram of the house showing the
           location of blood evidence, autopsy photos, crime scene
           photos, and crime lab photos of collected evidence appear on
           the large screen behind him as needed.

                                 IVORY
                        I can't say what happened, but I CAN
                        tell you what the evidence suggests. 

                                 MURTAH
                        Please, walk us through it.

                                 IVORY
                        To begin with, there is no way that
                        pajama top was torn in the living
                        room.  See, it's made in such a way
                        that, when torn, it sheds an enormous
                        amount of fibers.  Now, if that shirt
                        was torn in the living room, fibers
                        would be everywhere.  But not a single
                        fiber was found there.  

                                 MURTAH
                        No?  Where were the fibers found?
                                 IVORY
                        Under Colette's body in the bedroom,
                        which would indicate that the top
                        was torn there.  

                                 MURTAH
                        Is it just the fibers, or is there
                        other evidence that calls the
                        defendant's story into question?

                                 IVORY
                        Well, when we put the pajama top
                        back together, we found four
                        contiguous blood stains on the front,
                        all matching Colette.  The tear slices
                        through these stains, which means
                        they were made before it was ripped. 

                                 MURTAH
                        What DOES the evidence suggest with
                        regard to the pajama top?

                                 IVORY
                        It suggests that Colette suffered an
                        injury in the bedroom that caused
                        her to bleed directly onto the
                        defendant's shirt.  He probably struck
                        her in the nose, as noses tend to
                        bleed pretty bad at first.  After
                        that, she probably grabbed his top
                        by the V neck.  As he pulled away,
                        the top tore down the front, and
                        fibers shed here in the bedroom,
                        precisely where we found them. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Objection!  This is clear speculation
                        and highly prejudicial!

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        The man is saying that the evidence
                        SUGGESTS these things, not that it
                        PROVES them.  Overruled. 

                                 MURTAH
                        What about the weapons?  The defendant
                        claims the intruders brought their
                        weapons with them.  That the icepick,
                        the two knives, and the wooden club
                        did not come from inside the house.

                                 IVORY
                        I can tell you for one-hundred percent
                        that the wooden club came from inside
                        544 Castle Drive.
                                 MURTAH
                        How?

                                 IVORY
                        There were a number of splinters
                        found in the master bedroom which
                        were traced to the murder weapon. 
                        The grain on that club matches the
                        grain on a wooden slat found under
                        Kimberly's bed. It was supporting
                        the mattress.  A home fix to a broken
                        bed.  This proves that the club was
                        cut from the same piece of wood as
                        the slat.  So it had to come from
                        inside the house.

                        And what of the claim that he was
                        hit with the club in the living room. 

                                 IVORY
                        Just like with the fibers, not a
                        single splinter was found there.  

           Jeff looks back and notices that Joe has left the courtroom.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Jeff and Wendy trudge through a herd of REPORTERS to Bernie's
           car.  Jeff looks off to find Joe at a payphone, clearly
           yelling at whomever is on the other end of the line.  Jeff
           doesn't want to leave but the reporters start to crowd him. 
           Bernie pulls away as Joe continues to argue.

           After they leave, we get close to Joe.  When Bernie's car is
           out of sight, his demeanor changes.  He hangs up the phone. 
           There was no one on the other end.

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff is reading Heroes, waiting for Joe.  Joe enters and
           sits at the desk where a bottle and two glasses await.  Joe
           pours two stiff drinks.

                                 JEFF
                        You were still married when you and
                        Nancy hooked up.

                                 JOE
                        Fidelity was never my forte.

                                 JEFF
                        I always hid my indiscretions.  Why
                        write about them for everyone else
                        to see what a scum bag you are? 
           Joe hands a glass to Jeff.

                                 JOE
                        You've got to create your own
                        narrative.  It's better to point out
                        your own flaws than to wait for others
                        to do it for you.

           Joe opens the window and lights a smoke.  Jeff sits up.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I missed my kid's birthday.  Again. 
                        Third year in a row.

                                 JEFF
                        I'm sure he understands...

                                 JOE
                        Nah.  He's nine.  Know what I got
                        him for his birthday last year?
                            (pause)
                        A typewriter.  You know what an eight-
                        year-old does with a typewriter?
                            (pause)
                        He breaks it. 

                                 JEFF
                        I would have liked to have been a
                        dad to a little boy... 

                                 JOE
                        I'm sure you'd have been better at
                        it than me. Truth is, I have no idea
                        how to be a husband OR a father. 
                        And yet... here I am with an ex-family
                        that hates me and a new family that
                        will probably end up hating me too.

           They sip their drinks.

                                 JEFF
                        Who were you yelling at today?

           Joe pretends to be surprised.

                                 JOE
                        You saw that?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.

                                 JOE
                        I wish you hadn't seen that.
                                 JEFF
                        Who was it?

                                 JOE
                            (reluctantly)
                        Nancy.

                                 JEFF
                        Is she coming down?

                                 JOE
                        No.

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 JOE
                        Because she thinks you're guilty.

           It hits him like a ton of bricks.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh.

                                 JOE
                        I told her I didn't want her here if
                        she can't put her emotions aside and
                        just look at the evidence.  I mean,
                        sometimes I really feel like she's
                        trying to poison me against you. And
                        I can't have that kind of myopia
                        around me right now.

                                 JEFF
                        The smart ones are such a pain in
                        the ass.  I tell you, this is a new
                        phenomenon.  Twenty years ago, no
                        self respecting man would ever let
                        his wife tell him what to think. 
                        The moment bras and personal hygiene
                        became discretionary, the whole world
                        went to shit.

                                 JOE
                        Back then, if you beat your wife,
                        the neighbors would blame HER.

           Jeff flips to a flagged page of the book and reads:

                                 JEFF
                        "And my dreams were bad.  I dreamed
                        of going back to my wife and finding
                        her old and horribly wrinkled.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        And I dreamed terrible dreams about
                        the maiming and destruction of my
                        daughters..."

           Joe takes a drink.

                                 JOE
                        Hmmm.  I forgot I wrote that.

           Long pause as Jeff decides whether or not to open up.

                                 JEFF
                        If what happened to me happened to
                        you... how would you feel?

           Joe knows that he's got him now.

                                 JOE
                        I hate to say it but I'd feel...
                        relieved.  And then I'd feel disgusted
                        with myself for feeling that way.

                                 JEFF
                        Who do you think's spent more money
                        since 1970?  You on child support
                        and alimony, or me on Bernie Segal?

           They chuckle.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I'm horrible.

                                 JOE
                        These are complicated emotions. 

           Jeff exhales.  A big weight off his chest.

                                 JEFF
                        I loved my family.  I really did. 
                        But I was so young.  They were so
                        demanding... If I ever told anyone I
                        felt relieved that they were gone,
                        I'd look like a total fucking monster.  

                                 JOE
                        If you're a monster, then so am I.

           INT. JEFF'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe sits in his closet, talking quietly to Nancy over the
           phone.  He drinks throughout the conversation.
                                 JOE
                        The jury is going to be taking a
                        trip to the murder scene next week. 
                        Once they get in there and they see
                        those brown stains on the carpet...  

                                 NANCY  (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        These were children, Nance... little
                        girls. They have to convict.  Don't
                        you see that? It's an exorcism, and
                        no amount of magic by Bernie Segal
                        is going to change that.

                                 NANCY  (V.O.)
                        Did he find the passage?

                                 JOE
                        Quoted it to me verbatim.
                            (pause)
                        I told him that I would feel relieved
                        if Mandy and the kids were murdered. 
                        That's got to be the most horrible
                        thing I've ever said.  And I've said
                        my fair share of horrible things.  

                                 NANCY  (V.O.)
                        At least he's opening up to you now.

                                 JOE
                        Trying to out-manipulate the
                        manipulator?  This isn't journalism.  

                                 NANCY  (V.O.)
                        You're not putting words in his mouth,
                        baby.  He just needed a little push. 
                        You provided that.

                                 JOE
                        I certainly did. 

                                 NANCY  (V.O.)
                        That's what journalism is, am I wrong? 
                        Getting the subject to open up to
                        you in a way he won't to anyone else? 

                                 JOE
                        I guess.

                                 NANCY  (V.O.)
                        No one can tell this story better
                        than you.  Not even Joe Wambaugh.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        That's why Dell gave you all that
                        money in the first place.

           EXT. NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - MORNING

           Joe and Jeff jog through campus.  Joe is in much better shape.

           Later, they rest on a bench, sipping water.

                                 JEFF
                        It's amazing... at work, I'm
                        constantly up to my elbows in misery. 
                        You don't show up at the emergency
                        room at three in the morning
                        voluntarily, you know?

                                 JOE
                        I guess not.

                                 JEFF
                        I'm seeing people on their worst
                        day.  Their most vulnerable.  Most
                        embarrassing.  Most fearful.  Their
                        most... human.  The bond between
                        doctor and patient at that moment
                        simply can't exist anywhere else in
                        the world.  And I'm the one who
                        experiences it with them.  I'm the
                        one who comforts them when their
                        families retire for the night.  I'm
                        the one who looks past all the fluids
                        and awkwardness.  You saw all those
                        people at my fund-raiser.  Half of
                        them have been my patients, and they
                        cry when they see me because the
                        sight of me brings them back to that
                        moment.  That moment when THEY lost
                        control and I SEIZED it.  

           Jeff hands Joe some water. 

                                 JOE
                        Colette could never have understood
                        the gravity of that.

                                 JEFF
                        Holding someone's life in your hands
                        is the biggest rush in the world. 
                        Especially when the light fades from
                        their eyes.

                                 JOE
                        I don't know if I could handle that.
                                 JEFF
                        It's unnatural to deny yourself the
                        satisfaction of a god complex.  Once
                        they're dead, though, something clicks
                        and you separate yourself from the
                        humanity of it.  It becomes a
                        checklist.  Procedures to follow. 
                        Forms to fill out.  People to call.

           A young and timid student REPORTER sees them and calls over. 
           Jeff immediately changes his demeanor.

                                 REPORTER
                        Dr. MacDonald.  A moment.

           Jeff gets into character.

                                 JOE
                        Do you want me to...

                                 JEFF
                        No.  It's fine.

           The reporter arrives.

                                 REPORTER
                        My name's Ryan. I'm with the Observer. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hi, Ryan.

                                 REPORTER
                        Hi.  Uh, I was on my way to class
                        when I saw you, and uh...

                                 JEFF
                        The Observer is a fine campus paper.

                                 REPORTER
                        I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you
                        think I could get a statement?  My
                        professor would flip out.

                                 JEFF
                        Of course.  I've never turned away a
                        reporter.  Not even one as green as
                        you.  I have nothing to hide.

                                 REPORTER
                        Yes, well, I wanted to know if it
                        upsets you that some people find
                        your apparent lack of emotion in
                        this case disturbing.

           Jeff has answered this question a million times.  
                                 JEFF
                        There's no question that it would be
                        better for me if I were so distraught
                        I could hardly get to court everyday. 
                        But I think the jury will see the
                        real me when I testify.  I hope they
                        understand that not everyone wears
                        their heart on their sleeve. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Forgive me, but you sound a little
                        bitter.  Are you just frustrated
                        with how the trial is going?

           Jeff's face changes.  He has a point to make.

                                 JEFF
                        I seem bitter?  Kid, it took them
                        six months behind closed doors to
                        get a grand jury to indict me.  If
                        that doesn't tell a normal person
                        something, then that normal person
                        isn't using their brain.

           Jeff gets abrasive.  The reporter takes a step back.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I've testified whenever they've asked. 
                        I've given them whatever they've
                        wanted.  And here I am on trial nine
                        years later because of the mindless,
                        middle-level federal beaurocracy,
                        with people like Brian Murtah who
                        run around without any controls.

           Jeff steps towards the timid reporter, his rage mounting.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        A competent supervisor would have
                        halted the prosecution years ago!

           Joe tries to calm him down by reaching out to touch his arm. 
           Jeff swats it away and continues his approach.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Am I bitter?  Sure, I'm bitter. 
                        Wouldn't you be?  They're building
                        careers on my name.  But the truth
                        has to come out sometime.  They can't
                        keep lying forever.

           The reporter stumbles over a fallen tree branch, ending up
           in a seated position.  Jeff does not help him up.  The
           reporter stands as Jeff turns away.  Joe is frozen.  The
           reporter quickly heads back the way he came.
                                 JOE
                        You won't win any friends like that.

           Jeff turns back to watch the scared student flee.

                                 JEFF
                        Some rinky-dink journalism department
                        they must have here.  He didn't even
                        recognize you.

           Jeff chuckles.  Joe doesn't.

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe is sitting on his bed, busy going over transcripts and
           writing notes in his blue note pad.  Wendy knocks and enters. 
           She's been crying.

                                 WENDY
                        Dupree won't allow any psychiatric
                        testimony whatsoever.

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 WENDY
                        He said dueling experts would only
                        confuse the jury. Asshole.

                                 JOE
                        That doesn't seem fair.

                                 WENDY
                        And Candy just told Jeff that she
                        isn't coming down for his testimony.

                                 JOE
                        Damn.

                                 WENDY
                        Do me a favor and see how he's doing. 
                        You've become very important to him.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jeff is making a ham sandwich, lost in thought.  The
           ingredients spread out over the counter.  Joe enters.  Jeff
           speaks without acknowledging him. 

                                 JEFF
                        So you heard?

                                 JOE
                        It's a big blow.
                                 JEFF
                        How can that piece of shit let Murtah
                        tell a jury over and over again that
                        I butchered my entire family in cold
                        blood, without establishing a motive,
                        but refuse to allow us to tell the
                        jury that I'm incapable of committing
                        such an atrocity?

           He is cutting a tomato very violently with a sharp knife.

                                 JOE
                        I don't know. 

                                 JEFF
                        I mean, just look at Helena Stoeckley. 
                        She's a fucking mess.  The guilt of
                        it all has eaten her away.  Ten years
                        of severe drug abuse, mental
                        collapses, a fucking stroke!  This
                        is what you'd expect from someone
                        who was there that night.  Who was
                        involved.  Now look at me.  Do I
                        look ravaged by guilt to you?

           More violent thrusts with the knife.

                                 JOE
                        No.

                                 JEFF
                        Do I look like I've been on a self
                        destructive fucking downward spiral
                        for the last decade?

                                 JOE
                        No.

                                 JEFF
                        So now we're forced to abandon
                        everything that would make the jury
                        sympathetic to me.  And all we're
                        left with is cross-examining some
                        asshole who conducted some bullshit
                        experiment with a pajama top?

           He slams the knife down, exasperated.

                                 JOE
                        Let's just hope the jury understands
                        that Stombaugh's findings aren't as
                        compelling as they seem.
                                 JEFF
                        Compelling?  They took a pajama top
                        and poked 48 holes in it.  Then they
                        manipulated it so that the holes
                        lined up with the 21 wounds on
                        Colette.  Big deal.

           Jeff searches the drawers until he comes back with an ice
           pick and four metal shish kabob skewers.  He places the
           skewers on the table and hands the ice pick to Joe. 

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Hold this.

           Joe complies.  Jeff then takes off his shirt.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Switch with me.

           Reluctantly, he hands Jeff the ice pick and takes the shirt.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Stretch the shirt out.

           Joe puts down the drink and holds the shirt between his hands.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Don't move.

           After a pause, Jeff proceeds to stab the shirt with the ice
           pick ten times.  Joe is visibly distraught as the ice pick
           pierces the shirt time and time again. 

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Ok.  Now give it back.

           Joe gives the shirt back to Jeff, who tosses the ice pick in
           the sink and grabs the skewers. 

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Ten random holes, four skewers. 
                        Think I account for each hole?

           Joe doesn't answer.  He just grabs his drink, glad to be
           done with the exercise.  Jeff takes the shirt and folds it a
           few different ways before settling on final shape.  He pushes
           the skewers through the holes until he accounts for all ten
           with only four skewers.  Joe raises his eyebrows.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        See?  A magic trick.  It doesn't
                        prove a god damn thing.

           Jeff puts the shirt down and grabs his ham sandwich.  He's
           too distraught to eat.  He tosses it down.  An INTERN enters.
                                 INTERN
                        Bernie wants to see everyone.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bernie has the whole team assembled in the game room.  He
           stands before the television with a VHS tape in his hand. 
           Jeff puts on on a fresh shirt as he sits next to Wendy on
           the couch.  Joe stands by the door, unable to take his eyes
           off Jeff, who is clearly flirting.

                                 BERNIE
                        It's been a rough week and I know we
                        all feel a little beat up.  A little
                        desperate.  I know I've yelled at
                        some of you for no reason and some
                        of you for good reason. 

           They laugh.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        And in the heat of it all, I feel
                        like something's been lost.  That's
                        why I asked you all in here.  His
                        highness Judge Dupree told us earlier
                        today that there will be no
                        psychiatric testimony and we will
                        not be allowed to admit Jeff's
                        hypnosis session into evidence.

           Groans.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        I know.  I know.  The jury will never
                        get to see this, and it's a shame. 
                        But WE need to watch it.  To remind
                        us of why we're here.  To remind us
                        that there were four victims that
                        night, not just three.  It's hard to
                        watch.  But we need this tape to get
                        us through the rough days, like today.  

           Bernie puts the tape into the VCR.  An intern turns off the
           main light as the TV kicks on.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           We dissolve to the middle of the tape, where Jeff is reliving
           the attack and the murders.

                                 JOE
                            (to himself)
                        This guy deserves the Academy Award.
           Joe watches Jeff watch himself on the television, completely
           without emotion.  He whispers something to Wendy, which makes
           her laugh.  Joe takes a drink.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           DR. STOMBAUGH testifies: a mannequin with a blue pajama top
           draped on it rests in front of him.  21 needles stick out of
           it.  Behind him is a projection of a drawing, indicating
           where the 48 puncture marks were on Jeff's pajama top.

                                 STOMBAUGH
                        All 49 holes are circular, which
                        proves that the pajama top was
                        stationary at the time of impact. 
                        Of course, since there were only 21
                        wounds to Colette's chest, we had to
                        determine if we could match those
                        wounds to the 48 holes.

                                 MURTAH
                        And did you?

                                 STOMBAUGH
                        Yes.  Using crime scene photos as
                        reference, we placed a pajama top on
                        a mannequin and, using a number of
                        scientific techniques, found that
                        the holes did, in fact, add up.

                                 MURTAH
                        Unlike the defendant's story.

                                 BERNIE
                        Objection!

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Sustained. 

                                 MURTAH
                        Nothing further.  Your witness.

           Bernie's turn.

                                 BERNIE
                        How do you know the pajama top was
                        folded in exactly the same way as on
                        the night of the murders?

                                 STOMBAUGH
                        It was merely an approximation.
                                 BERNIE
                        Did you account for the holes in
                        Colette's pink pajama top when you
                        conducted this experiment.  I mean,
                        did you attempt to see if those holes
                        matched up to the other holes?

                                 STOMBAUGH
                        I wasn't asked to do that.

                                 BERNIE
                        If you were asked to fit 18 rods
                        into those same 48 holes, could you?

                                 STOMBAUGH
                        I wasn't asked to do that.

                                 BERNIE
                        Of course not.  Because that would
                        have been exculpatory.

                                 MURTAH
                        Objection.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Anything else, Mr. Segal?  Questions
                        about the contiguous blood stains,
                        the defendant's blood being found in
                        the bedsheets, or the location of
                        the defendant's pajama top fibers?

           This catches Bernie off guard.

                                 BERNIE
                        No, your honor.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        So you accept the doctor's findings
                        regarding the blood and fibers, then?

           Bernie fights back all of his aggression.  Jeff is visibly
           angered and confused by Bernie's lack of questioning.

                                 BERNIE
                        I have no more questions, your honor.

           INT. 544 CASTLE DRIVE - DREAM SEQUENCE - NIGHT

           Joe wakes up on a couch, wearing the same outfit he wore
           when he first met Jeff.  He looks around. 544 Castle Drive. 
           It's dark, except for a kitchen light and a light coming
           from the hallway bathroom.  The coffee table is on its side
           and the flower pot is overturned.  He gets up off the couch,
           careful to watch his step, and stops at the hallway.  We can
           see down the hall, into the master bedroom.  
           All of the sudden, Jeff exits Kristen's room, dressed in his
           torn and bloody pajama top. He is carrying Colette's limp
           body in a blue bed sheet.  Joe lifts his hands to his mouth
           to choke back a scream.  He watches Jeff carry the body into
           the master bedroom, leaving three bloody footprints behind. 

           Joe creeps down the hallway as Jeff poses Colette.  His
           breathing labored, Jeff wipes his forehead and returns to
           Kristen's room.  Joe looks in and recoils in horror.

           Jeff exits Kristen's room with the bloody bedspread.  He
           brushes by Joe as he goes back to the master bedroom.  Joe
           goes to Kristen's room and is once again shocked.  Jeff balls
           the bedsheet up with the bedspread and tosses them by the
           door.  He takes off his pajama top and places it on Colette's
           chest.  He takes the icepick out from his waistband and
           breathes deep.  He chokes back tears and hesitates.  Joe
           wants to stop it, but he's powerless to intervene. 

           Jeff stabs at Colette's chest, 21 times.  He sits over her
           for a moment, sobbing.  When he finishes, he places the
           icepick on the floor and stands.  He looks around and then
           down at his gloved hands.  He gathers as much of Colette's
           blood on his latex gloves as he can, then walks over to the
           headboard and writes "PIG" with his right hand.

           Jeff looks back to the hallway and locks eyes with Joe.

           INT. JOE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe wakes violently with a nose bleed.  It is 3:30am.  He
           goes straight to the bathroom to throw up.  He washes his
           face and stares at himself in the mirror.

           He sees Jeff, covered in blood, standing behind him in the
           mirror's reflection.  He jumps and turns around.  He's alone.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe needs a smoke.  He trembles as he moves through the house. 
           He pauses a little distance away from Jeff's open door. 
           Jeff is topless and doing an intense set of situps.  Joe
           sneaks out back without being noticed.

           EXT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe tries to light a smoke but his hands are trembling too
           hard.  Within moments, he breaks down crying.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           DR. JOHN THORTON testifies for the defense.
                                 BERNIE
                        What is your opinion about Dr.
                        Stombaugh's pajama top experiment?

                                 THORTON
                        It was a bit silly.

                                 BERNIE
                        Silly?

                                 THORTON
                        Yes, particularly the bit about how
                        the circular holes in the garment
                        indicate a stationary target.

                                 BERNIE
                        Why is that silly?

                                 THORTON
                        Because I took a piece of material,
                        placed it in motion, and stabbed it
                        with an icepick.  The resulting holes
                        were all circular.

                                 BERNIE
                        And did you form an opinion about
                        how Dr. Stombough was able to match
                        up 48 holes into 21 thrusts?

                                 THORTON
                        Yes.  Again, this was not scientific
                        by any means.  It's really just...

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Silly?

                                 THORTON
                        Yes.  It was merely an academic
                        exercise in how to fit a square peg
                        into a round hole.

                                 BERNIE
                        Thank you.

           Murtah stands.

                                 MURTAH
                        I'd like to hear a little bit more
                        about this experiment you conducted. 

                                 THORTON
                        I took a piece of cloth, similar to
                        the pajama top, and wrapped it around
                        an item that simulated the consistency 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THORTON (CONT'D)
                        and resistance of human flesh.  That
                        item was mounted on a board and moved
                        about in a manner akin to what a
                        human being is capable of.  Once in
                        motion, I stabbed it with an icepick.

                                 MURTAH
                        That sounds pretty scientific.  What
                        was the item you used for this
                        scientific experiment?

                                 THORTON
                        A ham.

                                 MURTAH
                        A ham?  Like a ham sandwich?

                                 THORTON
                        Yes.  Wrapped in a garbage bag.

           Murtah laughs and looks at the jury, shaking his head.

                                 MURTAH
                        Ham wrapped in a garbage bag.

           EXT. PIZZA PLACE - AFTERNOON

           Joe can see Jeff and the defense team through the window of
           the pizza place.  They are reviewing documents and eating
           slices.  Joe is on a payphone talking to Sterling.

                                 JOE
                        I'm unraveling here, Sterling. I
                        haven't slept for a week, and when I
                        do sleep, I'm having nightmares.

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        You're halfway there.

                                 JOE
                        You know how hard it is to sit next
                        to him and eat pizza and talk about
                        fucking football just minutes after
                        seeing photo after photo of his
                        mutilated family?

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        He's a sociopath, Joe. How do you
                        expect him to behave?

                                 JOE
                        But the fucked up thing is, even
                        though I know, I mean, fucking know, 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        that he's guilty... that he's a
                        monster, there's no way in hell he's
                        getting a fair trial.  And I don't
                        know how to feel about that.

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        What can I do for you?  How can I
                        help you get through this?

                                 JOE
                        Just tell me it's worth it.

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        What if I tell you we've got national
                        magazines champing at the bit to
                        talk to you?  An international book
                        tour being planned.  Interest in
                        some of your other "in development"
                        projects.  Namely, Alaska...

           This perks Joe up.

                                 JOE
                        Alaska?  Really?

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        AND, Mike Wallace himself called the
                        office to get an advanced copy once
                        a galley proof is ready. 

                                 JOE
                        That's fantastic.  

                                 STERLING (V.O.)
                        Just stick it out a little while
                        longer, ok?  Do it for Nancy.

           Joe looks over to the defense team again.  Jeff senses him
           and turns to lock eyes.  He smiles.  Joe smiles back.

                                 JOE
                        I'll do it for Mike Wallace.

           Joe hangs up.  An intern rushes over to the defense team,
           very animated.  Everyone acts as if they've just heard that
           Pearl Harbor was bombed.  They rush out towards Joe.  Bernie
           tosses cash on the table as he takes one last bite of pizza. 
           Once outside, Jeff takes Joe by the shoulders. 

                                 JEFF
                        They found Helena!

                                 JOE
                        What?
           INT. COURTHOUSE - MEETING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           The room is small.  Joe has to stand.  Seated at the table
           is HELENA STOECKLEY (28, slightly chubby, and very sickly). 
           Her left arm is in a cast and she looks almost hypnotized. 
           She carefully spins her Diet Coke on the table with her right
           hand.  Flanking her are Wendy and Bernie.  Bernie has a photo
           album in front of him.  He talks to Helena in a calm voice.

           She speaks softly and never makes eye contact.

                                 HELENA
                        I don't know what you want me to
                        say?  I wasn't there.

                                 BERNIE
                        Helena.  Please.  For your own
                        conscience.  And for the sake of
                        that man in the courtroom who has
                        been made to suffer for nine years.

                                 HELENA
                        I can't help you.

                                 BERNIE
                        Six people say you confessed to them
                        that you were in the house that night. 
                        Are they all liars?

                                 HELENA
                        I'm not saying that... I'm just saying
                        I don't remember.  Do you realize
                        how many drugs I've taken since 1970?

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff waits impatiently.  He spots a wounded bird, hobbling
           around the grounds of the Courthouse.  He calmly walks over
           to it, places his foot above it, and then steps firmly down,
           crushing it.  His face never changes.

           INT. COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Back to Helena, Bernie, Wendy, and Joe.

                                 HELENA
                        Only someone whacked out on drugs or
                        crazy could have done that.

                                 BERNIE
                        Helena, no one is asking you to say
                        you were involved. All you have to
                        say is that you were there.  Holding
                        the candle.  Because that's the truth.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                            (pause)
                        Only you have it in your power to
                        let an innocent man go home to grieve. 

           She seems to be considering something.  Then...

                                 HELENA
                        Can I get a sandwich?  

           Bernie sighs.  He's lost his momentum.  He turns to Wendy.

                                 BERNIE
                        Stay here and keep her company.

           Wendy nods.  Bernie taps Joe on the chest and they exit,
           leaving Helena and Wendy alone.

           INT. COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe and Bernie walk to the elevators.

                                 BERNIE
                        Why couldn't she have just stayed
                        fucking lost? Or dead?  That would
                        have been best. This is a disaster.

           The elevator doors open.

           INT. COURTHOUSE - MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Helena is flipping through the photo album as if it were
           People magazine.  She looks a bit bored.  A bit tired.  Wendy
           just sits there, not knowing what to say.  Helena stops at a
           picture of the rocking horse.

                                 HELENA
                        The rocking horse was broken.  I
                        wanted to ride it but it was broken.  

           Wendy looks around as if Bernie could rush in at any moment.

                                 WENDY
                        So you WERE in the house?

           Helena finally makes eye contact.

                                 HELENA
                        What do you think I've taken all
                        those damn drugs for?

           INT. COURTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wendy runs down the hallway, turning the corner to the
           elevator and practically slamming into Bernie and Joe.  
           Joe has a tray with a ham sandwich, apple sauce, and another
           Diet Coke.  Wendy is out of breath.

                                 BERNIE
                        What?

           INT. COURTROOM - AFTERNOON

           Helena is on the stand.  

                                 BERNIE
                        And do you remember where you were
                        on the night of February 16, 1970?

                                 HELENA
                        No.

                                 BERNIE
                        Had you taken drugs that night?

                                 HELENA
                        At that time?  Probably mescaline. 

                                 BERNIE
                        And at that time, you owned a floppy
                        hat, knee high rain boots, a dark
                        rain coat, and a blond wig, correct?

                                 HELENA
                        It was 1970.  Everybody did.

                                 BERNIE
                        What did you do with the wig?

                                 HELENA
                        Burned it up in a fire, I think.  My
                        boyfriend didn't like it.  

                                 BERNIE
                        And was he with you in the house on
                        the night of the murders?

                                 MURTAH
                        Objection!

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Sustained.

                                 BERNIE
                        Didn't you tell William Poesy that
                        you were in Dr. MacDonald's house at
                        the time of the murders?  That you
                        and your boyfriend had to kill more
                        people before you got married?
                                 HELENA
                        No, I did not.

                                 BERNIE
                        Didn't you tell Jane Zillioux and
                        Red Underhill that you wanted to
                        teach Jeffrey a lesson because he
                        wouldn't give your friends methadone
                        at the hospital?

                                 HELENA
                        No, I did not.

                                 BERNIE
                        What about Officers Gaddis and
                        Beasely?  You confessed to them too,
                        did you not?

                                 HELENA
                        No, I did not.

                                 BERNIE
                        Or Ms. Brisentine, the polygraph
                        operator?  Didn't you tell her that
                        you were there, holding a candle?

                                 HELENA
                        I don't remember.

                                 BERNIE
                        Alright.  Now, how about my associate,
                        Wendy Rouder?  You spoke with her
                        just yesterday.  Do you remember?

                                 HELENA
                        Yes.  I drank a Diet Coke.

                                 BERNIE
                        You told her that you remember trying
                        to ride a rocking horse at the house
                        but it was broken?

                                 HELENA
                        I don't remember that.

                                 BERNIE
                        This was yesterday, Helena. 
                        Yesterday, when you spoke to...

                                 MURTAH
                        Objection!  Asked and answered.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Sustained.
           INT. JUDGE DUPREE'S CHAMBERS - AFTERNOON

           Judge Dupree struggles with a taco as he eats.  He seems
           more concerned about his food than about what he is discussing
           with Bernie and Murtah.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Well, I don't think it's stretching
                        it to say that girl is a whackado.

           He accidentally drops taco beef on his shirt.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE (CONT'D)
                        Shit...

           He cleans it off.  Bernie just sits there, amazed.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE (CONT'D)
                        That's why we wear robes, no?

                                 BERNIE
                        You were saying...

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Oh, yes.  I think it's also safe to
                        say that girl has been a habitual
                        user of drugs for a very long time.

                                 BERNIE
                        Yes.

           He takes a big mouthful of taco.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Well, I think that there is a serious
                        problem believing anything she says. 
                        And so, as to whether or not I will
                        allow your seven witnesses to testify
                        about these so called confessions...

                                 BERNIE
                        Yes?

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        As far as being admissible as
                        statements against interest, I just
                        don't see how they comply with the
                        trustworthiness requirement.  In
                        fact, I think anything that sad little
                        chubby woman says is unclearly
                        trustworthy, or rather, clearly
                        untrustworthy.  And since there is
                        no corroboration...
                                 BERNIE
                        They corroborate themselves!

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        I just don't think you can trust
                        anything she has to say.

                                 BERNIE
                        That's a credibility determination
                        for the jury to make!  It goes to
                        the weight, not the admissibility!

                                 MURTAH
                        Your honor...

           Dupree shuts him down.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        There's no need.  I've made my
                        decision.  The confessions are out.

                                 BERNIE
                        This is an outrage...

           Dupree puts up his hand to quiet Bernie.  Dupree wipes his
           mouth and then his hands as he talks.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        You know, an attorney I've known for
                        quite some time now, decades actually,
                        asked me the other night if I could
                        rule on a directed verdict of guilty. 
                        I told him I didn't think so, but if
                        I could, I believe that this would
                        be the case to do it in.

           He returns to his tacos. 

           INT. BERNIE'S DORM ROOM OFFICE - EVENING

           Jeff is in his gym gear.  He's enraged. 

                                 JEFF
                        You have to fix this, Bernie.  I'm
                        paying you to fix this!

                                 BERNIE
                        It's out of my hands.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, well that's just fucking swell. 
                        Why don't we just roll over?  It's
                        only my life we're talking about!

           He knocks a stack of papers off Bernie's desk.
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I'm fucked, Bernie!  And it's your
                        fucking fault!  If we'd just gotten
                        through the Article 32 Hearing back
                        in '70, you would have gotten me off
                        at the court martial, and none of
                        this would be fucking happening!

           He turns over an end table in anger.  Bernie takes a step
           back.  Wendy moves in and gently takes him by the shoulders.

                                 WENDY
                        Jeff, you need to calm down.

           He violently shrugs her off of him, leaving her with her
           hands up in an show of acquiescence.  The room stares at
           him.  He recognizes this and calms down.  He puts his hand
           on Wendy's shoulder.  She flinches initially, but lets him.

                                 JEFF
                        I'm sorry.  It's just...

           Wendy clears her throat and forces out a calming voice.

                                 WENDY
                        When you act like this, they win.  

                                 JEFF
                        I know.

                                 WENDY
                        If the jury sees you like that
                        tomorrow, they'll be able to SEE you
                        in that house.  With that icepick
                        and that club, covered in blood. 
                        And then you're really fucked.

           She moves behind him again, touching his hand.  She has
           regained her composure.

                                 WENDY (CONT'D)
                        Go get some air.  And then come back
                        to prepare for tomorrow.  Ok?

           Jeff turns around.  They are close enough to kiss.  The
           tension is palpable.  He forces a smile, rubs her shoulders
           and then nods.  He makes eye contact with Joe and then leaves.

           EXT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff is leaning against a railing, staring out into the dark
           forest behind the house.  Joe enters, lighting a smoke.  

                                 JEFF
                        I could kill that fucking prick.
           Joe says nothing.  It's getting harder for him to propagate
           the facade of a concerned friend.  Jeff senses the distance

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        What are you thinking?

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        You think I'm fucked!

           Joe's eyebrows instinctively raise three inches.

                                 JOE
                        No I don't.

                                 JEFF
                        You're out here, hoping to get me to
                        say something incriminating.

                                 JOE
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        You're preparing for me to be
                        convicted.  Just like everybody else.

                                 JOE
                        No, I'm not.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes, you are.  You're angling for
                        something.  Three people have already
                        told me they'll work on my appeal
                        for free.  That's not very comforting! 
                        And now you're planning, too?

                                 JOE
                        You're picking a fight.

                                 JEFF
                        Whose side are you on?

                                 JOE
                        Yours.
                                 JEFF
                        Bullshit!  I know you.  You have to
                        side with the winner.  It's where
                        you get your strength.  It's what
                        makes you feel important. 

                                 JOE
                        That's ridiculous.   

                                 JEFF
                        You're a spectator, Joe!  A tourist! 
                        It all makes sense now.  You didn't
                        have the balls to fight for your
                        country so you grabbed a pen instead
                        of a gun and followed around some
                        real soldiers in Vietnam.  You bitch
                        and bitch about about the government,
                        but instead of running for office
                        you just hammer away on your
                        typewriter and throw Nixon under the
                        bus.  And now, here you are, living
                        with me, and playing both sides until
                        the winner emerges.  

                                 JOE
                        That's not fair...

                                 JEFF
                        Or maybe you're jealous.  Maybe that's
                        it.  Maybe you wish it was your family
                        that was murdered!

                                 JOE
                        Careful, Jeff...

                                 JEFF
                        YOU wrote all that shit about dreaming
                        of your family's demise, not me. 
                        Maybe this whole experience has made
                        you wish you'd had the balls to kill
                        YOUR wife and kids ten years ago!

                                 JOE
                        Fuck you!

                                 JEFF
                        I hear you on the phone with your ex-
                        wife.  You think you're alone sitting
                        in that fucking closet?  The walls
                        are thin, brother.  I hear everything. 

           Joe's ears are red with fear and adrenaline.  Jeff is
           beginning to puff out his chest in a way we haven't seen
           yet.  A way that mirrors the way he looked in Joe's dream.
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        She hates you.  Your kids hate you. 
                        And history is about to repeat itself
                        with Nancy and, what I can only
                        assume, is your child.

           Now it's gone too far.  Joe's no pushover and he's no coward.

                                 JOE
                        Excuse me?

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, she fucked you while you were
                        married, right?  You think that had
                        anything to do with you?  Like you're
                        so amazing that she would compromise
                        her morals JUST for you?  Don't be
                        stupid.  I'd get a paternity test
                        immediately if I were...

           Joe takes an angry swing at Jeff.  He dodges it and punches
           Joe in the face, drawing blood from Joe's nose.  Joe pauses,
           then charges at Jeff, tackling him around his waist. 

           They fall to the ground and tussle for a moment.  No other
           real punches are thrown.  Joe pushes Jeff off him.

                                 JOE
                        Stop, stop, stop!

           They separate.  Joe wipes blood from his nose.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        This is stupid. 

           Jeff breathes heavy and avoids eye contact. 

                                 JEFF
                        I'm sorry.  I didn't mean any of it.  

                                 JOE
                        I know... I know.

           Joe looks at Jeff.  He reeks of hopelessness.

                                 JEFF
                        Your nose alright?

                                 JOE
                        Does it make me look tough?

           He shows off his bloody shirt.

                                 JEFF
                        A little.
           They laugh.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        It feels like the walls are closing
                        in, you know?

           Joe stands and extends his hand to Jeff, who accepts it.  

           INT. BERNIE'S DORM ROOM OFFICE - NIGHT

           Interns finish cleaning up the mess Jeff made.  Bernie and
           Wendy read cases and statutes in silence.  Then:

                                 BERNIE
                        Where's Jeff?  

           Bernie goes to the door, screaming to the others in the house.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Has anyone seen Jeff?  No?

                                 WENDY
                        You think he...

                                 BERNIE
                        He's too indignant to run away.
                            (to the house)
                        Where's Joe?

           Bernie has an epiphany.  He grabs his car keys.

           EXT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - TRACK - NIGHT

           Joe and Jeff run until their lungs are filled with battery
           acid. When one falls behind, the other pushes them forward.  

           Bernie pulls up in his Cadillac just as they are ready to
           pass out.  They are covered in sweat.  They laugh.  Exhausted. 
           Bernie leans back and opens the back door.

           INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Bernie drives.  Joe and Jeff recover in the back.

                                 BERNIE
                        No sweat on the leather, kids.

                                 JEFF
                        If Stombaugh saw all this sweat,
                        he'd testify that it's a scientific
                        impossibility that we went jogging.

           They all share a laugh.
           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Jeff is on the stand.  A stark contrast from the previous
           shot.  Here, he is emotional.  The jury is in tears as well.

                                 BERNIE
                        Tell us about Colette?

                                 JEFF
                        She was beautiful and intelligent
                        and warm.  She was a great mother
                        and wife.  Totally devoted.

                                 BERNIE
                        What do you remember about Kimberly?

           This is harder for Jeff.

                                 JEFF
                        She was very inquisitive.  I think
                        exceptionally bright.  And very
                        loving.  So loving.

                                 BERNIE
                        And what about Kristen?

           Jeff has the most trouble getting through this one.

                                 JEFF
                        She was the prettiest of all of us. 
                        A little ball of fire.  My angel. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Now, I don't want to get too far
                        into what you say happened that night. 
                        The government, like hounds to the
                        fray, will leap at that tomorrow. 
                        But I'd like to ask you to, at the
                        very least, try to explain the
                        inconsistencies in your recollections
                        over the last nine years.

           Jeff pulls himself together as he wipes his eyes again.

                                 JEFF
                        I never told anyone I was certain of
                        anything.  It's all fragments and
                        confusing thoughts.  The best I can
                        say is that it's hazy.  I had been
                        woken from a deep sleep after having
                        been awake for almost two days
                        straight, and I was viciously attacked
                        and knocked unconscious.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        As soon as I could, and as best as I
                        could remember, I told the
                        investigators everything.  But it's
                        like trying to replicate a dream. 
                        Or trying to recall a painting you
                        saw in a museum.  You know you saw
                        the painting, but you just can't
                        remember all of the brush strokes. 
                        But that doesn't mean you didn't see
                        the painting.

           Bernie moves to the crime scene photos.  This is the worst
           of it for Jeff and the jury.  Joe has to shut his eyes. 
           Freddy Kassab stares straight at Jeff.

                                 BERNIE
                        When you awoke and found your wife,
                        is this what you remember seeing?

                                 JEFF
                        I remember a lot of blood. 

           He shows a picture of Kimberly

                                 BERNIE
                        And when you found Kimberly, is this
                        what you remember?

           The words barely escape Jeff's throat.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes.

           On to Kristen.

                                 BERNIE
                        And when you found Kristen, is this...

                                 JEFF
                        Yes.

                                 BERNIE
                        And what, if anything do you recall
                        doing when you found them?

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, lord.  I only remember one thing
                        clearly.  I remember patting Kimmy
                        on the head and telling her it would
                        be ok.  Oh, lord.  Excuse me.

           Bernie lets Jeff sob.  He moves close to Jeff now.
                                 BERNIE
                        Did you murder your family?

                                 JEFF
                        Oh god, no.

           Bernie hands Jeff a folded up piece of paper.

                                 BERNIE
                        Dr. MacDonald, would you share with
                        us a letter that Colette sent you in
                        the summer of 1969, when you were
                        forced to spend some weeks apart.

           Jeff stares up at Bernie, as if this request was a surprise. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Go ahead.

                                 JEFF
                        Sunday night.  Darling Jeff, what a
                        difference a day makes - or even a
                        few minutes - especially when you
                        take me from the nadir of despair
                        and return me to that happy full of
                        love and life feeling.  Thank you
                        sweetheart, you really know how to
                        handle me.  In case you're getting
                        ready to jump out of an airplane and
                        need a little material for pleasant
                        daydreaming, here are a few of my
                        favorites: (1)  Remember the night
                        you and Ernie came to Skidmore in
                        the snow for 'Happy Pappy Weekend'
                        and stayed in the Rip Van Dam, the
                        fashionable watering place of the
                        New York jet set.  (2)  The night we
                        came home from Paul and Kathy's and
                        we decided to have something to eat
                        in the city and we went to Manana
                        after walking around a bit.  This is
                        one of my favorites because I think
                        we were definitely on the same wave
                        length that night. (3)  When you
                        were in the Infirmary at Princeton
                        because you had dropped the weights
                        on your chest, you wrote me an
                        abstract story entitled 'the cool
                        guy and the warm girl.' Do you
                        remember that at all?  I do, It was
                        beautiful.  (4) New Year's Eve this
                        year - what could top that for a
                        feeling of togetherness!  (5)

                        Cutting up onions and peppers together
                        and planning for our giant Champagne
                        Brunch and then, of course, the brunch
                        itself.  (6) The first time you came
                        to Skidmore and the picnic we had in
                        the woods.  Four kisses.  Colette.

           The whole courthouse weeps.  Except for Freddy Kassab.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - LATER

           Waiting.  No one speaks.  Jeff bounces a racquetball against
           the floor and wall.  It provides the only sound.  Joe lets
           his cigarette burn to the filter.  Bob Dylan's "I shall be
           released" underscores the scene.

           INT. COURTROOM - LATER

           Everyone is assembled.  Judge Dupree nods to a bailiff, who
           opens the door to the deliberation room.  The jurors file
           in.  Some are openly sobbing.  All are deeply affected.

           Then a long pause.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Has the jury reached a verdict?

           The FOREMAN speaks up for all his fellow jurors.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Yes, your honor.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        And how do you find?

                                 FOREMAN
                        On the count of murder in the second
                        degree of Colette MacDonald, we the
                        jury find the defendant, Jeffrey
                        MacDonald... guilty.

           Jeff almost crumbles.  Bernie holds him up.

                                 FOREMAN (CONT'D)
                        On the count of murder in the second
                        degree of Kimberly MacDonald, we the
                        jury find the defendant, Jeffrey
                        MacDonald... guilty.

           Cries from the courtroom.  Joe looks away.
                                 FOREMAN (CONT'D)
                        On the count of murder in the first
                        degree of Kristen MacDonald, we the
                        jury find the defendant, Jeffrey
                        MacDonald... guilty. 

           Commotion.  Wendy rubs Jeff's back as Bernie whispers in his
           ear.  Jeff looks like he's had the life sucked from his body.

                                 JUDGE DUPREE
                        Does the defendant have anything
                        he'd like to say?

                                 JEFF
                        Sir, I don't think the jury heard
                        all the evidence.

           MARSHALS move in towards Jeff with handcuffs out.  There is
           tremendous tension in the room.  He extends his arms, wrists
           together.  The Marshal handcuffs him and leads him out the
           back of the courtroom.  Jeff looks back to Joe one last time. 

           Joe looks at the front door, where he finds the cold stare
           of Freddy Kassab.  Freddy puts his hat on and exits.

           INT. KAPPA ALPHA HOUSE - DAY

           The next day.  Packing.  Crying.  Joe has his duffel bag
           with him and he sports his fatigue jacket again.  He drops
           the bag on the floor and knocks on Bernie's door.  He is
           busy organizing a box of exhibits with Wendy.

           INT. BERNIE'S DORM ROOM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOE
                        I'm sorry to bother you.

                                 BERNIE
                        We're making sure everything's in
                        order for the appeal.  Flying out?

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.

                                 BERNIE
                        Well, it's been quite a ride, huh?

           Bernie stands and shakes Joe's hand.

                                 JOE
                        I know it's not the best time to
                        bring this up, but... you and Sterling
                        talked way back when about what we
                        would do if Jeff were convicted.
                                 BERNIE
                        Right.  Right.  I forgot. 

                                 JOE
                        About the access...

                                 BERNIE
                        Yes.  I spoke to Jeff about it. 
                        Well, not recently, but a while ago,
                        when all this seemed so impossible...

           He stops for a moment.  Then continues.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        He wanted you to stay at his condo. 
                        He thought you could keep it warm
                        for him while you wrote.

                                 JOE
                        That would be great.

                                 BERNIE
                        I'll have Wendy make copies of
                        everything.  It may take a couple of
                        weeks, but it's a priority.  

                                 JOE
                        Thanks.

           Joe starts to leave.

                                 WENDY
                        It's not over, Joe.  Don't write the
                        ending just yet, ok?

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Joe sits in first class as he flies back to Los Angeles. 
           The STEWARDESS stops at his seat and hands him two travel
           bottles of whiskey and a glass with ice.  He thanks her and
           empties the bottles into the glass.

           INT. JOE'S CAR/PRISONER TRANSPORT VAN - DAY

           Joe drives through Huntington Beach,just as he did in Act
           One, only this time he doesn't need a map.  "Heartache
           Tonight" by the Eagles plays as Joe pulls up to Jeff's condo.

           This action is intercut with a shackled Jeff being transported
           in a very uncomfortable prisoner transport van.

           INT. JEFF'S CONDO - DAY

           Empty and cold.  Boxes are stacked in the office, ten deep. 
           Joe acknowledges the boxes briefly as he gives himself a 
           tour of the house.  Jeff's closet is filled with fashionable
           clothes.  The boat out back gently rocks against the dock.  

           Joe finds the copy of President that he signed in Act One. 
           He reads it: "Truth never lies."  Joe smirks, then puts the
           book down and approaches the wet bar in the living room. 
           The bar is full of top-shelf liquor.  Joe reacts as if he's
           opened a large bag of money.  "Heartache Tonight" fades out.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           Joe waits in the visitor area.  Finally, a GUARD directs him
           to an empty room.  Moments later, Jeff enters in shackles
           and an orange jump-suit.  The GUARD accompanying him uncuffs
           him and closes the door.  Jeff rubs his wrists and then gives
           Joe a long hug.  Joe masks his unease.  They sit.  

                                 JEFF
                        Man, it's great to see you.

                                 JOE
                        It seems like the only function a
                        ride across the country in a prison
                        bus serves is to make your final
                        destination seem less awful. 

                                 JEFF
                        It's been an absolute nightmare.

                                 JOE
                        Well, I'm glad you didn't kill
                        yourself.  It would have been a bummer
                        for the book.

           They laugh a bit.

                                 JEFF
                        I wouldn't give those bastards the
                        satisfaction.  How's the condo? 

                                 JOE
                        Perfect.  Thanks again for the setup.

                                 JEFF
                        It's the least I could do.  You've
                        been there for me this whole time. 
                        More than I can say for Candy.  I
                        guess that's what I get for shacking
                        up with a chick named Candy.

                                 JOE
                        Buyer beware.
           Jeff takes a long breath.

                                 JEFF
                        I'm a fucking mess, Joe.  I feel
                        dirty and soiled by the decision,
                        and I can't tell you why, but I'm
                        ashamed.  I mean, the verdict just
                        hangs there, screaming, "you are
                        guilty of the murder of your family!"
                        And I don't know what to say to you
                        except that it's not true.  And I
                        hope that you know that and feel it
                        and that you're still my friend.

           Joe's mouth quivers a bit as he forces a smile.

                                 JOE
                        I am your friend, Jeff.  And I think
                        about that moment when the verdict
                        came down... total strangers can
                        recognize within ten minutes that
                        you didn't receive a fair trial.

                                 JEFF
                        It still feels like some horrible
                        dream, but I wake up in a cell, my
                        bed only inches from my toilet. 
                        There's a stain on one of the cement
                        blocks... it's my only piece of art. 

           Jeff reaches out to touch Joe's arm.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I feel so much rage against Dupree. 
                        Not the jurors, though.  They didn't
                        hear all the evidence.  But Dupree? 
                        Christ, how that man sleeps at night
                        is beyond me.  But Bernie's almost
                        certain that he have a winning
                        argument with the speedy trial thing. 
                        The Fourth Circuit's agreed to hear
                        it and no one argues better than
                        Bernie.  Until then, I'll just have
                        to keep looking forward to our visits.  

                                 JOE
                        Maybe I can give you something more
                        constructive to do.

           He leans in as if it's a secret.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I was able to convince one of the
                        guards to sneak in a tape recorder.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I'm thinking of breaking the narrative
                        up with these chapters called "The
                        Voice of Jeffrey MacDonald" or
                        something.  Probably not that exactly. 
                        Something more literate, but... I
                        need you to take the lid off and
                        climb down in there and tell me all
                        about your life in minute detail and
                        with as honest an attempt to
                        communicate the emotional content as
                        you can manage.  Can you do that?

                                 JEFF
                        Absolutely.  That's a great idea.  I
                        really dig that.  I'll start tonight.  

           Joe forces another smile.

           EXT. TERMINAL ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe runs out of the prison, short of breath.  He lights a
           smoke as he stares off into the distance over Los Angeles
           Harbor.  He looks back at the prison.  His hands shake.

           INT/EXT. JOE'S WORK - DAY/NIGHT

           "It's Only Make Believe" by Conrad Twitty plays as we enter
           a montage of Joe working on the book.

           Joe sifts through piles of work product, filling up a large
           cork board in the living room with evidence photos, documents,
           handwritten notes, etc... There are about a dozen boxes in
           various stages of emptiness. 

           Joe meets with Jeff in prison and takes notes.  Jeff is very
           animated as they interact.  Joe is noticeably distant.

           Joe sits with Freddy and Mildred, looking over photos of
           Colette and the kids at Freddy's home.

           Joe receives tape after tape from Jeff in the mail.

           Joe at the typewriter.

           Joe on the phone with Nancy, her pregnancy acting as a
           barometer for how much time has passed.

           Lots of drinking.  

           Avery reading pages with Joe at a bar.  "It's Only Make
           Believe" fades out.
           INT. JEFF'S CONDO - NIGHT

           Joe stands over the numerous half-empty boxes with a drink
           in one hand and a phone in the other.

                                 STERLING
                        So, Dell loves the title change. 
                        Fatal Vision is a huge improvement
                        over Acid and Rain.

                                 JOE
                        but...

                                 STERLING
                        Phyllis and I still have major
                        concerns about the content.

                                 JOE
                        Fantastic.

                                 STERLING
                        It reads like an appellate brief,
                        Joe.  Chapter after chapter of what
                        the jury didn't hear and what the
                        Judge fucked up.

                                 JOE
                        That's the reality, Sterling.

                                 STERLING
                        Is that the reality, Joe?

                                 JOE
                        I can't pretend that Jeff got a fair
                        trial.  We talked about this before
                        I went to Raleigh...

                                 STERLING
                        We talked about it in the context of
                        Jeff being acquitted.  As a fall
                        back... But that didn't happen.  

                                 JOE
                        Still, the story is...

                                 STERLING
                        The story is that he was convicted. 
                        He's guilty.  There's nothing left
                        to say.  Let Bernie Segal yell and
                        scream about what the jury didn't
                        hear.  That's not what Dell paid you
                        a 300 thousand dollar advance for.

                                 JOE
                        They paid me to be a journalist.
                                 STERLING
                        Don't be so god damn proud, Joe. 
                        You want to be an investigative
                        journalist? Fine, go investigate and
                        find me a motive for the killings.

                                 JOE
                        The government couldn't even do that.

                                 STERLING
                        The government wasn't writing a book.  

                                 JOE
                        What, do you want me to just make
                        something up?

                                 STERLING
                        I didn't say that.  But the MacDonald
                        market is getting crowded and I can
                        promise you that other writers won't
                        have any issue establishing a motive
                        and saying MacDonald got a fair trial.

                                 JOE
                        Who? Tell me it's not Wambaugh!

                                 STERLING
                        No.  He's busy with his film... 
                        Mostly unknowns, but there is this
                        small-time reporter who covered the
                        trial named Keeler who's generating
                        some interest.  You know him? 

           Joe is worried.

                                 JOE
                        A little.

                                 STERLING
                        Well, if he gets a deal and his book
                        is released first... all those plans
                        you have for the future disappear. 
                        You can't have the SECOND book on
                        the subject.  Get me?

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           Joe is upset.

                                 JOE
                        Bob Keeler's talking to your mom.
                                 JEFF
                        Bernie gave me the green light to
                        cooperate with him.  Thinks his
                        article could generate some good
                        press during the appeal.

                                 JOE
                        Well, he seems awfully plugged in. 
                        And he's planning a book, Jeff, not
                        just an article.

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        He'll use his series of articles in
                        Newsday as a book proposal.  Probably
                        to the New York Times Books. It's
                        common practice.  I don't expect you
                        to understand the nuances.

           Jeff doesn't appreciate the condescension.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        And honestly, I'm not sure what
                        Keeler's attitude is towards you. 
                        I'm not saying he's convinced you're
                        guilty... but how would I know?  

                                 JEFF
                        Hmmm.

                                 JOE
                        For all we know, he thinks the jury
                        heard all the evidence and you got a
                        fair trial.  Only I can write that,
                        Jeff.  Only me.

                                 JEFF
                        I see your point.

                                 JOE
                        I think it would be best if you did
                        nothing to encourage or assist anyone
                        else who might be planning to write
                        a book on this.  You gotta remember,
                        you have a financial interest in our
                        book, as well.  If our book is
                        released second, it'll look like a
                        response to Keeler's and it'll be a
                        critical and financial flop.  

                                 JEFF
                        I didn't think of that. 
                                 JOE
                        Maybe have Bernie drop a line at the
                        New York Times Books reminding them
                        of the extent to which libel and
                        invasion of privacy might apply.

                                 JEFF
                        That's a smart idea.

           Joe lights a smoke.  They both calm down.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        So when do I get to see some pages?

                                 JOE
                        Pages?  Christ, I haven't even started
                        outlining yet.  There's at least
                        thirty boxes of documents over at
                        the condo, there's the trial
                        transcripts, interviews to be done. 
                        This is going to take some time.  I
                        wouldn't expect any words to hit the
                        page for a while.

                                 JEFF
                        Just keep me in the loop, alright. 
                        It's one of the only things that
                        keeps me from pounding my head into
                        the cement.  You know, I can touch
                        both walls of my cell at the same
                        time if I stretch my arms out?

           INT. JEFF'S CONDO - NIGHT

           Joe is sitting on Jeff's deck, overlooking the Recovery Room,
           whiskey in hand.  He has "You Send Me" by Percy Sledge playing
           on the stereo.  He has a telephone next to him.  He is on
           the phone with a very pregnant Nancy.

                                 JOE
                        There's nothing here.  Volumes of
                        pages, all about how unfair the trial
                        was.  All I have on Jeff is that
                        he's an asshole with a temper.  And
                        I've got Dell and Jeff both pressing
                        me for pages.  

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        You know, if you're sad enough, you're
                        diagnosed with depression and you're
                        medicated.  If you're shy enough,
                        you're diagnosed with anxiety and
                        you're medicated.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But if you're angry enough, what are
                        you diagnosed with?  And what would
                        your medication be?  And what would
                        happen if you didn't take your
                        medication?

                                 JOE
                        Nancy, the investigative journalist.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        You have got to let this whole fair
                        trial thing go, Joe.  It's clouding
                        your instincts... and the advance is
                        starting to run out.

                                 JOE
                        Don't worry about the money.  I'll
                        figure this thing out and we won't
                        have to worry about money ever again. 
                        Ok?  I promise.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Good.  Because no matter how tight I
                        keep my legs pressed together, this
                        baby is coming.

           Joe smiles.

                                 NANCY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And on that note... I'm starving. 
                        I'm gonna go.

                                 JOE
                        Ok.  Love you, baby.

                                 NANCY (V.O.)
                        Love you, too.

           They hang up.  Joe smokes and contemplates his next move. He
           makes another call.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 JOE
                        It's me.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        We got the radio controlled plane. 
                        He loves it.  Thank you.

                                 JOE
                        Is he there?  Can I talk to him?
                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        He's at a friend's house.

                                 JOE
                        Oh.

           Pause.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Can you be honest with me?

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                            (hesitant)
                        Ok.

                                 JOE
                        What's the worst thing about me?

           She laughs.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        What is it about me that makes you
                        forget you ever loved me?

           She thinks it over.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        I'm thinking. 

                                 JOE
                        Is it that long of a list?

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        If I had to give it a label, I'd say
                        you're a pathological narcissist. 

           Joe almost chokes on his whiskey.

                                 JOE
                        A what?

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        You're so wrapped up in your own
                        power and glory and self importance
                        that you don't give a thought to
                        anyone else or anything else.  

                                 JOE
                        Oh, ok.  Wow.
                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        You asked.

                                 JOE
                        And you definitely answered.  

           Silence for a beat.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        What's the problem?

                                 JOE
                        I'm being pressured to pick a side
                        on this thing and I'm torn.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        What does Sterling say?

                                 JOE
                        Sterling says to give the readers
                        the boogie man they desire.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        What does Nancy say?

                                 JOE
                        She agrees with Sterling.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        What do you think?

                                 JOE
                        He might be a murderer, but he didn't
                        get a fair shake.  

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        And if you write that story?

                                 JOE
                        The book'll bomb, I'll most likely
                        declare bankruptcy, and I'll probably
                        get dropped from the agency.

           Mandy takes her time formulating a response.

                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        Well, here's what I think.  I think
                        the man I married would chase the
                        story.  But the man I divorced would
                        chase the money.

           Joe takes a deep breath.

                                 JOE
                        I gotta go.  I love you.
                                 MANDY (V.O.)
                        Good luck, Joe.

           They hang up.

                                 JOE
                            (to himself)
                        Pathological narcissism?

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - NIGHT

           Jeff lays in bed, his eyes open. He fixates on the stain he
           told Joe about: An abstract pattern on a cement brick.  It
           changes shape... the hallucinogenic reality of confinement. 

           EXT. SANTA ANA RACETRACK - DAY

           Avery and Joe watch the horses.

                                 AVERY
                        Pathological what?

                                 JOE
                        Narcissism.  Pathological narcissism.  

                                 AVERY
                        So, the guy's such an asshole that,
                        when he gets threatened by his wife,
                        he flips?  Call it the stress of the
                        job or the impending baby.  Having
                        been up for two days straight...
                        sure, why not?  It's not the sexiest
                        angle, but it's something. And the
                        government never argued this?

                                 JOE
                        They never got into motive.  

                                 AVERY
                        What about the fair trial angle?

           Joe has trouble addressing this.

                                 JOE
                        I'm dropping it.

                                 AVERY
                        But I thought...

           Joe gets agitated.

                                 JOE
                        He was convicted, Avery.  It was a
                        fair trial,  alright? 
                                 AVERY
                        Alright, boss.  You won't get an
                        argument out of me.

           Joe settles down.  He switches gears. 

                                 JOE
                        It's not too big a leap?  I mean,
                        it's one thing to be upset about
                        your wife taking parenting classes
                        and second guessing you around your
                        kids, but to take that and project
                        it out to murder?  

                                 AVERY
                        It probably started out as a fight
                        and got out of hand. At that point,
                        his doctor brain kicked in.  You
                        told me yourself how clinical he is.
                        A series of check boxes.  Stage the
                        crime scene.  Check.  Finish off the
                        only potential survivor.  Check. 
                        Inflict wounds on self.  Check. 
                        Call police.  Check.

                                 JOE
                        There's got to be something else,
                        though.  Like, pathological narcissism
                        PLUS.  Plus what, though? 

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           Joe has trouble looking Jeff in the eye.

                                 JOE
                        I'm flying back to Jersey at the end
                        of the week to be with Nancy when
                        the baby comes. 

                                 JEFF
                        I'll keep sending you tapes.  Just
                        give me your home address...

                                 JOE
                        Just send them to Sterling's office.

                                 JEFF
                        What?  Why?  You don't want me knowing
                        your home address?

                                 JOE
                        Come on.  No.  I just want to make
                        sure anything book related is filtered
                        through the office, that's all.
                                 JEFF
                        Whatever.  When can I see some pages?

                                 JOE
                        Jeff, I told you.  I can't send pages. 
                        Not yet, anyway.  Everything goes
                        through Morgan, the editor over at
                        Dell.  It's a process.

           Jeff stands.  He's ready to go back to his cell.  He doesn't
           make eye contact with Joe as the guard enters.

                                 JEFF
                        Bernie thinks our chances on appeal
                        are 70/30.  
                            (he looks at Joe)
                        Give Nancy my best.  And
                        congratulations on the baby.

           He leaves without saying goodbye.

           INT. JEFF'S CONDO - NIGHT

           Joe and Avery are hanging out while Joe goes through the
           final couple boxes of documents.  Avery is by the stereo.  

                                 AVERY
                        This sound system is fucking insane. 
                        How much you think this thing cost?

                                 JOE
                        A wife and two kids.

                                 AVERY
                        Ouch.  Nice release in the trades,
                        by the way.  Big-name author Joe
                        McGinnis signed to six-figure contract
                        to retell the most bizarre crime
                        story of the decade, as only he can. 
                        Through total and exclusive access. 
                        Fucking brilliant... 

           Joe is reading a handwritten note that he found at the bottom
           of the box.  He interrupts:

                                 JOE
                        Listen to this.  MacDonald wrote it
                        back in '70.  It must have been notes
                        to his first attorney... "We ate
                        dinner together at 5:45pm.  It is
                        possible I had one diet pill at this
                        time.  I do not remember, and do not
                        think I had one, but it is possible.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I had been running a weight-control
                        program for my unit, and I put my
                        name at the top of the program to
                        encourage participation.  I had lost
                        12-15 pounds in the prior 3-4 weeks,
                        in the process using 3-5 capsules of
                        Eskatrol Spansule."

           He looks up at Avery.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Eskatrol?  What is that?  Speed?

                                 AVERY
                        I don't know.

                                 JOE
                        Twelve to fifteen pounds in a month? 
                        That sounds like speed to me.

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - NIGHT

           Jeff does pushups alone in his cell.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Nancy gives birth with Joe beside her.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Nancy and the baby are asleep while Joe reads books on
           eskatrol with a desk lamp on.  The baby cries a bit.  Joe
           looks over at him, waits for him to quiet down, then goes
           back to his books, highlighting important passages.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Joe awkwardly feeds the baby while Nancy reviews Joe's notes.

                                 NANCY
                        Have you checked with Womack to see
                        if they tested him for amphetamines?

                                 JOE
                        Nope.  I mean, yes, I checked.  The
                        chemist notes from Fort Gordon say
                        they never tested him for
                        amphetamines.  It just never occurred
                        to them.

                                 NANCY
                        So, he could have had god knows how
                        much of this eskatrol crap in his
                        system that night.
                                 JOE
                        I'd say that's a real possibility... 

                                 NANCY
                        What would having too much eskatrol
                        in your body do to you?

           The baby spits up on Joe.

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - DAY

           Jeff is on the phone with Sterling's office.

                                 JEFF
                        What do you mean he's unavailable...
                        I know he just had a baby.  Do you
                        have any idea how hard it is for me
                        to schedule a phone call... No. 
                        It's been two weeks and I haven't
                        heard a fucking thing... No, I won't
                        calm down.  I'm rotting in this
                        fucking... who is this anyway?  What's
                        your name?  Why am I wasting my time
                        talking to you.  Put Sterling on
                        the... Oh.  Sterling isn't available
                        either?  Bull shit! 

           The guard looks over at Jeff, always ready for him to get
           too worked up.

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        Fine.  Fine.  Look, just leave another
                        fucking message for me.  Tell Joe
                        that I still haven't gotten any pages
                        and I feel like he's shutting me
                        out.  Great.  Yeah.  Thank you, too.

           He hangs up violently, slamming the phone down on the receiver
           three times for emphasis.

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           We watch as the 60 minutes crew prepares the visitor's area
           of Terminal Island for an interview: GRIPS setting up lights
           and running cables, CAMERAMEN checking and cleaning lenses,
           the SOUND CREW preparing boom mikes, etc... Jeff is being
           tended to by a MAKEUP ARTIST, his demeanor proud, as if he's
           getting ready for the Dick Cavett Show again.
           Finally, MIKE WALLACE sits across from Jeff.

                                 WALLACE
                        Dr. MacDonald, good afternoon.

                                 JEFF
                        It's a real pleasure to meet you,
                        Mike.  You're a fine journalist.  No
                        nonsense.  No holding back.  Just
                        the truth.  Unfiltered.  Brilliant.

                                 WALLACE
                        Thank you.

                                 JEFF
                        Find the place ok?

           This makes Wallace laugh

                                 WALLACE
                        No problem.  I'd like to jump right
                        in, if that's alright.

                                 JEFF
                        Of course.

                                 WALLACE
                        What went wrong?

           Jeff chuckles as he leans back and raises his eyebrows.

                                 JEFF
                        Wow, well... more than you can know
                        in just 60 minutes.

                                 WALLACE
                        We'll edit it down.

                                 JEFF
                        In short, the jury didn't hear all
                        of the evidence.  I mean, I don't
                        blame them for convicting me.  They
                        only heard one side of the story,
                        just like at the Grand Jury.  It's
                        not their fault the government lied
                        to them.  How were they to know?

                                 WALLACE
                        Does that anger you?

                                 JEFF
                        Of course it does.  But a friend
                        once told me that truth never lies. 
                        And I believe that.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        So I'm confident that, eventually,
                        people will know all the details. 
                        And when that happens, there's no
                        way anyone in the world could possibly
                        believe I had anything to do with
                        these murders.

                                 WALLACE
                        And how do you plan on getting those
                        facts out?  By way of appeal?

                                 JEFF
                        Well, naturally, we're appealing the
                        verdict.  I never got a fair trial. 
                        That's without question.  And there
                        are other legal issues at play as
                        well.  But you'd have to talk to
                        Bernie Segal, my attorney, to get
                        that information.  No, what I'm
                        talking about is something else.

                                 WALLACE
                        Joe McGinnis's book.

                                 JEFF
                        Yes.  If you're familiar with his
                        work, he's a top-notch...

                                 WALLACE
                        Yes, I'm familiar.  But let's return
                        to that in a moment. 

                                 JEFF
                        Ok.

                                 WALLACE
                        What I want to know is, did you have
                        drugs of any kind in your system on
                        the night of February 16th, 1970?

                                 JEFF
                            (taken aback)
                        No.  I don't think that's in dispute.

                                 WALLACE
                        No drugs whatsoever?

                                 JEFF
                        Taking drugs goes against everything
                        I believe in.

                                 WALLACE
                        What is eskatrol?
                                 JEFF
                        Eskatrol?  It's a diet pill.

                                 WALLACE
                        It's an amphetamine, isn't it?  Speed?

                                 JEFF
                        Yes.  I suppose. 

                                 WALLACE
                        Did you use this eskatrol substance
                        to assist you in losing roughly 15
                        pounds at the time of the murders?

                                 JEFF
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about, Mike.

           Wallace reads from a piece of paper:

                                 WALLACE
                        We ate dinner together at 5:45pm. 
                        It is possible I had one diet pill
                        at this time.  I do not remember and
                        do not think I had one, but it is
                        possible.  I had lost 12 to 15 pounds
                        in the prior 3 to 4 weeks, in the
                        process, using three to five capsules
                        of eskatrol spansule.  I was also...

                                 JEFF
                        3 to 5 capsules for 3 weeks?

                                 WALLACE
                        According to this.

                                 JEFF
                        That's not possible.

                                 WALLACE
                        Then why would you put it down here
                        that there was even a possibility?

                                 JEFF
                        These are notes given to an attorney
                        who had told me to bare my soul as
                        to any possibilities, so we could
                        always be prepared.

                                 WALLACE
                        Did you lose 15 pounds in the 3 weeks
                        prior to the murders?

                                 JEFF
                        I don't think that I did.
                                 WALLACE
                        It's in your notes.  I had lost 12
                        to 15 pounds in the prior three to
                        four weeks, in the process, using
                        three to five capsules of eskatrol
                        spansules.  That's speed... and
                        Compazine, to counteract the
                        excitbility of the speed.  I was
                        losing weight because I was working
                        out with the boxing team and the
                        coach told me to lose weight.

                                 JEFF
                        Mike, there's no question there's a
                        possibility I took the pill.  Nowhere
                        in there does it say I took it.

                                 WALLACE
                        If you were on the boxing team...

                                 JEFF
                        Right.

                                 WALLACE
                        One has to say, look, why would he
                        be taking off 12 to 15 pounds in the
                        period of three to four weeks, again,
                        in your own handwriting?

                                 JEFF
                        But if I did take off those 12 to 15
                        pounds over three to four weeks using
                        three to four tablets of eskatrol,
                        that's not abnormal.  That's a normal
                        thing.  The problem is you're making
                        it sound like a person who's honest
                        and writes honest notes to his
                        attorney for any possibility is guilty
                        of a triple homicide.

                                 WALLACE
                        I'm not making the connection.  This
                        was discovered by Joe McGinnis.

           Jeff is speechless.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        Mr. McGinnis believes a personality
                        disorder, pathological narcissism,
                        in conjunction with eskatrol abuse,
                        sparked a rage in you that ultimately
                        led to the murder of your family.

                                 JEFF
                        Joe wouldn't say that.
                                 WALLACE
                        This is a quote from an advanced
                        copy of Mr. McGinnis's book, Fatal
                        Vision: He had lost fifteen pounds
                        in three weeks while taking a drug
                        that can cause insanity.  He was
                        suffering from short-term physical
                        exhaustion and longer-term emotional
                        stress.  His life, in fact, had been
                        one extended period of stress-
                        financial, intellectual, psychological-
                        ever since Colette had accidentally
                        become pregnant with their first
                        child.  Might it be too much to
                        surmise that since early childhood
                        he had been suffering also from the
                        effects of the strain required to
                        repress the boundless rage which
                        psychological maladjustment had caused
                        him to feel towards child or woman,
                        wife or mother... the female sex?

           Wallace looks up briefly for a response but continues reading
           before Jeff has a chance to say anything.

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        And that on this night- this raw and
                        somber military-base February Monday
                        night- finally, with the amphetamines
                        swelling the rage to flood tide, and 
                        with Colette, pregnant Colette,
                        perhaps seeking to communicate to
                        him some of her new insights into
                        personality structure and behavioral
                        patterns- indeed, possibly even
                        attempting to explain him to himself-
                        his defense mechanism, for the first
                        and last time, proved insufficient? 
                        Would it be too much to suggest that
                        in that one instant- whatever its
                        forever unknowable proximate cause
                        might have been- a critical mass had
                        been achieved, a fission had taken
                        place, and that by 3:40am on February
                        17, 1970, the ensuing explosion of
                        rage had destroyed not only Jeffrey
                        MacDonald's wife and daughters, but
                        all that he had sought to make of
                        his life?  Perhaps.  Yet his bloody
                        footprint had been found on the floor
                        and there were blue threads on the
                        club outside the house and his wife-
                        already dead or near to it that the
                        difference was of no import whatsoever-

                                 WALLACE (CONT'D)
                        had been stabbed in the chest with
                        an icepick 21 times after his blue
                        pajama top had been laid across her. 
                        And when he had sat down to write
                        the first account of the night's
                        events- knowing that he was now
                        considered a chief suspect- his
                        consumption of a drug which is capable
                        of triggering psychotic rage had
                        been the thing he had felt it
                        necessary to mention first.

           Wallace puts the paper down.  Jeff can only muster:

                                 JEFF
                        How did you get an advanced copy?

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           OVER BLACK

           A bottle of champagne is heard being popped.  People cheering.

           INT. FANCY NEW YORK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The bottle was popped by Joe, smiling wide and laughing. 
           It's a party.  And it's all in his honor.  Nancy is there,
           as is Sterling.  The rest of the crowd are high-class
           SOCIALITES and fellow JOURNALISTS.  It purposefully resembles
           the Long Beach Police Fund Raiser in the beginning of the
           film.  Joe pours the bottle out over a pyramid of flutes.

           Joe empties the bottle and grabs the flute off the top.  He
           triumphantly takes a sip as everyone cheers.

           INT. FANCY NEW YORK RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe, still with his flute in hand, is at the hostess stand
           talking to the MAITRE D'.  He talks low.  People continuously
           pass by, patting him on the back or shaking his hand.  He
           looks troubled, but he doesn't let the guests see it.

                                 JOE
                        Mandy Schaeffer.  With an S.

           The Maitre D' checks a list. 

                                 MAITRE D
                        No, sir.  She hasn't arrived yet.

                                 JOE
                        Are you sure?  Did you step away
                        maybe for a moment...
                                 MAITRE D
                        I've been here the whole time, sir.

           Joe smiles and hands him a folded up $20 bill.

                                 JOE
                        Just let me know when she gets here.

                                 MAITRE D
                        Of course, sir.

           Joe turns around and almost collides with JOE WAMBAUGH, who
           has a TROPHY DATE by his side

                                 JOE
                        Wambaugh!  Hey, man.  So great you
                        could make it.

                                 WAMBAUGH
                        Congratulations, Joe.  The book is
                        fantastic.  Just remarkable.

                                 JOE
                        Well, none of this would have been
                        possible if it weren't for you.

                                 WAMBAUGH
                        300,000? Dell got you on the cheap. 
                        How could I compete?

                                 JOE
                        Ah yes, the advance. I spent half of
                        it on whiskey and women...

                                 JOE AND WAMBAUGH
                        And the other half I wasted!

           They laugh.  TROPHY DATE cuts in.

                                 TROPHY DATE
                        It really is awful, though.  How DID
                        you live with that maniac?

           Joe turns on the seriousness like a faucet.

                                 JOE
                        It was a nightmare.  I knew he was
                        guilty, but I had a job to do.  I
                        had an obligation to get the story.

                                 TROPHY DATE
                        You must have been terrified.
                                 JOE
                        Every day.  All I could think about
                        were those girls.  And my wife.  I
                        just wanted to get back to Nancy.  I
                        was so relieved when the jury came
                        back guilty that I actually cried.

           Trophy date puts her hand over her heart. 

                                 TROPHY DATE
                        Amazing.  It really is riveting stuff. 
                        I couldn't put it down.

           Sterling finds his way over.

                                 STERLING
                        You and a 100,000 other readers...

           Sterling and Joe hug.

                                 JOE
                        Looks like you're stuck with me for
                        another ten years, huh?

                                 STERLING
                        With sales like this, I'd say so.

           Wambaugh is ready to move on.  He lifts up an empty tumbler.

                                 WAMBAUGH
                        I'm dry.  Seriously, Joe, great work. 
                        Congratulations again.

                                 JOE
                        Thank you.  It means a lot.  Really.

           INT. FANCY NEW YORK RESTAURANT - LATER

           The flute is gone, replaced by a tumbler of whiskey.  Joe
           and Nancy are talking to another COUPLE.  Joe keeps looking
           past them, to the lobby and the Maitre D'.

                                 NANCY
                        It was...  I could hear it in Joe's
                        voice when he'd call.  He was living
                        so close to all that rage, you know?

                                 MAN
                        Tell us something that wasn't in the
                        book.  If you can.

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh, please.  That would be fantastic.

           Joe reengages after Nancy gives him a soft elbow to the ribs.
                                 JOE
                        What?  Oh, well... there was one
                        time when I saw him attack a college
                        journalist while we were jogging.

                                 WOMAN
                        Dear god!  Why?

                                 JOE
                        He didn't like the question he was
                        asked, so he lost control.

                                 MAN
                        Just like on the night of the murders.
                        You must have been terrified.

                                 JOE
                            (on auto pilot)
                        Yes.  Every day. All I could think
                        about were those girls.  And my wife. 
                        I just wanted to get back to Nancy. 
                        I was so relieved when the jury came
                        back guilty that I actually cried.

           He's won them over. Joe smiles and excuses himself when he
           sees Sterling waving him over.  He gives Nancy a kiss.

           Joe reaches him.  They talk in the corner, quietly:

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Did you find out? Is she here?  She
                        said she'd try to...

                                 STERLING
                        She's not coming, Joe.  She sent a
                        nice card, though.

           He hands Joe a card: "Congratulations.  We wish you all the
           best.  Always,  M." 

           Joe shakes it off and puts on a brave face. 

                                 JOE
                        Oh well.  Fuck it.  I was just
                        inviting her out of respect.

                                 STERLING
                        Of course.

           He switches gears.

                                 JOE
                        Any word on the Alaska project?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        I saw Jim Murphy here but he didn't
                        really want to get into it.  I think
                        if you could get me another meeting
                        with Dell, I could...

                                 STERLING
                        Later, Joe.  I promise... but first
                        I want to talk to you about a man
                        named Robert Marshall...

                                 JOE
                        Who?

                                 STERLING
                        He's standing trial in Jersey for
                        hiring some people to kill his wife. 
                        It could be another Fatal Vision.

           Joe looks unsure.  He polishes off his tumbler of whiskey. 
           This is not the career he was hoping for.  We move back from
           the two, through the crowd of socialites.  The music takes
           over and Joe is lost.

           INT. FANCY NEW YORK RESTAURANT - LATER

           Joe is standing in front of all his guests.  They are all
           seated at tables for his speech.  He is back on his game.

                                 JOE
                        It's easy to support someone when
                        they're doing well.  I know that. 
                        And it's just as easy to give up on
                        someone when they're not.  But you,
                        the people in this room, never gave
                        up on me.  Even when I gave you every
                        reason in the world to do so.

           He looks at Nancy, smiling wide with pride.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        And so...

           He raises his glass.  The guests follow suit.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        As success comes and goes... and as
                        fame rises and falls like the tide,
                        I will always be grateful for the
                        love and support of my family and
                        friends.  Cheers!

           Cheers!
           Joe's smile fades a bit as he drinks his champagne.  Maybe
           he isn't as happy in his glory as he'd hoped he'd be.  The
           theme from A Summer Place starts to play as we...

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - NIGHT

           Jeff, sitting on his bed, staring at that same spot on the
           wall.  He closes his eyes and we are transported to...

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Colette and the girls are dancing with Jeff on the sand. 
           Laughing and twirling as the sun sets behind them.  The music
           continues.  It's a wonderful vision...

           INT. TERMINAL ISLAND - NIGHT

           Jeff has tears in his eyes.  The music plays on.  He opens
           his eyes to find that same spot, still frozen on the wall.

           The music takes us out.

           TITLES OVER BLACK

           Fatal Vision hit the shelves in 1983, reaching number 6 on
           the New York Times bestseller list.  Joe McGinnis's career
           took off, and he went on to write two more highly successful
           true crime novels: Blind Faith and Cruel Doubt.

           Helena Stoeckley continued to confess to the killings even
           after the trial, including a confession to her mother on her
           deathbed. Helena died in 1983.

           In 1984, all of the contents in 544 Castle Drive were burned
           and destroyed by the government.  It had been under seal
           since the murders in 1970.

           In 2014, Joe MiGinnis died of prostate cancer.

           For over forty years, Jeffrey MacDonald has maintained his
           innocence. In 2012, he filed a motion to appeal, based on
           DNA evidence. The appeal is still pending.
